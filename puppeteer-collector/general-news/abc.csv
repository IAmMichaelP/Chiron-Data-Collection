https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-21/lost-countdown-clips-australian-music-tv-film-sound-archive/105197306,One in five Australians used to watch this show. Now clips thought lost forever have been found,"Every day of primary school, the bus driver on Janet Robins' 40-minute ride into Dubbo would play one student's cassette tape through the bus speakers.
Ms Robins knew you had to have songs that were featured on the TV show Countdown — meticulously recorded onto a cassette — to really impress the other students.
Countdown was one of ABC TV's most watched shows: a musical phenomenon hosted weekly by Molly Meldrum from 1974 to 1987.

By 1977, almost one in five Australians was tuning in. That same year, then Prince Charles, now King Charles III, featured in an episode.
Like thousands of children and teens across the country, Ms Robins watched Countdown as a form of cultural education.
""Our opinions on what was good music — and who these singers were — was from Countdown.""

She remembers watching Johnny Farnham — before he rebranded to John — singing Sadie (The Cleaning Lady) on Countdown, Jimmy Barnes and a ""gorgeous"" John Paul Young.
Now, a new exhibition from the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia (NFSA) is immortalising music from the 60s to the Noughties through an online exhibition.
NFSA staff were digitising an old student's film project when they stumbled upon two episodes of Countdown from 1976 unseen since their original broadcast and previously thought to be lost.
The lo-fi old clips show two live performances from Ted Mulry Gang and John Paul Young.

The clips became a central part in NFSA's Tune in, freak out exhibition showcasing five decades of Australian music television.
The exhibition includes clips of Big Day Out, a teenage Oliver Newton-John, Roy Orbison, Countdown and Rage.
There's a clip of AC/DC blasting out It's a Long Way to the Top on the show Bandstand, and the Minogue sisters starring on Young Talent Time in 1986.
Watching the rediscovered clips was delightful for Ms Robins.
""Look at that it's the Ted Mulry gang — he's only got a vest on and no shirt and he's got this chest hair hanging out,"" she said.

Exhibition curator Sarah Little said shows like Countdown were only possible in an age before the internet.
""Now we're in the streaming era and most of our music tastes are crafted by the algorithm.
""Younger generations won't appreciate how much of an influence these shows had.""
Yet, Ms Little said the impact of music television still lingered.
""My mum is so into ABBA and I didn't get it until I worked on this collection and realised ABBA is a really big deal in Australia,"" she said.
""ABBA became enormous in Australia because Molly Meldrum played one of their songs on Countdown and Abba-mania took over. We're still seeing the effects of that.""
Björn Ulvaeus gives viewers a glimpse of ""Stockholm!"" as he promotes the ABC's Countdown in 1976.
Her favourite clip in the exhibit is Roy Orbison' performing Crying on the show Sing Sing Sing.
""Even Elvis was jealous of Roy's voice and his charisma.""

Ms Little said preserving the around 45 minutes of clips meant future generations would forever be able to watch back a formative time in Australian music history.
""What we're trying to do is to preserve the culture, the art, the stories of a particular time period so future generations can understand how we've got to where we are,"" she said.","EBy Emily Anderson, JBy James Tugwell",Mon 21 Apr,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-21/john-cena-to-headline-wwe-event-n-perth-october/105197188,WA government refuses to reveal cost of John Cena's headline WWE show,"Wrestling star and Hollywood actor John Cena is set to appear in Perth in October as part of a three-day stint of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) events in the city, which the WA Government hopes will be a major tourism drawcard.
The announcement was made at WrestleMania — an event that garnered global attention and where Cena competed — in Las Vegas overnight.
""This October, John Cena lands in Perth for a full-scale WWE takeover,"" a promotional video stated.
""It all starts with Smackdown, ends with Raw and at the centre of it all, Cena takes the spotlight for one of WWE's most massive nights in Perth.""
Cena's appearance is being promoted as his last event in Australia over ""one epic weekend"" at Perth arena.
WA hosted a WWE Elimination Chamber at Perth Stadium in February last year, featuring wrestling figures like Logan Paul, Randy Orton and Australian Rhea Ripley.
According to the WA government, that event attracted 18,200 fans from outside Western Australia, and generated $36.2 million for the local economy.
Cena, now aged 47, became WWE champion for the 17th time over the weekend when he defeated Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania's main event.

In July last year, Cena announced he would be retiring from the WWE in 2025, bringing an end to his more than two-decade wrestling career which began in 2001.
He has also starred in film and TV shows including Peacemaker, The Suicide Squad, Trainwreck and Bumblebee.
WA Tourism Minister Reece Whitby refused to say how much money the WA government spent on getting the celebrity to Perth.
""It's a very competitive business, we're competing against other states in Australia and other countries,"" he said.
""It's not appropriate that I reveal the numbers involved because we want to be able to be competitive, we want to be able to negotiate in the future to get even more events to Western Australia.""

A few months before the 2024 Elimination Chamber event, the head of the WWE's parent company revealed it had been paid $US16 million for ""a combination of events"" in Australia.
""If you want us to bring one of these to town, you're going to have to pay,"" TKO Holdings' Mark Shapiro said.
""In particular, we've just done a deal in Australia with the government there for $16 million to bring a combination of events to Australia.""
It's unclear if that package included this upcoming event.
Mr Whitby expected Cena's involvement would draw more crowds than 2024's WWE Elimination Chamber in Perth, and showcase WA to millions of people watching the weekend's competitions.
""Cena's appearance will be part of his global WWE retirement tour and this will be the exclusive Australian appearance,"" Mr Whitby said.
""In fact, it will be the only appearance he will make in Australia, New Zealand and South-East Asia.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-21/the-simpsons-four-season-extension-ordinary-family-depiction/105149492,"The Simpsons are no longer 'ordinary', but the show's been extended","Popular animated television series The Simpsons was created to represent how an ordinary lower-middle-class, suburban American family looked.
More than 35 years on from its inception, the show has this month been extended, but the nature of a typical family in the United States has vastly changed in that time.
The longest-running animated and scripted prime time American TV show first hit screens in 1989 and if it sees out the remainder of its four-year extension until 2029, the program will have been broadcast worldwide for 40 years.
By 2029 The Simpsons would have been on-air for 40 years, which included the 2007 release of The Simpsons Movie. (AFP: 7eme Art / Photo12)
The cartoon focuses on a single-income family of five — Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie — who live in a suburban double-storey home with two cars, two pets and an endless carousel of experiences that often feature high-profile celebrities, politicians and international holidays.
But in 2025, US Census data shows that the famous yellow characters are no longer as representative of a typical American family as they once were — and yet their popularity has endured.
On December 17, 1989, when The Simpsons first aired as a half-hour prime time show, the cartoon closely mimicked the make-up of average American families and households.
US Census data shows that in that year, the ordinary American family household was comprised of 3.16 people — typically two parents and up to two young children.
In the decades since, those numbers have slowly been declining as American families have chosen to remain smaller.
Dr Rodney Taveira, the academic director and senior lecturer in American studies at the University of Sydney's United States Studies Centre, told the ABC that part of why The Simpsons mirrored a typical nuclear US family can be attributed to the childhood lifestyle of the sitcom's creator, Matt Groening.
""He grew up in the kind of golden era of television watching shows like Leave It To Beaver, so these kind of classic American sitcoms that had this very traditional family structure, which was largely a white family, two or three kids who go to schools and they live in the suburbs,"" he said.
""He basically made the characters on his own family.""

The Simpsons also reflected a stereotypical family life by mostly featuring married parental couples, Dr Taveira said.
""When Bart was born, which was think around 1980 … Most children would've lived with two married parents in their first marriage, that was the norm,"" he said.
""The show tends to be centred on families that have married parents in their first marriage and that just doesn't reflect neatly what America looks like anymore.
""The ages at which people are getting married has changed over the last 40 years. When Homer and Marge would've got married, the average age would've been something like 20 to 22 years old and now it's going up to almost 30 years old.""
That change in family dynamic has also been seen in the homes Americans can afford to live in.
While The Simpsons' house is presented as an ordinary, suburban property in ""a small town Americana"", Dr Taveira says that way of living is no longer as easily attainable by the average person.
""The show's kind of aware of the improbable position that Homer is in … The show confronted this with the character of [Frank] Grimes,"" Dr Taveira said.
""For a patriarchal father of a family to be able to provide for them, have a double-storey home, take the family on holiday, buy a new car every few years — that was normal for many white, middle-class Americans and that is no longer the case.
""It was decreasingly the case in 1989 and even less-so now … While the median income of families has risen, inequality means that fewer people have that amount of money.""
While historical housing affordability data shows an up-tick in the rate of married couples who could afford a median-priced home in 2009 to 45.7 per cent, the US Federal Reserve last year said just one in three Americans described their financial wellbeing as ""living comfortably"".
The Simpsons has notched up hundreds of industry awards in the time it's been on-air, including 37 Emmy Awards from more than 102 nominations.
Brendan Dando and Guy Davis — the Australian creators and co-hosts of the world's highest-rated Simpsons-related podcast Four Finger Discount — believe the show's initial popularity came from its broadcast frequency through the 1990s.
""It became such an institution during the 90s … Growing up in the '90s, our viewing habits were a lot different, the TV stations dictated what you watched and during that era it was just Simpsons, Simpsons, Simpsons, Simpsons,"" Mr Dando told the ABC.
""It just became such a part of our life, like an extension of our life, where watching The Simpsons was what we did.
""As we've gotten older it's just stayed with us and as we've gotten kids, we have since introduced our kids to it.
""I love being able to sit down and re-watch those old classics with my kids now and have them discover the show and watching them watch the show for the first time is something special.""
Mr Davis believes the introduction of an animated sitcom to prime time television was a winning move for The Simpsons.
The Simpsons is a Gracie Films Production in association with 20th Television Animation and still created out of Fox Studios in Los Angeles, California. (Reuters: Mike Blake)
""Animation was probably viewed as 'for kids'. Having an animated family sitcom in prime time that had an adult sensibility — the jokes weren't pitched directly at children — it was literally something the whole family could enjoy,"" he said.
""I think each member of the family could see themselves reflected in each member of the Simpsons family or in members of the Springfield community. That gave it the opportunity for a wider fan base.""
That relatability also contributes to the allure of The Simpsons as a loveable representation of ""the American dream"", according to Dr Taveira.
""Even a dumbass like Homer Simpson could have a job that he is eminently unqualified for, but still bring home enough money to take care of his family,"" he said.
""And so while it's fantastical, there's a kind of small town Americana element to the show.
Streaming platform Disney+ launched in Australia in November 2019 and offered Australian viewers complete online access to every episode of The Simpsons for the first time.
Mr Dando says that shift in viewing method has had an undeniable impact on the show and the audiences it continues to attract.
The traditional entertainment model is changing fast, with younger audiences moving away from pay TV and traditional media.
""For a long time for new episodes of The Simpsons, we were sometimes up to a year behind in Australia and you never really knew when they were going to air,"" he said.
""Now … we get the show three days after it airs in the States — and that's never happened before.""
The change has also been described by Dr Taveira as a ""continuing cultural conversation"" among audiences of different demographics.
""The fact that it is finding new audiences I think would speak to the various ways in which one can consume television now,"" he said.
""There's that kind of afterlife that these shows have on social media, the watching of clips of The Simpsons on YouTube and the memeification of various characters and incidents [which] might provide an entry point for a younger audience to go and watch the television show.""
There was no suggestion in the extension announcement from Fox and Disney Television Studios that The Simpsons would come to an end after 2029.
There is also no sign of the show's profitability slowing down. In 2017, the show's revenue was estimated to be around $US94 million ($147.9m) on top of $US245 million ($385.7m) in global merchandise sales.
The Four Finger Discount hosts say they think the show will never be cancelled, even if it stops being aired regularly on traditional television channels.

""I don't think The Simpsons will ever die. I don't think it can — it's been around too long,"" Mr Dando said.
""Who wants to be the executive that cancels The Simpsons? Who wants that to be on their tombstone? No one wants that, they're making too much money by The Simpsons — the merchandise is through the roof.",LBy Luke Cooper,Mon 21 Apr,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-17/a-minecraft-movie-chicken-jockey-cinema-/105177846,Cinema sees $50k in damage to screen after Minecraft movie showing goes wild,"A viral ""chicken jockey"" trend during screenings of A Minecraft Movie has sparked chaotic behaviour in cinemas worldwide, with Australian movie-goers now joining in on the mayhem.
The trend sees people erupt in loud cheers and throw items such as popcorn, flour and toilet paper.
In one instance, film-goers even snuck a real chicken into the cinemas.
The behaviour has become so disruptive that some cinemas have had to pause screenings, call security and at times, involve the police.
Tahlia Gass, who saw the movie at a cinema in Forest Hill, Victoria, posted to TikTok a video showing the aftermath of a screening, with flour and toilet paper strewn across the theatre.

""I had no idea about the trend before going in, so I had no idea this was going to happen,"" she told the ABC.
""When it was the chicken jockey scene, it went crazy — popcorn was thrown, as well as toilet paper, mop signs, a 3D glasses bin [and] two boys throwing some flour.
""The manager stopped the movie and the security were called. The manager on shift told the boys to stop and watch the movie or they would be kicked out. We had to have security stay in the cinema.
""The people that didn't participate in the scene got refunded and complimentary tickets as well. It was definitely an experience, I've never seen anything like it.""
In a separate incident on Sunday night, police were called to a cinema in Erina, on the New South Wales Central Coast, after an alleged altercation between two adult men and two 14-year-old boys.
Gosford-based Brisbane Water Police told the ABC the incident was related to people ""throwing popcorn"", with officers still looking into the matter.
Similar scenes were playing out in cinemas around the globe, with one TikTok video surpassing 4.3 million views.
Despite receiving lacklustre reviews, A Minecraft Movie has smashed box office records, raking in nearly half-a-billion dollars during its opening weekend.
It has now overtaken The Super Mario Bros Movie as the biggest video game adaptation launch of all time.
The term comes from the best-selling 2011 Minecraft video game, on which the movie is based.
In the game, a ""chicken jockey"" is a rare occurrence in which a baby zombie rides a chicken like a horse.
In A Minecraft Movie, the appearance of a baby zombie riding a chicken is paired with Jack Black's character yelling ""chicken jockey!"" — which appears to be the audience's cue for fans to lose their minds in the cinema.
For some people, part of the motivation would be filming the reaction to post online, says writer and filmmaker Jamie Tram.
They're participating in the trend, but drilling down into people's specific motivations is complex.
""On one level, it's ironic, but there's so many levels on which it's operating,"" says Jason DiRosso, who hosts ABC Radio National's film program The Screen Show.
""It's hard to know why they're doing it.""

Palace Cinemas chief executive Benjamin Zeccola says it's mostly a lot of fun, but there is a line that can be crossed.
""It's quite hilarious the way it's so communal,"" he says.
""The whole room is in on it, the whole room is anticipating it and there's a sense of excitement that's really good fun.""
Zeccola admits it's messier than usual sessions, with Palace Cinemas rostering on extra staff and allowing extra time between showings to allow for the clean-up.
""We bought leaf-mulching vacuum cleaners meant for gardeners to suck up all the popcorn,"" he says.
But the clean-up isn't always easy.
He says a screen will need to be replaced after cinema-goers threw their drinks at it — and with an estimated cost of $50,000, the company is getting the police involved.
However, Zeccola focuses on the positives of the trend, which is bringing more young people to the cinema.
""It's pretty innocent fun,"" he says.
""Social media is fuelling it,"" film critic Luke Goodsell says.
""Or maybe word got out early — the studio may have leaked it to key audiences.
""I feel like the trend has been wildly over-exaggerated on social media, which of course has the effect of people participating in it when they maybe wouldn't have, thereby making it real.""
The movie only came out at the start of April, so this particular trend is quite new.
But this kind of audience participation goes way back, DiRosso explains.
""This is a really interesting example of the 'memeification' of film culture and the way small soundbites really pop and connect with audiences,"" DiRosso says.
""It's an example of a long history of certain films triggering or inspiring a much more active cinema-going experience where the audience wants to, in some way, speak back to the film.""
He points to more recent trends like people dressing up in pink to watch the Barbie movie.
Or how cinemas put on special sing-along screenings of the musical Wicked because so many people were wanting belt out the lyrics along with the actors.

The scenes in some cinemas could be compared to screenings of The Room, where audience members throw plastic spoons at the screen at certain points of the movie.
And the cult following might be likened to the fanfare that surrounds The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
""Audience participation can be spectacular fun when there are clear expectations set for both patrons and cinema workers,"" Tram says.
""Also, the point of audience participation in Rocky Horror/The Room isn't just to record your friends causing mayhem — it's about celebrating the culture that's evolved around those movies.""
Fans are often handed plastic spoons to throw during special screenings of The Room.  (Supplied: KMPR)
Screenings of movies such as The Room and The Rocky Horror Picture Show are usually ticketed as special events, so people know what they're in for.
And the audience behaviour trend is something that gradually develops, but the ""chicken jockey"" trend erupted very quickly.
""The memeification culture is something that accelerates the process by which audiences can narrow down on an aspect of a film,"" DiRosso says.
""By the nature of it being memeified, it travels around the world really quickly and so do the reactions that are filmed and posted online.
""Audience participation that perhaps took months or years to develop and become codified as things people did, now can capture people's imaginations and become viral essentially in a matter of days.""
And this can mean people who aren't as chronically online as others might go along to the movies completely unaware of the trend.
""I feel for those people,"" DiRosso says.
""Sometimes these things are lot of fun but you're not always in the mood and they do risk getting out of hand for obvious reasons.
""It's not fun for people who aren't in on the joke.""
Zeccola says some parents were caught off-guard by the trend in the early days of the film's release.
The popularity of short-form video content has seen producers turn to viral moments.
There are positive and negatives.
""It's bad for the people who have to clean up the cinema, but I think anything that encourages audiences, and especially young audiences, to go to the cinema can only be a good thing,"" Goodsell says.
""The worry is, will studios respond by gearing more of their multiplex product toward interactive, audience participation screenings?""
He's not alone in fearing this outcome.
""I worry that the film industry will learn the wrong lessons from the 'chicken jockey' trend, and start investing even harder in nostalgia bait and shameless 'fan-service' moments,"" Tram says.
""I also worry that it encourages people to treat cinemas with less respect.
""That being said, the film industry can choose to learn important lessons from 'chicken jockey': primarily that kids love communal experiences that they can't get from online streaming, and that a healthy cinema-going culture is worth investing in.""","Sohani Goonetillake, Dannielle Maguire",Thu 17 Apr,0

The office said in a statement that it amended the cause and manner of death for the 39-year-old following a review of laboratory test results.
Trachtenberg, who was known for her roles in Gossip Girl and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was found unconscious and unresponsive in her luxury apartment tower in Manhattan in February.
Paramedics pronounced her dead at the scene.
Michelle Trachtenberg, who is known for her roles in Gossip Girl and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, has died at 39.
Officials said at the time that no foul play was suspected, and the medical examiner's office had listed her death as ""undetermined"".
Trachtenberg’s family had objected to an autopsy, which the medical examiner's office honoured because there was no evidence of criminality.
Her representative didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday, the Associated Press said.

Sarah Michelle Gellar, Taylor Momsen and Blake Lively were among the celebrities who mourned Trachtenberg when her death was announced on February 26.
""She was fiercely loyal to her friends and brave for those she loved, she was big and bold and distinctively herself,"" Lively wrote on social media.
The daughter of Jewish immigrants, Trachtenberg began her acting career at the age of three in commercials before starring in Nickelodeon series The Adventures of Pete & Pete.
Actress Michelle Trachtenberg dead aged 39
Michelle earned her big break at the age of 10 with her title role in hit movie Harriet the Spy, an American coming of age comedy film.
In 2000, Trachtenberg joined the cast of Buffy, playing Dawn Summers, the younger sister of the title character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar between 2000 and 2003.
The actress went on to play different recurring roles in Weeds, Six Feet Under and Gossip Girl, where she portrayed Georgina Sparks, a socialite who causes chaos throughout the show.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-16/katy-perry-women-blue-origin-space-flight-carl-sagan/105183256,The true shame of the space barbies' Blue Origin flight,"Few things incite a global pile-on as quickly as a group of wealthy, glamorous women being tone-deaf.
Like, for example, accepting a free flight into space from a billionaire, touting it as historic female empowerment, then, as pop star Katy Perry said, declaring you are putting ""the ass back into astronaut"". Ha! (Though when exactly was the ass in astronaut?)
All whilst impeccably, laboriously, expensively groomed, winking at cameras.
Lauren Sánchez, journalist and fiancée of the world's second richest man, Jeff Bezos, gathered a clutch of successful, otherwise creditable friends for this charade along with Perry: former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, film producer Kerianne Flynn, journalist (and best friend of Oprah) Gayle King, and civil rights activist and scientist Amanda Nguyen.
On Monday, a particularly phallic-looking rocket from Bezos's tech company Blue Origin shot the women up past the Kármán line — 100 kilometres above the earth, considered to be the threshold of space — for almost 11 minutes of astonishment, and a brief experience of weightlessness, then a return to land in West Texas.
Katy Perry touches down after all-female spaceflight
Only 11 per cent of astronauts are female, so you might consider it a triumph of sorts were it not just simple marketing for Bezos and the weird claims that it might have any impact on any other women in the world.
The headlines were clear: ""What's more vacuous than an endless vacuum? It's Lauren Sánchez and Katy Perry's party in space"" (The Guardian), ""The Perfect Pop Star for a Dumb Stunt"" (The Atlantic), ""In Space, No One Can Hear You Girlboss"" (Pitchfork), and ""Lauren Sánchez's Cosmic Bachelorette Party"" (The Free Press). Tina Brown called them ""The Real Housewives of Uranus"".
I have three objections to this nonsensical flight.
First, it had nothing to do with the empowerment of women, and it's embarrassing that this claim was even made. The entire flight was the stuff of parody as designers from Oscar de la Renta were hired to make skin tight new space suits to, in Sánchez's words, ""bring a little spice to space"".
We learned a special meeting was held to discuss the underwear Sanchez would wear with her snug suit — Kim Kardashian's shapewear. We saw the beauty preparations — the blow-dries, the fake lashes, the impeccable make up.

I do not object to fashion, and make up, as something fun and creative. But I do object to the idea that women who go into space also need to look hot, instead of, I don't know, being capable? Competent? Can the bony-arsed still get a ride?
And yet these women, circling the globe, floating, as the rocket blasted out greenhouse gases, held hands and yelled together ""TAKE. UP. SPACE."" Sánchez cooed: ""We're going to have lash extensions flying in the capsule!"" Perry claimed: ""Space is going to finally be glam.""
At last! As if thousands of spinning suns, stars and moons wasn't enough. Bowe, previously a rocket scientist, told reporters: ""I also wanted to test out my hair and make sure that it was OK. So I skydived in Dubai with similar hair to make sure I would be good — took it for a dry run.""
Sánchez told Elle she wanted to encourage ""the next generation of explorers"". But these women were passengers in a commercial flight. It would be like airlifting women in ball gowns to the top of Everest and saying, ""See? Women can climb mountains! And look cute to boot!""
The reason there have not been more women in space is not because they aren't pretty enough.

Which brings me to my second objection: that the contrast with what is happening with the employment of women, and scientists, in the United States could not be greater. As Jessica Grose writes in the New York Times, a high profile woman wanting to bring light to the obstacles women are facing has much to choose from: like, say, the loss of access to contraception and other health care due to cuts to USAID, significant layoffs in childcare, ongoing erosion of reproductive rights.
As we watched King step out of the rocket and kiss the ground, we could almost forget that the Trump administration has been sacking NASA scientists, including Katherine Calvin, the chief scientist (go girl, yeah! Oh wait). The president's directives on diversity, equity and inclusion are also forcing NASA to shut down offices, and science funding has been gutted.
Remembering Bezos has donated large amounts of money to Trump, sat in prime position at the inauguration and has scored multi-billion dollar government contracts for Blue Origin.
The pop star, alongside other celebrities, joined Jeff Bezos's fiancée in the first all-female flight in more than six decades.
My third objection is that space exploration in many ways represents the finest of human imagination and innovation, the sharpest, glowing edges of our daring and science. But who benefits from this space tourism, publicity-driven junkets for the friends of billionaires?
All of this talk of ""yeah the girls"" distracts fundamentally from the consistent testimony of space explorers and astronauts that space travel fundamentally changes you — for the better.
When I was writing my book Phosphorescence, I read reams of the diaries and writings of astronauts, and was continually struck by the impact of the ""overview effect"" — the profound change in thinking that can occur when astronauts see Earth from space.
In short, it should be an experience of awe where we look outwards and are humbled and sobered to realise how small we are, how irrelevant national boundaries, how fragile the Earth and how much we need to look after it and each other.
But I wasn't hearing that so much from this group — even though King said she liked how quiet and kind space was — and this is the true shame. When asked what the experience was like, Sánchez said: ""I don't really have the words for this, like…?"" Asked again, she responded: ""I can't put it into words but I looked out the window and we got to see the moon.""
The astronomer who best articulated the incredible potency of seeing our planet as a small spot, is the great Carl Sagan. He described the earth as a pale blue dot, seen in a photo taken at his suggestion from Voyager 1 on 14 February, 1990. I'd like to cite it in full because it's so beautiful:
…you look at it, you see a dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joys and sufferings, thousands of confident religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilisations, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every hopeful child, every mother and father, every inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species, lived there on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam. The earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.
Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity — in all this vastness — there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. It is up to us. It's been said that astronomy is a humbling, and I might add, a character-building experience. To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.""
I've often wished we could all go up, have a brief moment of hurtling around the Earth, not to posture or preen, but to show the opposite — we are small, we are humble, and we need to fiercely care for the Earth.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-15/coachella-2025-highlights-weekend-one/105175420,Lady Gaga dazzles Coachella while Amyl and the Sniffers get political,"With lower ticket sales, grumbles about the star power of its line-up and so much competition for peoples' dwindling entertainment budgets, Coachella is perhaps not the culture-defining event it once was.
Any criticisms of the festival's ability to present the world's key artists were proven unfounded over the weekend, as the Californian desert played host to yet another dazzling array of acts spanning just about all genres.
The headlines from its first weekend — it will be repeated with the same line-up this weekend coming — have been kind to the event this year, focused largely on celebrity spotting and fashion.
US politics is never far away from anything these days and a surprise appearance from 83-year-old Vermont senator Bernie Sanders before Clairo's set brought a little of the current situation to the festival.
In his speech, Sanders urged the young audience to demand more from the current political class, and took a few swipes at US President Donald Trump's stance on climate change.
But for most of us, Coachella remains about the music. If you're looking at settling in to watch some of it this Easter weekend, here's our take on some of the biggest sets.

You'd be forgiven for forgetting that Lady Gaga's headlined Coachella before.
In 2017, she slotted in after Beyoncé, then-pregnant, pulled out from headlining. In the throes of denim-and-diamonds album Joanne, the set came at a limbo period — and while excellent, it left no major pop-culture mark. (It doesn't help that Beyoncé returned the next year for Beychella.)
When announcing her 2025 return to the desert, Gaga wrote on Instagram that this performance would be ""fully realised"" in a way 2017 couldn't be ""for reasons beyond our control"". She wasn't lying: Closing in on 20 years of pop-superstardom, Gaga shows signs of entering a new creative peak.
Performing off the back of March's dipped-in-darkness pop album, Mayhem, Gaga's set was decadently theatrical — a near-two-hour gothic pop opera where forces of light and evil fought for Gaga's soul over five acts and 22 songs.
Beginning with 'Bloody Mary' — a 2011 album cut that had a 2023 TikTok resurgence — Gaga arrived centre-stage several storeys tall, her torso atop a blood-red hooped skirt.

After screaming ""dance or die"" as the relentless industrial synths of Mayhem highlight 'Abracadabra' kicked in, she descended through her towering skirt before its pillowing fabric opened, revealing a cage with entrapped dancers.
It was just the first of many elaborate and awe-inspiring scenes, including a life-or-death chess match against a 'Bad Romance'-era Gaga (but set to 'Poker Face'), a sandbox with more creepy-crawlies than Dune ('Perfect Celebrity') and a dance with death ('Zombieboy', where a troupe of dancers hump skeletons).
Skipping a whole decade of albums — 2013's Artpop, 2016's Joanne and 2020's Chromatica — Gaga kept things moody and atmospheric, with a nightmarish Alice-in-Wonderland journey through fame, celebrity and maintaining one's own identity among it all.
Despite the darkness, Gaga's set was pure light — especially as early hits such as 'Born This Way' or encore track 'Bad Romance' saw Coachella's infamously tame crowds erupt.

The massive marching band that appeared at the start of Travis Scott's headline set on night two might have had a few of us dreaming about the best Coachella set of all time, but the Houston rapper offered something far darker and less impressive.
Barely acknowledging the crowd, Scott churned through a directionless 30-song set that saw his songs — mainly from latest album Utopia and 2018 breakthrough Astroworld — chopped and changed so much that it just ended up exhausting.
While the rationale behind dropping two brand-new tracks into the start of a set being watched by an enormous global audience is questionable, we do give him full marks for the set's production.
Between the endless pyrotechnics, the moving stages, and the acrobatic dancers suspended in midair, there was plenty to look at even if Scott's distant vibe and autotuned modern rap left your cold.
It's hard to argue this is one of the great Coachella headline sets.
Teased as an end to Brat summer via a scratched-out billboard, Charli XCX's set proved that her blend of bright and brash green electro-pop still has plenty of life in it.
Where Lady Gaga's set was maximalist production, Charli kept to the pared-back performances of the Brat era, hitting the stage solo in sunglasses, thrashing around to her own songs in front of a strobing screen.
Well, for the most part she stood alone. Charli brought out a handful of best friends for some help, including: Troye Sivan appearing for the sinewy 'Talk Talk'; Lorde strutting alongside Charli for their feud-ending 'Girl, So Confusing'; and Billie Eilish for the irresistible, throbbing 'Guess'.

But it was the end of Charli's set that offered the biggest surprises. While the singer danced to early EDM hit 'I Love It', her screens offered a slightly existential message.
""Does this mean that Brat summer is finally over?"", the screen asked. ""Idk? Maybe? Wait was it? No?? Yeah cuz duh it was already over like last year. Wait. Was it? NO??? I don't know who I am if it's over???"" F–KKKKKKKK.""
But then, a moment of clarity: ""Wait. I remembered. I'm Charli… and honestly… I just want this moment to last forever.""
With a message ""PLEASE DON'T LET IT BE OVER"" taking over the screen as Charli left the stage, fans are speculating whether she's teasing Brat 2.0, whatever that looks like.
In the meantime, there's always weekend two. (Though a year of booked shows and festival slots suggests Brat is far from over just yet.)
For my money, the weekend's highlight came from hip hop impresario Missy Elliott, who delivered a breathless career-spanning set packed with incredible costumes, choreography, and an unimpeachable set list.
She arrived onstage as a kind of Transformer, sauntered into the crowd mid-verse without dropping a beat, and gave us a dazzling array of dance moves that made it truly impossible to look away from her set.
But it was those songs that truly made the set special. While she will always be considered a musical trailblazer for the way she propelled the sound and attitude of hip hop in the 90s and 2000s, Missy Elliott's songs are now genuine classics and seeing them rolled out in this overwhelming procession of brilliance was almost too much to bear.
It's been 15 years since she toured down here. Australian promoters: give her a blank cheque.
While her guests — Queen Latifah, Victoria Monet, Ciara, Spiritbox — were incredible, Megan Thee Stallion was the force of nature we know her to be in her main-stage slot on the final day of the festival.

Much like Missy's the night before, the set was a seamless display of both the artist's sheer star power and the quality of her output.
Whether you're a fan or a naysayer, this set is worth catching on weekend two. Megan is quickly cementing herself as one of the better live performers in the new breed of rap stars and these might be her best sets yet.
Unfortunately, it might not have been timed out quite as well as it should have, as the rap star was cut off during her final song. A sour end to a very sweet set.
Despite the fact they air three songs from their classic 1994 album Dookie, we must come to terms with the fact that Green Day are a very different band than they were when they first started visiting Australia in the 90s.
Their Saturday night Coachella performance was snotty punk dressed up as stadium rock, a lane the band have made their own for the past couple of decades. They do it well, but when you hear 90s songs like 'Brain Stew' and 'Welcome To Paradise', one can't help but yearn for their simpler, snottier past.
Whether or not you approve of their change in musical direction, the band at least don't betray their reputation as agitators, as Billie Joe Armstrong sings ""I'm not part of the MAGA agenda"" in 'American Idiot', and ""running away from pain like the kids from Palestine"" in 'Jesus Of Suburbia'.
Small contributions, perhaps, but when made on a stage as big as this, in front of this big a global audience, it felt significant.
Melbourne punks Amyl and the Sniffers made Green Day's political stance look pretty insignificant at their set late on the festival's final day.
While their ferocious, high-energy performance was as strong as ever, the most memorable moment was a short, heartfelt speech from frontwoman Amy Taylor as she addressed the present social and political climate.
""It's a super-tough time all across America and I just want to extend my love and support to all the trans people, all the gay people, all the black people, all the immigrants — illegal and legal — and everybody else including women and the f***in' men, because everybody's getting f***ed up from it.
""I'd also like to extend my heart to the people in Palestine and the people in Ukraine, because f**k dying in any capacity and f**k getting murdered by other people for bullshit.""
The band delivered another scintillating set, giving American audiences yet another reason to fall in love with the now-LA-based quartet.
Since their historic 2016 reformation, The Original Misfits have played just a couple of shows per year. Their first appearance at Coachella felt like a throwback to organisers Goldenvoice’s roots of promoting punk rock shows in Southern California, and the band delivered in spades.
A set list heavy on the band’s earliest material – almost the whole set was made up of the Static Age and Walk Among Us albums – reminded us just how much of an impact this band had on the development of punk and garage rock through the 80s, their influence still heard across the genre to this day.
It all started off a bit messy, but once the band were locked in, it’s hard to imagine a better punk rock show. At 69 years old, Glenn Danzig’s voice remains a treasure, while the band’s energy and aggression was as immense as any band of any age at Coachella this year.
If you don’t respect them for their music, at least give them props for being the only band in Coachella history to get their logo on the festival’s infamous poster.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-13/obsession-the-white-lotus-rich-wealthy-enough-one-percent/105164292,Is our obsession with The White Lotus a sign we've had enough of the 1 per cent?,"""When the people shall have nothing more to eat, they will eat the rich.""
This statement, originally attributed to Jean-Jacques Rousseau (despite lack of evidence that he actually said it), has often been used to explain class uprisings in history, most obviously, and spectacularly, the French Revolution.
It could also explain the current obsession millions of us have with watching rich people suffer and squirm in shows like The White Lotus.
Think of the response by the show's Victoria Ratliff, the Lorazepam addicted, drawling, wealthy wife and mother of three when she is asked if she could cope without money: ""I just don't think, at this age, I'm meant to live an uncomfortable life. I don't have the will.""
It's a bald statement, revealing both entrenched privilege and an utter lack of imagination. It alarms her husband, who has just learned he is likely to lose all of his considerable fortune. It's also funny, possibly because it's something many people would like to believe of rich people — that without money they believe they are nothing. That it's all they love, and live for. And that, not all that deep-down, they are miserable.
It's also, perhaps, relatable — who wants to live an uncomfortable life?

Victoria, played deliciously by Parker Posey, and adored by fans, has spawned hundreds of memes for her cluelessness, love of chemical oblivion and her drawn-out Southern accent, where each vowel has its own journey: ""Parker, nooooooo"", and ""soo-NAH-me"" (tsunami).
She is numb and daft, barely conscious of the mental breakdown her increasingly shut-down, spiralling husband is having, nor of the lies her children tell her. ""I don't even have my Lorazepam,"" she cries when her pills go missing. ""I'm going to have to drink myself to sleep.""
In each of the seasons of The White Lotus, set in luxury resorts in Hawaii, Italy and Thailand, the wealthy play like spoilt children, and many possess the ugliest of character traits: narcissism, petulance, smallness, greed, selfishness. They lie to each other, cheat on each other, betray and belittle each other. And at least one of them dies.
Tone-deaf, they appear oblivious to the impact of their privilege on the people — and countries — around them. Take Mark Mossbacher in the Hawaiian first season: ""Look, obviously, imperialism was bad. Shouldn't kill people, steal their land, and then make them dance. Everybody knows that. But it's humanity. Welcome to history. Welcome to America.""
We chat to White Lotus star Morgana O'Reilly about Pam the wellness mentor, working with Mike White and the season three finale.
It's not just The White Lotus. Think of Succession, modelled on the Murdoch dynasty, where characters spit and brawl whilst trying to crawl up the crumbling rungs of their father's regard in order to secure a position as his successor. It's superb television, even if some people have told me they can't stomach it because they don't like any of the characters, and there are few redeeming traits.
It's a long way from the tidy suburbia of the Brady Bunch, Leave it to Beaver and Roseanne. In the 1980s there were glamorous depictions of the wealthy — Dallas, Falcon Crest, Hart to Hart — but in recent years, the rich have become parodies of caricatures.
Think Schitt's Creek (which may be an adorable exception), Palm Royale, Big Little Lies, and Billions. Mostly white people — Crazy Rich Asians is an exception — who cheat and steal and kill. Vain and shallow. Often searching for meaning, but thwarted by their own hungry needs: Piper Ratliff, who wants to spend a year in a Buddhist monastery meditating, worries about eating vegetarian food that isn't organic and sleeping in a barely furnished room. She sobs at the thought she might be the princess she didn't want to be.
In Triangle of Sadness, which won the Palme D'Or and was nominated for three Academy Awards, the entitled super-rich, with Russian billionaires and model influencers, gather on a yacht, and end up violently vomiting or writhing with diarrhoea before the sewage overflows in a storm.
Could it be that people have had enough of the 1 per cent — the apparently bloated bodies of those at the top, those who symbolise greed and inequity?
In Forbes last year, psychologist Mark Travers attempted to explain why we like to watch the wealthy suffer, fall, and fail in shows like The Menu, Parasite and Knives Out. He writes:
Watching the downfall of the rich can make us feel better about our own socio-economic status and struggles. It provides a sense of justice and balance, satisfying our innate desire for excessive wealth and consumption to be met with consequences. This alignment with our sense of fairness and equity can be satisfying, as it confirms our belief that no one is invincible and that everyone is subject to the horrors of life — regardless of their wealth.
Research conducted jointly by UNSW and ACOSS last year found that the average household wealth of Australia's highest 10 per cent has been inching upwards considerably faster than the lowest 60 per cent, going to $5.2 million from $2.8 million in the last two decades. This is an 84 per cent increase, compared to the 55 per cent increase of the average wealth of the lowest 60 per cent, up from $222,000 to $343,000.
Almost half of the growth in household wealth since 2003 has filled the pockets of the highest 10 per cent, heavily favouring older people.

Outlets like Marketplace remind us: ""Think about the extreme economic events we've been through. There's the pandemic, when essential workers kept the country running while the richest 1 per cent amassed a huge sum of wealth — twice as much as the rest of the world put together, according to the nonprofit Oxfam. And before that was The Great Recession, which is how we got the term 'the 1 per cent'.""
To be in the top 1 per cent in Australia, you need to have an estimated net worth of at least about $7 million. In the US it's higher, more like $9.5 million.
And as the gap yawns, we sit in front of our television screens and laptops, the shadowy forms of mean, vacuous and greedy rich people flickering across our faces. We cheer at their demise, laugh at their idiocy, roll our eyes at their entitlement and long for their endless supply of Lorazepam whilst envying their clothes, their comfort, their yachts.

A 2023 study on attitudes towards capitalism on five continents found a positive attitude towards capitalism in only six out of 34 countries surveyed: Poland, the United States, the Czech Republic, Japan, Nigeria and South Korea. (When you ask only about economic freedom without using the word capitalism, Argentina joins their ranks.)
The study found the things that bothered respondents about capitalism were, in order, that capitalism is dominated by the rich, who set the political agenda; capitalism leads to growing inequality; capitalism promotes selfishness and greed; and capitalism leads to monopolies.
It also found — unsurprisingly — those with high incomes were more favourably disposed to capitalism, as well as those with higher levels of education, men, and those who identify as being politically on the right. Interestingly, anti-capitalists also tend to be more conspiracy minded.

This is of course not the only reason so many are gripped by The White Lotus. It's funny, sharply drawn and compelling. Deeper questions about meaning thread each series — most obviously in the third, where Tim Ratliff, desperately anxious as he is about losing everything and tempted to take his own life — asks a monk what happens when we die. The monk says: ""You are born, then you die to descend back into the water and become one with the ocean again. No more separated, no more suffering. One consciousness … death is a happy return, like coming home.""
Lifelong friendships swing from toxic to sweet and enduring, and are warmed by the hopeful love of Chelsea, played by a charming, disarming Aimee Lou Reed.
We also watch characters grapple with the notion that a big job with a big salary might not be the path to fulfilment.
But if you swing from the show to our lit up faces, it does seem that our fascination with the rich and famous often curdles into something darker, even if it is hard to tell if we're eating the rich or eating cake.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-11/icymi-china-hits-us-film-industry-trump-tariffs-lorde-n/105165624,Why China's hit against Hollywood should have Trump worried,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recap the pop culture and entertainment news you might have missed over the past week.
If you have a stonks-minded person in your life, you may have noticed them melting down for the past week over US President Donald Trump's wild tariff frenzy.
US markets plunge again as optimism over President Donald Trump's tariffs ""pause"" is overshadowed by his escalating trade war with China.
After promising to heavily increase taxes on imports from basically every country in the world, Trump then created further chaos by enacting a 90-day pause on the most extreme tariffs for every country — except China.
In retaliation to eye-watering tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing's National Film Administration released a statement claiming the tariffs further soured domestic demand for US cinema in China.
""We will follow market rules, respect the audience's choices, and moderately reduce the number of American films imported,"" the NFA said on its website.
But Trump seems less than concerned.
""I think I've heard of worse things,"" he said when asked about the issue at a US cabinet meeting on Thursday, eliciting chuckles from his surrounding secretaries.
And… he might not be far off.
It's true that, since the turn of the millennium, Hollywood has seen China as a potential area for profit, as the second-largest film market in the world.
2019's Avengers: Endgame pulled in nearly $US1 billion in the Chinese market alone, and they're really into the Fast and Furious, with the seventh and eighth instalments of the franchise each clocking a cool $US500 million in the Chinese box office.
But the popularity of domestic films has exploded post-COVID, with locally produced animation Ne Zha 2 raking in $US3.3 billion this year, toppling Pixar's Inside Out 2 to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time.
NeZha 2 International Trailer
Aside from the financial loss, there is some concern over the US losing its ""soft power"" influence in China.
Chen Hong, executive director of the Asia-Pacific Studies Centre at East China Normal University, told The Global Times that American films had long been a key tool for spreading their values and establishing a polished image of itself around the globe.
""[But these policies have] led audiences to question the authenticity of US cultural narratives, fuelling a preference for homegrown content that reflects China's cultural confidence,"" Chen said.
Trump's blasé attitude towards the NFA's announcement could also have something to do with his general disdain for Hollywood, as many prominent figures backed democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 US election.
In January, Trump announced long-time supporters Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone as ""special ambassadors"" to Hollywood.
""They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK—BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!,"" Trump said on Truth Social at the time.
About four years on from her most-recent album, Solar Power, Aotearoa/New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde has joined TikTok and teased a tantalising snippet of upcoming track 'WWT' (What Was That).
The clip sees the angsty 28-year-old walk-running through New York's Washington Square Park wearing an untucked white shirt, grungy jeans with a thick, heavily accessorised chain (is this the next level up from the carabiner?) and over-ear headphones, while she vaguely sings along to the lyrics.
""Since I was 17 / I gave you everything / Now we wake from a dream / Well baby, what was that? / What was that?""
We only have 15 seconds to go off, but it's already clear 'WWT' is a significant departure from Lorde's last studio album.
This isn't the sort of song you have to sit with to truly appreciate: it goes hard.
Could the Grammy-Award-winning artist's next record be a return to her Melodrama era, with added Charli XCX influences (who could forget the collab of 2024, 'Let's Work it Out on the Remix')?
Whatever the Lorde giveth, we shall taketh.

AEST: 9am-4.30pm
ACST: 8.30am-4pm
AWST: 7am-2.30pm
Headlined by Lady Gaga, Green Day, Travis Scott and Post Malone, the three-day festival — held twice, this weekend and next — also features performances from the likes of Missy Elliott, Charli XCX, the Misfits, Megan thee Stallion, Lisa, Kraftwerk, The Prodigy and many, many more.
Australian acts include Amyl and the Sniffers, five-piece band Parcels, Sydney hardcore group SPEED, techno DJ HAAi and Glass Beams.
The stream kicks off on Saturday at 9am AEST (Friday 4PM PDT), and there are two ways to watch: Coachella's Youtube channel, which boasts six-concurrent streams, as well as the Coachella Livestream app on iOS and Android. Additionally, DJ sets from the electronic Quasar Stage will also be live-streamed as vertical videos via Youtube Shorts.
Each day's stream will be broadcast again in full after it ends, meaning you have two chances to catch each performance. There's also next weekend.
With each day's stream beginning a few hours into the festival, you can't watch every single artist's set at home, but more than 70 acts will be shown — including all of the above names, with the full list of live-streamed acts underneath each stage's Youtube videos.
Two acts you definitely won't catch are Brazilian artist Anitta and alt-pop artist FKA Twigs, with both dropping off the line-up in recent weeks.
There are also questions as to whether Weezer, a last-minute addition, will play their set slated for 4pm Sunday AEST.
Earlier this week, writer Jillian Shriner — the wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner — was shot by the LAPD and charged with attempted murder after allegedly turning a pistol on officers as they followed a hit-and-run suspect to Shriner's neighbour's yard. Sources tell Variety the band will perform ""as of now"".
The prestigious Cannes Film Festival has just announced their 2025 line up, with projects from Wes Anderson, Ari Aster and Richard Linklater among the 19 films vying for the coveted Palme d'Or.
Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme has been pegged as an espionage black comedy; Aster's Eddington is a pandemic-set Western starring Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal and Emma Stone; and Linklater's Nouvelle Vague is a French-language tribute to director Jean-Luc Godard and the French New Wave.
Behind the blood and guts, The Substance carried a viscously important message about how society treats women as they age. Its breakthrough at the Oscars is a landmark moment for women in horror.
Among the other nominations for the top prize, six films are directed by women, including a new title from Julia Ducournau — whose win for Titane in 2021 made her only the second female filmmaker to ever receive the top honour. Her new film, Alpha, set in 1980s New York, follows an 11-year-old with a parent who has AIDS.
Last year's festival premiered Academy Award best-picture winner Anora, as well as Oscar contenders like Emilia Pérez and The Substance.
The Un Certain Regard category — which recognises the first or second films of promising filmmakers — includes directorial debuts from actors Scarlett Johansson and Babygirl's Harris Dickinson. Johansson will premiere Eleanor the Great, a drama starring Thelma's June Squibb, while Dickinson's Urchin follows a homeless person in London trying to turn his life around.
Spike Lee's English-language remake of Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's Highest 2 Lowest will also premiere out of competition, after being belatedly announced by Lee himself over Instagram.
The 78th Cannes Film Festival runs May 13 to 24, with Robert De Niro set to receive an honorary Palme d'Or for lifetime achievement.
Britpop legends Pulp will release their first album in 24 years this June (Tom Jackson)
Legendary British band Pulp have announced they will release their first new album in 24 years. The band's eighth album will be called More and released on Friday June 6. It is dedicated to the band's bassist Steve Mackey, who died in 2023.
Pulp's last album was 2001's We Love Life, produced by the great Scott Walker and released the year before the band split for the first time in 2002.
A reunion in 2011 saw them make only their second visit to Australia (gee those shows were good), but the band broke up again in 2013. They reactivated in 2022 for a string of dates in the UK and US, and it was during those tours that they got the itch to start creating new music for the first time in decades.
""This seemed to open the floodgates: we came up with the rest of the songs on this album during the first half of 2024. A couple are revivals of ideas from last century,"" frontman Jarvis Cocker said.
Pulp formed in 1978 but didn't find success until the mid-1990s, when they became one of the leading lights in the dominant Britpop movement. Songs like 'Common People', 'Do You Remember The First Time?', 'Disco 2000' and 'Party Hard' remain indie anthems of the era.
Today, the band released 'Spike Island', the first single from the new album. Watch the video, in which Cocker uses AI to animate old photos of the band from the 90s, below.

We might have to wait a little while to see snippets of other Cannes-premiering films, but Wes Anderson has already blessed us with a trailer for his upcoming project. A gift for fans of symmetry and Michael Cera.

Armstrong was the sports presenter on ABC News Breakfast between 2021 and 2024 and hosted other ABC series including A Dog's World, Tony Armstrong's Extraordinary Things and Eat the Invaders.

After stepping down from News Breakfast last year, Armstrong said he was ""just so excited"" for his next challenge.
""I'm just trying to spread my wings a little bit, and who better to do it with than the great Courtney Act,"" he told ABC News Breakfast on Wednesday.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-08/kate-ceberano-creative-types-kylie-minogue/105131326,Kate Ceberano was slammed for criticising Kylie. It led to this realisation,"It was just the kind of thing that the tabloid media loves to call a ""cat-fight"".
Back in the go-go late-80s, when a young Kylie Minogue was hitting the big time with a string of UK and Australian number ones, an equally young Kate Ceberano had something to say about it.
In an article in a Melbourne newspaper headlined, ""Kate KO's Kylie"", Kate said Kylie was nothing more than a marketing success, and that ""nobody with any taste buys her records"".
The article was published in the Melbourne Truth, a tabloid newspaper that folded in 1993. (Supplied)
Kate was slammed for her comments and has rarely spoken about them since.
Now, in the aftermath of her interviews with me for an episode of Creative Types, and just weeks after Kylie's record-breaking Australian tour, Kate is accounting for her words. She's owned that her comments were, of course, driven by the least complex and also the least acknowledged emotion in their industry: simple jealousy.
""It almost felt unfair,"" Kate now recalls of Kylie's multi-platform industry support and her enormous success.
""In that moment, she lifted, and I think I was jealous of that because I couldn't seem to find an angle for myself.
""I didn't quite have the oxygen to lift my dreams into the same stratosphere that she was going into.
""Mine seemed to be bound in stone and clay, and I was there just chipping away … pubs and clubs, and the whole thing was so earthbound compared to her … so that's actually what it was — just looking at it going, 'Oh, if I just had one-eighth of that!'""
Ceberano was just a teenager when she auditioned for the band I'm Talking (with fellow vocalist Zan Abeyratne, pictured left) in 1983. (Supplied)
Kate copped it at the time. Terry Blamey, Kylie's long-time manager, was furious at Kate.
""[He said] 'How can you do that to a friend, a colleague?' And I felt so bad, I never spoke about it again.
""It caused me to think very deliberately about who I was then.""
Years later, Kate received a rough lesson in empathy. She felt a sting of her own when a written profile of her was headlined, ""My Almost Brilliant Career"".
""It's an indefensible crime to be average if you're seeking something exceptional, and that affected me in the same way that my comments affected [Kylie],"" Kate says.
She's never sought to discuss or apologise for her comments with Kylie but says that, as a mother with a young daughter, Gypsy, now seeking her own success on the stage, she can imagine how those comments would have landed.
Ceberano has written about her four decades of performing in her 2023 memoir, Unsung.  (Supplied: Aaron Smith)
""Imagine, watching and observing someone categorically tearing your child apart? If you've got the courage to say shit things to people, well, then, go ahead. But I don't really believe, face to face, I would ever have had the courage.""
These days, Kate seems much more content in her own skin and has her own success behind her: countless top-10 hits and more than 25 albums, 11 of them platinum, eight gold.
""I've been living to become the singer that I am today,"" she says. ""I wanted to get the experiences so that people would believe that I'd actually done and seen and been the things that I'm singing about rather than just simply being the voice box.""
And while Kate is still writing and creating, she's been energetically revisiting her own back catalogue and the music of the incomparable time from which both she and Kylie emerged: the Melbourne music scene of the 80s and 90s.
Ceberano is relishing being the singer she always wanted to become. (Supplied: Aaron Smith)
""Kylie is emblematic of a dream realised, and don't we all want to realise our dreams?"" she says.
""She is doing it, and for as long as she wants to, on her own terms, and that is a flagship right there.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-07/a-minecraft-movie-viral-moments-in-film-and-television/105145334,A Minecraft Movie's viral moment sheds light on shift in film industry,"A Minecraft Movie hit cinemas last week, and it predictably took over the box office, the world and the internet.
The film — based on the highest-selling video game of all time, Minecraft — delivered a global opening weekend of $US301 million ($493 million), unseating 2023's The Super Mario Bros. Movie as the biggest video game adaptation opening ever.
The movie centres around a washed-up gamer, a real estate agent, and two kids who find themselves sucked into The Overworld of Minecraft, where they join forces with a man trapped there years previously.
Before this weekend, box office returns were lagging 13 per cent compared with last year.
Thanks to A Minecraft Movie, that gap is down to 5 per cent.
In a tale as old as time for both kids' movies and video game adaptations, critics haven't exactly been as kind to A Minecraft Movie as audiences have.
Review aggregators Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes have it sitting at 47 and 48 per cent, respectively, meaning less than half of official critical reviews are positive.
The mammoth box office returns and soaring audience ratings of 87 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes suggest critic scores do not really matter on films made to capitalise on what is popular with kids.
Meg Herrmann says production companies are still working out how to create viral content. (
               ABC News: Christopher Gillette
            )
University of Queensland PhD candidate Meg Herrmann said producers were trying to find ways to bridge the gap as younger generations flocked to short-form media platforms.
""So, what we see is a few different changes that are moving away from some of the conventions that have existed in film and television for a while, where filmmakers are aware that they need to have a presence on social media platforms where people are engaging and creating their own [interpretations],"" she said.
Despite big recent examples such as Disney film Encanto and Netflix show Wednesday, Ms Herrmann said the industry's manufacturing of viral moments was still in its infancy.
""It's helpful to look at what's going on in the music industry to sort of get a sense of where the film industry is trying to go, because the music industry has already sort of monetised that practice in a more formalised way,"" she said.
A Minecraft Movie is filled with moments that could translate to short-form video, mainly in the form of songs performed by star Jack Black.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie also featured a massive musical number by Black, with his character Bowser going viral with Peaches and Black performing the tune at the 2023 Game Awards.
But this time, it was something slightly more quirky and organic that popped off on social media: the chicken jockey.
Videos posted on social media show audiences sitting respectfully, watching the movie, before a small square-headed zombie drops onto the back of a chicken in a boxing ring, and all hell breaks loose.

Black's character, Steve, declares ""chicken jockey!"" and the crowd goes ballistic, throwing popcorn around, taking off their shirts and generally screaming loudly in the theatre.
Audience members getting into the trend stood up to film the furore before heading online and posting to their social media accounts, prompting others who might see the videos to take part.
Ms Herrmann said it was an example of the kind of ""clippable moment"" film producers were looking for, even if they had not necessarily planned this one.
The traditional entertainment model is changing fast, with younger audiences moving away from pay TV and traditional media.
""There are these quite clear moments starting to be embedded, all these clippable moments that really function as prompts or invitations for viewers to remix, edit, parody, replicate, or otherwise create additional paratexts and completely saturate the internet,"" she said.
She said there were no guarantees that a planned viral moment would come off, but that production companies were packing them in, in the hope some of them got picked up.",Ned Hammond,Mon 7 Apr,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-06/fashion-pushback-against-plus-size-inclusivity/105082292,'Smaller is better': Why fashion has turned its back on inclusivity,"In 2020, Dutch model Jill Kortleve was the talk of couture's biggest designer houses.

""Being the right fit for a brand is not about your size,"" she told British Vogue, fresh from the runways of Chanel, Valentino, Versace and Fendi.
For the latter two, the ""plus-size"" model (in reality Kortleve says she's an AU 10-12)  became the brands' first foray outside of sample size.
Kortleve said she was determined to see more inclusive catwalks. The industry seemed to agree with her.
But now, just five years later, less than 1 per cent of models during the recent Autumn/Winter 2025 shows were plus-sized.
Some fear it's a worrying trajectory away from inclusivity and back towards an industry only fit for the ultra-thin.
Of the 8,703 looks presented across 198 shows and presentations in four different cities, only 0.3 per cent were plus-sized, according to the most recent Vogue Business size inclusivity report.
The report defines plus-sized as AU 18+.
Meanwhile, only 2 per cent of mid-sized models were represented.
Both represent a drop from last season where plus-sized models were seen 0.8 per cent of the time and mid-size looks made up 4.3 per cent of runways.
The average Australian woman wears a size 14—16.
A separate analysis from Glamour magazine shows only 26 plus-sized models were seen at London fashion week across the AW25 season.
The British week remains the most inclusive of the big four (London, New York, Paris and Milan).
In contrast, Milan had no plus-size models in any of their AW25 shows, according to Vogue Business.
The Glamour data also highlights how it wasn't always like this.
Just three seasons ago, London was reporting a total of 85 plus-sized models on show.
That same year plus-sized model Paloma Elsesser won the British Fashion Council's model of the year.
Australian model and content creator Shauna Ryan says she remembers the power and possibility of Rihanna's filmed Savage X Fenty runways, which ran from 2019—2022.
The singer and business mogul famously cast diverse models with the goal to be ""more inclusive every year"".
""I sat there crying with my roommates, seeing people who looked like me, not just wearing a dress that covers them from head to toe, but wearing lingerie,"" Shauna says.

Since then, she's been exhausted to see ""the representation become smaller and smaller"".
Ahead of Australian Fashion Week in May, Shauna says she's found only four designers who produce a size 20.
Others only cater up to a size 10 or 12, she adds.
""The trends do tell us that smaller bodies deserve to be celebrated and they deserve to be seen, and they deserve to be decorated in ornate, beautiful pieces that are intentionally made for them,"" she says.
""It just sends a message, conscious or subconscious, that I have a body that's not desirable. I have a body that's not fashionable.
Shauna Ryan is calling for inclusivity to be seen as more than a fashion trend.  (Supplied: Heather Tichowitsch)
That runway representation is often in opposition to how brands want to appear on social media, Shauna notes, with many asking her to model — only for them to not stock her size.
""It tells me there's such a disconnect,"" she says.
""The people who make decisions about marketing know that there has to be diversity but then the people who are creating the designs for these brands don't really make those allowances.""

Fellow content creator and curve model Annika Neilsen recalls a similar experience last year when her friend was made the face of a major Australian fashion week but walked on very few physical runways.
It's led her to question where in the creative pipeline these decisions are coming from.
""Who is making that decision to exclude people?"" she asks.

Once decided by an exclusive few, trends are now created via GRWMs (Get Ready With Me) and mob wife micro-trends — making fashion's social media influence more pervasive than ever before.
Recently on TikTok, various influencers gravitated to an AI filter which let users see what they would look like if they were fat, often with cruel intent.
Meanwhile, Vogue uploaded a homage to Hairspray on YouTube and socials, starring model Gigi Hadid in the infamous plus-size role.
Sydney-based writer Rebecca Shaw labelled the trend ""not just disappointing"" but a ""really bad sign"".
""It seems like any acknowledgement that fat people exist in the world, and that it’s OK for us to exist, is sliding back to nil,"" she wrote for The Guardian.
Shauna too was left in disbelief by the shoot: ""What do you mean Tracey Turnbland is on Ozempic?""
""How could you produce a whole video about a plus-size icon and not include even a single plus-size person in the cast?""
Both incidents demonstrate couture's demographic shift from the glossy pages to anyone who owns a phone.
""While I understand fashion, for the most part, has been very aspirational historically, we're at the point now in history where it shouldn't be exclusive,"" Shauna explains.
The latest TikTok trend is an AI filter that shows people what they would look like if they were fat.
Clinical psychologist and manager of the Butterfly Foundation's national Helpline Sarah Cox says social media is increasingly a concern for those experiencing body dissatisfaction.
Data released by the foundation in February estimates more than 4.1 million Australians over 15 have been significantly affected by body dissatisfaction over the past 12 months.
Those with an eating disorder are estimated to be more than 1.1 million.
""Social media doesn't lead to eating disorders alone, but there's definitely a lot of quite harmful content that's on it,"" Ms Cox says.
""It can really push people into comparing themselves to what they're seeing and then feeling inadequate, and feeling pressure to try and change their own body so that they can be perceived as attractive or successful or even worthy.""
When identifying what prompted the resurgence of the ultra-thin, many critics point to 2021.
In June of that year, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the Wegovy (semaglutide) injection for use in chronic weight management plans.
Semaglutide might be better known by its other brand name — Ozempic.
Hillary Taymour, founder of designer label Collina Strada, laid blame solely on the drug and its alternatives.
""Everyone's on it. It's a drug that has created a skinnier industry and a new trend that skinnier and skinnier is better,"" she told the New York Times.
Ozempic is fuelling a narrative that ""small is better, no matter the cost"", Shauna believes.
Recounting her own experience of considering the drug, the content creator likened it to a resurrection of the fad diets and weight loss medication of the '90s and '00s.
""If somebody like me who dedicates so much of my life to the idea of worthiness had a moment of 'maybe I should', I can't imagine what people who are disengaged with their worthiness would feel,"" she says.
The re-emergence of '00s trends, such as Alexander McQueen skull print which was seen at Paris Fashion Week, has led some to fear the era's return in other ways.

She fears the illusion of its accessibility and celebrity use is spurring others to mould their bodies to ""whatever is in fashion"".
""Fashion is fashion but when people start to internalise it and devalue their own existence based on what they see, it's so harmful,"" she adds.
""These are really specific decisions that huge corporations are making intentionally, and they profit off it.""
Ms Cox says the Butterfly Foundation fields calls from those recovering from eating disorders who feel triggered by Ozempic's depiction in media.
Health experts are concerned Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs may be inappropriately prescribed to people experiencing disordered eating.
""They're often advertised as a quick, easy fix, which can be obviously very appealing for somebody who might be at risk of an eating disorder or  may already have an eating disorder,"" she says.
She also says there's medical concern over whether assessments for weight loss drugs like Ozempic are thorough enough in screening for eating disorders.
Annika says she understands how plus-sized people, in the face of stigmas, could be pressured view Ozempic as an option.
""There's only so much that you can take, there's only so many pictures you can look at,"" Annika says.
""There's only so many times that you can be mistreated by people because of your weight that it just makes you fed up.""
The Butterfly Foundation estimates in the past 12 months more than 3.1 million Australians have experienced appearance-based discrimination — including weight-based.
For Shauna, it's enough to feel like the ""boat is sinking"" and there's not enough voices speaking up ""before it all just capsizes"".
Voices that include people in straight-sized bodies.
""If you have a plus-size friend tap in with them and see what their life experience is. And then engage in the conversation,"" she says.
""Just because it doesn't include you, it doesn't mean that we don't need you to be part of the conversation.""
Designer Christian Siriano has been heralded as one of the few designers to consistently show diverse models.  (Reuters: Shannon Stapleton)
Annika wants things to change at the top — and she's tired of waiting.
""There's so many brands that just kind of chalk it up to we're working on it and I'm like, well, I DM-ed you five years ago and you're still working on it,"" she says.
""We push for gender equality in leadership because policies for women shouldn't be made without women and the same thing I believe applies to fashion.",Unknown,Sun 6 Apr,0

The man behind the ""ooh-loo-loo-loo""-heavy theme song that made The White Lotus intro one to watch has quit the show days before the hit social satire's season three finale.
Cristóbal Tapia de Veer's Emmy-Award-winning White Lotus scores were fan favourites in seasons one and two.
But in an explosive interview with The New York Times, the composer said show creator Mike White never liked his work and had to be convinced to use his season one theme.
I can hear God when the beat drops at 1:01 of #whitelotus S2 theme song  pic.twitter.com/47wbY7oXN7
Season three, he said, was ""for sure"" his last on the show.
""Maybe I was being unprofessional and, for sure, Mike feels that I was always unprofessional to him because I didn't give him what he wanted. But what I gave him did this, you know — did those Emmys, people going crazy,"" he told the paper.
And De Veer, as it turns out, was just as upset over The White Lotus season three theme treatment as the rest of the internet — albeit for different reasons.
The current season's score appeared to have scrapped the ululation that made it so popular; the intro credits run for 1:45 and the all-important ""ooh-loo-loo-loo's"" don't come in until 2:08.
De Veer says this was another point of tension between him and White: ""I told [the producer] that it would be great to, at some point, give them the longer version with the 'ooh-loo-loo-loos', because people will explode if they realise that it was going there anyway.
""But then, Mike cut that — he wasn't happy about that. At that point, we already had our last fight forever, I think.""
Two weeks ago, De Veer went ahead and uploaded the full score to his YouTube account.

Occult (and comedy and cinema) lovers rejoice this week as Australian comedian Cassie Workman officially announced her upcoming docuseries, Cassie Workman is Witchy AF.
That alone is worth celebrating, but there's more! The eclectic show has the backing of legendary director Lilly Wachowski who, along with her sister Lana, directed and wrote The Matrix films.
Workman and Wachowski are both trans women, so it was apt that the show announcement was made on International Day of Trans Visibility AND exactly 26 years since The Matrix was released.
The series is described as an ""adult comedic documentary"" and set in a fictional occult store owned by Workman, who will take the audience through ""a world of ritual magic, identity, demons, tarot, love, death and possible salvation"".
""It's been an honour to work with the incredible Lilly Wachowski, and an amazing production team, to make this weird and wonderful show,"" Workman said on Instagram.
Workman has been a mainstay in Australian comedy since she won Melbourne International Comedy Festival's RAW Comedy competition in 2009. She's written for shows like Shaun Micallef's Mad As Hell and Aaron Chen Tonight. Most recently, she toured her show Aberdeen — a tribute to her ""idol"" Kurt Cobain — internationally.
Witchy AF marks Wachowski's return to TV following her stint as a showrunner on comedy-drama Work in Progress, which lasted for two seasons from 2019-2021.
The British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards — better known as the BAFTAs — have released their 2025 nominations, with Netflix's darkly comic stalker series, Baby Reindeer, picking up a sweep of nominations.
Richard Gadd's semi-autobiographical program, for which he was sued for defamation, landed him a Best Actor nomination, along with seven other nods.
Nava Mau, who plays Gadd's girlfriend in the show, is the first out trans actor to be nominated for a BAFTA, going up against co-star Jessica Gunning for Best Supporting Actress.
Trailing Baby Reindeer with six nominations each are Toby Jones docudrama Mr Bates vs The Post Office, Gary Oldman thriller Slow Horses, and Rivals, a soapy comedy starring David Tennant set in the 1980s.
Nicola Coughlan posted about ""ringing my mum and getting to tell her forehead the news"". (Instagram: @nicolacoughlan)
Irish sweetheart Nicola Coughlan is also up for an award, and was in tears at the news of her first-ever BAFTA nomination, taking to Instagram to express a big ""holy moly"" at the news, feeling ""overwhelmed and excited and emotional"".
The Derry Girls and Bridgerton actor is in the running for Best Female Performance in a Comedy for Big Mood, a sitcom about mental health and friendship.
Between the announcement of four incoming Beatles biopics and confirmation that Spiderman: Beyond The Spiderverse finally has a release date, it might have seemed like there was a lot of movie news this week. And you would be correct!
It's all because of CinemaCon, the yearly convention where many of the major and minor studios come to hock the films that will be filling our cinemas in the next few years.
Here are just some of the announcements made over the convention:
However, it didn't take long for fans to notice that the majority of the films announced for 2026 are remakes, reboots or sequels.
And while it appears we are in an era of filmmaking that is pretty much just repeating the past 40 years, it's not all dire.
Challengers director Luca Guadagnino showed off his new thriller After The Hunt, a new original Wes Anderson joint is imminent and Yorgos Lanthimos teased his next project with muse Emma Stone.
Aussie filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou, AKA The RackaRacka brothers, have returned.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-02/val-kilmer-death-film-role-retrospective/105129062,Val Kilmer's most notable roles,"Actor Val Kilmer, star of Top Gun and Tombstone, has died aged 65.
He died from pneumonia, The New York Times reported, attributing Kilmer's daughter Mercedes Kilmer.
In a career spanning decades, Kilmer took on supporting and leading roles spanning from Batman to Doc Holliday.
Kilmer started his career on the stage in New York when he co-wrote and starred in the aptly named play How It All Began.
His commitment to the stage saw him turn down a role in director Francis Ford Coppola's film The Outsiders in 1983, but he would end up on the big screen anyway when he took the lead role as rock star Nick Rivers in the spy spoof Top Secret! in 1984.
The actor was best known for his roles in Top Gun, Tombstone, and Batman Forever but also earnt a reputation as a temperamental star.
He threw himself into the role, performing all his character's songs and releasing a companion album.
It was the start of a run of supporting roles for Kilmer, who appeared in 1986 action flick Top Gun as Iceman, the rival of Tom Cruise's Maverick.
In 1988, he appeared alongside Joanne Whalley and Warwick Davis in fantasy adventure movie Willow as the irreverent mercenary Madmartigan.
After meeting on the set, Kilmer and Whalley married in 1988 and had two children, before divorcing in 1995.

Kilmer reached stardom in 1991 when he took on the role of Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's biographical film The Doors.
The film released to middling reviews, but critics were unanimous in their praise for Kilmer's portrayal of the troubled rock star.
Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, but wrote that Kilmer's performance was ""the best thing in the movie — and since nearly every scene centres on Morrison, that is not small praise.""
1993's western Tombstone saw Kilmer relish in the swagger of Wild West gunfighter and dentist Doc Holliday in a performance nominated for Most Desirable Male at the MTV Music Awards.
Two of his most notable roles came in 1995, with the releases of Batman Forever and Heat.

Batman Forever saw Kilmer taking over the role of the caped crusader from Michael Keaton, the sort of change that always sparks a whirl of discourse.
In a movie given generally lukewarm reviews, Kilmer's performance was praised by critics, including Peter Travers of Rolling Stone who wrote that Kilmer had a ""deftly understated […] comic edge"".
Michael Mann's crime thriller Heat released the same year, and featured Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as a cop and criminal on a collision course.
Kilmer played De Niro's right hand man in the film, which became a cult classic and is considered the gold standard for action sequences.

He worked solidly in Hollywood over the next two decades.
Kilmer was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014 and later recovered, daughter Mercedes Kilmer said.
Val, a 2021 documentary about his life, showed him needing a breathing tube.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-31/richard-chamberlain-dies-aged-90/105114924,Heartthrob actor Richard Chamberlain dies aged 90,"Richard Chamberlain, the Emmy-nominated actor and 1960s heart-throb who rocketed to fame in the TV medical drama Dr Kildare and starred in the mini-series Shogun and The Thorn Birds has died at the age of 90, publicist Harlan Boll said.
Chamberlain died late on Saturday in Hawaii from complications from a stroke, his publicist Harlan Boll said in a statement on Sunday.
Chamberlain was an instant hit, and became a teen idol, as the handsome Dr. James Kildare in the series that ran from 1961-1966.
The breakout role was the start of a six decade-career that spanned theatre, films and television.
He was dubbed the ""king of the mini-series"" after appearing in several TV dramas in the 1980s and earned plaudits on stage in roles ranging from Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady and Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music to Shakespeare's Hamlet and Richard II.
He also was the original Jason Bourne in the 1988 mini-series The Bourne Identity.
""What's fascinating about Richard is that his range is enormous. His ability to be different each time out is what makes him such a valuable property,"" producer Susan Baerwald told the New York Times in 1988.
The versatile actor was nominated for four Emmys — as an English navigator in 17th century Japan in Shogun (1981), a love-torn priest in The Thorn Birds (1983), Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg in Wallenberg: A Hero's Story (1985) and for the title role in the TV movie The Count of Monte-Cristo.

Most of his roles were as romantic leading men, which is why he did not publicly reveal he was gay until he was 68 years old.
For much of Chamberlain's life he said he pretended to be someone else for fears it would ruin his career.
""When you grow up in the '30s, '40s and '50s being gay, it's not only ain't easy, it's just impossible,"" he told the New York Times in 2014.
""I assumed there was something terribly wrong with me. And even becoming famous and all that, it was still there.""
Chamberlain had a three-decade relationship with actor and writer Martin Rabbett, his co-star in the 1986 adventure film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold.
The couple parted in 2010 but remained close friends.
""He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us. How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul,"" Rabbett said in a statement.
Chamberlain said it was a tremendous relief after he acknowledged his sexuality in his 2003 autobiography.
""I had no fear left,"" he said in a 2019 interview. ""It was a wonderful experience. People were open, friendly and sweet.""
Born George Richard Chamberlain on March 31, 1934, in Los Angeles, he was the youngest of two sons.
He had hoped to be an artist but switched to acting after attending Pomona College in California.
His acting career was put on hold when he was drafted into the US Army in 1956 and served in Korea.
After his discharge, Chamberlain returned to Los Angeles, where he co-founded a theatre group and had small parts on TV before becoming Dr Kildare.

The success of the TV show led to a brief singing career and film roles opposite Julie Christie in Petulia and The Madwoman of Chaillot with Katherine Hepburn.
In the late 1960s, Chamberlain moved to England where he honed his acting skills in the BBC series The Portrait of a Lady and as Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theater.
""Dr Kildare was a huge hit in England, and I heard that all the London reviewers were coming to rip this interloper to pieces,"" he said in an interview. ""But we got very good reviews.""
Chamberlain returned to the big screen in the early 1970s as Lord Byron in the drama Lady Caroline Lamb, The Three Musketeers and as a villain in the disaster film The Towering Inferno.
Throughout his career he mixed roles in Broadway plays, including Tennessee Williams' The Night of the Iguana, with musicals, TV and films.
After coming out publicly, he played both gay and straight characters in TV shows including Brothers & Sisters, Will & Grace and Desperate Housewives.

David Genat, better known as 'The Golden God' to Survivor fans, has just won the biggest cash prize ever awarded on network television.
Genat won a mammoth $US5.8 million in the finale of NBC's Deal or No Deal Island, the equivalent of $A9.2million.
Based in Perth, Genat became known for his audacious gameplay in his multiple Australian Survivor appearances, and won himself the title of sole survivor in the 2020 series.
A post shared by Deal or No Deal Island (@dealornodealtv)
His Australian Survivor win brought him home $500k, while the biggest prize Australian Deal or No Deal contestants can bag is $200k.
Deal or No Deal Island, as the name suggests, blends the concept of Survivor with Deal or No Deal.
It involves 13 contestants competing in physical challenges and mastering social gameplay to find hidden briefcases worth millions, overseen by a mysterious banker. This season, which is also streaming on 10Play, attracted US Survivor legends including Parvati Shallow and ""Boston Rob"" Mariano.

Yuval Abraham — one of the filmmakers behind Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land — has hit back at the Oscar Academy over the letter released to members following the arrest of the film's co-director Hamdan Ballal.
The director said he was arrested for filming an attack on his neighbour's house in the village Susiya.
Earlier in the week, Ballal said he had been assaulted by Israeli settlers after filming them attacking a neighbour's house and then returning to make sure his own house was not attacked. He and two other men were arrested by Israeli security forces shortly after and Ballal was released from detention the following day.
No Other Land is an Israeli/Palestinian co-produced documentary about Israeli displacement of a Palestinian community. Ballal and Abraham, as well as fellow co-directors Basel Adra and Rachel Szor, accepted the Academy Award for Best Documentary in Los Angeles three weeks ago at the 97th Annual Academy Award Ceremony.
Israeli director Abraham — who has previously condemned the Academy for not supporting Ballal sooner in the wake of his arrest — took aim at a letter seemingly about Ballal that was co-signed by Academy CEO Bill Kramer and President Janet Yang and sent to members on Wednesday.
While the letter condemned ""harming or suppressing artists for their work or their viewpoints"", it also acknowledged the Academy represented ""close to 11,000 global members with many unique viewpoints"".
""After our criticism, the Academy's leaders sent out this email to members explaining their silence on Hamdan's assault: they need to respect 'unique viewpoints',"" Abraham wrote on social media.
The director also highlighted that the Academy's letter failed to mention Ballal by name, unlike a previous statement in favor of persecuted Iranian director Jafar Panahi.

As the start date of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' US federal sex trafficking trial looms, his numerous civil trials continue to play out in court.
This week Combs was granted a small win in his civil trial with former collaborator Rodney ""Lil Rod"" Jones, with a judge dismissing five claims in the suit but upholding others.
Jones filed the lawsuit against Combs in January 2024, alleging he was groomed, abused and exploited during the year he worked for Combs on what would eventually become The Love Album: Off The Grid.
Sean ""Diddy"" Combs will remain in jail ahead of his May 5, 2025 trial on sex-trafficking charges after a US judge denied his bid on Wednesday to be released on $US50 million ($77 million) bail.
Jones was seeking $US30 million in restitution.
Earlier in the week Judge J. Paul Oetken dismissed the claims in Jones' lawsuit that fell under New York's Racketeer Influenced and Corruption Act, including a racketeering allegation, the breach of contract claim and causes of action related to infliction of emotional distress. He also dismissed a claim in the suit related to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.
Despite these changes, Jones' civil suit against Combs will move forward on claims of sexual assault and sex trafficking.
Combs is currently being held in custody in New York as he awaits a trial that will decide if he is guilty of the two decades of sex trafficking crimes.
In mid-March, Combs pled not guilty to the charges in his most recent indictment, which says Combs used the ""power and prestige"" he wielded as a music mogul to intimidate, threaten and lure women into his orbit, often under the pretence of a romantic relationship.
The indictment said he then used force, threats and coercion to cause victims, including three women specified in the court papers, to engage in commercial sex acts.
Questioning of prospective jurors in the case will begin on May 5, with opening statements expected to occur on May 12.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-27/new-stars-old-legends-marvel-announces-avengers-doomsday-cast/105101532,Marvel announces Avengers: Doomsday cast,"Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Anthony Mackie's Captain America, Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes, Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Tom Hiddleston's Loki are all returning to the Avengers ensemble, where they are set to joined by several of cinema's original X-Men.
The five veterans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are in the cast of 2026's Avengers: Doomsday, which Marvel announced in a series of videos rolled out slowly overnight.
Patrick Stewart, 84, who played Professor X in Fox's early-2000s X-Men films, and 85-year-old Ian McKellen, who played his arch-nemesis Magneto, are also in the Doomsday cast as Disney and Marvel seek to take advantage of the acquisition of Fox's movie library.
Kelsey Grammer, who played Hank ""Beast"" McCoy, was also announced, as was Rebecca Romijn (Mystique), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler).
Their characters were taken on by younger actors in the 2010s X-Men series reboot.
The more senior superheroes will be joined by more recent MCU additions, including some who have yet to make their debuts.
Vanessa Kirby, set to play the Invisible Woman Sue Storm in this July's Fantastic Four: First Steps, will also appear in Avengers: Doomsday.
Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards will join the Avengers too.

And they will be joined in both movies by Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who is playing Ben Grimm, aka the Thing, and Joseph Quinn, who plays Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch.
Simu Liu, who played the title character in 2021's Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, is also in the newly announced cast, as is Tenoch Huerta Mejía, who played the aquatic antagonist Namor in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.
Letitia Wright, who plays Shuri in the Black Panther films, will also be back among the Avengers, as will other Black Panther alum Winston Duke.
Florence Pugh, who will reprise her MCU role as Yelena Belova in the forthcoming Thunderbolts, will also appear in Doomsday, along with cast mate David Harbour as Red Guardian.
Some of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's biggest and most anticipated names were not among the 27 names announced, though Marvel and Disney could be sitting on them for now.
There was no mention of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine or Ryan Reynolds's Deadpool, though the announcement did include Channing Tatum, who played the X-Men's Gambit in last year's Deadpool & Wolverine.
Chris Evans was also absent from the cast list. Tom Holland's name did not appear either.
Holland's Spider-Man became an Avenger in previous films. However, the character was on loan from owner Sony, whose complicated relationship with Marvel has made the intellectual property a sticking point.

Robert Downey Jr revealed last summer that he will be returning to the MCU to play the villain Doctor Doom in the next set of Avengers films.
Avengers: Doomsday, set for release in May 2026, will be the fifth Avengers movie, and the first since 2019's Avengers Endgame became one of the highest-grossing films of all time.
Marvel has been struggling to recover its cultural buzz and box office mojo ever since Endgame. However, it hopes the forthcoming ensemble films will bring back the magic that dominated cinema for more than a decade.
While you could argue the Marvel Cinematic Universe is far from on its knees, all eyes are on the lone MCU film being released this year to save the day, or —  at the very least — be a canary in the caped coal mine.
The success of the first 23 films in the franchise — the Infinity Saga — has been difficult to emulate, with the so-called Multiverse Saga seeing the first box office flops in the studio's history: 2021's Eternals and 2023's Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
Both films also copped ""rotten"" critic scores on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, another first for the MCU.
Despite decent reviews, 2023's The Marvels was the MCU's lowest-grossing film ever, failing to break even on its more than $US300 million ($476.4 million) budget.
The television offerings have also been mixed at best, with shows such as Loki and WandaVision earning good numbers and critical acclaim, and outings such as Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Secret Invasion struggling to make an impact.
It has not been all bad news, though, with 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home delivering a huge fan service and generating almost U$2 billion in gross worldwide revenue for Marvel — unsurprising for a character considered to be the heart of Marvel.

Avengers: Doomsday and the follow-up Avengers: Secret Wars will bring to a close to the Multiverse Saga after a bumpy ride in which the studio that seemed like it could do no wrong faced the realities of a growing franchise.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-23/scandi-noir-to-tassie-noir-cold-dark-and-riveting/105060348,Noir television is taking hold in Tasmania,"Noir film took hold in Hollywood's post-World War II era, spinning grim mysteries for smoking detectives in trilby hats to chase down over a tight 90 minutes.
These traditional and stereotypical heroes gave way in the modern age to a new style of noir, one championed by the glacially cold and glacially paced examples from the Nordic market.
In movies and films such as The Killing, The Bridge, and the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, directors and producers used the landscape as a character of its own, rugged up law enforcement officers trudging through snow and difficult terrain in quiet forests and small towns.
It's a technique writers and producers like Vicki Madden have used to stage a noir revolution on Australia's shores.
There had never been an adult drama filmed and produced in Tasmania when Madden returned home from the United Kingdom, where she spent years working in television.
She said it was a sense of ""location, location, location"" that drove her to pitch 2016 limited series The Kettering Incident to Screen Tasmania.
""I kind of really wanted to come home to Tasmania, and as a writer, I desperately wanted to write something about where I'm from,"" she said.
""And because of that model, I came back here and I was hugely influenced by — always am, really, hugely influenced — by all Scandi noir.""

There was a kinship, Madden said, between the geography and climate of the Scandinavian countries that birthed this style of noir and the chilly, isolated landscapes of Tasmania.
""It's very similar to Tasmania in a way, with the big landscapes and the isolation and the cold and all of that, and so my experience as a child growing up here … Tasmania is very gothic. It's got a very dark underbelly,"" she said.
In her analysis of the commonalities between Scandi and Tassie noir in the Australasian Journal of Popular Culture, PhD candidate Rebekah Brammer wrote about an aspect of ""liminality"" present in the landscapes of both Tasmania and Nordic countries.
Water played a feature role in both Scandi and Tassie offerings, Brammer wrote, reminding audiences of the isolated nature of the settings, with victims found at the base of a waterfall and the coastline acting as ""both threshold and boundary"".
""These bodies of water contribute to the melancholic mood and atmosphere and can be viewed as metaphors for liminal states,"" she said.
A pilot who disappeared nearly 40 years ago after reporting a UFO is one of the inspirations for the plot of the television drama series The Kettering Incident.
Liminality is a sense of being neither here nor there, a disorienting feeling often experienced midway through a journey.
""The location of The Kettering Incident's titular town on the state's eastern coastline also highlights its imposing shores and atmosphere of remoteness,"" Brammer wrote.
Beyond the physical similarities, Madden also found a unique sense of place in the small towns of Tasmania that felt eerily similar to those of Scandinavia.
""There's something … it hints at an underbelly of towns, and things that go on, that exist in a world of [their] own,"" she said, ""and I think it's something about the isolation of Tasmania"".
Madden said as soon as she drove into ""certain little towns"" with interstate friends, they commented that ""this [place] is creepy"".
Madden's love for exploring the genre extends beyond simple noir, with hints at otherworldly elements dropped into both The Kettering Incident and The Gloaming.
The idea of a ""strong crime story bridged with another genre"" is a technique she would like to explore further in the future.
""I think why [The Kettering Incident] did so well around the world … it was something really fresh and new and different, and that went for location but also moving into the supernatural world,"" she said.
""My quest now is to kind of surpass what I've already done, to do something a bit different, because now I'm looking at shows going, 'Oh, that looks a bit like Kettering, that looks a bit like The Gloaming.'",Ned Hammond,Sun 23 Mar,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/white-lotus-gal-godot-snow-white-netflix/105080128,Hollywood director arrested for allegedly swindling Netflix out of $17 million,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recap the pop culture and entertainment news you might have missed over the past week.
Carl Erik Rinsch — best known for directing 2013 action film 47 Ronin — has been arrested and charged with wire fraud and money laundering this week.
Prosecutors will argue that Rinsch conducted a scheme to defraud Netflix after the streaming giant paid him millions of dollars for a show that never materialised.
This new one-take crime drama takes toxic masculinity to a violent extreme.
Netflix paid Rinsch $US44 million ($69 million) for an unfinished show called White Horses, and later another $US11 million ($17 million) to wrap up production.
However, according to prosecutors, Rinsch didn't spend this money on production, instead funnelling the $11 million into a personal account and promptly losing around half of it on bad investments over two months.
The filmmaker clawed some of the money back by dumping it into the cryptocurrency market and then went on a spending spree.
According to prosecutors, Rinsch spent about $10 million on personal expenses and luxury items, including credit card bills, lawyers to sue Netflix for more money, furniture and antiques, five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, watches and clothes.
Rinsch had an initial hearing at a Los Angeles court earlier in the week where he did not enter a plea and agreed to pay a $US100,000 ($150,000) bond.
He'll face a New York court on his charges at a later, unspecified date.
While you may be familiar with Jason Isaacs for his role as Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter series, he's made a new name for himself as a shady southern businessman with a lorazepam habit in the latest series of The White Lotus.
The HBO hit has long been known for its comic portrayal of male nudity; from season one's anilingus scene to Theo James's nine-inch flash in season two.
And as Isaac's character, Timothy Ratliff, unravelled, so too did his hotel-supplied bathrobe, which slipped in episode four this season, revealing his genitalia to his horrified children.

But when questioned about whether he used a prosthetic, Isaacs complained about a ""double standard"" for male actors, pointing to Margaret Qualley's nude scenes in The Substance and Mikey Madison's role as a sex worker in Anora.
""I don't see anybody discussing her vulva, which was on [the screen] all the time,"" he told CBS mornings.
After online backlash, Isaacs has since backtracked on his comment, telling Variety, he ""said the wrong words in the wrong way"".
""I was tired — I'd done so many interviews,"" Isaacs explained.
""There is a [different] double standard — women have been monstrously exploited and men haven't.""
The 61-year-old actor admitted he ""absolutely should not"" have specifically referred to the two Oscar-nominated actresses, who he said he was ""a massive fan of"" and respects ""enormously"".
""My point wasn't that men have had a harder time than women — that would be absurd.""
Aaron Blabey, the Australian author and illustrator behind The Bad Guys book series — which was turned into an animated heist movie starring Sam Rockwell and comedian Marc Maron in 2022 — signed an eight-figure book deal this week.
""I have a little formula on my wall... it's just 'smart-dumb, funny-scary.' I just have to find [the] balance between those elements in each [Bad Guys book],"" Blabey said in 2022. (Supplied: Universal)
The bestselling children's author will write seven new books for tweens for publisher Macmillan, to be released in the UK, US and Australia. The books will drop in two series: the first a collection of fantasy books titled Game of Pets, expected in 2026, and the second called The Awfuls.
""In June 2023, I completed the final Bad Guys book — my 40th title in 10 years — and genuinely felt it might be time to retire. I mean, that's a lot of books!"" Blabey says.
""However, the infectious enthusiasm of everyone at Macmillan for a pair of new ideas (that I had quietly tucked away) has made me think perhaps all I needed was a holiday and a shot of new positive energy. I am very excited to get back to work.""
DreamWorks’ latest feature adapts the bestselling Australian kids book series about a posse of ‘bad’ animals learning to be good.
Blabey's books have sold about 55 million copies, with the author first finding an audience with his picture book series about a crotchety dog: Pig the Pug; and following it up with Thelma the Unicorn, the story of a somewhat-delusional pony that was turned into a Netflix movie (starring Brittany Howard from blues rock band Alabama Shakes) last year.
Blabey explained to ABC Arts in 2022 he thought The Bad Guys — about a gang of anthropomorphic criminal animals — resonated with children because it looked like the kind of book they might not be allowed to read.
""That cover with the four guys in the black suits, it was very Reservoir Dogs-ish, and it looked like something that [a kid's] older brother might look at, but not them,"" he said. ""And they suddenly realised it was not only for them, but pitched directly to them.""
The second Bad Guys movie is due out later this year. The 20th — and final — book in the series was released in 2024.
Israeli actor Gal Gadot's Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony earlier this week was disrupted by protesters on either side of the Israel-Gaza conflict.
Gadot, who stars as the Evil Queen in the new Snow White adaptation served in the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and has been vocal in her support for Israel following the events of October 7, 2023.

Police were called after a pro-Palestine protester stole an Israeli flag and the event was delayed by approximately 15 minutes, according to Variety.
Disney's decade-long mission to remake their classic animation catalogue marches on with a live action remake of their first feature.
About two dozen demonstrators reportedly gathered, and a video shared by Variety reporter Katcy Stephan on X (Twitter) depicted pro-Palestine supporters chanting ""shame on Gal Gadot"".
Another video from Stephan showed a pro-Israel protester declare that Gadot was ""being persecuted because she is [Jewish] and we will not stand for anti-Semitism"".
In an interview with Variety ahead of her Hollywood honour on Tuesday, Gadot said she had no regrets about speaking out post-October 7, 2023.
""I was shocked by the amount of hate, by the amount of how much people think they know when they actually have no idea, and also by how the media is not fair many times. So I had to speak up.
""When your compass is clear, your conscience is clean. I know what I'm advocating for, and I know what I wish for the world.""

OK, maybe Gogglebox, but that's only because, like most Australians, I fancy that I'm an undiscovered stand-up comedian and also because it's a job I could do sitting on the couch eating crisps. I was born for that.
But certainly, none of the rest of them and especially not the one show that my son has positively nagged us to go on: the infrequently broadcast gladiatorial parenting show, Parental Guidance, in which families with self-described distinct parenting styles battle each other to be recognised as best practice.
There's the authoritarian, the free range, the spiritual and the ""team"" styles, among many others. They all have their eyebrow raising eccentricities and their advantages. But the one thing they all have in common is that parenting and being devoted to their children — even the free range ones — is the centre of their lives.
10 diverse parenting styles put to the test in new TV show | Parental Guidance | Channel 9
Not for them the family life of my generation: harried parents who kicked you out of the house after breakfast and didn't expect to see you 'til dinner, and who would be speechless if you looked to them to not only feed and house you, but also advise, entertain, comfort and ""snowplough"" for you.
This approach to child rearing lands as indulgent, disabling and preposterous to parents from a time when reproduction was just that — making more humans until they left home and made more humans themselves. Such parenting is blamed for pampered young adults who ""fail to launch"" and many apparently less independent young adults.
So this is where new surveys by the Pew Research Centre in the US land with an unexpectedly happy thud, showing that yes, many parents are highly involved in their young adult children's lives but the clear majority of them, and their children, are very happy about it.
Further, the surveys show that these kids are nonetheless achieving certain milestones of independence even while they remain closely connected to their parents.
A cluster of interdependent changes have aided the shift: tech and telephony advancements that make staying in touch cheaper and easier; changing gender roles and expectations that have seen more fathers taking on (some) greater caregiving responsibilities; and the major social change of the abandonment of authoritarianism as the prevailing parental style.
Adult children who live at home share the pros and cons of living with parents.
Not that every parent wants to be a best friend, but I'd wager that very few wield the straps that were common in my generation's households.
Child rearing is now an entire way of life. It's a choice and an embrace of making a highly connected life with the humans you create because, if it works, it brings mutual joy and closeness. It's the same reason why many people are very reasonably opting not to have children: it's not just because of the cost, it's because the expectation is now of a continuing close and committed life experience that isn't for everyone.
Now, you don't have to yell — I can hear your groans from here, accusing modern parenting of creating a generation that lacks grit or life skills. And yes, I've also seen the less healthy side of parental over-involvement that rivals even the Boomers in its desperate desire to be seen as persistently youthful.
But it is sneaky sophistry to argue this and airily ignore the economic realities that underpin this complete change in parenting. I could — and did — run out the door with my sister at the age of 19, with zero money in the bank but three casual shifts at Woolworths in my diary — and make a go of it.
Somewhere deep inside, my angry parents knew that too: my sister and I would be able to ask the world to provide for us if we offered the fair exchange of our labour.
The generational divide behind Australia's cost of living split (Daniel Ziffer)
But that was at a time when mortgage — or rent — requirements sat at about 30 per cent of my income, and I was on a pauper's wage: a full-time university student supporting myself on three five-hour shifts.
In the early '60s, household debt-to-income ratios were around 20 per cent; they crept up a little for me in the '80s: now they sit at around 190 per cent — that's an increase of 850 per cent over my lifetime. With all other costs hurtling skyward as well.
And while Australia never broadcast the classic New York city television PSA asking if you knew where your kids were at 10pm, that would have been a reasonable question in my youth. Maybe I was in bed; or maybe I'd crammed myself into a friend's brother's Torana and we were hightailing it to the Crystal Ballroom in St Kilda to try to sneak past security. We were 16.
The shadow cast by that sort of history provides the other, more heartening side of the discussion, which is: What's the point of doing this at all if you don't really do it?
The Pew research records parents noting that they like their kids, that they are fun to be with. The kids said they value the advice and life experience their parents share with them.
One in three Australian grandparents babysit their grandkids to fill in gaps in childcare, becoming a support ""village"" for working parents, research finds. But what happens if you don't have grandparents to rely on?
Oddly, all of this sounds more like a much older, pre-Boomer way of growing up, when generations shared houses and helped each other grow up.
But you can never quite escape your own past. There's a part of me that cringes when I hear dads describe their grown sons as their ""best mate"" and the enmeshed mother/daughter relationship can truly be one of the most toxic. But then, that's what a kid from the ""do you know where your children are"" generation would say, isn't it?
If the alternative is a staunch and loving parent who is always in your corner and always up for a coffee, a yoga session and a bit of advice, it's hard to see the downside.
This weekend we have a delightful selection of long reads for you, including from our very own Mary McGillivray on the remarkable connection between Australia — and the enduring gifts of the Felton Bequest — and the masterpiece tapestry, The Lady and the Unicorn.
Have a safe and happy weekend and as I cast around with a little envy at all the marvellous acts music festival-starved music festival goers have been able to fall into, I find myself pulling out the CDs (oh yes, still CDs) of the acts I wish I had the time to see myself.

She will be replaced by Dario Vitale, who most recently was design director at Miu Miu, with his appointment effective on April 1.
It marks the first time in the brand's 47-year history that it will be led by someone without the Versace surname.
Versace welcomed Vitale to the role, emphasising in a statement that ""championing the next generation of designers has always been important to me"".
""I am thrilled that Dario Vitale will be joining us, and excited to see Versace through new eyes,"" she said.
""I want to thank my incredible design team and all the employees at Versace that I have had the privilege of working with for over three decades.""
The matriarch said she would take on a new role as chief brand ambassador and ""will remain Versace's most passionate supporter"".

The creative shift comes amid speculation that Prada Group is in talks to buy Versace from Capri Holdings, which paid 2 billion euros for the fashion house in 2018.
The US group also owns Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.
Miuccia Prada — the head of Prada Group — acknowledged interest in the brand on the sidelines of Milan Fashion Week last month, while Versace made no comment at what was to be her last runway show.
Versace symbolically wore a vintage jacket that Gianni made for her in 1992, inspired by the powerful Miss S&M collection.
Capri Holding's statement made no mention of any plans to sell Versace, but the arrival of a designer from Miu Miu — a brand also owned by Prada Group — is only likely to fuel speculation of a possible deal.
Versace was thrust into the role of creative director in 1997 after her brother Gianni Versace's murder in Miami.
""It has been the greatest honour of my life to carry on my brother Gianni's legacy,"" she said.
""He was the true genius, but I hope I have some of his spirit and tenacity.""
As the fashion house lead, she brought a boldness that led to some iconic runway and red carpet moments.

On the 20th anniversary of Gianni's death, Donatella created a healing tribute that featured supermodels he helped elevate.
Under Donatella, Versace became synonymous with the power woman she herself projected, despite periods of self-doubt.
""I asked why I took so long to find my way,"" she told reporters ahead of the anniversary show.
""The first few years I wasn't sure of myself. I made mistakes. But you learn from your mistakes.""

Versace received an outpouring of love and support on social media from younger designers she championed over the years, including Roberto Cavalli creative director Fausto Puglisi and former Valentino designer Pierpaolo Piccioli.
""I hope I've made you proud so far,"" Versace wrote in a post celebrating her and Gianni's creations and moments from across Versace's nearly 50 years.
Versace CEO John D Idol said in a statement the creative shift was ""part of a thoughtful succession plan for Versace"".
He called Vitale a ""strong leader"", and expressed confidence that ""his talent and vision will be instrumental to Versace's future growth"".
As chief brand ambassador, Versace ""will continue to champion the Versace brand and its values"", Idol said.
Versace represented 20 per cent of Capri Holdings with 2024 revenue of 5.2 billion euros.
Capri recently laid out strategic plans to rebalance the Versace portfolio to return the brand to its more daring roots, increase sales of accessories and win back entry-level consumers put off by a post-pandemic focus on higher net-worth clients.
During the presentation, Idol acknowledged that Versace had recently struggled in menswear ""where the historical … customer was used to us being very, very loud. And we've gone much quieter.""
Versace's loud designs will be a departure from the preppy Miu Miu style Vitale has worked with for more than a decade.  (Reuters: Stephane Mahe)
Coming across from Miu Miu, where he has worked since 2010, Vitale will be tasked with appealing to a new customer base.
""Versace and Miu Miu are very different brands and have very different customers,"" said Federico Giglio, chief executive of Giglio.com, an Italy-based retailer.
The Miu Miu customer likes more detail, a classy look, while remaining playful, whereas the Versace woman has a brasher and sexy style, he added.
""A good designer, however, knows how to identify with the DNA of the company and add his personal touch,"" he said.

Carl Dean, Parton's husband, died at the age of 82 in Nashville, Tennessee, according to a statement by Parton's publicist obtained by the Associated Press.

""Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can't do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy,"" Parton wrote in a statement.
The famous country singer met then 21-year-old Dean when she was 18, outside a laundromat on the day she moved to Nashville.
""I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me),"" Parton recalled in a 2008 interview.
""He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about.""
The couple married two years later, in a small ceremony in Ringgold, Georgia, in May, 1966.
Parton and Dean renewed their vows in a private ceremony on their 50th wedding anniversary in Nashville.
""I thought well, you know, we need to do something — it's been a good 50 years and I don't know how many more years we'll have left,"" Parton said in a 2016 interview.
""If I had it to do all over, I'd do it all over again, and we did,"" she said.
Speaking to the Dumb Blonde podcast late last year, Parton revealed the secret ingredients to her long-lasting marriage were love, respect and humour.
""He's quiet and I'm loud, and we're funny,"" she said.
""I think one of the things that's made it last so long through the years is that we love each other [and] we respect each other, but we have a lot of fun.""
""Anytime [there's] too much tension going on, either one of us can like, find a joke about it to really break the tension, where we don't let it go so far,"" she said.

Parton's iconic hit Jolene, which was twice nominated at the Grammys for Best Female Country Vocal Performance, was written about a flirty bank teller who seemed to take an interest in Dean.
""She got this terrible crush on my husband,"" Parton said in a 2008 interview.
""And he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kinda like a running joke between us.""
Over the years, Parton has described her husband as a ""country boy"", who loves to work on his tractors to media outlets.
Dean, who was known for avoiding the spotlight, will be laid to rest in a private ceremony with immediate family attending.
Dean is survived by Parton and his two siblings, Sandra and Donnie.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-02/but-i-m-a-cheerleader-at-25/104967056,"Initially panned, this 25-year-old film became a 'beloved' cult classic","Made by community for community, But I'm a Cheerleader has become one of the most iconic queer films of all time.
It could have gone terribly wrong — media executives could have become overly involved, toning down the project until it was palatable for mainstream audiences and the male gaze.
And yet, this campy, irreverent film set in a conversion camp was somehow greenlit in 1999, and enjoyed a cinematic release in Australia by 2000, premiering at the Mardi Gras Film Festival.
25 years on, But I'm a Cheerleader remains a beloved re-watch for queers both in Australia and globally.
But I’m a Cheerleader: Director’s Cut Official Trailer
To explore its cross-generational impact, we spoke with Alice Maio Mackay — a 20-year-old trans filmmaker from Kaurna/Adelaide, who's behind a string of horror flicks, including T Blockers — and Kate Jinx, an ""older millennial"", programmer at the Melbourne International Film Festival, and the co-host of the See Also podcast, which featured an episode on the modern classic.
But I'm a Cheerleader follows the life of preppy blonde teen Megan, played by honorary queer Natasha Lyonne, who is sent to a conversion camp to make her ""normal"" after her friends and family accuse her of being a lesbian.
The cult comedy, which also stars the actually gay Clea Duvall, has been heralded as a ""sea change"" for queer cinema in the 21st century, and is widely regarded as ahead of its time.
The film's impressive cast includes Cathy Moriarty, Michelle Williams, Bud Court, New Zealand's Melanie Lynskey and even a young RuPaul out of drag. (Lionsgate)
Many other LGBTQA+ films of the era told soul-crushing stories of repressed sexuality and the AIDS crisis, or featured straight actors ""playing gay"" for a mainstream audience.
Instead, But I'm a Cheerleader poked fun at heteronormativity and gender roles, taking dark themes of homophobia, social isolation and conversion therapy and turning them into a candy-coloured romantic romp.
For Jinx, who watched the film as a 20-year-old from Sydney's Western suburbs, the film was ""hugely influential"".
""A lot of what I was watching and dealing with were quite sad portrayals [of queer life],"" she says.
""The tragic lesbian is such a thing, and I felt like everything was so loaded, but this film had so much life and energy and lightness and a great soundtrack … it really blew me away.""
Since But I'm a Cheerleader and Heavenly Creatures, Melanie Lynskey has become known for Yellowjackets and countless other roles. (Lionsgate)
She had a friend who worked at their local cinema, who would let Jinx and her housemate enjoy back-to-back viewings.
""We would watch the film and then wait 15 minutes, and then it would start again.""
For Maio Mackay, who first watched the film as a 12-year-old exploring the tantalising world of SBS content, it's But I'm a Cheerleader's expert handling of light and shade that makes it so special.
Cathy Moriarty's Mary Brown ran True Directions with her ""straight"" son, Rock, played by Eddie Cibrian. (Lionsgate)
True Directions is a 1950s-style world, where girls vacuum and wear plastic pink dresses, and boys play with toy guns among phallic blue trees. RuPaul, who's an ""ex-gay"" camp counsellor, preaches about masculinity while wearing a ""Straight is Great"" T-shirt.
As Maio Mackay says, it's ""not a grounded film"".
""It's very satirical and colourful and campy and it's not like the real world.
""But at the same time, there's some sad and pretty shitty stuff that happens … we see these characters go through it but [because] it is such a vibrant world, it's still a fun watch.""
Jinx agrees the film is rooted in truth; director Jamie Babbit's mother even ran a rehabilitation centre called New Directions, albeit for drug addiction.
""Even though it comes off as this pastel-coloured confection, there's so much honesty in there too,"" Jinx says.
At its time of release, But I'm a Cheerleader was widely panned by reviewers, many of whom were straight men who misunderstood the film's humour, or who were scandalised by its focus on queer love and belonging.
But there was backlash from the LGBTQA+ community too, especially from the generation who'd lived through the AIDS crisis and didn't think it appropriate to laugh at topics such as homophobia.
But I'm a Cheerleader, a silly, irreverent film about conversion therapy, also has plenty of heart. (Lionsgate)
Over time, attitudes have changed, as has our understanding of gender and sexuality.
There's a character in the film who's implied to be a transgender man, however this isn't overtly explored, and they're mostly just the butt of the joke.
""It's not the greatest representation of all time,"" Maio Mackay says.
""But it's a product of its time and it still meant a lot to see a character like that when I was younger, when there weren't a lot — there still isn't a lot — of that kind of thing in the media.""
The film's tender portrayal of female love and desire has also kept it relevant to modern teens, including a sex scene the director had to fight for.
And Clea Duvall's soft butch character, Graham, clearly intended for the queer female gaze, has captured the imagination of a whole new generation.
TikTok today is full of horny Graham edits, with Gen Zs expressing their love for the film through sexualised montages of her character, as well as more generalised tributes and cosplays, all backed by a soundtrack of modern pop hits.
While many members of But I'm a Cheerleader's cast have gone on to have mammoth careers in the two and a half decades since the film's release, it's a project they're still frequently asked about; Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey recently reunited for Variety's Actors on Actors series.
The film was adapted into a stage musical in 2005, premiering at the New York Musical Theatre Festival, with a 2022 London production of the same script winning WhatsOnStage's Best Off-West End Production.
It's unclear if pop superstar Chappell Roan's cheerleading bop Hot To Go! was inspired by the film, but she is evidently a fan.
MUNA and Phoebe Bridgers's gay anthem, Silk Chiffon, made a more direct homage in its music video, with band members playfully re-enacting scenes and characters.

On an individual level, But I'm a Cheerleader has had a personal impact on many in the queer community, including trans actor Elliot Page, who credited it with changing his life.
Page brought up the film while receiving an award at Outfest film festival: ""We don't talk enough about how important representation is and … how many lives it saves.""
For Jinx, the film has been ""such a touchstone"" in her life.
""It was the kind of film I wanted to show everyone … it's those sorts of films that make you want to go into film curation and programming because it's all about connecting with people and creating dialogues.""
For Maio Mackey, the way the movie blends queerness with comedy influenced her own style of twisting the transgender experience through horror.
""A lot of people my age and a lot of people I work with really love the film and the story and how it's told.
""For any film made 25 years ago … I think that's pretty special.""

The Logie-nominated star, who had previously broken the news to her fellow cast members on set, will step back from the show as she sets off on another nationwide theatre tour of The Grandparents Club.

""After almost 33 years in my dream role and working everyday with people who I love, respect and whom I now consider family, it's bittersweet to be closing the chapter on what has been the best and longest gig of my life,"" McGranger said in a statement.
How the character Irene, who has beaten breast cancer, alcoholism and a plane crash, will depart the show is uncertain.
The star revealed she has been involved in the storyline behind the iconic character's exit, but did not say how she will leave Summer Bay.
""I can say that I came up with the idea,"" she told Channel Seven.
""It is very pertinent and it's very current, and I think the viewers won't be disappointed.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-23/the-white-lotus-and-the-immense-value-of-film-tourism/104924748,The White Lotus and the 'immense value' of film tourism,"The White Lotus has returned, welcoming a fresh batch of addictively awful characters to another lush part of the world where, despite their best efforts, someone always comes home in a body bag.
After stays in Hawaii and Sicily, the third season of Mike White's Emmy-winning social satire anthology takes place in Thailand on the idyllic island of Koh Samui.
With a population of less than 70,000, the island is the latest picture-perfect backdrop for one of the buzziest shows on television.
Thailand will be hoping to ride the wave of film tourism, where travellers book their next holiday based on the locations they see on screen.
And according to experts, it is a powerful marketing phenomenon.
While the White Lotus is a fictional resort, in reality, HBO struck a deal with the Four Seasons last October after using its Maui and Taormina locations for seasons one and two, respectively.
Every season of The White Lotus is set across one week at a luxury resort where dark secrets derail a relaxing holiday. (HBO)
Four Seasons executive vice-president and chief commercial officer Marc Speichert told ABC News the hotel and resort chain observed ""significant interest"" from guests following The White Lotus.
""The growth in visitor numbers has been truly remarkable,"" Mr Speichert said.
""Maui experienced a 425 per cent year-over-year increase in website visits and a 386 per cent increase in availability checks during season one alone.
After the first two seasons of The White Lotus, Expedia saw searches for Hawaii and Sicily each spike 300 per cent, though the travel website did not provide raw numbers.
The third season of Mike White's ""eat the rich"" series jets off to Thailand, introducing a whole host of people you'll want to strangle and locals you'll want to save.
""Destination marketing is vitally important for countries all around the world,"" says Professor Gary Mortimer from the Queensland University of Technology's Business School.
""You only need to think of actual travel shows, which often are funded by a tourism board of a country.
""In any show or doco that profiles a location, particularly the travel, tourism and hospitality elements of it — great bars, amazing resorts, beautiful beaches, fabulous landscapes — it's designed to attract people to that destination.""
Professor Mortimer adds that The White Lotus resonates with ""a particular audience"".
The White Lotus sells Koh Samui as an island paradise — but the whole season was nearly set in Japan.
When producers began location scouting, tourism authorities in Thailand pulled out all the stops to lure the critically acclaimed production to its shores.

Tourism Authority of Thailand executive Siripakorn Cheawsamoot told the ABC last April they were proactive in their attempts to be chosen as the show's latest destination.
""We approached The White Lotus production team and then we talked with them about trying to bring their budget costs down with potential partners,"" Mr Cheawsamoot told the ABC's South East Asia correspondent, Lauren Day.
As fans eagerly wait for a new lot of guests to check into the White Lotus, a behind-the-scenes drama has been unfolding to secure the filming location of the Emmy Award-winning show.
Two kinds of incentives were used to entice the production: cash incentives such as rebates, then ""in-kind incentives"" such as free services.
But one of the biggest drawcards was the Thai government's film incentive program, which offers a cash rebate of up to 20 per cent for foreign film productions.
In 2022, the government waived the personal income tax for foreign talent for five years, meaning the stars of season three would not have paid Thai tax during filming.
According to Associate Professor Monica Chien, a tourism behaviour and destination marketing expert from UQ Business School, Thailand's bid for The White Lotus underscores ""the immense value of film tourism as a strategic tool for destination marketing and economic growth"".
""Film tourism is a multifaceted phenomenon that encompasses a wide range of activities and cultural experiences, all of which can significantly influence a destination's image and drive visitation,"" she told ABC News.
The story, not just the scenery, helps drive film tourism, according to Monica Chien. (HBO)
Traditionally, film tourism involves visits to locations featured in specific films or television shows.
""These include the interplay of landscape, iconic features, narratives and characters, as well as the extent to which the location itself becomes a central character in the story,"" Dr Chien says.
""Film tourism has proven to be a powerful marketing tool, capable of increasing awareness and interest in lesser-known destinations while adding value to already popular tourist hubs like London or New York.
""For instance, I vividly remember my trip to New York 15 years ago, where the first thing I wanted to do was take a guided tour to visit all the iconic locations featured in Sex and the City.
The White Lotus isn't the only show giving viewers finding travel inspiration.
According to Expedia, Ted Lasso prompted a 160 per cent surge for searches for Richmond, the leafy suburb of London, following its second season.
For all its benefits, film tourism can quickly give way to overtourism. (HBO)
Meanwhile, searches for the Scottish Highlands recorded a 190 per cent ramp-up following the second season of The Traitors, compared with data from two years prior.
""The relationship between cinema and tourism is deeply intertwined,"" Dr Chien says.
""When tourists visit film locations, they generate substantial revenue for local businesses, including accommodations, restaurants, tour operators, retail outlets and transportation services.""
Destination marketing is ""vitally important"" for tourism, Gary Mortimer says. (HBO)
Beyond the obvious economic advantages, Dr Chien says several other advantages include enhancing a destination's image, propping up off-season business and reputational management.
But a surge in popularity can quickly give way to overtourism, straining local infrastructure, disrupting communities and degrading the environment.
""Many destinations are unprepared for the sudden influx of tourists driven by the popularity of a specific film or television series,"" Dr Chien says.
One example Dr Chien points to is Thailand's Maya Bay, which was made famous by the film The Beach.
""The surge in tourism following the movie's release led to severe ecological damage, forcing authorities to close the beach for several years to allow the fragile ecosystem to recover,"" she said.

Audiences are only just getting to know the characters of season three, but The White Lotus has already been renewed for a fourth season.
As for where viewers can expect the show to travel to next?

Rage at cancer patients shouting at doctors and (fatally) refusing their advice, rage at con-artists pretending to be ill in order to garner a following and monetise the misery of others, rage at the continual elevation of quackery, of false cures and false hopes and rage at those who purvey and profit from expensive, unevidenced treatments that can make people sicker.
If you have somehow missed the story, Belle Gibson was a young influencer and app-creator who lied about having cured herself from brain cancer she never actually had with food and alternative therapies. She developed a successful ""wellness"" brand, advocated against conventional medical treatments and purported to raise money for charities — little of which she ever passed on.
In 2015 she finally admitted ""none of it is true"".
Vanity Fair called her ""one of the most hated women in Australia"".
Apple Cider Vinegar | Official Trailer | Netflix
Few things incite headlines as quickly as a fraudulent female fantasist and, years after the Federal Court found Gibson guilty of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct, and fined her $410,000, her story continues to be told.
A new Netflix series, Apple Cider Vinegar, picks a sticky way through her webs of deception, trying to explain how it all happened, fathom how so few questioned her, and highlight the dangers of lack of interrogation of such claims (in short: people die).
The series, which Netflix says is a ""true-ish story, based on a lie"", also features a character based on wellness blogger Jess Ainscough who sought alternative therapies for cancer (as well as medical treatments) but sadly died at 29. Her family is furious at her false depiction as a rival to Gibson.
Now, another a documentary titled Dangerous Lies: Unmasking Belle Gibson involves further head-scratching.
I rocketed down a rabbit hole after watching the series, as I suspect others have too.
First, the original articles by the journalist who broke the story, Richard Guilliatt, who has queried its accuracy and called it an ""over-caffeinated, pop-soundtracked caricature … a drama about a real-life compulsive liar, told with little regard for the truth"". Having been written out of the story, Guilliatt suggests it's a ""bit rich"" that his own wife's breast cancer was ""grafted onto"" the plot line, connected to a fictional journalist.
Then I found myself looking at Ainscough's Instagram, and that of her partner, whose heartbroken posts are interspersed with his finding new love, and was cheered by his recent marriage. I went back and watched the 60 Minutes interview with Tara Brown and saw in Gibson the face of a woman accustomed to lying, to employing loopholes of language, basting in her own contradictions as Brown turned her on a spit of accountability.
Unmasking Belle Gibson: The real story of the infamous wellness scammer | 60 Minutes Australia
So what does all this mean for cancer patients?
The level of public loathing for Gibson has become so high and feverish that one 29-year-old woman who has terminal stage four bowel cancer — Kellie Finlayson, a mother and the wife of a Port Adelaide AFL player — says that she has been compared to Gibson ""countless times, several times a week"", which is ""a big punch to the face"".
""It's kicking me while I'm down,"" she told one reporter, but she believes people are doing it because she has sought alternative therapies and often looks well despite her illness.
""Being called this woman's name is offensive — it's abusive almost,"" Finlayson said. ""Having gone through the things that she described … or pretended to have gone through and the way she manipulated people around her to empathise and to give her so much … it makes me physically ill.""
I also can't help but feel concerned about one aspect of having cancer that seems to have been lost in all of the indignation about Gibson's pathological lies: it can be hellish traversing the medical system sometimes.
I say this whilst sharing this indignation and advocating, at all turns, science.
I have had uncharitable thoughts about people who advised me, after my own cancer diagnosis, to take some concoction that cured their Aunty Beryl, to drink vats of cucumber juice or to just think positively, which one woman I met claimed sorted her cancer right out.
If there was legitimate research finding sleeping with crystals nestling in our armpits would prevent or shrink tumours, we'd all do it, night after night.
But the answer is not to patronise or dismiss as mad cancer patients who seek gentler, less stressful routes. If we want to avoid the potentially fatal sway of canny fabulists like Gibson, the answer is not to ridicule patients but to elevate science, to put more money into cancer research.

Let me say baldly, I have had recurrent cancer and I have dutifully followed everything my doctors have told me to do. But I'm fully aware that it is a rare type, and under-researched, so much of the treatment guess-work. Smart guess work, done by smart people based on the available science. Which is why I have followed it.
But like many, I have had bad experiences too. My usual surgeon is brilliant, dogged, and exceptionally hard working. I am indebted to her. But I once consulted, and trusted, another surgeon, who ended up being contradictory and dismissive once his proposed treatment failed.
After my last appointment with him, I was so shocked by his blunt, almost cavalier approach that I struggled to sleep for several months — as did my friend who came with me. It was a truly awful and avoidable experience that made me wonder if we are doing enough to equip medical professionals to deal with the mental pain and uncertainty of chronic illness.
Medical staff can say incredibly insensitive things; people can get lost in the whirr of machines, the pinging of MRI lasers, the draining of blood, the pricks of cannulas.
This is often why people who are desperately ill turn elsewhere — because it can be so hard to grasp what you are going through, because few of us have sufficient medical knowledge or scientific understanding to be able to comb through academic journals and be satisfied about the correct route to take. Because it can be bewildering and overwhelming and sometimes the cleverest of doctors can be the worst communicators.

People don't refuse treatment just because they don't want to cut off an arm — as was suggested in Ainscough's case — but because they don't understand the complexity and uncertainty and, especially for those with rarer diseases, the gaps in research. Because they seek some semblance of control and fear the pain and toxicity of treatment.
American actor Kaitlyn Dever talks about finding the good beneath the surface of Belle Gibson, and the rise of the wellness industry.
The story of Belle Gibson is an important one, and it should be widely known for several reasons: so that we might avoid snake oil, challenge misinformation, question bogus medical claims, recognise what ignoring medical science might mean, and — allow me this — also witness the importance of good, properly funded investigative journalism. As well as shoddy journalism, of course — those who platform people claiming to have unproven miracle cures without demanding evidence.
In an era of increasing distrust of science, medicine and vaccines, we urgently need scientists and doctors who can communicate effectively. We also need to understand the root causes of that distrust, rational or otherwise, if we are to save lives from destructive ""self-healing"". We need to ensure people trust their doctors.
But let's not be distracted by simply fixating on a group of women who people seem to love to hate — pretty female influencers — and ensure we keep the medical system accountable too. So much remains unknown about so many cancers; no funding can go to waste.

""You've got an empty plot of land and you can draw walls and add windows, add doors and design your own kind of architecture, and it opened my eyes to these possibilities.""
The Sims has just turned 25, celebrating a quarter-century of house building, relationships and creativity.
A lot of people who grew up playing The Sims would remember an odd quirk: you can use a cheat code to remove the ladder from the pool while your Sim is swimming, drowning them.
It's these kinds of unexpected scenarios that had a big impact on people, says Jini Maxwell, video game curator at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) in Melbourne. ACMI is holding a special event celebrating the Y2K aesthetics of the early 2000s and nostalgia of the series.
""The Sims creates a kind of domestic sandbox [that] facilitates so much, like, social, creative and imaginative play, and I think that kind of play, it gives you a sense of agency,"" Maxwell says.
While the video game series has been played by around 500 million players so far, it was originally thought to be a relatively niche spin-off of the popular city-building and planning game series Sim City (created by designer Will Wright).
Maxwell believes this smaller scope meant some of the gameplay design decisions ended up being very groundbreaking socially, including the very first gay kiss ever portrayed in video games.

""The Sims was not conceived of as a blockbuster, high-budget video game,"" they say. ""So when Jamie Doornbos, one of the engineers, just decided that gay relationships were going to be an option, nobody really saw a reason not to, nobody really saw a reason to cut it.""
It's the humour and level of wish fulfilment in The Sims that video games researcher Jacqueline Burgess says has given it broad enduring appeal, especially for women and girls.
""The Sims is funny in a lot of different ways,"" she says. ""The tone of the game is sarcastic and satirical and, indeed, the entire game is a satire of suburbia — that made the game and its humour familiar and accessible for players.
""It was also a sort of dream simulator for some people: maybe you lived in an apartment or a city but you could move your Sims into the dream suburban home. By just entering cheats, you build and buy all sorts of combinations of houses, so it gave players a lot of agency and control.
""Because of the game's focus on creativity, it also appealed and still continues to appeal to female players who, despite making up nearly half of all video game players, are stereotypically not considered the gamers.""
Maxwell says the games continue to evolve alongside society.
""Video game history isn't just technology history, it's also cultural history, and thinking it about it that way is a way of humanising that experience for both players and developers,"" they say.
""Beyond the shocking and scandalous gay kiss, a recent expansion introduced polyamorous relationships, because that's something that's in the cultural Zeitgeist now.
""The Sims is a really perfect example of how the game sort of continues to expand and reflect the society that we're in.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-06/projects-cancelled-after-eight-women-accuse-neil-gaiman-of-abuse/104900618,Projects cancelled after eight women accuse author Neil Gaiman of abuse,"Neil Gaiman is one of Britain's most prolific authors, with many of his sci-fi and fantasy stories picked up by studios and adapted into television series or theatre productions.
But following abuse allegations made by multiple women, several of his projects have been paused, rewritten or cancelled entirely.
A woman from New Zealand has filed three civil lawsuits accusing Gaiman of repeatedly sexually assaulting her while she was working as his family's babysitter and nanny.
Scarlett Pavlovich filed the lawsuits this week against Gaiman and his estranged wife, Amanda Palmer, in federal court in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New York.
Ms Pavlovich publicly identified herself in an interview with New York Magazine, which published an article in January detailing allegations of assault, abuse and coercion levelled by eight women.
The allegations of four of the women were previously broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.
After the New York Magazine article was published, Gaiman released a statement in January.
Best-selling author Neil Gaiman has responded to new allegations he sexually assaulted, abused and coerced eight women.
""I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever,"" Gaiman wrote in a statement.
""Some of the horrible stories now being told simply never happened, while others have been so distorted from what actually took place that they bear no relationship to reality.""
Representatives for Gaiman and Palmer did not immediately respond to requests for comment, according to the Associated Press.
On February 7, Palmer posted a statement on Instagram denying the allegations.
""I will not respond to the specific allegations being made against me except to say that I deny the allegations and will response in due course.""
From comics to television series, here is the status of Gaiman's various projects.
Last month, publisher Dark Horse Comics announced it would no longer work with Gaiman.
""Dark Horse takes seriously the allegations against Neil Gaiman and we are no longer publishing his works,"" the publisher said in a statement posted to X.
""Confirming that the Anansi Boys comic series and collected volume have been cancelled.""
Gaiman has worked with multiple publishers throughout his career, including Bloomsbury, Penguin, Hachette, DC Comics and Titan, which have not yet commented.
It was announced in January that the stage adaptation of Coraline would be cancelled, with producers saying it was ""impossible to continue"" following the allegations against Gaiman.
The stage version of Gaiman's novel, which was turned into a film in 2009, was set to begin at the Leeds Playhouse from April 11.
""We have decided our production of Coraline — A Musical will not proceed,"" the production said in a statement.
The statement added that those who already purchased tickets would be contacted directly.
Streaming giant Netflix announced this week that there would be no further seasons of The Sandman once season two drops later this year.
The Sandman premiered on Netflix in 2022. (Netflix)
In a statement, showrunner Allan Heinberg said the decision to have the series run for only two season was made three years ago.
""The Sandman series has always been focused exclusively on Dream's story, and back in 2022, when we looked at the remaining Dream material from the comics, we knew we only had enough story for one more season,"" Mr Heinberg said.
""We are extremely grateful to Netflix for bringing the team all back together and giving us the time and resources to make a faithful adaptation in a way that we hope will surprise and delight the comics' loyal readers as well as fans of our show.""
The third season of the Amazon Prime series Good Omens will be just one 90-minute episode with no involvement from Gaiman, according to Variety.
Good Omens premiered on Amazon Prime in 2019. (Amazon Prime)
It was previously announced the third season of the show, which is based on the novel of the same name by Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, would be the last.
When Good Omens premiered on Amazon Prime in 2019, Gaiman was credited as the series creator, executive producer and showrunner.
According to Variety, Gaiman is no longer listed among the show's executive producers for the final episode.
Dead Boy Detectives is set in the same universe as The Sandman. (Netflix)
Netflix has cancelled its series Dead Boy Detectives after just one season.
The series, based on Gaiman's comics of the same name, was set in the same fictional universe as The Sandman.
The cancellation was reported by Variety in August, just four months after it first premiered.
It has not been confirmed if the cancellation was related to the allegations against Gaiman, which were first reported in July.
Disney's film adaptation The Graveyard Book has been paused.
According to IndieWire, which first reported on the story, the production has been halted for multiple reasons.
No cast had yet been announced for the film, which is based on Gaiman's 2008 young adult novel, though Marc Forster was attached to direct.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-06/how-the-covid-pandemic-is-represented-in-books-and-film/104882164,Why you're unlikely to see COVID mentioned in film for a while,"It's been five years since COVID-19 started to sweep the globe, sparking lockdowns, infecting communities and claiming millions of lives.
But for an event of its scale, the way the pandemic has been represented in culture — if at all — has varied wildly.
The COVID-19 pandemic has hardly been mentioned in any major Hollywood blockbusters, with the industry sidestepping the very thing that brought several productions to a halt.
It is a different story when it comes to literature, with multiple novels interrogating the pandemic's lasting effects on our lives and relationships.
Madeleine Gray is the author of Green Dot, which follows Hera, a 20-something who starts an affair with her older, married colleague.
In the middle of the novel, Hera attempts to flee the mess she's made in Sydney by moving to London — but strict COVID-19 lockdowns up-end her new life and force her back home.
Madeleine Gray wrote her debut novel Green Dot during Sydney's COVID-19 lockdown. (Supplied: Allen & Unwin/Zan Wimberley)
Gray wrote the novel when she was living alone during lockdown in Sydney, with her mental health ""not exactly flourishing"".
""I decided to include the pandemic section in the book because Green Dot is a contemporary novel, set before and during the pandemic time, and to me it would have felt strange to create a revisionist history of the present,"" Gray told ABC News.
""Green Dot is a story about yearning and love and not being able to connect with the person you love, so the pandemic was actually an amazing plot device for that.
Green Dot was published in 2023. (Supplied: Allen & Unwin)
""The isolation we all felt during the pandemic — that's a parallel to the kind of lovelorn desperation and pathos that my protagonist is experiencing.""
Gray is far from the only author whose writing features the pandemic — see Dolly Alderton's Good Material, Curtis Sittenfeld's Romantic Comedy and Ann Patchett's Tom Lake.
But one of Gray's publishers suggested it ""might be best"" not to include the pandemic, the reason being that readers might not be ready to re-experience it.
""And while that is a perspective that I empathise with, at the same time, we did all go through it, and as a world we are still recovering from a deeply traumatic experience that connects all of us,"" Gray said.
""Fiction is a place in which we can see our world reflected back to us, enter the minds of others, understand that our experience of an event might be very different to someone else's, so I fought to keep the pandemic section.
In the years since 2020, plenty of TV series have weaved the pandemic into their episodes, such as Morning Wars, Superstore and Grey's Anatomy.
The pandemic has also cropped up in international films, including the Oscar-nominated Norwegian film The Worst Person In the World.
But COVID-19 is yet to feature much in mainstream Hollywood films, if at all.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022) was one of the first films to mention the pandemic. (Netflix)
Glass Onion, Rian Johnson's sequel to Knives Out, featured the pandemic but only through the lens of rich people ditching their face masks in turn for a getaway on a tech billionaire's private Greek island.
Because the film was bought by Netflix, it went straight to streaming after a limited one-week run in theatres.
""It is estimated that over 1 million people in the United States died from COVID-19,"" said Lauren Rosewarne, an expert in politics and pop culture at the University of Melbourne.
Dr Rosewarne added there were ""very little positives to draw from this period"".
""All the incalculable loss and grief aside, the pandemic also destroyed businesses, significantly impacted livelihoods and further amplified sharp and ugly political divisions.
""Experiencing the whole thing again right now is probably something nobody wants. At least not now, at least not in our entertainment media.""
This isn't the first time Hollywood has been reluctant to represent an unfolding crisis.
""The two classic examples of this are the Vietnam War and the AIDS epidemic,"" Dr Rosewarne said.
""Both topics took several years to make it to the big screen in a significant way.""
After the terrorist attacks in the US on September 11, 2001, the Twin Towers were also digitally removed from the New York City skyline in several yet-to-be-released films to avoid re-traumatising audiences.

But there are other factors at play that may have contributed to a lack of COVID-19 content across film.
""Lockdowns, compounded with the Hollywood writers' strike, mean that the film and TV industries are still playing catch-up in a way that literature hasn't had to,"" Dr Rosewarne said.
For authors such as Madeleine Gray, representing the pandemic in novels is less of a risk because ""to be honest, novels cost less money to make"".
""That is why literature can be the wackiest, most exciting, most bizarre art form,"" Gray said.
The COVID-19 pandemic hit at the start of a new decade. Now at the halfway mark, what can we expect from film, television and literature in the next five years?
It's been about five years since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Australia. This is what Australia living through ""unprecedented times"" looks like in numbers.
""Creators have tried — and will continue to try — to capture aspects of the Zeitgeist in their work,"" Dr Rosewarne said.
""Some of this will be about the pandemic and understanding its impact on us, even if not necessarily being about the pandemic itself.""
Dr Rosewarne said it was likely the pandemic would be represented through metaphors, rather than direct presentations.
""During the early years of the AIDS epidemic, for instance, there were several horror films about viruses and bodily invasion — albeit without any direct mention of AIDS,"" she said.
""Films and TV shows can reference the legacy of the pandemic without needing to be about the pandemic itself.",JBy Jessica Riga,Thu 6 Feb,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-04/taiwanese-star-barbie-hsu-dies-of-flu/104893990,Taiwanese star Barbie Hsu dies of flu aged 48,"Barbie Hsu, a Taiwanese actress who starred in the popular TV drama Meteor Garden that once swept Asia, has died at age 48 after contracting pneumonia triggered by the flu.
Hsu, better known as ""Da S"", which means ""Big S"", caught the flu when she visited Japan with her family during the Lunar New Year, according to her younger sister, Dee Hsu, also a famed TV host. Dee Hsu said the pneumonia was a flu complication.
""I am grateful that in this lifetime I was able to be her sister, taking care of each other and being companions. I will forever be thankful for her and miss her!"" Dee Hsu said in a statement on Monday, without specifying where and when her sister died.
The news about Barbie Hsu's sudden death shocked audiences in Taiwan and China, where many had watched her shows since her early career. In China, news of her death was trending on the social media platform Weibo.

""It feels like someone you're so familiar with is suddenly gone,"" wrote one Weibo user. ""This is unbelievable. Her two children, poor kids. May she rest in peace.""
Hsu broke into the industry when as a teenager she formed a pop music group called S.O.S. with her sister Dee Hsu, popularly known as ""Xiao S"" or ""Small S"". The pair later switched to hosting TV shows and won many young fans.
In 2001, Meteor Garden beamed Barbie Hsu's name into many households in Asia. She played the female leading role in the romance drama, which also starred the boy band F4.
After gaining widespread popularity, she continued to advance her entertainment career through other TV dramas, movies and talk shows.
In recent years, her personal life also made it into the news, in particular her high-profile divorce from Chinese businessman Wang Xiaofei.
Her fallout with Wang, their heated exchanges on social media following their divorce in 2021 and their legal battles, often made headlines.
She later married Korean musician Koo Jun-yup, also known as ""DJ Koo"".

Hsu was passionate about defending animal rights and collaborated with groups including PETA.
""Barbie was one of the first and biggest stars to lend her support to PETA,"" read a statement by the organisation's senior vice-president, Jason Baker.
""She spoke up countless times for animals, directly urging brands to stop selling fur.""
Hsu is survived by Koo and two children she shares with Wang.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-26/scream-queens-ariana-grande-ryan-murphy-cheat-sheet/104855870,"Ten years ago, these Hollywood celebrities starred in a horror comedy","Welcome to Cheat Sheet, where we give you all the intel you need about iconic shows your friends have been bugging you to watch! In honour of its 10th anniversary, this time we're looking at bonkers black comedy Scream Queens.
In the post-Wicked hubbub, you might have been served a clip of Oscar-nominated actor Ariana Grande lamenting that hell totally sucks, in part because Hitler's there motorboating her.
This isn't some sophisticated AI ruse, but rather Grande's last pre-Wicked jump into acting — her featured role on Ryan Murphy's 2015 horror-comedy series, Scream Queens.
By 2015, Murphy had been dominating television for more than a decade: First, with his offbeat medical black comedy/drama Nip/Tuck; then with 2009 high school serial Glee. His 2010s Netflix deal led the New York Times to crown him the most powerful man in TV.
The writer and director had already started to dabble in horror by this point, producing two wonderful seasons (and 10 meh ones) of the gory anthology American Horror Story. Nowadays, the 59-year-old is keeping busy raiding real-life coffins for his Monster and American Crime Story series.
But in the mid-2010s, there was a short, glorious blip when Murphy took the high-stakes ridiculous drama of Glee, combined it with his love of the grotesque, and came up with Scream Queens — the short-lived black comedy more concerned with pithy dialogue than making any kind of sense.
It also featured wildly committed performances from stars who were just about to break — including the last semi-substantial on-screen role from Ariana Grande before she started holding space for Wicked.
In honour of Scream Queens turning the big 1-0, here's everything you should know about Ryan Murphy's most bonkers creation.
Scream Queens Official Trailer
Scream Queens follows the members of sorority Kappa Kappa Tau, an elite college institution that harbours a few secrets underneath its lavish staircases.
The KKT president is Chanel Oberlin (Emma Roberts), the supreme mean girl who refuses to learn her underlings' names and simply refers to them as The Chanels. There's Chanel #2 (Ariana Grande), Chanel #3 (Billie Lourd) and Chanel #5 (Abigail Breslin). There was a Chanel #4 but she ""got meningitis"" and then went home and died. Be prepared for this kind of ostentatious callousness.
SCREAM QUEENS SCENE - Meet The Chanels
Right when Chanel is about to get everything she wants, a serial killer called the Red Devil turns up on campus and starts chopping co-eds.
There are a lot of eclectic characters revolving around The Chanels. There's new pledgers Grace (Skyler Samuels) and Zayday (Keke Palmer) — these are our straight men earnestly hunting down the killer. There's Hester (Lea Michele, in her greatest post-Glee role), the mysterious back-braced new girl. Then there's Chad Radwell (pre-breakthrough Glen Powell), Chanel's on-off boyfriend with a penchant for bow ties (it's 2015! preppy was still in).
Then there are the ""adults"", the most interesting of which are college Dean Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis, a bonafide legacy scream queen) and police officer Denise (Niecy Nash, on her first step to a Ryan-Murphy-aided Emmy win for his Dahmer miniseries).

Season two keeps The Chanels, Dean Munsch and a few peripheral characters, but swaps the college for a hospital setting, and the Red Devil for a new mysterious killer, the Green Meanie. But don't worry, it's just as gory and ludicrous.
Ever since he was put at the head of his own shows, Ryan Murphy has traded in the farcical. From a love interest being banged off a balcony to her death in Nip/Tuck to a school kid nearly being blinded from a rock salt slushie in Glee, early Murphy offerings barely knew the meaning of the word ""grounded"".
Even his more serious earlier American Horror Story seasons featured screen icon Jessica Lange singing 'The Name Game' in between being lobotomised. But around the time that Scream Queens wound down, Murphy started getting a taste for “based on a real story”, beginning with his AHS spin-off, American Crime Story, which has so far tackled the OJ Simpson trial, Gianni Versace’s murder and the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
Here's why Netflix's new serial killer show about Jeffrey Dahmer is dividing viewers.
As the decade clicked over, Murphy and collaborator Brad Falchuk dived even further into real-life horrors with their Monster series. With a season on Jeffrey Dahmer and the Menendez Brothers in the can, and one on Ed Gein on its way, Murphy has come under increased scrutiny for sensationalising the stories of murderers.
Which is why it's so refreshing to revisit a time when he let his imagination and reverence for classic horror dictate the action. Scream Queens is heavy on the creative kills, but it is also immensely silly, allowing for some tremendous comedic performances to shine through its whip-crack dialogue.
Years away from his cinema breakthrough, Anyone But You's Glen Powell delivers one of his best creations in exceedingly rich, evil himbo Chad, who can be surprisingly progressive when it comes to his frat bros.
But perhaps the biggest crystal-ball sneak peek Scream Queens provides is showing off Ariana Grande's comedy chops. Grande eats up what small screen time she's provided, testing out the ditzy-yet-quick character she polished up to play Glinda.
Scream Queen's decision to promote the show largely off Grande's participation, despite only appearing in a handful of episodes, was also an early indicator of the starlet's tendency to ahhh … overshadow a production.
Many of Murphy's more ridiculous moves tend to live on in the most enduring form of communication: the gif. This early episodes' enduring giffery comes from Niecy Nash and her impeccable comedic delivery.
Nash's over-confident cop, Denise, is introduced when the core cast are struggling to believe a madman is targeting them. As Nash sits outside the sorority house, her partner is violently targeted, which leads to Denise blessing us with the immortal words: ""Shondell, why you got a knife in your throat?""
Also keep your ears open for Chad and his bro Boone (Nick Jonas, lol) bringing the word ""Broner"" into existence.
Beyond Grande's outlandish murder in the pilot episode (yes, she gets killed off that early) this back-half ep contains the singer's most memorable monologue. She pops up as a ghost in Chanel's bedroom, lamenting that Hell totally sucks (there are no dinosaurs!) but also warning Chanel that her lackeys are planning to murder her.

Jamie Lee Curtis also gets to flip the script in this episode, as the forever-hunted Halloween scream queen becomes the hunter. Curtis's Dean Munsch spends the episode pulling double duty as a scorned wife, pinning the murder of her cheating ex-husband on the dozy student he cheated with (blogging wunderkind Tavi Gevinson in one of her first TV appearances).
Every sentence that falls out of Emma Roberts' Chanel is laced with poison, whether she's calling her closest friends dumb sluts or the house's maid ""white Mammy"" (if you needed any reminder that this show was written a decade ago).
But the inspiration for Chanel comes from a real-life viral and vicious email a sister at University of Maryland's Delta Gamma sorority sent her sisters — you can read the full thing here, but be warned, it's brutal.
This moment is dramatised in Dorkus, as Chanel lets fly on what she really thinks of her sisters, if you can imagine she's been holding back. This episode also deals with the fallout of the Red Devil being revealed, but in a series as heightened as Scream Queens, even killer confessions aren't that simple.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-20/icymi-bob-dylan-lyrics-tiktok-ban/104837008,Two pages of Bob Dylan lyrics sell for $800k at auction,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recap the pop culture and entertainment news you might have missed over the past few days.
Timothée Chalamet might be swanning around doing his best Dylan for the A Complete Unknown press tour, but a recent auction proved there is still high reverence for the OG Bob.
One of the most enigmatic figures in modern culture has a long history with the silver screen. These are some of the best Bob Dylan-related films.
Draft lyrics for Dylan's classic, 'Mr Tambourine Man', sold for $US508,000 ($819,000) at a Nashville auction over the weekend. The typewritten lyrics covered three iterations of the song on two pages of yellow paper, with Dylan's handwritten annotations on the third draft.
'Mr Tambourine Man', from Dylan's 1965 Bringing It All Back Home album, was the first of his compositions to reach No. 1 in the United States and the United Kingdom.
The lyrics came from the personal collection of late music journalist Al Aronowitz who had reported that Dylan had written them at his New Jersey home.
""[He sat] with my portable typewriter at my white formica breakfast bar in a swirl of chain-lit cigaret (sic) smoke, his bony, long-nailed fingers tapping the words out"", Aronowitz was quoted as writing by auction house Julien's Auctions.

The lyrics were part of a much larger collection — some 60 items — of Dylan paraphernalia that went under the hammer at auction.
The items generated nearly $US1.5 million ($2.4 million) in sales overall through in-person and online bidding, Julien's Auctions said.
Other high-ticket items from the Saturday sale included a 1968 Dylan-signed oil-on-canvas painting for $US260,000 ($419,000), and a custom 1983 Fender guitar that he owned and played for $US225,000 ($362,000).
TikTokkers in the US spent the weekend saying goodbye ahead of the planned shutdown of the app following a US Congress ruling.
Heartbroken users divulged their final secrets before ""the end"": fitness influencers admitted to not doing their own workouts; PR relationships were revealed; make-up creators confessed to wiping off their signature foundation.
The app went dark on Saturday night local time, with a ""sorry, TikTok isn't available right now"" message blocking their access as the ban came into effect.
Users were in shock, and everyone became a tech expert. Creator Katie Fang used a virtual private network (VPN) to call for help, while mega-influencer James Charles posted from a burner account, hiding under his blankets.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world celebrated a TikTok without Americans, where centimetres, Celsius and kilograms reigned supreme.
Less than 24 hours later, incoming president Donald Trump promised an executive order to delay the law, allowing the company to ""make a deal to protect our national security"", which means selling the app to a company not based in China.
""I would like the United States to have a 50 per cent ownership position in a joint venture,"" Trump posted on X. ""By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say [sic] up.""
Following the announcement, TikTok restored its services and, after their dramatic exit, Americans were back.
As thousands of LA locals reckon with their losses and prepare to rebuild their city, Hollywood is scrambling to support both the victims of the fire and the current awards season.
Just weeks after postponing their ceremony for the first time, the Critics Choice awards have been pushed back again — this time to February 7th.
As LA continues battling its worst wildfires, some celebrities have called for Hollywood's marquee event to be cancelled altogether.
The event is still set to be held in the Barker Hangar, close to the Pacific Palisades area where thousands of residents were forced to evacuate due to the fires.
Multiple other awards season events, like nominations for the Academy Awards, have been postponed. Others, like the annual BAFTA Tea Party, have been outright cancelled.
Meanwhile, a swath of high-profile musicians have banded together for FireAid, a benefit concert to raise money for those most affected by the wildfires.
Taking place across two locations on January 30, the FireAid line-ups include the likes of Billie Eilish, Joni Mitchell, Lady Gaga, John Mayer with Dave Matthews, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Katy Perry and Stevie Nicks.
LA locals No Doubt will be reuniting for the concerts — it'll be the first time the Gwen Stefani-led act will play together since their reunion set at last year's Coachella music festival.
Film fans that were left heartbroken over the death of director David Lynch have one more chance to pay tribute to the eclectic creative.
The acclaimed filmmaker and artist has died, aged 78, but his influential, surrealist legacy lives on through an iconic filmography, select musical work, and his meme-worthy, quotable charm.
Lynch's children — Jennifer, Austin, Riley and Lula — have announced a worldwide group meditation to honour their late father on what would have been his 79th birthday.
""Our beloved dad was a guiding light of creativity, love, and peace,"" they said in a group statement.
""Let us come together, wherever we are, to honour his legacy by spreading peace and love across the world. Please take this time to meditate, reflect, and send positivity into the universe.""
The Lynch kids are calling on fans to gather on Monday, January 20 at 12pm Pacific Time for 10 minutes of meditation for David. If you're an Aussie 'Lynchhead' wanting in on the action, the local times are below.

With a career spanning six decades, his dark, subversive visions earned him a dedicated cult following and he was held in high esteem by critics.
His influence was so far-reaching that the term 'Lynchian' was commonly attributed to anything that loosely resembled his distinctive mood and aesthetic. However, though deeply inspirational, his style was impossible to imitate.
Consistently treading the line between dream and reality, his surreal work juxtaposed the comforts of everyday Americana with disturbing themes and nightmarish imagery, a universe where innocence and perversion were closer than you'd think.
Here are some of our favourite moments from David Lynch's illustrious career.
There's an amount of mental preparation necessary when undertaking Lynch's cinema, but the beauty of Mulholland Drive is how it lures you into its labyrinth. It's a psycho-sexual, avante garde thought experiment on Hollywood's dark underbelly, disguised as a classic noir mystery.
The set-up is compelling and, crucially, comprehensible: An aspiring actress fresh to L.A. (Naomi Watts) befriends a woman (Laura Elena Harring) suffering amnesia after a car crash.

But then the curveballs come thick and fast, with branching, brain-bending plot points that plunge the viewer into a maze of nightmarish hallucinations and atmospheric intensity… and it's all the better for it.
Boasting impressive technical craft, dynamic performances and uncomfortable yet unforgettable scenes, Mulholland Drive offers a vertical slice of Lynch's bracingly strange pie, making it a great introduction for first-timers.

The original TV drama series, set in the titular Pacific Northwest town, follows an FBI investigation into the murder of local teenager Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). It ended in 1991 on a cliffhanger that prompted decades of theorising. But, as promised by Palmer herself, (""I'll see you in 25 years""), Twin Peaks made a surprise return for a third season.
While Lynch reunited with co-writer Mark Frost and the majority of the TV show's cast, The Return was — even for Lynch — a dark, distorted portrait of the quirky Northwest town millions first fell in love with. A place where bizarre, transcendent beauty and great evil bloomed in equal measure.
It also withheld fan service, best typified by actor Kyle MacLachlan, who spends most of the series bumbling wordlessly as salaryman Dougie Jones. His Dale Cooper — Twin Peaks's enigmatic, endlessly optimistic FBI cop hero — is nowhere within his body, a light bulb burned out. And where was Laura Palmer? Is Audrey Horne okay?
Twin Peaks's third season arrived 26 years after the second, continually teasing audiences who hoped it would solve the show's biggest mysteries. (Suzanne Tenner/Showtime)
The Return eschewed answers and tipped the scales into evil's favour, instead interrogating the fear underneath all of Lynch's work, voiced by a minor Twin Peaks character: ""The possibility that love is not enough.""
Part 8 contains the most singular moment of the series, a largely black-and-white, wordless exploration of humanity's point of no return: Trinity, the US government's 1945 nuclear bomb test. From afar, we see it explode before its cloud reaches the camera, prompting a many-minute journey through its fires and flames, set to the discordant 'Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima'.
Even though he was beloved by millions, Lynch's work always felt like a secret code whispered just to you, indecipherable, bypassing the conscious for the transcendental. But occasionally, out of the blue and in the most irreverent, silly scenes (of which, despite the darkness, there are countless), there were direct calls for kindness and resistance to the forces of pain out of our control. As Lynch's own character would say, ""Fix your hearts or die.""

I don't know what to make of Lynch's debut feature. I don't even know if I like it. I just know that ever since I rented it on VHS back in high school, it's a particular nightmare that's never going to completely let me go.
It's a black-and-white surrealist film about a man who must confront and reckon with his monstrous, sperm-like baby. (An inspiration to Etsy craft-makers everywhere, it would seem.)
Umm... Cute? (ABC: Google Image)
The film's nightmarish body horror will hit you hard in the face, but it's the unsettling, layered sound design (by Lynch, along with frequent collaborator Alan Splet) that keeps you trapped in this unpleasant dream, not allowing even a moment's respite.
But let's get back to the baby. Because it's really about the baby. I'm not going to lie, during the birth of my eldest son, I thought about the Eraserhead baby.
Is that weird? Probably. But I'm sure I'm not alone there.

Eraserhead - Trailer
Lynch's adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi epic is mind-boggling, deeply weird, at times troublingly bad, and truly unforgettable.
Lynch consistently disavowed Dune — and in a scathing one-star review, film critic Rogert Ebert called it ""a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion into the murkier realms of one of the most confusing screenplays of all time."" Jeepers.
But over the years, Lynch's Dune has become a cult classic for exactly those reasons. Imagine the Blue Velvet auteur making a creepy, surrealist version of Star Wars, but with a fraction of the special-effects budget, and you get the idea.
If your primary exposure to the world of Arrakis has been Denis Villeneuve's sweeping, big-budget, sandworm-infested, Zendaya-and-Timothée Chalamet-filled epics, it's worth your while delving into the historical oddity of Lynch's version and, with the benefit of hindsight, appreciate that it ever got made.
You'll be rewarded with a young Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides, doing his best to make bad sfx work; Patrick Stewart charging into battle with a pug; and Sting as a deranged ginger Harkonnen nephew in a blue cod piece that you can never unsee.
Weird is wonderful. Battle pugs 4-eva.

Lost Highway parked itself in front of David Lynch fans five years after the end of Twin Peaks. It was a bold return to form — a hypnotic film that sinks into the shadow life of Los Angeles.
Bill Pullman plays Fred, an experimental saxophonist married to Alice (Patrcia Arquette), who begins to suspect foul play in their home. Fred meets the eyebrow-less Mystery Man (Robert Blake, who was tried for the killing of his wife) at a party. Madness descends. Let it fall over you, feel your way through it. Decoding the narrative puzzle, as with much of Lynch's work, is not really the point.

Because the director always recommended watching the film over having a take on the film, I will instead leave you with this quote from Lynch's book, Catching The Big Fish — a rare, explicit insight into his inspiration:
""At the time Barry Gifford and I were writing the script for Lost Highway, I was sort of obsessed with the O.J. Simpson trial. Barry and I never talked about it this way, but I think the film is somehow related to that … What struck me about O.J. Simpson was that he was able to smile and laugh. He was able to go golfing with seemingly very few problems about the whole thing.
""I wondered how, if a person did these deeds, he could go on living. And we found this great psychology term — 'psychogenic fugue' — describing an event where the mind tricks itself to escape some horror. So, in a way, Lost Highway is about that. And the fact that nothing can stay hidden forever.""

Music was at the heart and soul of so much of David Lynch's art. Whether flipping Roy Orbison for a haunting Spanish rendition (""Silencio!"") or working closely with composer Angelo Badalamenti and dreamy vocalist Julee Cruise, his unique musical choices were about so much more than mere soundtrack.
He famously tapped David Bowie to feature in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me and enlisted Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor to produce the Lost Highway soundtrack. He also directed music videos for Moby, Interpol, and Chris Isaak's 'Wicked Game'.
Lynch explored his musical side on several solo projects (most recently, last year's Cellophane Dreams with US singer Chrystabell) and contributed to many more as a lyricist, producer, guitarist and keys player.
From Eraserhead to his own musical career.
An underrated gem in his discography is Dark Night Of The Soul, a collaborative album made with revered producer Danger Mouse and the late, great Sparklehorse.
Richly layered, often melancholic but deeply beautiful, the record features a star-studded roster of vocalists — including members of The Strokes, Flaming Lips, Pixies, The Shins plus Iggy Pop and Suzanne Vega.
Lynch compiled an accompanying book of photography and sang on two album tracks: the dusty, noirish title track and 'Star Eyes (I Can't Catch It)'. The former would fit snugly in one of his movies, but it's the latter that hits different in the wake of his death — an abstraction of simple words (""Sun. Shine. Be. Mine. Come. Back."") delivered with wide-eyed optimism, but landing with disarming poignancy.

While it's obvious to honour a film legend of David Lynch's calibre with the cinema he gifted us, it's important to recognise his creative influence outside of film, too. We'd be remiss not to recognise how his meme appeal is deeply entrenched in his legacy.
With his unabashed nature to tell it like it is — from consumerism in film to the weather outside — his quips and quotes were always deeply relatable, even if they were a little cryptic most of the time.
One of the best Lynchian memes was born from a 2007 BAFTAs lecture. When asked to elaborate on why he believed his 1977 surrealist body horror, Eraserhead, was his ""most spiritual film"", Lynch simply replied: ""No.""
Giving absolutely nothing when asked an interrogative question, Lynch continued to subvert expectations. Can you ever truly know what's going on inside that enigmatic brain? A person who — as longtime collaborator and Agent Dale Cooper, Kyle MacLachlan, put it — was ""in touch with something the rest of us wish we could get to"". There's relativity in the absurd, and thus, a meme was born.

This weekend, the eyes of the entertainment world were drawn to the bushfires in LA that have devastated several neighbourhoods in the region, leading to at least 10,000 structures destroyed and the deaths of more than 20 people.
The strength and wide stretch of the fires has impacted numerous Hollywood productions, with shows such as Abbott Elementary, Loot and Ted pausing filming.
The Critics Choice Awards, slated to take place on Sunday, January 12, have been moved to January 26, with Oscars nominations postponed for two days as well.
Here's what else has been happening.
Meghan Markle announced this morning her new Netflix series With Love, Meghan will be delayed.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been California locals since stepping down from royal duties in 2020, when they moved to their Montecito mansion near Los Angeles.
They are not under active threat from the fires that have already destroyed more than 9,572 hectares of land in the region, but their neighbourhood is still considered a ""high-risk"" zone.
The couple visited an evacuation centre on Friday, where they helped serve meals to emergency crews and those who had lost their homes. They also met José Andrés, the founder of World Central Kitchen (WCK), a partner charity of their own organisation, The Archewell Foundation.
They've reportedly opened up their home to friends forced to evacuate, and issued a statement on their website pointing to various aid drives.
Markle's show is an eight-part lifestyle program, promoted as ""a heartfelt tribute to the beauty of Southern California"", which sees Meghan cooking, gardening and crafting at home with a variety of guest stars, including Mindy Kaling and Abigail Spencer.

Mel Gibson's $23 million Malibu mansion burned down while the Australian American actor and director was in Texas appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast.
In an interview with News Nation, Gibson said he was aware his neighbourhood was on fire during his chat with Rogan, and was ""kind of ill at ease"" during recording. ""When I got home, sure enough, [the house] wasn't there,"" he said.
""I went home and I said to myself, 'Well at least I haven't got any of those pesky plumbing problems anymore'.

""It's emotional. I've been relieved from the burden of my stuff because it's all in cinders. I have never seen a place so perfectly burned … You could put it in an urn.""
Other prominent Australians living in Los Angeles have also taken to social media to share their experiences of the fires. According to 2021 US census data, there are more than 20,000 Australians living in Los Angeles — though in 2016, the Los Angeles Consular-General estimated 45,000 Australians lived in the city.
Australian actor Benjamin Rigby (Alien: Covenant; Ford v. Ferrari) also shared on Instagram that he lost his Palisades home in the fires.

He shared a photo of the destruction, writing: ""My heart is absolutely and completely broken. My home is gone.""
Fires burning in and around Los Angeles have claimed the homes of thousands of people, including numerous celebrities.
Musicians Delta Goodrem and G Flip have evacuated their homes in the past few days, but have told followers they are currently safe.
""I love this beautiful city,"" wrote Goodrem on Instagram. ""It has always been a home away from home for me. My heart is broken and the feeling in the smoke-filled air is devastating. Praying for everyone.""
G Flip wrote on Instagram: ""Myself, [wife] Chrishell [Strauss] and [dog] Gracie had to evacuate our house in a hurry but we are safe in my studio… Be safe LA friends.""
Actor Rebel Wilson, who is currently in Australia, has also taken to social media to thank a friend for rescuing her and wife Ramona Agruma's cat from their Hollywood Hills home.
""Can not believe this,"" she wrote, sharing a picture of smoke and flames over West Hollywood.

Along with the thousands of residential homes destroyed in the LA fires, several pieces of Hollywood history have been lost to the flames.
This includes the Altadena mansion featured in award-winning comedy Hacks.

The pink-tinged abode featured in the second and third season of the show as star Deborah Vance's (Jean Smart) ""side mansion"" in LA. Despite production currently being paused for the fires, the house will feature in the show's upcoming fourth season, Hacks' key assistant locations manager, Scott Kradolfer, confirmed to Deadline.
""We had shot already earlier in the season; it was one of the first locations up for season four,"" Kradolfer said.
""Thankfully, we were able to go at the start of the season, but it was left up in the air whether or not we would see the character of Deborah Vance under that roof again.""
The mansion had been a mainstay for film and TV, also featuring in LA soap opera Knots Landing, 2020 thriller Ratched and, recently, comedy-drama Palm Royale.
A $US83 million ($134 million) mansion featured in the final season of Succession has also been ravaged by fire, reports say.
The 18-bedroom structure was a plotting place for the Roy siblings in the fourth season of the drama, with interiors and exteriors featuring in several episodes.

Parts of Palisades Charter High School — which served as the location for films such as Carrie, Freaky Friday and Teen Wolf — have been affected, as local schools official Alberto Carvalho confirmed last week.
The union that looks after more than 160,000 actors, announcers, voiceover artists, stunt people and other media professionals has made a sizeable donation to the relief fund designated for victims of the LA fires.

SAG-AFTRA — which became famous in late 2023 as the leader of the highly publicised Hollywood actors' and writers' strike — made a $US1 million ($1.6 million) pledge to the SAG-AFTRA Foundation's Disaster Relief Fund, with the money to be made available immediately to those affected by the natural disaster.
""The fires that have devastated communities throughout LA County have had a profound impact on the lives of many of our friends and colleagues who are members of SAG-AFTRA,"" president Fran Drescher and national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a statement.
""Union members stand together — and that's never more true nor more important than in times of crisis.""
While many high-profile Hollywood actors are SAG-AFTRA members, during the 2023 strikes, it was revealed that the median actor's salary in 2021 was $US46,960 ($76,279), with the lower quartile taking home just $US30,040 ($48,803).","Velvet Winter, Rachel Rasker, Jared Richards",Mon 13 Jan,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-11/nsw-sydney-burwood-acdc-house-planning-heritage-laws-demolition/104788294,'A disgrace': Why the AC/DC house wasn't protected before demolition,"The demolition of a Sydney home last month linked to Australian music history was subject to a planning law that local council said bypassed its approval.
For six decades, the property at 4 Burleigh Street in Burwood marked the site that helped cement two of the country's most famous rock bands.
The Young family moved into the building in 1965 and lived there for 12 years in the city's inner west.

During that time, George Young enjoyed success with recently formed band The Easybeats, while Malcolm and Angus started up AC/DC at the home in 1973.
Music writer Glenn A. Baker told ABC News the significance of the house could not be understated as a ""sacred"" site famous artists would ""turn up at"" and draw crowds ""like locusts"".
However, as Burwood Council shifted responsibility for the demolition onto a state government system, angry fans have been left wondering why the house didn't warrant more protection.

""It was really quite, quite terrible what [happened], it's one of the most miserable things you've ever heard,"" Baker said.
""There are people that are really pissed right off ... I really think it's a disgrace.
""This should be a wake-up call, what happened in Burwood — the greed and avarice that's led to that house being destroyed should have never been allowed to happen.""
Developer Burwood Square Pty Ltd purchased 4 Burleigh Street and the property next door in 2023 to turn into a $28.75 million residential development.
A spokesperson for Burwood Council said it was not involved in the process or approval to demolish it.
""The owner, under state government Planning Controls, engaged a private certifier authorised to issue a Complying Development Certificate, requiring only two days' notice to council before demolition works commence,"" they said.
The spokesperson said council remained committed to finding ways to honour the area's rich musical history ""including engaging in discussions with the owner of 4 Burleigh Street"".

The ABC reached out to Burwood Square Pty Ltd and Excel Demolition for comment.
In a previous statement, general manager Leon Kmita said Burwood Square Pty Ltd apologised, and regretted that ""the previous long-term owner did not share this vital part of the property's background"" with the company.
""We now recognise how deeply this location resonates with the AC/DC community and fans worldwide. We feel a strong responsibility to honour AC/DC's legacy and to make amends to all the fans who hold this band in such high regard,"" Mr Kmita said.
Complying development has been in place for 25 years and is a common practice, Professor Gurran said. (ABC News: Jack Ailwood)
University of Sydney planning professor Nicole Gurran said complying development was a streamlined, ""low impact"" approval pathway introduced 25 years ago for developments that meet certain requirements.
She said the system helped address concerns about planning speed and efficiency.
""There's no particular sort of decision-making involved other than testifying that something meets the rules, that's why the state government is happy to allow private certifiers to essentially tick off on it,"" she said.
President of Local Government NSW Phyllis Miller OAM said the use of private certifiers to approve complying development was ""an area of ongoing concern to councils and communities"".
The house was quietly demolished in December 2024. (ABC News: Jack Ailwood)
Both the Department of Planning and Heritage told ABC News that demolition can only be carried out as complying development where it meets all the relevant criteria, including not on a heritage item or land subject to an Interim Heritage Order (IHO).
The departments said they worked closely together to ensure heritage was sensitively and appropriately considered within the government's program to deliver on its housing targets.
The overall development of the Burwood site would have had to go through the ""normal checks and balances"" after demolition, with assessment by professional planners and relevant decision making bodies, Professor Gurran said.
The AC/DC house was put on the National Trust Register in 2013 — a community organisation that has no legal force but can offer independent, early warnings for places under threat of demolition.
The NSW government advised the house had never been nominated for the heritage protection.
It said neither the Minister for Heritage Penny Sharpe nor state bodies were asked to consider an IHO prior to the house's demolition, which local council can also consider granting.
A decade ago, independent heritage specialist City Plan Heritage was proactively engaged by Burwood Council to assess the property, who did not recommend the site be listed as it was ""not considered to be significant enough historically"".
AC/DC co-founder Malcolm Young moved to the Burwood house with his family, including fellow famous musicians George and Angus.  (Facebook: AC/DC)
Professor Gurran said the case brought to light ""the fact that heritage listing is a subjective process, and it's also a confusing process"".
""In the context of the dialogue we're having all the time about it being too difficult to build new houses, anything like a heritage listing is viewed as a constraint on development.""
Cr Miller said that while councils had various roles and responsibilities for local heritage, ""the strongest protections and recognitions come from other layers of government"".
""Heritage listings don’t exist primarily to block development, rather they ensure the planning system has a process to consider how important heritage can be respected while development is appropriately accommodated,"" she said.",MBy Millie Roberts,Sat 11 Jan,0

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-04/crazy-frog-axel-f-annoying-thing-mobile-ringtone-youtube-tiktok/104742018,"At 5 billion views, Crazy Frog's life span is longer than anyone expected","Few pop culture properties are as polarising as the Crazy Frog.
Some found him so endearing. A little animated creature mimicking the sound of a motorcycle, hooning around to Harold Faltermeyer's 'Axel F', the theme song from Beverly Hills Cop.
Many considered him the most irritating pop culture invention ever. Originally dubbed The Annoying Thing, this creature was not just nauseatingly grating, he had such a hold over Australian culture through the mid-2000s that he was genuinely inescapable.
Crazy Frog - Axel F
Crazy Frog's 'Axel F' went to number one in Australia and spent 21 weeks in the charts. It was our fourth-highest-selling song of 2005 and was all over the TV, thanks to mobile phone ringtone companies (remember them?) who ensured no Big Brother viewer would escape the frog's call.
It wasn't just us. 'Axel F' went to number one in a dozen countries, its worldwide dominance belying its humble origins.
""It wasn't always this kind of a huge project,"" says Sigfrid Söderberg, CEO of Crazy Frog Entertainment, a key player in bringing Crazy Frog to life in the early 2000s.
""It started off as almost nothing, no big commercial idea behind it. It was a fun little thing for us.""
Going viral in the pre-social-media era seems quaint now. It meant your picture, sound, or video had pinged from inbox to inbox as we figured out what to use this extraordinary new 'email' technology for.
That grating audio where the Crazy Frog imitates the sound of a moped had already had its viral moment before the actual frog character even entered the picture.
Swedish teenager Daniel Malmedahl created the sound as 2TAKTARE.MP3 in 1997, and soon it was popping up in email inboxes worldwide.
A few years later, Sigfrid Söderberg and his colleague Andreas Wicklund were recruiting for their animation studio Kaktus Film, when Erik Wernquist's application came across their desk.
""On his show reel was this little character,"" Söderberg says. ""We didn't think much of it. It was a fun little creature.
""We sort of saw the potential, but there was still a lot of water to flow under the bridges before something happened.""
The Annoying Thing
An early animation of the Crazy Frog made its way to a big player in music, who saw the potential that the Kaktus team wasn't sure was there.
""This clip ended up at the record label Ministry of Sound in Berlin,"" Söderberg says. ""They had this song ['Axel F'] that they thought would match with this character, so they asked if we wanted to do a joint venture in making a music video with our character for this song.""
When 'Axel F' became a worldwide hit, no-one was more surprised than the men behind the video.
""We didn't believe in it at all,"" Söderberg admits.
""It was a low-budget music video, so we said, 'We can do this video if we get a cut on everything. But we'll just do it, and we'll send it to you when it's done. You can't say anything about it. No feedback'. They agreed and… yeah, that went well.""
From the musicians' perspective, there was no need for feedback. The clip was precisely what they'd hoped for, and they knew they were onto something big.
""When they received the video, they said they immediately knew that they had a hit,"" Wicklund says.
""I mean, I don't know how you can tell that. Maybe it was a bit easier in those days because the competition wasn't as big, and we could actually [produce] some high-quality animation.
""We really put our heart and souls into the production. We really worked hard, because we did that music video that we wanted to be proud of.""
Given that Crazy Frog was originally called The Annoying Thing, and that it was a bizarre-looking character aping the already-grating sound of a noisy vehicle, the fact there was backlash isn't surprising.
""You either hated it or you loved it,"" Wicklund says. ""Many times kids loved it, and then if you were a teenager, or an adult, the thing to do was to hate the character.""
Instant fame on the scale of Crazy Frog's can be ruinous, as creators are exposed to extreme levels of both praise and criticism.
Crazy Frog - Popcorn
The Crazy Frog team were so busy looking to capitalise on the success of the first song – they released a version of the classic 1969 instrumental 'Popcorn' just three months after 'Axel F' – that they didn't have a lot of time to let the opinions of others affect them.
""It didn't get to us that much,"" Söderberg says. ""We were full-time concentrating on what we were doing next. So, the not-so-funny feedback we got, I guess we put that aside.
Wicklund concedes his team's faith in the quality of their work was also vital in getting through the backlash.
""We've always had really good self-confidence, when it comes to the character and to the music video,"" he says.
""We want to make a nice little story, and it needs to be fun. It's all about our humour and our way of doing music videos, and I think that's one of the key strengths.""
To be annoying is one thing. When you're annoying and inescapable – in every TV break, on the radio, and even out in regular life whenever mobile phones rang – the disdain becomes more poisonous.
""[Axel F] came with this package of mobile ring tones, which we never really liked,"" Söderberg says. ""It was kind of shoved down people's throats. So, it was a mix of being very proud and being annoyed with the backlash we also got from it.
Crazy Frog Jamster Commercial
""We just liked the character. It's a fun and lovable character. But since they showed it so many times on MTV and stuff like that, we got this backlash also.
""Nowadays, we don't have that at all because we got rid of those parts that we didn't like about the project. We got to focus on building this character as we want him to be and where he is now.""
Yep, in case you didn't know, the Crazy Frog hasn't been squashed.
Recent years have seen a resurgence in the character's popularity, perhaps due to millennials exposing their kids to a slice of their youth, or maybe this damn frog just had more enduring appeal than we expected.
""It started to live again, and we were a bit surprised because [we thought] we had closed the chapter,"" Wicklund says.
""We were still very aware of the potential, how good a character it was, and the reach that it had, but we didn't think too much of it until we discovered that it was really taking off. That's when the nostalgia era started.""
Crazy Frog clearly has lots of life left in it. At time of publishing, the Axel F video has 5 billion views on YouTube, with another 13 of its videos sitting at over 100 million views. It has half a million followers on TikTok, where short clips reach another broad audience.
Creative types tend to prefer looking to the future than reflecting, which can make for a challenging relationship with nostalgia. But Söderberg and Wicklund relish the chance to continue working on Crazy Frog, this time entirely on their own terms.
""We had time to prepare for what we wanted the character to be in a larger universe,"" Wicklund says.
""At the time, everything just happened, and we sort of went with it. We had this number one hit, and then came [second single] 'Popcorn'. We sort of just adapted to the situation.
""Now, we can do it the way we really want it. We are really thankful that we get a second opportunity to relive the character and really present it the way we want it.""
When it comes to learnings from the Crazy Frog experience, the two men agree on one simple takeaway: virality can't be manufactured.
""These things are very hard to plan,"" Söderberg says. ""If you try to have this majestic plan for how to do it, it probably won't happen.
""There was no plan behind it from the start, it was a fun little project that exploded because everyone involved — from Erik that created the character to the guys that made the music, to us coming up with the Crazy Frog world and the music videos — was [doing it] all for fun and without expectations.
""That's when you can have something that really works because it really comes from the joy of creating something.""
Crazy Frog - Hands Up (Explode)
The team have since been approached by many clients seeking virality, and their answer is always the same.
""We get asked, 'We're thinking about creating a character that we want to go viral', and we're like, 'It doesn't work like that',"" Wicklund says.
""It's really in the hands of the fans or the people who's going to watch it. There's something deep within the people that it sort of strikes a chord with, and then it just starts to move.
""It's very, very hard to do the analysis of what's going to work for people, because it's a combination of what's going on in society today, in everybody's life, what can you relate to.
""My tip is just really believing in your own talent and what you want to do, and just go with that. Create for yourself, foremost, and then hopefully somebody else will like it as well.""",Dan Condon,Sat 4 Jan,0

The streaming giant dropped a trailer early on Friday morning for With Love, Meghan, which shows the former royal cooking, gardening, beekeeping and flower arranging with celebrity guests.
A post shared by Netflix US (@netflix)
Netflix's website posted a short description of the show, which will be released on January 15 and lists Meghan Markle as a producer.
""[The show} re-imagines the genre of lifestyle programming, blending practical how-to’s and candid conversation with friends, new and old,"" the description read.
""Meghan shares personal tips and tricks, embracing playfulness over perfection and highlights how easy it can be to create beauty, even in the unexpected.
""She and her guests roll up their sleeves in the kitchen, the garden, and beyond, and invite you to do the same.""

Guests include actress and comedian Mindy Kaling, celebrity chefs Roy Choi and Alice Waters.
There is also a shot of the royal couple sharing a kiss and a mimosa.
The release of the trailer follows a post to social media by the Duchess of Sussex who had not posted in years.
Under the Instagram username Meghan, the duchess is seen running along a beach before drawing 2025 in the sand with her finger.
The account following quickly grew to over 1 million.
The former working royal followed up with a post featuring the trailer to the show on Friday morning.
""I have been so excited to share this with you!,"" she wrote in the caption.
""I hope you love the show as much as I loved making it.
Wishing you all a fantastic new year! Thanks to our amazing crew and the team at Netflix,  beyond grateful for the support - and fun!""
Meghan Markle has barely had a social media presence since 2020.
In 2019, Prince Harry and Meghan formed their own social media presence and website, branding themselves as Sussex Royal — with the ""Sussex"" part coming from their duke and duchess titles.
However, the Sussex Royal Instagram account was not active for long, as Harry and Meghan stepped down as working royals in 2020.
In March last year, Meghan teased her new brand American Riviera Orchard with a new Instagram page.
The Duchess of Sussex launches her new brand, hinting at a potential pivot to lifestyle content, in her first post in nearly four years. Here's what we know so far.
At the time it appeared to be teasing a pivot to more lifestyle content but nothing has been posted since March 15, 2024.
Neither the Instagram page or linked website provided too many answers about what the brand was.
The US trademark office revealed a little more, however.
According to the application at the time, the brand hoped to sell cookbooks, kitchenware (including silverware and kitchen linens) and a variety of jams and fruit preserves.
The trademark was filed under a company called Mama Knows Best, which Associated Press says was registered in January in Delaware.
Since leaving royal life behind, Prince Harry and Meghan have started a production company and charitable foundation, and pursued various ventures, including another Netflix show, called Harry & Meghan, about their relationship.
In April, the couple's media company Archewell said two new series were in production, one celebrating ""the joys of cooking & gardening, entertaining, and friendship"" (now known to be With Love, Meghan), and another exploring the world of professional polo, which aired in December.
That docuseries, titled Polo, was panned by critics, with The Telegraph describing it as ""a dull indulgence about a rich person's pursuit"".",Georgie Hewson,Fri 3 Jan,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-02/swiss-socialite-jocelyne-wildenstein-dies/104778250,Swiss socialite Jocelyne Wildenstein dies,"Swiss socialite Jocelyne Wildenstein, known for her extensive plastic surgery, has died according to her partner.
Her partner and fashion designer Lloyd Klein broke the news to AFP on Tuesday, saying ""an icon has left us"".
Mr Klein told the agency she had died aged 79, while other outlets reported she was 84 at the time of her death.
She died of a pulmonary embolism in a luxury hotel in Paris on New Year's Eve, Mr Klein said.
""Early reports from the doctors called to the scene indicate that she had endured heart failure and passed peacefully in her sleep,"" Mr Klein added.
Born in Switzerland, Jocelyne Perisset became a New York socialite after marrying art dealer Alec Wildenstein, with whom she had two children.
She kept his name after their messy divorce in the late 90s.
The cosmetic surgery aficionado, with more than a million followers on Instagram, became known as ""Catwoman"" in the tabloids for the feline-like shape of her eyes.
She had been living between New York and Miami, she told French media in recent months.
She last posted a video of herself and Mr Klein posing for photographers outside the Ritz Paris on December 23, to the soundtrack of Wham's Last Christmas.
""I never wanted to change my face,"" she told French television news channel C8 this autumn.
She did admit she might have wanted her lips to be a little thicker but said she did not embark on cosmetic surgery to try to keep her ex-husband.
She received $US2.5 billion from their divorce, making it one of the most expensive at the time, according to Mr Klein.

Asked if she had found love again, she said she had with Mr Klein, who was 21 years her junior.
Mr Klein and Wildenstein ""met during New York Fashion Week in 2001 when he was presenting his fashion collection on the runway,"" he said in his written statement.
""She was a front-row guest and after that show the two became romantically involved and had remained inseparable since that time.
""Jocelyne was my best friend, my partner, my fiance,"" he said.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-31/2024-best-memes-pop-culture-moo-deng-hawk-tuah/104759898,"Very demure, very mindful: The most memorable pop culture moments of 2024","Pop culture moved hard and fast in 2024 — and it was undeniably led by TikTok.
When looking at the year's viral moments and memes, almost all of them originated on TikTok — while X became a ghost town of bots, Facebook leaned into AI-generated slop and Instagram's reels continue to be dominated by reported TikTok content.
In an overwhelming year, pop culture and memes were particularly irreverent, often being reduced to one or two words, with people becoming famous for bringing the boom, going ""hawk tuah"" or being brat.
For better or worse, there are countless moments from this year that have etched themselves into our memories. From unbearable scenes of devastation to moments of lightness and hope, here are 24 images that defined the year.
And the internet conspired like never before, whether theorising #WhereIsKate, tracking down Baby Reindeer's alleged real-life inspiration or creating memes about assassinations (and assassination attempts).
Meanwhile, we joked about Olympians' shooting fits, breakdancing routines and, uh, appendages; Justin Timberlake's world tour was ruined; Jojo Siwa invented movements here-to-fore unseen in human history, and celebrity lookalike competitions popped up in parks across the world.
And so much more. Listing them all would be futile: Instead, the ABC Arts, Culture and Entertainment team (plus a few pop-culture-intrigued colleagues) look back on the moments they couldn't forget, for better or worse. Show meme to me, Rachel!
Picture this: It's February in Glasgow, Scotland. It's cold and overcast. You head to Willy's Chocolate Experience, billed as an immersive re-creation of the wonderful chocolate factory from Roald Dahl's classic book with ""surprises at every turn"". It costs up to 35 British pounds ($70) a head.
But what you find there is a largely empty warehouse, decorated with candy-themed props. There's a jumping castle. There's a depressed-looking woman dressed as an Oompa Loompa, standing behind a table covered in ""scientific"" equipment. Young actors are spouting lines from a script that seems strange, and probably AI-generated, given the inclusion of a creepy new masked character called The Unknown. Instead of gorging on a chocolate fountain, you find yourself sipping on a half-cup of lemonade and snacking on three, literally three, jelly beans.
I can't stop thinking about the Oompa Loompa who later told Vulture she and her fellow cast were trying to make the best of a bad situation: ""[W]e were trying to be the sprinkles on s***."" I can't stop thinking about the crowds of disappointed children, and their parents. I can't stop thinking about spending $70 on promised whimsy, and being met with nothing.
It feels like a stark metaphor for living in the world today: you try your best, you just want to have a good time, but the world is on fire and the cost of living is rising. Best just to eat a chocolate bar on the couch. As a little treat. Because treats are all we have.

Taylor Swift may have been Time's Person of the Year last year, but the pop superstar continued to dominate headlines in 2024.
The Eras Tour wrapped in December, with Forbes estimating the gargantuan production grossed $3 billion, making it one of the biggest tours in history.
There is a hum in the air from the start, a feeling that everyone in the city is tilting their bodies slightly towards the MCG, just waiting for the moment when she will finally take the stage.
It also transformed homemade beaded friendship bracelets into a must-have accessory; impacted traffic and public transport in cities around the world; and filled the streets with legions of fans clad in sparkles, pink or pyjamas, breathlessly comparing experiences and surprise songs between each show — including in Australia in February.
The sheer quantity of Eras Tour content online meant it was inescapable.
We unpack the best moments and greatest disappointments of the emotional rollercoaster that is Taylor Swift's new album The Tortured Poets Department.
But the endless posting of songs to TikTok after each show seemed to only make the world more curious, with her tie-in concert film becoming the highest-grossing of all time. And amid all the chaos, she dropped a brand new album — The Tortured Poet's Department — and then, just for fun, dropped a second secret album at 2am, making a whopping 31-track Tortured Poet's Department: Anthology.
2024 felt like Swift's biggest year yet, but who knows what she has planned next?

It started as a simple question, posed by a TikToker to random women on the street: If you were alone in the woods, would you rather come across a man or a bear?
Unsurprisingly to practically every woman, seven of the eight very quickly answered: ""Bear"". Even the one who picks ""man"" doesn't seem very sure. Then the internet erupted, particularly as women around the world gleefully echoed the sentiment.
First, because it's true. As I really wish I didn't have to point out, estimates from the World Health Organization say 1 in 3 women worldwide have been subjected to either physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime.
As one woman comments: ""What I've heard about bears is that they don't always attack you, right? Unless you f**k with them"", so it might be better to take your chances with a furry foe.
Secondly, it's funny. Partly because sometimes you have to laugh about things so you don't cry, but mostly because the violent outrage from a selection of the internet's men was immediate, predictable, and proved the point entirely.
Continuing their vital research, TikTokers started asking men a version of the question: If your daughter was stuck alone in the woods, would you rather she came across a man or a bear? And in a stark reflection of the ""as the father of daughters"" trope, most of the men get a dark, serious look on their face and resolutely say: ""Bear"".

This year, Kendrick Lamar and Drake lobbed barbs at each other over a series of increasingly nasty diss tracks that lit up social media, dominated headlines and rocketed up the music charts. The more you know of the beef's ins-and-outs, the better the hyper-specific memes are.
Some decried the high-profile battle as ugly,  but most agree that Lamar was the resounding winner, largely because his tracks were more cutting, sonically and lyrically detailed, and came at breakneck speed. Whenever Drake released a new song, Lamar was ready with a response.
The most dramatic turn of events — and thus, the funniest memes — came when Drake released 'Family Matters' only to be undercut less than an hour later by Lamar dropping the dark 'Meet the Grahams'.
Before Drake could recuperate, Lamar woke up the next morning and delivered the fatal blow: 'Not Like Us', a chart-topping sensation so severe that Drake has resorted to court action.
Drake's reply, 'The Heart Part 6', was widely ridiculed as a poor attempt to respond to allegations of paedophilia and a confusing self-own.
As for Lamar? He ended up topping the US charts a third time this year, landed the headlining slot for the 2025 Super Bowl Half Time Show, and scored seven 2025 Grammy Award nominations.
Oh, and he released GNX — a surprise sixth album and proverbial victory lap that didn't even bother mentioning his nemesis by name. The Pulitzer-Prize-winning rapper is truly in his villain era.

Remember when a TikToker managed to get a scoop from one of Australia's most renowned and elusive directors, even though she seemed to have no idea who she was talking to? Yes, I'm talking about the interview where Georgia Godworth bails up Oscar-winning Baz Luhrmann — who rarely gives interviews — on King Street in Sydney's Newtown.
It kicks off with Luhrmann, the guy who made Moulin Rouge! and Elvis, adjusting the lighting set-up to get his good side. Both he and Godworth side-eye the camera: You see this guy on the street who wants his good angles? You see this presenter who doesn't understand good lighting?
And the scoop? That Luhrmann and his wife, set and costume designer Catherine Martin, are seemingly in an open marriage.
Or as Luhrmann put it when asked if he was single or dating: ""That person that I'm married to and I found our own, really genuine, authentic concept of what our contract to each other should be.
When Australian TikToker Georgia Godworth approached a stylish man, she didn't realise who he was — now, their interview has gone viral.
""My own general philosophy is, if you care about someone … but they fall in love with someone else or they like someone else, there has to be some degree of acceptance. It's a contract of communication.""
But the true gift of the interview comes later, when Luhrmann is unimpressed by her dry misread of his relationship dynamic as mostly involving group sex.
The director asks: ""So I mean, what is the point of the conversation we're having?""
It's a question I ask myself every day.

In June, a 21-year-old Tennessee bedspring factory worker named Haliey Welch was approached on a night out by a TikTok interview channel. They asked ""What's one move in bed that makes a man go crazy every time?"", and her answer — about giving them the ""hawk tuah"", an onomatopoeic sexual act — made her famous. (Her thick Southern accent certainly helped.)
A month after the clip went viral, Welch had quit her job and made more than US$50,000 ($80,000) on official merch alone. Then came the podcast, Talk Tuah, where she and her friends interview various celebrities, and which reached the top five of Spotify's charts in October.

Since then, she's launched an animal welfare not-for-profit and multiple products, including an AI-powered dating-advice app.
Whether Welch's 15 minutes will extend into 2025 are unclear, as she currently faces her first scandal: A lawsuit alleging malpractice over the December launch of $HAWK, a Welch-branded cryptocurrency coin — though Welch is not named in the lawsuit and maintains she didn't have an active role in the launch.
Whatever happens, we'll always have Talking Talk Tuah, a non-affiliated podcast that over-analyses Talk Tuah.

2024 was the year pop culture caught up to British pop star Charli xcx, a long-standing critical darling whose sixth album, Brat, was everywhere — especially the cover featuring just the word in Arial against an abrasive, almost radioactive green (#8ACE00).

Recalling the sound and aesthetics of 2000s club culture (electroclash, indiesleaze, Eric Prydz) but with references to contemporary IT girls Julia Fox and Gabbriette, Brat is a messy mixture of hedonism and vulnerable comedowns, soaked in Auto-Tune and other digital distortions.
Of course, cutting-edge cool is always co-opted (and Charli's 'Kamala is BRAT' tweet accelerated things), but not even a NATO post could quell Brat summer.
Viral dances, a US stadium-tour with Troye Sivan and remixes with Lorde, Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande (plus a whole remix album) kept Brat thriving long after its release — and with Charli headlining Laneway this February, we're getting a southern hemisphere edition, too. (But this isn't Clairo shade, as she's also on the bill.)

Around July this year, when the US election race seemed to be a lock between two men old enough to be disqualified from driving, a lifeline appeared. Vice-President Kamala Harris announced she was stepping up as the democratic candidate.
For three glorious months, we had hope… I mean, memes. Rolling hot off the press was the rumour that Trump's vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, had been intimate with a couch. Yes, it spawned from one unverified tweet, but did that matter to the meme gods? No!
Kamala came with her own trove of memes including ""you think you fell out of a coconut tree?"", Momala and constant Veep comparisons. Team Trump also delivered the goods during the cycle, first with the endlessly disturbing images of his followers with pads glued to their ears after his first assassination attempt. Then, appearing real late in the game, was Trump's baffling (and false) statement that immigrants in Ohio were ""eating the dogs, eating the cats"", which got the full TikTok treatment.
Weirdly, all these memes became a lot less funny around November 6.
— Velvet Winter
Antithetical to brat, being demure is all about poise, modesty and mindfulness. Kind of.
TikToker Jools Lebron became a star in August due to her videos offering advice on how to be ""very demure, very mindful"" in various situations: arriving at work (""I do my makeup, I lay my wig""), the pharmacy (""This is not the Met Gala""), airport travel.
It was always tongue-in-cheek — and perhaps a nice reprieve from the picturesque tradwife content of the likes of Nara Smith, almost designed to make most viewers feel slovenly.
But most importantly, demure was fun to say and lip-sync to. (Demure is also Dictionary.com's word of the year.)
But the biggest impact was on Lebron's life: a few weeks after going viral, she posted an emotional update, saying she could now finance further gender-affirming surgery.

Sorry Pesto, but Moo Deng is the viral animal of the year.
Moo Deng is the moment, Moo Deng is you, Moo Deng is me. For every moment, there is a Mood … Eng meme.
This bouncy baby pygmy hippopotamus — Thailand's most famous round and rambunctious gal pal with gleaming black eyes, fluttering ears, glossy self-lathering skin and adorable rosy cheeks and chin — has become the symbol and salve for our chaotic, burnt-out 2024 times.
When Moo Deng charges about her concrete enclosure, we identify with her impulse to escape, only to have nowhere to hide in our always-on world. When she bites her keeper's knee, she affirms our desire to assert boundaries. And when Moo Deng takes refuge in her black feeding basin, resting her rosy chin on its rim, we too understand the need for respite and rest in a wearying world.
Moo Deng is female rage embodied, reminding us we can be cute and rage against the machine at the same time. We are human, we contain multitudes, we embrace them.
And after we rage, we nap.

In 2024, movies held space in pop culture.
Wicked's unmissable, chaotic press tour capped off a year where movies and memes went hand in hand, with studios and distributors embracing or attempting to generate free marketing — no doubt inspired by Barbenheimer's successes.
Take Dune: Part Two's limited-edition popcorn bucket, featuring a lid in the shape of a sandworm mouth, which felt designed for NSFW jokes. (Wicked's NSFW printing error on the packaging of tie-in figurines was unmistakably not on purpose, though).
But it wasn't just blockbusters that made an impact — and gained eyeballs — through memes. Body-horror The Substance made a bloody splash, in part, through the jokes and reactions online; erotic love triangle Challengers sent people into a horny frenzy; and Madame Web's product placement and stilted script were thoroughly rinsed.
And then there's the complex matter of It Ends With Us, whose flowery rom-com marketing felt at odds with its domestic violence plot line, with an avalanche of memes blaming star Blake Lively. But an extensive December report by the New York Times alleges Lively was targeted in a digital smear campaign by film director and co-star Justin Baldoni, who Lively is now suing for harassment. Memes can (and often do) have a dark side.

Obituaries do more than pay tribute to those we've lost — they're an opportunity to look back at a life well lived and the creativity that has driven them.

Quincy Jones died aged 91.  (AP: Chris Pizzello/Invision)
A titan of the music world who worked with everyone from Frank Sinatra to Snoop Dogg, Quincy Jones died in November aged 91.
Born in 1933, Jones overcame a difficult childhood spent running with gangs on the streets of Chicago to become one of America's most influential music composers and producers.
Best known for producing some of the biggest albums of the 20th century, including Michael Jackson's Thriller, Jones composed dozens of film scores and arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, among many others. He won 28 Grammy awards.
Jones overcame racial barriers to become one of Hollywood's first black executives, and his film and TV production company is responsible for 90s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and the film The Colour Purple.
""There's an entire universe waiting in his seven decades of music. And while you listen, hear him, hear how he imbued love into every single second of music he made. That was his real legacy, love,"" his daughter, actor Rashida Jones, said at the Oscars Governors Awards.

Former One Director singer-songwriter Liam Payne died tragically in October after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. He was 31.
Payne's death sparked an outpouring of grief from fans of the popular teenage boy band, which formed in 2010 after auditioning on British reality TV show The X-Factor.
One Direction sold more than 70 million records, becoming one of the most popular groups of the 21st century.
In the years following One Direction's split in 2016, Payne spoke openly about the pressure of being a teenage star and his struggle with drugs and alcohol.
""We had an absolute blast but there were certain parts of it where it just got a little bit toxic,"" he told Men's Health in 2019.
In early 2024, Payne released his first solo single in three years.
He is survived by his parents, siblings, and seven-year-old son Bear.
Health professional Ray Kelly discusses working with Michael Mosley.
British physician and broadcaster Michael Mosley died unexpectedly in June, aged 67, while holidaying in Greece.
After studying philosophy and medicine, Mosley joined the BBC as an assistant producer in the 1980s.
He went on to present and produce science and health programs over four decades, becoming a mainstay on British television. He also presented several documentaries in Australia.
Mosley gained worldwide recognition after he popularised intermittent fasting with the publication of his bestselling 2013 book The Fast Diet. He began experimenting with fasting after he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
While some of Moseley's dieting advocacy attracted criticism, he was praised for his unrelenting commitment to science and ability to connect with audiences.
""He was a truly generous, curious, warm-hearted man who cared as much about people themselves as the science that could help them,"" Australian TV presenter Marc Fennell wrote on X.

Treasured dancer and choreographer Eileen Kramer died in November, shortly after her 110th birthday.
Born in Sydney, Kramer joined the Bodenwieser Ballet, considered to be Australia's first modern dance company.
""It felt marvellous, it was prestigious,"" she said in 2015.
Kramer lived and performed overseas for much of her life, meeting Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong along the way.
She stopped dancing to care for her husband after he suffered a stroke, nursing him for 20 years. Returning to Australia aged 99, she began dancing publicly again.
""She dedicated herself to showing an old person can also contribute and be a dancer and influence people. It gave a new view, it [dance] isn't just a young person's thing,"" former ballerina Barbara Cuckson said.
Oscar-winning actress Dame Maggie Smith died at the age of 89.
Dame Maggie Smith, one of England's most celebrated actors of the stage and screen, died in September aged 89.
Smith received critical acclaim playing Desdemona opposite Laurence Olivier's Othello in 1965. She won Academy Awards for 1969's The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and 1978's California Suite. She is one of the few actors to have won an Oscar, Emmy and Tony award.
But it wasn't until Smith was in her 70s that she became a household name as the sharp-tongued Violet Crawley in Downton Abbey.
""I'd been working around for a very long time before Downton Abbey and life was fine — nobody knew who the hell I was,"" Smith said in a 2017 BFI interview.
Smith is best remembered by younger audiences as Professor McGonagall in the Harry Potter films. Smith ""was a fierce intellect, a gloriously sharp tongue, could intimidate and charm in the same instant and was, as everyone will tell you, extremely funny,"" Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe said.
Smith was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990, and King Charles paid tribute to her after her death, calling her a ""national treasure"".

Brian Wenzel, the Australian actor who played Sergeant Frank Gilroy in the long-running TV soap opera A Country Practice, died in May aged 94.
Wenzel starred in the Channel Seven series for 12 years until 1992, winning a silver Logie for Best Supporting Actor in 1983. All up, he said he appeared in more than 3,000 hours of television, also featuring in popular soap Neighbours, Rove Live, The Young Doctors and Matlock Police.
Born in Adelaide in 1929, Wenzel had a troubled childhood. At age 10 his parents put him and his older brother in a boys' home — the first of five he would live in, and flee from.
""They would beat the living suitcase out of us"" as punishment for running away, Wenzel told the Advertiser in 2017.
Eventually Wenzel returned to live with his mother. As a teenager he took a job with a circus, looking after ponies, but soon began performing in the ring. He became a professional actor at the age of 17.
In 2021 Wenzel revealed he had suffered two mini strokes and could no longer walk unaided. ""I got old all of a sudden. I can't work anymore, which I find really frustrating,"" he told New Idea magazine.
According to Channel Seven he died in nursing care, leaving behind his wife Linda, who he married in 1957.
Wenzel was a ""passionate family man and devoted Carlton supporter"" who would leave ""an irreplaceable mark on the Australian film and television industry"", his agent Jennifer Hennessy said.
John Blackman (right) with his Hey Hey It's Saturday colleague Daryl Somers. (Nine Network)
Australian radio and television personality and the voice of Hey Hey It's Saturday's quick-witted comedic puppet Dickie Knee, John Blackman died in June aged 76.
He had been diagnosed with skin cancer in 2019 and had surgery to remove part of his jaw.
Blackman began his media career at Goulburn radio station 2GN in 1969. In 1971 he began working on the fledgling morning children's TV show Hey Hey It's Saturday, which evolved into an entertainment and variety show and was moved to the night slot in 1984.
Blackman was an announcer on Hey Hey but he also voiced several of its comedic characters including Dickie Knee, the Angel and Mrs McGillicuddy. He worked on the show until it was cancelled in 1999, returning when it was revived briefly in 2009 and 2010.
Blackman returned to radio in the late 1990s and early 2000s, hosting shows on 3AK and Triple M in Adelaide. His last gig was at Magic 1278 in Melbourne in 2015-16.
The host of Hey Hey It's Saturday, Daryl Somers, said he was ""devastated"" by the loss of his ""beloved friend"".
""He had a God-given talent to make people laugh, especially me,"" Somers said. ""He used to say his mission on Hey Hey was to break me up, and at times I'd be crying with uncontrollable laughter. Sadly today, I'm just crying.""
Richard Simmons became famous for his fitness videos.  (Supplied)
Dubbed ""the clown prince of fitness"" by People magazine in 1981, fitness guru and short-shorts sporter Richard Simmons died in his Los Angeles home in July. He was 76.
Simmons was an overweight teenager who shared his weight loss tips on the Richard Simmons Show, which aired in the early 1980s. In it, he performed aerobic exercise workouts to his live audience, often in flamboyant outfits.
He also authored several best-selling books, created the Deal-A-Meal diet plan, opened workout studios and featured in exercise videos. He cast real people — chubby, balding or non-telegenic — in his videos to make his fitness goals seem attainable.
""I think I'm just a good example of a chubby, fat, unhappy kid who lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, and dreamed, and now all my dreams are coming true,"" Simmons told a TV host in 1980.
But he was also the target of media personalities Howard Stern and David Letterman. Stern, for instance, once teased him until he cried.
In 2017, after Simmons had not been seen in public for several years, he became the subject of a popular podcast called Missing Richard Simmons, which discussed theories about what might have happened to him (one critic called it ""an invasion of privacy masquerading as a love letter"").
But in 2022 Simmons's spokesperson told The New York Post that he was ""living the life he has chosen"".
Actor Shannen Doherty was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015. (Reuters: Mario Anzuoni)
Best known for her roles in the 1990s TV hits Beverley Hills, 90210 and Charmed, actress Shannen Doherty died in July after a years-long struggle with cancer. She was 53.
Doherty first rose to prominence in the 1980s as a child actress, starring in the TV series Little House on the Prairie and Our House and the film Heathers. But she became a star playing Brenda Walsh in the popular high school soap opera Beverley Hills, 90210, whose first episode aired in 1990.
Doherty and her 90210 co-stars regularly made tabloid headlines, with Doherty gaining a reputation for hard partying and conflict and drama in her personal life.
After she was written out of 90210's fourth season in 1994, Doherty went on to star in the films Mallrats (1995) and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001). She also played Prue Halliwell in the TV series Charmed, which ran for eight seasons from 1998.
Doherty was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015. She announced she was in remission in 2017. But her cancer returned in 2020 and, in 2023, she revealed it had spread to her brain, then her bones.
She continued working after her diagnosis, launching a podcast in December 2023 in which she reflected on her career, her relationships and her health.
""I'm not done with living. I'm not done with loving. I'm not done with creating. I'm not done with hopefully changing things for the better,"" she told People magazine in 2023. ""I'm not done.""
James Earl Jones was best known for voicing the Star Wars villain Darth Vader. (AP: File)
James Earl Jones, the actor who voiced Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy and Mufasa in Disney's The Lion King, died in September aged 93.
Born in Mississippi in January 1931, Jones was raised by his maternal grandparents after his parents divorced and his mother remarried and moved away.
""I was raised by a very racist grandmother"" who blamed all white people for slavery, and Native American and Black people ""for allowing it to happen"", Jones told the BBC in 2011.
""She was the most racist person, bigoted person I have ever known.""
His childhood trauma left him with deep scars and as a young boy Jones developed a stammer. By age 8 he was stuttering so badly he stopped speaking entirely — until he overcame his disability in high school by reciting poems and joining debating teams.
After moving to New York City in 1955, Jones studied at the American Theater Wing and Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio, going on to win minor roles in a string of Shakespeare plays in the 1960s.
His film debut was as Bombardier Zogg in Dr Strangelove (1964) and by the 70s and 80s he was in high demand for stage and screen roles, starring in movies including Conan the Barbarian (1982), Matewan (1987), Coming to America (1988), Field of Dreams (1989) and Cry, the Beloved Country (1995).
Jones won many awards during his career: Tonys, Golden Globes, Emmys, Kennedy Center honours and an honorary Oscar.
Author Barbara Taylor Bradford, pictured in 2006. (AP: Dima Gavrysh/FIles)
Barbara Taylor Bradford, who wrote stories of women fighting for love and power in a man's world, died in November aged 91.
At age 16, she left school to become a reporter for The Yorkshire Evening Post. For 30 years she worked in roles including fashion editor and columnist, but writing novels was her dream.
She became a publishing sensation in her 40s, with the saga A Woman of Substance. Published in 1979, the novel was a multi-generational chronicle of the travails and triumphs of retail baron Emma Harte, who would be featured in several other Bradford novels.
Bradford averaged nearly a book a year as one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers. She had a strict writing routine: at work behind her IBM Lexmark typewriter by 6am, break around 1pm, then back to writing until 6pm, at the latest.
She was published in 40 languages and sold more than 90 million copies around the world.
Kris Kristofferson was an army helicopter pilot before becoming a songwriter.
Texas-born actor and singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson died in September aged 88.
A former US Army pilot, Kristofferson worked as a part-time janitor at Columbia Records' Music Row studio hoping to break into the industry.
He became a prolific songwriter, known for hits including Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down and Help Me Make It Through the Night. He was a singer himself, but many of his songs were best known when performed by others, such as Ray Price (For the Good Times) or Janis Joplin (Me and Bobby McGee).
Kristofferson wove intricate folk music lyrics about loneliness and tender romance into popular country music, and was part of a new breed of country songwriters alongside peers such as Willie Nelson, John Prine and Tom T. Hall.

Shelly Duvall, the Texas-born star of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, died in July, aged 77.
At her peak, Duvall was a regular star in some of the defining movies of the 1970s and 1980s, particularly working with director Robert Altman.
Gaunt and gawky, Duval was not a conventional Hollywood starlet, but her wide-eye presence sang on screen, including in Thieves Like Us, Nashville, Popeye, Three Women and McCabe & Ms Miller.
The film critic Pauline Kael called her the ""female Buster Keaton"".
Duvall disappeared from movies almost as quickly as she arrived in them. By the 1990s, she began retiring from acting, with her last role in 2002's Manna From Heaven, when she then retreated from public life.
Actor Donald Sutherland appeared in more than 200 movies and TV series.  (AP: Chris Pizzello/Invision)
Donald Sutherland, whose acting career spanned more than half a century, died in June, aged 88.
He never stopped working, ultimately appearing in nearly 200 films and series.
Sutherland was known for offbeat characters such as Hawkeye Pierce in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H movie, the hippie tank commander in Kelly's Heroes and the stoned professor in Animal House.
Over the decades, Sutherland showed his range in more buttoned-down — but still eccentric — roles in Robert Redford's Ordinary People and Oliver Stone's JFK. His role in the Hunger Games introduced him to a new generation.
Sutherland — whose son Kiefer followed him into the business — wrote a memoir, Made Up, But Still True, that was released after his death.

Australian cartoonist Michael Leunig died in December,  aged 79.
Leunig's early work appeared in Woman's Day and London's Oz magazine and his first book of cartoons, The Penguin Leunig, was published in 1974.
His prints, paintings and drawings have been exhibited in public and private collection. In 1999 he was declared a national living treasure by the National Trust.
He was a regular contributor to The Age and Sydney Morning Herald. In September 2024, he was dismissed from The Age, 55 years after he penned his first cartoon for the paper.
Some of his work attracted controversy in his later years, but Leunig said it was his job to ""probe the tender spots"" because he felt they were the most important.

Marsden wrote the Tomorrow book series, beginning with the 1993 novel Tomorrow, When the War Began, about a hypothetical war where Australia is invaded.
The series sold millions of copies world wide before being adapted for TV and film, and  made him one of Australia's most renowned young adult novelists.
He won many major awards for children's and adult fiction, and in 2006 received the Lloyd O'Neil Award for contributions to Australian publishing.
Marsden also founded and served as principal at two schools in regional Victoria, Candlebark near Romsey and Alice Miller in Macedon.

Jimmy Carter, the former US president who became a crusader for human rights and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in later life, died on December 29, age 100.
Carter served one term as the 39th president between 1977 and 1981 and lived longer after leaving the White House than any other ex-president.
Prior to his 100th birthday Carter said he was only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris. He voted by mail on October 16.
Raised in segregated rural Georgia, Carter's politics were influenced by the civil rights era and was established as a progressive politician.
His presidency oversaw an historic peace deal between Israel and Egypt and an arms control treaty with the Soviet Union. He is also remembered for the events that overwhelmed the era: inflation, a global energy crisis, war in Afghanistan and the US hostage crisis in Iran.

American actors' union SAG-AFTRA held the longest strike in their history in 2023 — over labour issues like the impacts of AI, streaming and their effect on residual payments — and the four-month hiatus meant enormous delays or even cancellations for many shows.
But even with all of that, there were so many exciting series to watch this year that whittling down our bloated long-list was a hard task. So with heavy hearts, we decided to exclude returning seasons.
It is important to acknowledge the quality and impact of the third seasons of beloved series Hacks, The Bear and Somebody Somewhere; season two of Pachinko; season four of The Boys; the fifth season of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City; and the sixth and final season of vampire romp What We Do in the Shadows.
Even with the delays and disruptions, even with all of these already beloved shows crowding our plates, so many incredible new productions were made, released and enjoyed in 2024. Here were our faves.
The Sympathizer trailer
That The Sympathizer isn't more popular proves we're in a streaming glut.
It's an A24 and HBO adaptation of a Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel starring Sandra Oh and a post-Oscar-winning Robert Downey Jr., created by South Korean auteur Park Chan-wook (Oldboy, The Handmaiden and Decision to Leave). Five years ago, any one of these descriptors would have made it appointment TV; In 2024, it's a contender for the year's most slept-on shows.
The Sympathizer follows the Captain, a communist spy who remains undercover as a Southern army captain for decades after the Vietnam War, following refugees to Los Angeles to keep tabs on potential counter-revolutionary movements.
Played by Vietnamese Australian actor Hoa Xuande, the Captain's allegiances constantly shift — as the title shows, he's reluctant to be purely ideological, instead motivated by human connection.
Meet the Aussie star of The Sympathizer
Alternating between heightened satire and spy thriller, The Sympathizer is a meaty, literary show that challenges Western media's image of the Vietnam War — known in Vietnam, as the show points out, as the American War.
It's also slippery and silly, in large part because of Downey Jr. He dons various disguises to play four ridiculous characters, including a CIA agent, a congressman and a filmmaker shooting a war epic remarkably similar to Apocalypse Now — all interchangeable white antagonists, superficially opposed but ultimately part of the same anti-communist machine.

After The Party - trailer
Robyn Malcolm's award-winning performance in After The Party has stayed with me all year: A woman bruised by life but determined to stick to her morals, even as resentment attempts to rot the foundations of who she knows herself to be.
This provocative drama follows Penny who loses everything when she accuses her husband of a sex crime against her daughter's teenage friend, and no one believes her.
This six-part Kiwi drama is dark, morally complex and haunting, centring on a nightmare situation. Penny (Malcolm) stumbles upstairs during a party and spots her husband Phil (Peter Mullan) abusing a teenage boy, and accosts him in front of friends and family. Phil denies it, as does the boy, and everyone thinks Penny's made it up: But she knows what she saw. Right?
Years later, Phil returns to Wellington to help their daughter with her own child, and Penny has a choice: let it lie, or seek justice. While scratching the itch of a crime mystery, After The Party is a character study of a middle-aged woman made to feel invisible in a life that's out of her control, filled with plenty of tension-releasing cringe comedy.
While After The Party's nuanced depiction of abuse and justice is perfectly timed for a culture grappling with #MeToo's limits, the show's primary concern is what it means to be a good person, and whether thrashing towards the truth is worth the wreckage. You'll be thinking about Penny — and Malcolm's performance — for a long time.

Marvel Entertainment youtube: Marvel Television’s Agatha All Along | Official Trailer | Disney+
I have long told anyone who will listen that actor Kathryn Hahn is grossly under-appreciated. As the star of Agatha All Along, she finally gets to show us what she can do.
AAA is technically a sequel to WandaVision, Marvel's first foray into television. You don't have to watch WandaVision first (although it's a quite stunning show) — just know that things did not end amicably between Agatha (Hahn) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen).
The show starts out as a stereotypical crime procedural, with Hahn playing the grizzled detective, until the illusion is shattered by the appearance of a teenage boy with heavy eyeliner asking too many questions (Heartstopper's Joe Locke, with a shaky accent but an irresistible sweetness).
Then we discover that Agatha is actually a powerful witch who had a habit of violently stealing other people's magic, before being stripped of her powers (by Wanda) and made to forget who she is. Once reawakened, the boy convinces her to travel the mysterious Witches Road with him, so she can regain her power, and he can become the witch he's always dreamed of being.
They are accompanied by a coven of mismatched witches with their own motivations for travelling, including the black-hearted Rio (Aubrey Plaza, having so much fun), whose unresolved history with Agatha threatens to derail the whole journey. They soon find that the Witches Road consists of challenges designed to pick at their worst emotional wounds and also probably kill them, if they don't kill each other first.
The delicious sexual tension between Hahn and Plaza alone is enough of a reason to watch AAA, but this smart, dark, funny fantasy full of women acting their socks off will keep you guessing until the end.

Bodkin — official trailer
In Bodkin, a jaded journalist, her junior colleague and an overly enthusiastic American podcaster who do not get along arrive in a charming small town in West Cork, Ireland, with two jobs.
Number one: find out what happened to three people who went missing during the Gaelic festival of Samhain 20 years ago.
Number two: make a hit true crime podcast out of their discoveries.
However, none of the locals want anything to do with it, or them. And Gilbert (Will Forte) the podcaster, Dove (Siobhán Cullen) the reporter, and their research assistant Emmy (Robyn Cara) want extraordinarily different things out of the investigation.
Countless critics have compared Bodkin to Only Murders in the Building, with many saying it pales in comparison, and I'm not going to lie to you: Steve Martin and Martin Short are an irreplaceable comedy duo.
But Forte's Gilbert is more than passable as a Charles-Haden type, and the background characters in the rural town of Bodkin are just as quirky as Oliver. Plus, no-one does cynicism better than the Irish, so Cullen's sullen Dove is far more realistic than whatever Selena Gomez is going for as Mabel.
There's no word yet on a second season of Bodkin, but that's arguably a good thing: the series' first was brilliantly written, didn't require too much suspension of disbelief and was neatly tied up. The same cannot be said for Only Murders…

Trailer Check youtube: JERROD CARMICHAEL REALITY SHOW Official Trailer (2024) | HD
In the first 10 minutes of Jerrod Carmichael's Reality Show, the comedian sincerely sucks a man's toes on camera and it's not even the most uncomfortable thing that happens in the episode. The ""reality TV"" show follows Carmichael as he traverses his life post-Emmy win for Prothallial, his breakthrough 2022 Netflix special in which he came out as gay.
As cameras monitor him in his apartment, hanging out with friends and going to work, it's clear Carmichael is not the hero of his own story. We watch him repeatedly cheat on his first boyfriend, push his friend into revealing performances and lambaste his dad for fathering four children outside of his marriage. He also struggles to reconcile his unrequited feelings for none other than Tyler the Creator, who also appears in the show, and grapples with his mother's rejection of his homosexuality.
Carmichael's experiment in ""radical honesty"" features confessions and comments that you couldn't waterboard out of people, let alone convince them to capture on camera.
But Carmichael did, and in doing so he has created one of the most perversely transfixing displays of human relationships ever seen on TV.
Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show is stomach churning, devastating and hilarious in equal measure — but be wary of the existential crisis it may induce.

Official Trailer - Thou Shalt Not Steal
Australian TV hasn't had a show quite like Thou Shalt Not Steal: a provocative, irreverent and ultra-cheeky Western, set in 1980s Central and South Australia.
Created by director Dylan River with cousin Taninth Glynn-Maloney, the series follows Robyn (Sherry-Lee Watson, Heartbreak High), an Indigenous teenager who escapes juvenile detention to find her estranged dad.
Directed and co-created by Dylan River, Thou Shalt Not Steal is a zippy Western set around Alice Springs, with plenty of twists and laughs.
Teaming up with awkward teenager Gidge (fellow Heartbreak star Will McDonald), the two tear away in a stolen taxi. They're trailed by not only the police, but Gidge's preacher father, (Noah Taylor), and the taxi's owner, Maxine (Miranda Otto), a pimp with a panache for revenge.
Its eight episodes — all under 30 minutes — race by as the body count rises, while the script subtly peels back the layers on each character without slowing down on the action.
Easy to watch in one go, Thou Shalt Not Steal is filled with surprising twists, rich desert colours and characters, plus some ingenious lines, right from Robyn's first words: ""Them missionaries reckon thou shalt not steal. Bit rich from the Bible-bashing bastards that stole our country!""

Baby Reindeer trailer
So many words have been written this year about Richard Gadd's breakthrough series, Baby Reindeer. Most of them about the media storm that followed once callous internet sleuths doxxed the people at the centre of Gadd's heartbreaking story. The gasping need for outlets to continue the closed circle of Baby Reindeer in search of clicks threatened to eclipse the incredibly sensitive series.
At its core, Baby Reindeer is about the lengths we will go to for human connection. Gadd's failing comedian Donny entwines himself with unstable blow-in Martha (an incredible Jessica Gunning), leading to shattering consequences for both parties. There are no villains in Baby Reindeer, just two people that choose the path of most destruction in an attempt to remedy their aching loneliness.
Full of disarming performances and impactful writing that resulted in a trail of awards and accolades, Baby Reindeer pulled double duty in 2024 by not just being excellent TV, but by highlighting our impulse to sacrifice real people in order to satiate curiosity.

Binge youtube: Fantasmas | Official Trailer | BINGE
Absurd, unique and as whimsical as the perfect night out, Fantasmas is the latest oddball comedy from Julio Torres — the brains behind Los Espookys, Problemista and some of SNL's best sketches of recent years.
Torres, playing a version of himself, dreams of pitching a clear crayon at the Crayola factory, but finds his path to creative freedom stifled by bureaucracy. As an undocumented US immigrant, he first needs a Proof of Existence document, requiring more proof he does not have. But also, he lost a golden oyster-shaped earring at a nightclub, and maybe finding that is more important?
With help from an AI robot, Bibo, and performance artist Vanesja (not a typo, played by ethereal presence Martine Gutierrez), he goes down a colourful, near-nonsensical rabbit hole through a surreal version of New York.
While the absurdity heightens with cameos — ranging from Steve Buscemi as the letter Q, Julia Fox as Mrs Claus and producer Emma Stone as a Real-Housewife-like figure, among many many others — Fantasmas isn't just quirk.
Underneath the ridiculousness are characters all striving to be less alone and precarious in the cogs of capitalism. It can be quite touching, even if you're empathising with a letter: Such is Torres's gift.
While not for those who cringe at whimsy, this is exciting, bizarre TV that confounds and delights as you wonder how it was even made. (The answer is Stone, who also produced The Curse and I Saw The TV Glow.)

FX networks youtube: Shōgun - Official Trailer | Hiroyuki Sanada, Cosmo Jarvis, Anna Sawai | FX
The most beautiful TV series of 2024 is also the best drama of the year.
This adaptation of James Clavell's epic historical novel tells a fictionalised version of the founding of the Tokugawa shogunate, which ruled Japan from the early 1600s until the Meiji Restoration in 1868.
Fans of samurai and action genres will appreciate seeing Hiroyuki Sanada (John Wick 4, Bullet Train, 47 Ronin) finally playing a weighty lead role worthy of his talent, as the wily warlord and master strategist Lord Yoshii Toranaga, a character inspired by Tokugawa Ieyasu.
Shōgun is subtly acted and rich in detail, and rightfully swept the Emmys with 18 wins, including for Outstanding Drama, lead actor for Sanada and lead actress for Anna Sawai, who plays Lady Mariko, Toranaga's translator and loyal liege.
Cosmo Jarvis as marooned English sea pilot John Blackthorne completes Shōgun's trio of leads, playing the 'barbarian' outsider who becomes an unexpected, and sometimes reluctant, player in tactics and 17th century castle intrigue.
Naturally, the question of who is a ""barbarian"" — and from whose perspective — gets a run in this international series: is it the unwashed Englishman who's fond of rotted bird meat; the warring kimono-clad nobles who take lives on points of etiquette; or the Portuguese Catholic men of the cloth who've insinuated themselves into feudal Japan for religious, political and commercial gain?
Shōgun is a big budget visual feast that delivers what all good historical dramas do — the adrenaline-pump of epic battle scenes along with small moments of intimacy that drive emotional buy-in.
The stakes are well calibrated and delivered on such a level of quality and scale that each episode feels cinematic. This is a rare TV series that makes you feel rewarded for watching it.

ABC iview youtube: First Look | Guy Montgomery's Guy Mont Spelling Bee | ABC TV + iview
Funny people, silly gags and spelling? Sign me up!
Guy Montgomery's Spelling Bee is one of those wonderful shows that takes a not very important thing very seriously, somehow drawing you right in.
A brainchild of the Kiwi comedian during lockdown, it started as a YouTube series, and became a touring live comedy show before morphing into a kind of parody game show.
The comedian has been a mainstay of Australian TV for years, including on Thank God You're Here. Now he hosts his own comedy show.
On a 70s-style set of oranges and browns, a rotating cast of Australian comedians — some fresh talent, some very familiar — have to spell like their lives depend on it, all for the glory of being best speller, or just to avoid being forced to sit on a stool and wearing a literal dunce's hat.
The hysterically funny Aaron Chen ""helps"" the host, but is mostly a comedic foil, and the chemistry between the two comedians is a big part of this show's charm.
But it's the absurd, sharp-edged writing that makes Spelling Bee great. Whoever's in the writing room isn't afraid to let their verbose imagination fly when it comes to the clues and hints contestants can ask for; sometimes Montgomery himself seems caught off-guard.
There are a lot of laughs, and lots of opportunities to show off those primary school spelling skills to your loved ones, whether they like it or not.

Chimp Crazy — official trailer
In Chimp Crazy, we meet a woman who breastfed a premature chimpanzee, and another who loved a retired Hollywood actor/chimp so much that she faked his death because a judge ordered him to be sent to a sanctuary in Florida.
So, it's little wonder the latest creation from Tiger King director Eric Goode became HBO's most-watched docuseries in four years. Chimp Crazy is equal parts sensational, tragic, enlightening and thrilling.
Tonia, the aforementioned Missouri woman who did everything she could to keep her chimp Tonka in her care, is responsible for most of those descriptors.
As was the case with Tiger King, Goode uses Tonia's story as a springboard for important discussions on exotic animal ownership and welfare concerns across the four-part series.
Watch it for the wild cat-and-mouse game between Tonia, the US justice system and PETA. Watch it to see what happens when people try, and fail, to domesticate wild animals. Watch it for the captive apes with no agency over their lives. Just, watch it.

BBC youtube: NEW Official Doctor Who Season 1 Trailer 🔥 BBC
Confession time, I had never seen a single complete episode of Doctor Who until this year. But when it was announced that Sex Education's Ncuti Gatwa was going to be the brand-new iteration of the renowned Timelord, I couldn't resist giving it a go.
Surprise, surprise, I am now a full-blown convert.
Very early in the first episode of Gatwa's full season, he's seen dancing in a club, his kilt spinning joyously around him. It's queer joy, it's Black joy, it's Scottish joy, and it's a bit cheeky — which could be said for the entire show.
Our sidekick for this season is a young woman named Ruby Sunday (a sweet and scrappy Millie Gibson) who was abandoned outside a church on Christmas Eve before being taken in by a kindly adopted mother.
Once the Doctor stumbles upon her, she joins him on a rocketing adventure through time and space (with remarkably few questions) via the sparkling magic of the Tardis, having technicolour adventures involving everything from space babies to music-consuming demons to a delightful Bridgerton parody.
A more poised version of the man we came to love in Sex Education, Gatwa's smile glows off the screen, and he is an absolute master at the single devastating tear rolling down his cheek. Always dressed impeccably, his Doctor is also unapologetically queer, cracking jokes about his historic hook-ups (Harry Houdini anyone?).
This show is silly, camp and fun sci-fi, but also doesn't shy away from digging into really complex issues of race, the role of technology and grief. I cried in just about every ep.
And the good news is, once you've barrelled through this season, there's a brand-new Christmas Eve episode, featuring the one and only Nicola Coughlan.

Paramount+ Australia: Fake | Official Trailer | Premieres 4 July | Paramount+ Australian Original
In Fake, Asher Keddie — she of every beloved Australian TV show of the past 20 years, from Love My Way and Offspring through to ABC TV's Plum and The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart — plays Birdie, a freelance writer in her 40s who has been unlucky in love.
Her mum thinks she should be less picky. Anxious Birdie would probably argue she's not picky enough. That's when she meets architect-turned-grazier Joe, played by a somehow simultaneously charming yet slimy David Wenham (ABC TV's SeaChange; all the Australian movies worth watching).
Except something about Joe doesn't add up: he's always cancelling on Birdie at the last minute; his stories about his past don't seem to fit together; and then he skips out on her close friend's wedding, without even a word. Turns out Joe is not who he says he is.
Fake is inspired by a book by journalist Stephanie Wood, that collects and tells stories of women who have been bamboozled by the men they love. This includes a real-life version of Joe, who Wood dated and then was compelled to investigate.
Not only was this a sharp and compelling show, I walked away from watching Fake, and reading the book that inspired it, feeling more confident in my own pickiness.

Exposure - trailer
In a post-Big-Little-Lies landscape where every other show is a mystery thriller, Australian six-part drama Exposure deftly uses the genre's tropes to tell an immensely personal story.
Australian mini-series Exposure explores the ""total rage and desperation"" of a sexual assault survivor, inspired by true events.
Creator and writer Lucy Coleman wrote Exposure indirectly about an assault she experienced at age 22, exploring it through the protagonist, Jacs  — a photographer investigating the suicide of Kel, her housemate and best friend since childhood.
Played by Alice Englert, Jacs is searing with sadness and anger, imagining herself a vigilante who descends on her hometown of Port Kembla, trailing a range of men she believes could be somehow responsible. It's a visceral yet grounded performance, made all the more potent by the tenderness Jacs rejects from her mum (Essie Davis) and Kel's ex, Angus (Thomas Weatherall, Heartbreak High).
Jacs expresses her love with an iron fist, making Port Kembla — a beach town whose steel smokestacks destroy its meditative beauty — a perfect backdrop.
Unnerving, complex and quietly moving, Exposure cuts through the slog of similar fare with its raw power and deft, understated hand.

Nobody Wants This — official trailer
If Nobody Wants This hadn't made Jewish women the villains of this story, it would have been a perfect rom-com.
But it did, and so it would be better described as a frequently problematic, yet incredibly enticing rom-com… that still managed to be the genre's best of the year despite its myriad faults.
This was due to the delicious premise — an agnostic, shiksa sex podcaster named Joanne falls for a rabbi on the rebound called Noah — and impeccable casting.
The leading lady in Nobody Wants This is played by Kristen Bell, while her love interest is embodied by none other than Adam Brody.
And while more of the tension in their relationship comes from religion and outdated notions of Jewish-gentile relations than it perhaps should, Bell and Brody's chemistry is not only irresistible in the moment, but memorable months after the fact.
I've lost count of the number of friends who've lamented how long we're going to have to wait for the second season of Nobody Wants This. (I'm so sorry to tell you the only date we have so far is ""2025"").

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-20/raygun-musical-resolved-steph-broadbridge/104749522,Raygun says parody musical legal drama has been resolved,"Breakdancer Rachael ""Raygun"" Gunn says she has resolved a dispute with a comedian after her lawyers shut down a parody musical based on her Olympic journey.
Sydney comedian Steph Broadbridge cancelled her Raygun-inspired musical two weeks ago after receiving letters from the breakdancer's lawyers.
Raygun's lawyers claimed her name and the silhouette of her iconic kangaroo pose from Paris 2024 were protected intellectual property.
Hoping to put the online saga to rest, Ms Gunn posted a video statement on Instagram on Thursday night, saying her legal team and Ms Broadbridge's had come to an agreement.
""Hi everyone, it's been a big couple of weeks,"" Ms Gunn said in a video posted to Instagram.
""I'm not going to lie, it's been a wild ride but I'm really pleased to say we've resolved everything.
""My team's been working with Steph's team and we've managed to come to an agreement.""

The legal stoush was documented in a string of social media posts by the pair.
Ms Broadbridge on Thursday announced she would go ahead with a different ""completely legal parody musical""
It comes after Anthony Skinner, the owner of the club originally set to host the musical, said he had been invoiced $10,000 in legal fees by Ms Gunn's lawyers.
In legal letters from Ms Gunn's lawyers seen by the ABC, Mr Skinner was ordered to ""reimburse our client with legal costs to date which we estimate to be $10,000"".
Mr Skinner said he offered Ms Gunn $500 made in ticket sales but says it was rejected by lawyers.
The Olympic breaker says she had been ""blindsided"" by the musical and only heard about it through media reports.
Ms Gunn addressed this in her video, claiming that $10,000 charge was in anticipation of legal fees should the matter go to court.
""We have not sought any costs from all this. So there's a lot of talk around this $10,000 … that was from really early on, like, day one, my lawyers were acting on my behalf.
""They sent out letters and, you know, they asked for a response … by a certain time, they didn't hear a response. And you know, we were worried that we might have to go to court.
""Obviously, no one wants that, and so the $10k was would just be my potential legal costs if we had to go to court. But fortunately, we didn't.
""We're not seeking any costs, I've said before it's not about the money, and it is still not about the money. We've got no costs from them, not from Steph, not from the comedy club.""
Mr Skinner has been contacted for comment.
In her own Instagram statement published on Thursday evening, Ms Broadbridge apologised and acknowledged she did not contact Raygun before she created the title and poster of the original show, Raygun the Musical.
In a previous video, Ms Gunn said she had been ""blindsided"" by the news of the musical.

""It was never my intention to mislead people into thinking that she was involved in the production,"" Ms Broadbridge wrote.
""I am deeply sorry to learn that Raygun has faced negative backlash as a result of the media attention around the cancellation of the preview for the musical.
""The last thing I wanted was for anyone to experience hate or distress from this situation.""
Speaking with the Sydney Drive show, Ms Broadbridge said she had originally intended to have the show completed after the preview and invite Raygun to opening night.
""This is a totally new environment for me to be in and I just want to say, I am sorry for any hurt that was caused. I am certainly not doing that intentionally.""
Ms Broadbridge's reworked musical, Breaking The Musical, will be a ""fictional telling of a moment in Australian history"".
""It's about the sport, it's about the internet, it's about the entertainment industry,"" she told Sydney Drive.
""It's about a young Australian with a dream.
""I'm playing the lead so I've painted myself in a very good light.""
Ms Gunn said it had been a stressful time for herself and Ms Broadbridge.
""This has been a stressful time for me, and it's been tough for me, but I know that I'm not the only one,"" she added.
""I know that this has been tough for Steph, for you know, everyone in her show, and a lot of other people, and it's never been my intention to cause any hurt or distress.""",Georgie Hewson,Fri 20 Dec,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-19/drag-race-down-under-season-four/104732438,Drag Race Down Under's new season proves we never needed RuPaul,"It's unusual for a TV show to lose its biggest star and get better, but separating RuPaul from Drag Race Down Under has coincided with the series' best season yet.
Withdrawing from hosting the fourth season due to scheduling conflicts around promoting his memoir, RuPaul's absence could have been the death knell for the struggling local franchise.
It's regularly cited in fan rankings (and on IMDB) as among the worst of the more than 20 international editions of the reality TV franchise — Down Under queens Kween Kong and Hannah Conda competed on global editions this year just to prove our scene's talent.
But season four — which finishes on Friday — has taken the title shift (fka RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under) in stride by moving Ru's right-hand woman, Michelle Visage, into the centre seat, and revitalising the series in the process.

It's been a wonderful display of queer Antipodean irreverence: Where else will you get a lip-sync to the Young Divas? Or girl groups inspired by Olivia Newton-John? Impersonations of Gina Riley and Jane Turner? An insight into the tensions between Oxford Street and the ballroom community? Looks that take Leigh Bowery's floral dress to an even freakier level?
Not only are audiences leaving glowing reviews on social media, but the drag communities in Australia and New Zealand are also giving it a second chance, according to season one finalist Art Simone.
""Word on the street is that, now that we've seen the season and know it's a different beast, there's a lot more girls keen to audition,"" she says. ""After season three, they were like, 'Nah, what's the point?'""
While Australia's versions of Survivor, MasterChef, Alone and Married at First Sight have broken big overseas, Drag Race Down Under has struggled to make its mark.
The reception to a reality show may seem inconsequential, but Drag Race's cultural ubiquity means that Down Under colours the world's perception of Antipodean drag.
""It [also] needs to be there for other queer people to see people like them celebrated and visible,"" says Art. ""There's nothing more inspirational and beautiful than to be like, 'Oh, that person's like me'.""
The much-criticised premiere local season of the hit drag queen competition tells us much about the state of Australian media.
After almost a decade of near-starts, Down Under debuted in 2021 as a co-production between Stan, US Drag Race producers World of Wonder and TVNZ, with the series shooting in Auckland, featuring New Zealand queens alongside Australians.
It was the seventh version of the show and the third to feature RuPaul as host, with Visage — who has judged the US show since 2011 — and Australian comedian Rhys Nicholson rounding out the panel.
COVID-19 restrictions and a last-minute move to Auckland certainly didn't help, but a comparatively low budget, puzzling production choices and severe issues around representation and race meant we weren't leading with Down Under's best foot forward.

Subsequent seasons have better represented Australia and New Zealand's diverse drag community than season one's franchise-first, all-white top eight (there were 10 contestants).
Still, it's been a struggle.
While budget issues remained, the bigger issue is the series' struggle to tailor itself to Down Under drag's unique blend of camp, charisma and crass humour.
In the oddest episodes, challenges were either directly lifted from the US show, or pulled from bizarre reference points, such as choreographing a BMX-Bandit-themed dance with bikes. And if queens made jokes about The Wiggles, they risked a stone-faced reaction from Ru. In short, it didn't let its talented cast shine.
""There was a disconnect between the Australasian drag scene and the judging panel,"" says Art. ""Something was lost in translation.""
After wrapping filming this March, new host Visage told ABC Entertainment that season four focused on ""what makes Down Under drag special"".
Season four's cast features many veterans of the drag scene, resulting in stronger performances in challenges. (Supplied: Stan)
""It's more about the heart,"" she says. ""And it's more about integrity and performance than anything else. And it's with a twinkle in the eye and a wink-wink, nudge-nudge. They're always in on the joke.""
Visage said she was just there to facilitate, and ""help the cream rise to the top"".
""And I can't even tell you how fantastic this season is. You're going to be blown away by the talent.""
Season four's cast are queens of eclectic talents and backgrounds, with a focus on established names. The 10 run the gambit of local legends (Oxford Street steward Vybe; seamstress Mandy Moobs), the fan-demanded (dancer Max Drag Queen; professional kook Lazy Susan) and pleasant surprises, such as Nikita Iman, a powerful Aotearoa ballroom figure and competition front-runner who none of the cast recognised upon entrance.
In a touching moment, Nikita Iman (left) and her makeover challenge partner performed a traditional Samoan Siva dance on the main-stage. (Supplied: Stan)
In addition to their talents, the cast has given their all to the show on and off the stage. Just as memorable as Lazy Susan's constantly innovative runways has been Max's raw processing of her mother's death a month before filming, and Nikita's moving realisation that she is fa'afafine, a Samoan third gender.
""They all knew [there was a sense of] this is our last chance for the franchise,"" says Art. ""They're giving it one more go. Let's make it count. Let's make it stand out.
""They also seem to be uplifting each other where possible, which is helping them all do really well. On some episodes, I didn't know who they'd send home.""
Lazy Susan's outfit for a Liquid-Dreams-themed runway featured a dress that changed colour when wet, and a functioning tap in her beehive wig. (Supplied: Stan)
Season four seems to be better set up for the cast to succeed, Art says.
That's not necessarily through Ru's absence, but with a third judging panel spot opening up, the show has invited a rotating cast of Down Under winners to join — a world-first for the franchise.
(Reallocating Ru's associated costs elsewhere into the budget certainly helped too, with a noticeable upgrade to the set and lighting.)
Art Simone says season four's success is, in large part, due to the introduction of Down Under alumn, such as Spankie Jackzon (pictured), on the judges panel.  (Supplied: Stan)
""The exciting thing to me this season is the addition of actual ridgy-didge drag queens on the panel having voices and opinions,"" says Art. ""It's just so nice to see drag queens judging drag queens. But it makes sense — it's like, 'Why haven't we done this before?!'
""It really adds a big family sense to the show, and that's really helped.""
Visage agrees: ""They've walked the walk, they've been in their shoes, quite literally. It's amazing to have them, and they all bring something different.""
Art Simone (pictured) hosts her own unofficial — and brutally honest — Down Under recap series, Kick Ons, on Youtube. (Supplied: Art Simone)
Plus, with Nicholson there and the guest panel spot filled mostly by local celebrities, Visage is the lone American fish out of water. The queens' cultural references land, and there's simply less pressure.
""The queens are so much more comfortable and relaxed,"" says Art.
Regardless of which finalist wins this Friday, the cast of Down Under season four can stand tall.
Art hopes the strong showing means the series continues, hopefully giving voices to a wider net of the drag community — including drag kings, trans and assigned-female-at-birth performers.
""The drag bit is the fun bit right?"" Art says.
""The runway and the glitter and the sassiness, that's the fun bit, but at the heart of it, Drag Race is about telling queer stories. And we have so many more to tell.""

After a seven-year hiatus, which included becoming a publican in Wyong, the 46-year-old musical theatre actress has returned to the stage, this time with a whole new legion of fans.
Ms McQueen plays Celine Dion in the musical Titanique, based on the 1997 film Titanic, with the twist being Celine Dion tells the story through her songs.
""About 200 people from Wyong have come down to see the show so far,"" Ms McQueen said.
""Every week there's more and more.""

It has been a case of life imitating art for the publican.
She once played the role of Marion in the stage production of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.
The character runs a pub in a county town and encourages her friends to perform shows to bring a level of culture to the venue.
""I never thought this would become my real life, but when [my husband] Frank suggested we buy a pub, I was absolutely up for the adventure,"" Ms McQueen said.
The experience of running a pub has come with lessons that transition to the stage.
""Whether at the front bar of a pub or watching a show at the Sydney Opera House, everyone has the same needs,"" Ms McQueen said.

She said the venue had changed and patrons had enjoyed the injection of culture in what was once more of a ""rough and tumble"" style of venue.
Wyong resident Trish Doyle said she would never have dreamed of setting foot in the pub until she heard about Ms McQueen's Friday night cabaret shows.
""We started going to the shows and having the best of times and you walked out of there on such a high,"" Ms Doyle said.
""I don't think it [the pub] used to have entertainment other than lingerie waitresses on a Friday night and it wasn't a place that I was interested in.""
Ms McQueen has had to step away from the pub to perform eight shows a week in Sydney.
""I never imagined that I would be playing Celine Dion but it kind of just popped up,"" she said.

""I didn't know if I was going to get back into the theatre. Frank and I have been so busy at the pub since we took it over.
""I was thinking, 'How am I going to get back on the stage?' and it just seemed like the timing actually turned out to be perfect.""
Marney McQueen was inspired by Barry Humphreys. (Supplied: Marney McQueen)
Ms McQueen is also part of an all-star cast performing in the ABC’s A (Very) Musical Christmas stage show, which supports Beyond Blue.
She said she was passionate about charity work, having raised more than $250,000 for Central Coast charities through events at her pub.
But she said she was most proud of the ""unofficial"" community work that happened in her pub's front bar.
""There was a guy who drinks in the front bar regularly, he lives week to week and people became aware that this man had grandchildren who live in Queensland and he had never met them because he couldn't afford to get to Queensland and his daughter couldn't afford to bring the three grandkids down to meet him,"" she recalled.
""So everybody passed the hat around to get enough money so he could go to Queensland to meet his grandchildren and he came back a new man.
""I have loved getting to know all of our regulars and hearing their stories and realising that while some of them might have a tough exterior most of them have the biggest, kindest, most generous hearts of all.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-19/john-marsden-no-biological-children-raised-generations/104744354,John Marsden had no biological children but raised generations of kids,"""Does anyone read your letters or can I write anything I want?""
That question, from 15-year-old Tracey to her pen pal Mandy in John Marsden's 1991 novel Letters from the Inside, so captured my imagination when I was kid, I posed the same question to my own pen pal.
Her response was similar to Mandy's.
""What do you mean, does anybody read my letters?""
Marsden nailed the language of teenagers in the novel, the curiosity, the angst and, as I would later write about in my own book, what it's like when you're a young person who cares about another young person who is incarcerated.
Letters from the Inside resonated with me, spoke to me, had impact and as a consequence, Marsden's other books were ones I sought out as a young adult.
Marsden, the acclaimed multi-award-winning Australian author who sold millions of books, and school principal who founded two schools, has died. He was 74.
John Marsden leaves behind an incredible legacy. (ABC News: Dave May)
In 2004, journalist and author George Negus interviewed Marsden on George Negus Tonight on ABC TV and described him as ""one of Australia's most simultaneously popular and controversial authors"".
""With no children of his own, along the way, John has copped a fair bit of flak,"" Negus said.
""'Unqualified to write about or for teenagers,' some critics argue. 'A dangerous influence on impressionable minds,' say others.
In Letters from the Inside, Marsden wrote about juvenile detention — Tracey was writing letters from inside jail, and I can't remember any other books I was exposed to as a young reader offering that perspective.
Marsden wrote books that resonate with young people. (ABC News: Dave May)
Common among his novels — Marsden wrote more than 40 in his lifetime — are protagonists who are children and young adults with depth and strength.
Marsden gave his characters the type of agency and power he felt was beyond his own reach when he was growing up.
Born in Melbourne the third of four children, Marsden moved home every four years because of his bank manager father's work.
In 1956, Marsden's father was transferred to Devonport in Tasmania, where Marsden attended Devonport Primary School.
""The best being Mrs Scott in Grade 4 who encouraged writing and creativity and created this wonderful warm and supportive atmosphere.
""And I really flourished in there and first enjoyed writing for its own sake, I guess, and loved reading all the time.""
By the time he was 10, the family had moved to Sydney where Marsden attended The King's School, Australia's oldest independent school, for the remainder of his schooling.
""It was a strange place to be. It was a very complex place,"" Marsden said.
""It was an island of 800 teenage boys and a number of teachers, many of whom had been there for decades and some of whom were abusive and violent, and others were gentle and intelligent and liberal.""
It was during these teenage years that Marsden came up with the idea of his bestselling Tomorrow series.
""I was 15 and sitting in school, fantasising about a world without adults, because pretty much all the adults I encountered were authoritarian, were not interested in fairness or justice, they lacked compassion, they lacked imagination and they were really a bloody nuisance,"" he told the ABC's Dave May and Richard Mockler on Throwback, a series revisiting the creatives who shaped Australian childhoods.
Marsden's seven-book Tomorrow series, starting with the 1993 novel Tomorrow, When the War Began, portrays the invasion of Australia by a foreign power.
It was adapted to film in 2010 and a TV series in 2016.
Tomorrow, When The War Began was released as a movie in 2010. (film-book.com)
On ABC TV's 2018 Q&A program Stranger Than Fiction, audience member Elishka Josipovic asked Marsden, a panellist, whether we'd raised a generation in fear of invasion through his Tomorrow series and movie adaptation.
""I hope not, Elishka"" Marsden replied.
""It was written 20 or so years ago when no-one talked about the security of Australia.
""I wouldn't write that book now — not because of a societal view but because of my own horror at the way refugees who have come to Australia have been treated.
""When I see people who arrive here legitimately seeking refuge and shelter, and they are treated as the scum of the Earth and they are sentenced to awful detention and sometimes death by both major political parties without any apparent scruples or conscience … then that would put me in a very different position … because demonising people like that is unforgivable and it's disgusting.""
Author Michael Mohammed Ahmad, also on the Q&A panel, pushed back.
""I remember growing up in the Western suburbs of Sydney where there was tremendous xenophobia towards Vietnamese-Australian communities,"" Ahmad said.
""With all due respect, the language of the book and the implications in the book genuinely impacted and damaged the lives of a lot of the young people that I grew up around.
""And for me, reading, it's not about the ability to put words together, it's about the ability to pull words apart.
""When I pulled the words apart in the Tomorrow series I did interpret a paranoid, white nationalist fantasy about a group of coloured people illegally invading this country, and I always find that narrative deeply ironic because that's what the white population did to the Indigenous population.""
Marsden told Ahmad and the audience that he was fine with people reacting to his work in whatever ways they wanted to.
It's no reaction at all that would bother him.
Marsden was the founder of two schools in regional Victoria where he served as principal — an alternative primary school, Candlebark School, in Romsey which he started in 2006, and Alice Miller School, an arts-focused secondary school in Macedon, which he opened in 2016.

Marsden told the ABC he started Candlebark after contemplating what a good school would look like, then coming to the realisation that he needed to start one himself.
Marsden had six stepsons he cared for from his wife Kristin's previous marriage, but raised generations more.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-17/popeye-tintin-hemingway-faulkner-public-domain-2025/104734968,Popeye and Tintin enter the public domain in 2025,"Pop open a can of spinach and grab a furry friend because Popeye and Tintin are among the classic comic characters becoming part of the public domain in the US.
This means these two iconic characters, who first appeared in 1929, can be used and repurposed without permission or payment to copyright holders from next year.
It comes after the landmark entrance of (one version of) Mickey Mouse into the public domain in last year's release.
But this year will still include a range of influential works whose 95-year copyright maximum is about to expire.
Here is a look at the 2025 list.
Popeye the Sailor, known for chomping down spinach and packing a punch, was created by EC Segar.
He made his first appearance in the newspaper strip ""Thimble Theater"" in 1929 with his first words being ""'Ja think I'm a cowboy?"" when asked if he was a sailor.

The infamous sailor was supposed to be a one-off appearance but he became permanent and the strip was renamed Popeye.
In 1933, Popeye first appeared in animation, featuring his theme song and Betty Boop doing the hula hoop.
However, similarly to Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh, only the earliest version of Popeye is free to reuse from January 2025.
This means the element of his spinach obsession is not part of the public domain, as it was not a part of his initial character makeup.
His distinctive mumble voice will also remain under copyright, along with the 1980 film starring Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall as his oft-fought-over sweetheart Olive Oyl.
Also included in next year's line-up is Belgian artist Hergé's creation Tintin, which followed the adventures of a young reporter and his wire fox terrier Snowy.

The comics were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century and first appeared in the US in 1929.
But its signature bright colours — including Tintin's red hair — did not appear until years later and could be the subject of legal disputes.
And in much of the world, Tintin will not become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator.
Although the next decade will see a collection of major movies entering the public domain, the early works of some major figures will join the public domain from next year.

Alfred Hitchcock's film Blackmail was made in Britain a decade before his renowned Hollywood movies like Psycho and Vertigo.
The film started off silent but shifted to sound during production, resulting in two different versions.
One of those versions became the UK's — and Hitchcock's — first sound film.
Oscar-winner John Ford, whose later Westerns would put him among film's most vaunted directors, also made his first foray into sound with 1929's The Black Watch.
The 1928 black and white animated version of Mickey Mouse is now free for people to use after 95 years.
The first sound film to win the Oscar for best picture, The Broadway Melody, will also become public.
The melodrama Dynamite, musical comedy The Cocoanuts and a dozen more of Mickey Mouse's earliest animations are also on the list.
Songs from the last year of the Roaring Twenties, also known as the Jazz Age, will also become public property.
Cole Porter's compositions What Is This Thing Called Love? and Tiptoe Through the Tulips are among the highlights, along with Fats Waller and Harry Brooks's jazz classic Ain't Misbehavin.
Singin' in the Rain, which has become synonymous with the 1952 Gene Kelly film, made its debut in the 1929 movie The Hollywood Revue and will also be public domain.

Different laws regulate sound recordings and those newly in the public domain date to 1924.
They include a recording of Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen from civil rights icon Marian Anderson and Rhapsody in Blue performed by composer George Gershwin.
Nobel Prize-winner William Faulkner's novel The Sound and the Fury will also become free to use.
Despite being famously difficult for readers, it was a sensation after its publication and used multiple non-linear narratives to tell the story of a prominent family's ruin in Mississippi.
Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms also joins his earlier The Sun Also Rises in the public domain.

The partly autobiographical story of an ambulance driver in Italy during World War I cemented Hemingway's status in the American literary canon.
It has been frequently adapted for film, TV and radio, which can now be done without permission.
John Steinbeck's first novel, A Cup of Gold from 1929, is also on the list, along with British novelist Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own.

Let us get you caught up.
Singer Paula Abdul has settled her year-long legal battle with former co-worker and British television producer Nigel Lythgoe in a California court.
""This has been a long and hard-fought personal battle,"" Abdul said in a concluding statement.
""I hope my experience can serve to inspire other women, facing similar struggles, to overcome their own challenges with dignity and respect, so that they too can turn the page and begin a new chapter of their lives.""
The co-creator and executive producer of So You Think You Can Dance, said he was dedicating his time to ""clearing my name"" following three separate sexual assault lawsuits.
Abdul launched legal action against Lythgoe last December, alleging that he had sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions while working together on popular reality shows American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance.
The singer alleged that Lythgoe first assaulted her during auditions for an early season of American Idol. Abdul said Lythgoe groped her in the elevator of their hotel after a day of filming and ""began shoving his tongue down"" her throat. Abdul pushed him away and ran to her hotel room when the elevator doors opened.
""In tears, Abdul quickly called one of her representatives to inform them of the assault,"" the lawsuit says, ""but ultimately decided not to take action for fear that Lythgoe would have her fired.""
The lawsuit alleges a similar incident occurred after she became a judge on So You Think You Can Dance alongside Lythgoe in 2015.

Abdul launched legal action against Lythgoe in the final days of California's Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act — legislation that allowed people to launch certain sexual abuse lawsuits that would otherwise have fallen outside the statute of limitations.
Abdul filed a notice of settlement in a Los Angeles court but the terms were not revealed.
In his own statement, Lythgoe said he was ""glad to be able to put this behind me"".
""We live in a troubling time where a person is now automatically assumed to be guilty until proven innocent, a process that can take years … I know the truth and that gives me great comfort,"" he said.
Lythgoe stepped down as a So You Think You Can Dance judge in January 2024 after two more anonymous women sued the 75-year-old for sexual battery. A similar lawsuit from a fourth woman was brought against Lythgoe in March.
And Just Like What? Actor and publisher Sarah Jessica Parker will be a judge for next year's Booker Prize, one of the world's most prestigious literary awards.

Parker, famous for playing magazine columnist Carrie Bradshaw in the long-running Sex and the City series and films, has been adding literary strings to her bow since 2017, when she became an editorial director at UK marketing company Hogarth.
She began to wonder what else she could do, and in 2020 launched her own imprint, SJP Lit, with a mission to publish ""sweeping, expansive, thought-provoking, and discussion-driven stories that are inclusive of international and under-represented voices"".
Parker has described her appointment as Booker judge as ""the thrill of a life"", ""a golden ticket"" and a nice distraction from Big moving to Paris.
Former prize winner Roddy Doyle will chair the 2025 panel, whose other judges — the Samantha, Miranda, Charlotte and Che Diaz to SJP's Carrie, if you will — include award-winning Nigerian writer Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀; British broadcaster and literary critic Chris Power; and American novelist and Booker-longlisted author Kiley Reid.
RIP, the Sony Spider-Man universe (SMU), we hardly knew you.
Oh, what's the SMU you ask? It's the spin-off universe full of C-list Spidey characters Sony owns but couldn't actually feature the web slinger because he's the property of Marvel/Disney.
The Wrap reported last week that Sony was looking to shut down its flailing franchise after a string of films that failed to connect with critics or audiences (Morbius anyone? How about Madame Web?) to focus on the Spider-Man films they share with Marvel.
The decision to ditch the SMU was further concreted after the opening weekend of Sony's long-delayed super villain-action film, Kraven the Hunter, starring Aaron Taylor Johnson's abs.

Kraven pulled in a paltry $US11 million in North America, making it the worst domestic opening for any SMU film. To add insult to injury, the film is currently sitting on a 15 per cent Rotten Tomatoes rating.
The film was originally slated for release in October 2023 before getting delayed to January 2024 before getting tangled up with the SAG/AFTRA strikes and being delayed to August 2024 before getting delayed until December 2024 so as to not be in direct competition with other Sony releases.
To rub salt into the injury, all these changes caused the budget to balloon from a reported $US90 million to $US110 million.
But hey, we'll always have Morbin' Time.
Hollywood star Jamie Foxx has taken to Instagram to thank fans after an incident at his birthday left him injured.
The actor and comedian required stitches after an altercation involving glass while celebrating his birthday in Los Angeles over the weekend.
Last week, Foxx, 57, released a Netflix special addressing a mystery illness that left him hospitalised for weeks in 2023.
The Oscar and Grammy winner said what started out as a headache in April 2023 resulted in ""a brain bleed that led to a stroke"".
He explained the mantra that helped him be resilient during the illness: ""If I can stay funny, then I can stay alive.""
Foxx sprinkled in a few musical numbers during the special, in which he thanked God and spoke about how grateful he was to his family, who shielded him from the media.
He also reflected on how close he was to not making it through the medical episode alive.
""I don't remember 20 days,"" he said.
Lil Timmy Tim is leaning into his role as Bob Dylan in the upcoming biopic, A Complete Unknown, and hey, considering it's got him in award's season talks we can't blame him.

Those were the words uttered by people who just happened to be at Sydney Harbour on Thursday as 300 Squid Game guards dressed in pink marched along the shore.
The guards were escorting Young-hee — the Red Light, Green Light doll from the Netflix series and global sensation Squid Game — to Luna Park Sydney.
While for some it was a chance encounter, others were there to sample Squid Game: The Experience before it opens to crowds Saturday.

Fans of the series can compete against each other, either in groups or solo, for a grand prize.
The prize won't be billions of won. Nor will the consequences be as deadly as they were in the TV show, but participants will get to play a series of games including Red Light Green Light, Ddakji, Marbles, and Memory Steps.

There have already been Squid Game events held at select locations around the world including London and Edinburgh, Paris, the World Premiere in Seoul, and here at home in Melbourne.
When the South Korean drama Squid Game premiered in 2021, it fast became Netflix's most popular title.
The first season followed 456 people who were in debt and desperate for cash, playing children's games for a massive cash prize.
Lose, however, and you're eliminated. Literally.
The series was watched by more than 142 million households and amassed 1.65 billion viewing hours in its first four weeks.

It was nominated for 14 Emmys and won six, becoming the first non-English-speaking series to receive nominations and win at the awards show.
Season 2 has already been nominated for Best Drama at the upcoming Golden Globes despite not airing yet.

Co-written by Arena, a former Young Talent Time cast member, about the ""enormous frustration"" she experienced ""making the transition from child star to adult"", Chains was released as the lead single on her 1994 album Don't Ask.
Now, it's among the 2024 additions to the National Film and Sound Archive's (NFSA) Sounds of Australia registry.
The NFSA said the emotionally-charged song became a career-defining moment for Arena, peaking at number four on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, number six in the UK, and 38 on the US Billboard Hot 100.
""Celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, Chains is one of the most recognisable recordings in this year's Sounds of Australia capsule, and one of the most iconic and successful power ballads by Tina Arena,"" NFSA Sounds of Australia curator Nick Henderson said.
""Building up from a pop groove intro through to its rockier climax, this single and its associated album, Don't Ask, propelled Arena onto the international stage.""
YT: Kickin' To the Undersound by Sound Unlimited (1992)
Since 2007, the NFSA has invited public nominations of audio recordings with cultural, historical and aesthetic significance and relevance, which inform or reflect life in Australia.
The voting panel of industry and NFSA sound experts considers everything from popular songs and speeches, to advertising jingles and nature calls — as long as it's at least 10 years old.
This year's final 10 also features the original Doctor Who theme music, composed by Australian Ron Grainer (1922-1981) in 1963 for the BBC TV series of the same name.
It's believed to be the first electronic music theme for television and was realised by English musician Delia Derbyshire (1937-2001).
Derbyshire created each note individually by cutting, splicing, speeding and slowing segments of analogue tape recordings of white noise, a test-tone oscillator, and a single plucked string.
Mr Henderson said the theme is ""an absolutely iconic sound"".
""Anyone who's engaged with pop culture, science fiction or TV over the past decades can't help but respond to this recording,"" he said.
""Even people who aren't into Doctor Who immediately recognise the theme music and the TARDIS noise at the start.
""It's been part of the series throughout its 60-plus-year history — what is continuous and consistent across all the variations of the theme tune over the decades is Ron Grainer's melody, with all re-arrangements since then based on his score.""
The original Doctor Who theme music from 1963, by composer Ron Grainer and musician Delia Derbyshire.
Mr Henderson said the original theme speaks to the broader significance of electronic music, and its involvement with pop culture.
""The theme tested out pre-synthesiser techniques that would go on to be used by many people later on. We take these sounds for granted now, but they were groundbreaking in their day.
""It's also a testament to the work of Delia Derbyshire at the BBC Radiophonic workshop, who realised the sounds that Ron Grainer envisaged, but couldn't create because they hadn't yet been invented!""
The now-iconic 1968 advertisement for Carton & United Breweries' Victoria Bitter (VB), which insisted ""a hard-earned thirst needs a big cold beer"", also made the cut.
Mr Henderson said the VB 'Big cold beer' ad had been used with minimal changes for more than 50 years.
""With John Meillon's raw and honest style delivering rhyming couplets, like 'you can get it rolling, you can get it bowling', repeated throughout, the ad seems to have imprinted on the Australian psyche, and people immediately then recall the concluding line, 'a hard-earned thirst needs a big cold beer'.
""Meillon passed away in 1989 but his voice has continued to be used with the permission of his family, with new TV ads produced to the original voice recordings.""
The last call of the Christmas Island Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus murrayi) was recorded in 2009.
As the first Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Australian to use recorded sound to document Aboriginal culture, Jimmie Barker's (1900-1972) pioneering work from 1968 to 1972 has also been included, along with the last known recording of the now-extinct Christmas Island Pipistrlle, a three-gram microbat endemic to Christmas Island.
""These new additions to the NFSA's Sounds of Australia capsule, ranging from landmark speeches to iconic theme music, from enduring pop to the sad, final call of a now-extinct species, are collectively a testament to the power of audio,"" said Meagan Loader, the NFSA's Chief Curator.
""It's very meaningful to be able to preserve this diversity of content so that future generations will be able to understand and appreciate the sounds and their stories that resonated with Australians in 2024.""
There are now 196 items in the Sounds of Australia archive, including the nation's earliest known recording from 1896.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-09/ruby-slippers-wizard-of-oz-barry-keoghan-sabrina-carpenter/104700832,Stolen ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in Wizard of Oz sell for $43 million,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recap the pop culture and entertainment news you might have missed over the past few days.
Let us get you caught up.
Wicked may have made a squillion (approx.) dollars at the box office, but The Wizard of Oz is still raking in the cash, after Judy Garland's original ruby slippers went under the hammer over the weekend.
Originally valued at $4.7 million, the slippers exceeded that price within seconds of bidding at Dallas-based Heritage Auctions, eventually selling to an unidentified buyer for an eye-watering $43 million.
After forking out the winning bid and auction house fees, the buyer is expected to pay a total of $50.8 million for the slippers.
The aged footwear are one of four remaining pairs worn by Garland during the filming of the 1939 classic film. But these are the only pair that were, up until a few years ago, at large.

Back in 2005, the slippers were stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota after thief Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash his way into the museum and the slippers' display case.
A US man who has confessed to stealing a pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore while filming The Wizard of Oz receives no jail time but will pay a $US23,000 fine.
They remained missing until 2018, when they were located during an FBI sting operation. Martin wasn't revealed as the thief until 2023, when he was indicted on one count of theft of a major artwork. Then in his 70s, in a wheelchair and on supplementary oxygen, Martin pleaded guilty and was sentenced to time served in January.
Martin's attorney, Dane DeKrey, said ahead of sentencing that Martin was convinced by an associate with mob connections that the shoes were adorned with real rubies, justifying their $1.5 million insurance.
When a fence — a person who buys stolen goods — later told Martins the jewels were actually glass, Martins got rid of the shoes.
The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77 was indicted in March in connection to the crime. The indictment alleged that he ""received, concealed, and disposed of an object of cultural heritage"" while knowing that the slippers were stolen goods.
He was also indicted on a count of witness tampering, after he threatened to release a woman's sex tape and ""take her down with him"" if she didn't keep quiet about the slippers.
Saliterman, also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance, is scheduled to go on trial in January 2025.

The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael Shaw, who had loaned them to the Judy Garland museum.
The museum confirmed via Facebook that they had not been the successful bidders for the slippers, despite raising money for the auction at their annual Judy Garland festival earlier in the year.
In further Oz news, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande shared their side of a bizarre, nonsensical Wicked press tour video that went viral last month, with the actors admitting they were also at a loss during the chat.
An interview by Out Magazine journalist Tracy Gilchrist captivated the internet in November, as Gilchrist told Erivo and Grande that ""people are taking the lyrics of [Wicked song] Defying Gravity and really holding space with that and feeling power in that.""
The video — which includes Erivo in near-tears, Grande holding one of her co-star's fingers in support and Gilchrist revealing she'd seen ""a couple of posts"" — quickly became a meme.
Speaking to Variety this weekend, Grande and Erivo reflected on the moment.
""So, I didn't know what any part of it meant,"" Grande says. ""I didn't understand the first sentence, and then I definitely didn't understand how you responded. And I just wanted to be there. Because I knew something big was happening, and I didn't know how to be there.""
After more than 20 years of raging success on stage, the origin story of the Wicked Witch of the West has finally made it to the big screen. And the lush, visual spectacular does not disappoint.
Erivo explained she was emotional at the idea of people 'holding space' with Defying Gravity's lyrics, but then confused by the admission that it was merely a few posts, which Gilchrist attributed to being in ""queer media"".
""I honestly didn't know what that meant — am I also in queer media, maybe?,"" says Erivo. ""Work! Let's both be there.""
Grande also offered her thought process behind the finger-grab: ""I'm going to grab this, because she looks like you might need something. I don't know what the tapping was about.""
The two say they're delighted by the interview's virality (as is Gilchrist, who has poked fun at herself). ""I feel really relieved that the world had the same experience with this moment that I did, because I felt like, 'Oh, I'm not broken',"" says Grande.
Hold space and watch their delightful reaction — featuring Wicked director Jon M. Chu — below.
2024 was truly the year of celebrities telling overzealous ""fans"" to back the f off.
Academy-award-nominated actor Barry Keoghan issued a lengthy statement on X, formerly Twitter, asking people to be ""respectful"" following his break-up with pop-star Sabrina Carpenter.
The two celebs have been engaged in a high-profile relationship for a majority of the past year, with Keoghan accompanying Carpenter to the Met Gala and starring in the music video for her single 'Please, Please, Please'.

Shortly after news broke that the pair had split, rumours started to circulate that it was due to cheating on his part, which Keoghan denied in his statement.
""I can only sit and take so much. My name is being dragged across the internet in ways I usually don't respond to,"" Keoghan said.
The Saltburn star said he felt compelled to address the situation as there are ""too many lines being crossed"", revealing that people had been ""knocking on his grannie's door"" and ""sitting outside my baby boy's house intimidating them"".
""Each and every day I work harder to push myself on every level to be the healthiest and strongest person for that boy,"" he said.
With pop superstar Chappell Roan speaking out repeatedly against ""creepy"" behaviour from fans, we unpack what celebrities do and don't owe their audiences.
""I want him to be able to look up to his daddy, to have full trust in me and know I will have his back no matter what. I need you to remember he has to read ALL of this about his father when he is older.""
Keoghan shares a two-year-old son with dental nurse Alyson Kierans — the pair broke up in mid-2023 shortly before he started seeing Carpenter.
""The messages I have received no person should ever have to read them. Absolute lies, hatred, disgusting commentary about my appearance, character, how I am as a parent and every other inhumane thing you can imagine,"" Keoghan said, while revealing that he had deactivated his Instagram account.
Here's to people having better boundaries in 2025.
Haliey Welch is on minute 14 of her 15 minutes of fame and it shows.
The 22-year-old Tennessee native went viral as the ""Hawk Tuah"" girl earlier this year, so-named for her eloquent explanation of a salivary secret that drives her male companions wild.
Welch has done many things to ensure her cultural capital stays high, including creating the Talk Tuah podcast and a line of merch, but now she's messing with people's actual capital, fans are accusing her of manipulating them.
Last week, Welch launched her own Hawk Tuah digital coin — largely interpreted as a memecoin, a form of cryptocurrency that is mostly seen as a form of entertainment due to its highly volatile and unserious nature.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
Hyped up by Welch, the coin hit a market cap of $US490 million ($765 million) shortly after its launch on Wednesday, but fell to $US60 million ($95 million) within 20 minutes.
Some observers have accused Welch and her team of running a ""pump and dump"" scheme: where the promoters of a coin hype up the price before launch, then sell for a profit.
YouTube cryptocurrency investigator Coffeezilla, real name Stephen Findeisen, confronted Welch on an X live stream, calling it one of the ""most miserable launches"" he had seen.
""Are you profiting from a rug pull?"" Findeisen asked, referring to when crypto promoters will entice buyers only to halt trading and take off with investors' money.
Welch has denied that her team sold any of the tokens they owned in a post to X, which was echoed by OverHere, the team behind the Hawk cryptocurrency.
So, really, the only winners in this situation are those who had ""Hawk Tuah girl crypto currency scam"" on their 2024 bingo cards.
As we draw towards the end of the year, one of television's most time-honoured traditions is almost here: the Christmas special.
Doctor Who got its very first special in 2005, when it rebooted with David Tennant, and has since become an annual staple. In keeping with tradition, last year's festive ep — 'The Church on Ruby Road' — was used to hard-launch the 15th Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa.
Gatwa's season of extraterrestrial adventure was a gorgeous delight. He is the funny, stylish, eccentric, queer, black doctor the world needs right now (not to mention his Oscar-worthy command of a single teardrop running down his cheek).
To cap off another tough year for Planet Earth, The Doctor is giving us a little extra gift in this year's special episode. The one and only Nicola Coughlan, rounding up her victory lap of a year, will be accompanying the Doctor on his festive, interstellar adventure. I simply can’t wait.

Raygun: The Musical was set to debut in Sydney on Saturday evening at a venue on Oxford Street, in the city's inner east.
Broadbridge had billed the show as ""the inspiring story of a groundbreaking breakdancer and new global sensation"".
But she announced on Instagram on Saturday that the premiere wouldn't go ahead, after Raygun's lawyers claimed her name and iconic kangaroo dance move were protected intellectual property.
""Raygun's lawyers got in touch with the venue and threatened legal action,"" Broadbridge said in the Instagram video, offering refunds for the tickets.
In a statement to the ABC, Gunn's management agency Born Bred Talent said it wanted to make sure the breakdancer's brand remained ""strong and respected"".
Here's more what what the agency had to say:
""While we have immense respect for the credible work and effort that has gone into the development of the show, we must take necessary steps to safeguard Rachael's creative rights and the integrity of her work.
""This action is not intended to diminish the contributions of others, but rather to ensure her brand is properly represented and protected in all future endeavours.""
Broadbridge said the lawyers told her she was ""damaging"" breakdancer Rachael Gunn's brand, and joked, ""She doesn't need me to do that"".
""They were very concerned that people would think that Rachel Gunn was affiliated with the musical. I want to assure everyone she will not be part of the show. She's very welcome to come. I would love for her to see it,"" she said.
""They also said I wasn't allowed to do the dance, because she owns the kangaroo dance.
But Broadbridge assured theatregoers the show would go on at a later date.
She said she would change the main character's name in the show to Raygun with an ""I"" in it, and added in the caption ""we will be back soon and with a whole new story arc"".
Anthony Skinner, who heads up the show's promoter ID Comedy Club, said IP lawyers working for Gunn threatened to take the production to court ""tomorrow"" with a lawsuit if they didn't cancel the show.
He told the ABC an offer to remove ""infringing properties"", including the name Raygun and a silhouette pose of the breakdancer, did not appease them.
""It was just too much stress on the performers,"" he said.
He lamented the production would no longer be making its planned $500 donation in ticket sales to the Women and Girls Emergency Centre in Sydney because the tickets had to be refunded.
The promoter stressed he didn't see why Gunn would want the show cancelled.",Aoife Hilton,Sat 7 Dec,0

This infectious track was the only single released from the soundtrack of Despicable Me 2 and received an Academy Award nomination for best original song in 2014, but lost to Let It Go from Frozen. It was the lead single on Williams's second studio album Girl. It peaked at number one in two dozen countries including the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, where it was the longest-running number-one single of the year, spending 12 weeks in the top spot on the ARIA charts. A live rendition of the song won the Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. Happy also won Best Music Video and Girl won Best Urban Contemporary Album.

You hear plenty of hit songs in Piece by Piece and also hear from superstars like Snoop Dogg, who is depicted in Lego. The Doggfather points out in the film that the double-platinum Drop It Like It's Hot, which features Williams and was produced by The Neptunes, became both artists' first number one song, which is hard to believe if you grew up listening to Doggystyle.

Yes, I'm in the same agony of embarrassment and attempted recovery as most of my social media-addicted generation, as my Spotify Wrapped for the year has dropped — and I don't know who the hell they are talking about.
Taylor Swift is the most listened-to artist for a second year in a row, according to Spotify Wrapped 2024. See how your listening habits stack up.
My top artist for the year is… Taylor Swift? OK, so I loved the concert, and I had a few mellow, autumnal days with The Tortured Poets Department, but how did she rise above all the Indie Australian and neo-disco and alt-British and fave 90s that I actually listened to all year? Like that other recently scored year-long project, the HSC, are songs given varying weightings in the Spotify ranks?
And then I went and apparently had this Goblincore Movie Tunes Soundtrack Moment in September (what an ugly sentence), because of a preference for the internet musical, Over the Garden Wall, and John Williams compositions — when none of it is my fault at all.
Yes, the pitfalls of refusing to buy a separate Spotify account for a 12-year-old…
Just once, I wish my Wrapped actually wrapped up me.
Last year my top artist was the guy who scores music for Japanese anime and the Korean conductor of reimagined Star Wars themes. So perhaps I should be grateful for a small mercy of minor improvement. The young ones at my gym guffawed at my data, but not as much as they did at the trainer who talked about her Apple Music Replay… ""Ewwww"".
So I've become another mum meme of the all the women who know that peace only reigns in the car when the kids have control over the music, now that the toddler days of brainwashing them with the Clash, the Cult and Meatloaf are well behind us.
But who cares? The algorithm does, of course, because the dopamine kick of perhaps achieving a super-cool Wrapped one sunny December will, I'm sure, keep me swiping well into 2025. I'm already frantically liking a whole lot of music from Telenova, St Vincent and a few Florence Welch DJ remixes to restore my sense of self — and cheat the program.
The psychology behind Spotify Wrapped
I shouldn't care at all, in fact I should probably delete the app and go back to straight purchases, because as the Australian singer-songwriter and one-time half of Savage Garden Darren Hayes argued, when he posted the cold facts from United Musicians and Allied Workers, Spotify hasn't done anything for him lately.
The American UMAW has been needling Spotify with irrefutably uncomfortable data of their own, showing that Spotify pays a maximum of 0.003 cents per stream and has fired most of their curatorial staff, instead relying on AI for the $2.5 billion salary the union says Spotify founder, Daniel Ek, makes.
The union is running a Make Streaming Pay campaign, along with arguing for a Living Wage for Musicians Act that mirrors the fight writers in Hollywood went through to get a reasonable return from the streaming system that profits from their creativity.
The laziness of the addiction is the problem: now that I can just set and forget the annual fee and get access to almost anything I want to hear any time, I don't want to be discomfited by the suggestion that my money isn't really going to the artists I love. I signed up because I never wanted to rip their music illegally, I wanted to pay the price — so who tricked me?
On Spotify Wrapped day, we share the music we loved. But sometimes the data just doesn't seem to match up with our expectations.
As Freakonomics put it, Ek ""saved"" the record labels by making them an offer they couldn't refuse: a legal platform to stream their music and stop the pirating but, in a mogul move that we all should have seen coming, it of course was never going to benefit the musicians downstream. And now we are trapped, because nobody buys their music on CDs and carries a Discman anymore. Which is a pity.
The solution is opaque: you'd have to be the aforementioned artist, Taylor Swift, to actually make a dint in Spotify by removing your music, and in any case she could only do that with the versions that were hers.
The simplest solution? Make Spotify pay a fairer streaming share: in other words, insist that the banks make less profit. Yeah right. I'd have a better chance of landing a Hot-Girl Wrapped in 2025.
This weekend we have tales of the green fairy and O the places you can go if living in Trump-land is not going to be for you. In other words, it's a weekend of escape.
Have a safe and happy weekend — and if you're in need of a simple, moreish and affordable family meal as you gird your loins for the onslaught that is the pre-Christmas/Christmas over-eating season, I have a tin of tuna you may be interested in.
I was a guest recently on Alice Zazlavsky's ABC TV show, A Bite to Eat, and together we resurrected the tuna mornay, with a beautiful herb crust and much more flavour than you remember from your suburban childhood. Seriously — it's delicious. You can watch my debut as a TV cook here (all notes accepted) and make the dish here.
I'd play this while you were cooking it: it suits the era and the mood. Go well.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-06/maggie-tabberer-best-moments/104696620,Gold Logies and criminally good photo shoots: These were Maggie Tabberer's best moments,"On Friday, Maggie Tabberer's family announced on social media that the Australian TV and fashion icon had died at the age of 87.
Tabberer is most well known as the former fashion editor of the Australian Women's Weekly, having the job for 15 years.
But her career included everything from modelling work to running a fashion label, hosting a TV show and gracing the front pages of magazines until her 80s, making her a household name.
Here are five of her best moments.
Police once mistook a Tabberer photo shoot for a jewellery heist. (Supplied: State Library of New South Wales/ Alan Nye and Helmut Newton)
Born in Adelaide, Tabberer was discovered by famed German-Australian photographer Helmut Newton in Melbourne at the age of 23.
She worked with him through the late 1950s, including on assignment for Vogue magazine.
Tabberer's strong features and cool confident gaze featured in many memorable Newton images and the two became lovers.
She said Newton taught her a lot about fashion, putting her on ""the most enormous learning curve"".
In her 1998 autobiography Maggie, Tabberer reminisced about a photo shoot resembling a jewellery robbery complete with a Mayne Nickless truck.
The scene was so realistic police turned up. (Supplied: State Library of New South Wales/ Alan Nye and Helmut Newton)
Tabberer posed as a ""wicked lady"", trailing jewels.
The scene was so realistic police turned up.
She was named Australia's Model of the Year in 1960, before turning her focus to television.
In 1964 she became a panellist on the Seven Network show Beauty And The Beast, staring down ""beastly"" host Eric Baume with the help of fellow ""beauties"" Dita Cobb, Pat Firman, Ena Harwood, Hazel Philips, Anne Deveson and Patricia Lovell.

Even in a show that critics dismissed as ""sheer nonsense"", Tabberer's mix of intellect, looks and common sense shone through.
It marked the beginning of a long career on Australian screens.
She created her own daily chat show, Maggie, in 1969, for which she won the Gold Logie for Most Popular Female Personality back-to-back in 1970 and 1971.
She was the first person to win consecutive awards, although Graham Kennedy had already won three non-consecutive Gold Logies by 1970.
She spoke about the impact of Beauty And The Beast and Maggie on an episode of This Is Your Life.
Maggie Tabberer spoke about the impact of her chat show on This Is Your Life.
Tabberer launched the plus-size clothing label Maggie T in 1981 and that same year became fashion editor of The Australian Women's Weekly — an influential post she held for 15 years.
The Maggie T label was founded for women sized 12 to 24. According to research at the time, 70 per cent of Australian women were size 14 or bigger.
During an interview with the magazine, Tabberer said it was important for women who were not standard size to dress to their strengths.
Maggie Tebberer celebrated 50 years of Australian Women's Weekly in 1983, two years after joining as fashion editor.
""It's a matter of knowing what you've got. My body has thickened but I don't have a big bottom. My best thing? My long, slim legs — they're why I wear trousers a lot,"" she said.
""I don't have a waist so I never belt it. But I do like to be belted at the hip because that makes me narrower there and longer. That's one of the things about knowing your figure's faults.""
In 1998, Tabberer was made a member of the Order of Australia for her contributions to the advancement of the Australian fashion industry and for her support of charitable organisations.
Speaking on ABC Conversations in 2009, Tabberer said working in fashion brought a significant amount of joy — especially when it came to providing creative clothing options to plus-size Australian women.
""With Maggie T, we had a $5 million order from the Myer group on the first showing, which was unheard of. It just took off like mad,"" she said.
""[That size range] wasn't being catered for at the time.""
The magazine's current editor, Sophie Tedmanson, said Tabberer was an icon who empowered women around the world.
""It was an era in which Australian fashion took on the world and Maggie blazed that trail,"" she said.
""We thank Maggie for her extraordinary legacy and send love to her entire family.""
In 1999, Tabberer sat for Australian artist Paul Newton for the first time.

At that point, Newton had already won the 1996 Archibald Packing Room Prize with a portrait of radio announcer John Laws.
He would win it again in 2001, along with the People's Choice award, with a portrait of characters Roy Slaven and HG Nelson.
But Newton landed in the Archibald finalist list twice for portraits of Tabberer.
While speaking about his 1999 piece, Newton said he ""was struck by the fact that after years as a model, posing for the camera, she was very aware of how she appears"".
""Maggie was a bit teary and said it was a very emotional experience — as an artist you can't ask for a better reaction than that.""
YOUTUBE PAUL NEWTON
After returning to Tabberer as a subject for his 2020 finalist piece, Newton said he had ""often thought of approaching her again"".
""Before COVID-19 hit, I got together with Maggie, now in her mid-80s (though just as elegant and beautiful as ever), to work with her again on this new portrait,"" he said.
""I was again drawn to the simplicity and graphic quality of this sort of composition; her strong presence needing nothing else to support her.""
Australian Women's Weekly most recently photographed Tabberer for what would be her very last shoot — for the September 2023 cover to celebrate the magazine's 90th anniversary.
""She showed women that you could be gorgeous and relevant at every age, right up until she appeared on the 90th birthday edition of The Weekly in her 80s,"" former editor Deborah Thomas said.
During the interview, she quipped about her famous ""black for the winter, white for the summer"" looks, and revealed how she decided on her name.
While starting out as a model she called herself Margaret May, but Helmut Newton told her it would not suit.
""He renamed me. Helmut coined Maggie and it stuck,"" she said.
She said she felt ""lucky"" to be offered The Australian Women's Weekly fashion editor job in 1981, and said she created her plus-size label ""for women like me"".
""People always loved what I wore and there was nothing out there for them. There were crossover bodices and wrap dresses and skirts, and they looked really bad,"" she said.
""Maggie T was a success pretty much immediately.""",Unknown,Fri 6 Dec,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-05/spotify-wrapped-2024-weirdest-things-chappell-roan-/104688400,The weirdest things in our Spotify Wrapped this year,"Whether you like music, data, viral marketing or just arguing with people on the internet, Spotify Wrapped day is always a lot of fun.
It's one day of the year where we conveniently forget that they pay most artists a pittance while gleefully signing enormous cheques for controversial podcast hosts and celebrate the service for throwing our data back at us with some cute animation and, this year, a surprisingly condescending AI-generated podcast that wraps up your data.
But how accurate is it? Does your Wrapped really tell the full story of who you are as a music fan?
We obsess over our Wrapped just like everyone else. But we've got some questions about what Spotify dished up to us this year.
Each year, Spotify Wrapped has introduced some gimmick to ensure extra virality.
Spotify's confounding pigeonholes have helped their annual Wrapped go viral (Spotify)
Remember last year's ""Sound Cities""? Y'know, which puzzlingly lumped the music tastes of LGBTQI+ listeners with Californian residents of Berkeley, Burlington, and Vermont?
Well, this year's confounding novelty is ""Music Evolution"", which assigns musical moods to each month seemingly based on a pool of artists and songs.
For example, March was my ""Indie Sleaze Catwalk Pop"" phase, and July declared my ""Mcbling Abstract Hip Hop"" mode. Meanwhile, my partner was none too chuffed with her ""Coastal Grandmother Fingerstyle Folk Rock"" August.
Others I've spotted in the wild have been ""Surf Crush Actor Indie"", ""Mallgoth Catwalk Pop"" and even more head-scratching, ""Snow American Football UK Hip Hop"" and ""Goblincore Wrestling Folk Punk"".
Sure, seeing this gibberish shared on social media has prompted a chuckle or two. But it's also a cringe-inducing reminder that this WTF factor is just playing into the hands of Spotify overlords wanting your free promotion.

I'm feeling a little bit of ""Déjà vu"" because it is the year 2024 and my top artist on Spotify Wrapped is Something for Kate. Something for Kate haven't released a record in four years.
I listen to so much Something for Kate I am apparently in the top 0.5 per cent of fans. I listen to so much Something for Kate I took the train to Wollongong to see Paul Dempsey play solo, where I howled along with the lyrics, had a cathartic cry, then took the last train straight back.
Something for Kate — Captain (Million Miles an Hour)
The kicker? Four out of five of my top songs were by Dempsey's synth-rock side project Fanning Dempsey National Park. But at least that band had a record out this year.
And Spotify is making fun of me for my devotion, by describing my January listening habits as ""Van Life Rock Out Australian Indie"", which feels like an insult. I don't even like camping, let alone sleeping in a van.
The top artists for that strange take on a genre were ""artists like"" Something for Kate, Fanning Dempsey National Park and Dick Diver. Fanning Dempsey National Park had not yet released a song in January. The word ""like"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting.
Then, in May, I was allegedly listening to Something for Kate, Grinspoon and Spiderbait, or the precisely named ""Apocalyptic Old School Punk Australian Rock"".
Because I appear to be trapped with ""Monsters"" in a mid-00s time warp. And I don't really want to leave.

At the start of my year, my life was so carefree.
I had never seen or read Dune, I did not know what a Bene Gesserit was and I was laughing at the fans lining up for the sandworm popcorn bucket.
Then in March, I was asked to pick up an interview with the Dune franchise's Australian cinematographer, Greig Fraser (amazing man, really knows how to capture a sandworm). So, of course, I had to see Dune 2 (yes, I watched the sequel first, no it didn't make a lot of sense).
Sitting in that theatre, Hans Zimmer's entrancing score rocketed into my mind like spice coursing through a Fremen's bloodstream. Before I knew it, I was returning to the theatres for another viewing, and I wasn't even getting paid to do it.
I started listening to the score on repeat, particularly the opening track Beginnings Are Such Delicate Times. One thing led to another and now my number one track for the year is an eight-and-a-half-minute orchestral piece about space wars (boooo).
I blame Hans.
— Velvet Winter
If the hooks that have been bouncing around in my head in a chaotic, joyful loop for months are anything to go by, Chappell Roan was always going to feature prominently in my top artists.
I was surprised to see she was at number five, although she was competing against Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter, Waxahatchee's Tiger's Blood and the general sadgirl beauty of boygenius and Phoebe Bridgers, so it's not completely inexplicable.
I am incredulous her track Casual is not in my top songs — it was the first of her singles I got truly hooked on, but its absence is perhaps explained by how frequently I watch the song's absurd music video.
Chappell Roan — Casual
But where I draw the line is my alleged July mood, which I feel was Spotify's attempt at conceding Chappell's mega influence on my music choices. To do this, they chose the unholy word salad of ""Pink Pilates Princess Strut Pop"".
I know they've just done a virtual mind map of the songs I've selected — and lazily pulled most influence from my new favourite karaoke song, Pink Pony Club — but there's something about this sweeping, hyper-femme, mischaracterisation that gives me the ick.
Chappell's riotous, racy, incredibly queer music has given me catharsis and joy this year. It has helped me feel like I belong in pop music for the first time in a long while. Turns out that a giant multinational company mining my data and then packaging it up for me doesn't quite do that feeling justice.
— Katherine Smyrk
Overmono — Turn the Page
I really like the song that Spotify claims was my number one of the year.
UK electronic duo Overmono took The Streets' 2002 classic Turn the Page and made it even more anthemic, jacking it up just enough to make it ripe for the dance floor. It was a nice hat tip from an act on the rise to an artist who blazed a trail a couple of decades ago.
But geez, I didn't like it that much.
When Charli xcx released her collaborations with Lorde (Girl, so confusing) and Billie Eilish (Guess) this year, I could barely think of anything else, let alone listen to other songs.
After hearing Dua Lipa's 2017 song New Rules in an Uber to the pub in early winter, I was reminded of what a banger it was and began to obsess over every second of it, repeating the song over and over to try and understand what made it such an alluring piece of music.
The only potentially plausible explanation I can give for Overmono and The Streets taking out the top spot is that the algorithm really wanted me to listen to this song more. I recall more than a few occasions where I skipped the song because it just didn't fit the vibe for what I was doing at the time. Do those few seconds where the song was thrust upon me count in the final tally? They must.
If that's the case, then Spotify gets way more say in our yearly Wrapped than we might expect or hope. For a service that many claim puts the power of curation back into the hands of the consumer, that's kinda annoying.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-02/diddy-bryana-bongolan-civil-suit-luca-guadagnino-queer/104671622,Sean 'Diddy' Combs sued for allegedly dangling woman off a 17-storey balcony,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recap the pop culture and entertainment news that you might have missed over the past few days.
Let us get you caught up.
Days after a US judge rejected Sean ""Diddy"" Combs's $77 million bail plea, another lawsuit was filed against the disgraced rapper and producer.
Fashion designer Bryana ""Bana"" Bongolan filed a 17-page lawsuit against Combs this week in Los Angeles, according to Rolling Stone.
The lawsuit accuses Combs of sexual battery, infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment, among other claims, with Bongolan seeking $US10 million ($15 million) in damages.
Bongolan says she worked for Combs up until 2018 including on the 2016 Bad Boy reunion tour, album covers, music videos and a clothing line with Combs's former partner Cassie Ventura.
Sean ""Diddy"" Combs has been a revered artist and entrepreneur in the world of hip hop since the early 90s. Now, he's awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. How did we get here?
Among the claims in Bongolan's lawsuit are accusations that Combs lifted Bongolan by her armpits and dangled her over a 17th-floor balcony at Ventura's apartment. The suit says that Combs eventually brought her back over the balcony, at the insistence of Ventura, but not before allegedly slamming Bongolan onto the balcony's patio furniture.
The incident was also mentioned by Ventura in her sexual abuse and sex-trafficking lawsuit against Combs, which was settled in November last year.
Bongolan alleges in the lawsuit that Combs cornered her at a photo shoot of Ventura's and threatened her, saying, ""I'm the motherf***ing devil. You have no idea what I could do to you. I could kill you.""
Combs ""firmly denied"" Bongolan's claims against him in a statement to Rolling Stone.
Bongolan joins a group of 30 people that have filed civil suits against Combs for various instances of alleged abuse between the 1990s and 2022.
Combs was arrested on criminal charges of racketeering and sex trafficking in September of this year. He is currently being held in a New York prison with a trial date set for May 2025.
Luca Guadagnino has spoken out about the Turkish ban of a screening of his upcoming film Queer, vowing to ""fight any institution that wants to tarnish"" cinema.
Guadagnino, the Oscar-nominated director behind Challengers and Call Me By Your Name, spoke out about the ban at a press conference at the Marrakech International Film Festival, where he presides over this year's jury.
""They banned the movie because they said [it] was creating social disorder,"" said Guadagnino (via Agence France Presse).
""I really hope they do believe that the form of the movie brings the possibility of societal collapse. Because this means that my belief in the power of cinema is true and not delusional.""

Queer was set to open streamer Mubi's Mubi Fest Istanbul in November, but was banned at the last minute by the city's governor.
Via a statement, the streamer claimed the governor believed Queer included ""provocative content that could endanger the peace of the society"". Mubi subsequently cancelled the three-day festival as a stance against ""an intervention that restricts art and freedom of expression"".
The film, starring Daniel Craig, is an adaptation of William S. Burroughs's semi-autobiographical 1985 novel of the same name, focusing on an exiled American's time in Mexico City, where he begins a relationship with a reluctant younger man. It also stars Drew Starkey, Lesley Manville, Jason Schwartzman and singer Omar Apollo.
The director questioned whether the film's press impacted the governor's ban: ""I wonder if they've seen the movie or if they are just judging it by the outline or, let's say, the facetious stupidity of some journalist focusing on James Bond going gay.""
""It's an obtuse censorship, particularly in this world where you can download the movie.""
Queer will be released in Australian cinemas on February 6.
Moana 2 was always going to smash the box office. But numbers from the Disney animated film's opening weekend have exceeded expectations.
Moana 2 has taken in an estimated $8.3 million in Australia since it opened on Thursday, making it the highest-grossing opening weekend of any Walt Disney Animation movie – ever.
When the first Moana film came out, the authenticity of the Pasifika culture shone through and captured audiences. Eight years later, can the sequel live up to the hype?
This was after the film nabbed the record for the highest Walt Disney Animation Studios opening day of all time, bringing in $1.7 million on Thursday alone.
Other local records broken include the biggest animated opening day post pandemic and the second-highest opening day of 2024, behind Deadpool & Wolverine.
Moana 2 brought in a whopping $US386.3 million ($596 million) worldwide over the weekend, making it the second-biggest global debut of any film so far in 2024 (the Merc with the mouth has number one on lock … for now).

Actor Rupert Grint, who played Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter film series, is facing a £1.8 million ($3.5 million) tax bill, having lost an appeal with UK tax authorities.
Grint was first ordered to pay the fee in 2019, after HM Revenue and Customs investigated the actor's return from 2011-2012.
The UK's tax authority determined that Grint had wrongly classed £4.5million ($8.79 million) of Harry Potter residuals as capital gains rather than income.
Grint's appeal was denied this week. It's the actor's second legal battle over tax – in 2016, he lost an appeal for a £1 million ($1.95 million) tax refund.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-01/black-chrome-simon-stretton-punk-rock-australia/104649642,"Once 'hated, ignored and rejected', this little-known punk rock band led by a former judge has found a cult following","Simon Stretton had been driven by a desire to change the world from an early age. It's why he spent 14 years working as a District Court judge in Adelaide, overseeing everything from civil to commercial and criminal cases.
But before his legal career, he hoped to spark change through his music, as a member of the punk rock band Black Chrome.
The genre burst onto the international music scene in the mid-1970s. Seen as an aggressive and hostile form of music, it mirrored the social upheaval that was occurring at the time, particularly in the UK: songs like The Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK served as a call to arms and addressed the state of the nation.
The Sex Pistols formed in London in 1975. The band split just three years later.  (The Sex Pistols)
""My inspiration for the music was more my appreciation of cultural and social and other bleakness and apathy,"" said Judge Stretton, who was both guitarist and vocalist for Black Chrome.
""That was what I perceived to be the youth culture that I faced in Adelaide in 1977. And that was the real impetus for Black Chrome and the message we were trying to get across.""
From the very beginning, Black Chrome experienced insurmountable hurdles.
""We didn't realise at the time how hated and ignored and rejected we would be, because we were certainly the first punk band in South Australia,"" Judge Stretton said.
Adelaide radio hosts definitely weren't interested in playing punk rock at the time.
""I don't think Australia is ready for the punk rock image. People with rings in their noses and rings in their ears, with a chain combining together, that to me doesn't gel,"" Adelaide radio host Bob Francis told This Day Tonight in 1977.
A decade earlier, in 1964, Francis had successfully campaigned for The Beatles to come to Adelaide. The clean-cut boys from Liverpool were more Francis's idea of good music than that of the loud, in-your-face style of punk.

""I've gone around to all the announcers here and said, you know, what do you think of it [punk rock]? And they hate it. They don't like it,"" Francis told This Day Tonight.
""It's not part of our image. If other stations want to play it and it becomes the number one record, well, that's fine.
""But I think everyone has a particular standard to follow in certain music. And I think that we have the right to be able to say, I don't like that particular standard of music and therefore, I don't go play it.""
Judge Stretton said radio stations were playing meaningless pop music and Bob Francis had a vendetta against the band.
""He was the antichrist of punk rock. He completely failed to understand the genre,"" Judge Stretton told 7.30.
""I'd like to bring one point up: the names of groups in punk rock,"" Francis told This Day Tonight.
Judge Stretton says Bob Francis, pictured above, failed to understand the punk rock genre.  (ABC TV)
""There are the Sex Pistols, Stranglers, Boomtown Rats, Backstabbers, Electric Chair, Extermination. And the one group that really burned a fire inside me was a group in Sydney called The Beaumont Children. That really disgusts me.""
Three siblings, Jan, Arnna and Grant Beaumont disappeared from Glenelg beach near Adelaide in 1966. Their disappearance still remains unsolved.
""Firstly, there was never a band called The Beaumont Children,"" Judge Stretton fired back.
""That's a complete fabrication.""
Trying to get their music played on radio was one thing – the defiant and rebellious image that symbolised punk rock also didn't sit well with Adelaide's music venues.
""No venue would book us. We had to lie and told them we had a musical event,"" Judge Stretton explained.
""We would just turn up, put our posters on buildings around town and people would just rock up. Then of course someone in the audience would wreck one of the toilets so we would have to leave in a hurry and hope no one found us and sued us.""
But there was one place where they could get regular gigs.
""There were these stoned hippies who had these Bihu festivals in the Adelaide Hills. There'd be people called Star Shine and they'd be blowing bubbles, or knitting alpaca jumpers,"" Judge Stretton said.
Hippies may not have been Black Chrome's target audience, but the band was grateful to be given opportunities to perform.  (ABC TV)
Ironically, the death knell for Black Chrome came when they were interviewed for ABC TV's This Day Tonight. The program had travelled to Adelaide to interview the only punk rock band they could find at the time.
""Once we were on TV that meant we definitely weren't going to any gigs because everyone was aware of us,"" Judge Stretton said.
Black Chrome featured on an episode of This Day Tonight.  (ABC )
The girlfriends of the band members also only realised that their boyfriends were in a punk rock band after the program aired.
""So they broke the band up, is my perception,"" Judge Stretton recalled.
Despondent, Judge Stretton was going to give it one last shot. He got into his Valiant with 200 copies of the band's one single, Australia's God, and drove to radio stations across Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane in the vain hope that someone would play their song.
""I can still remember going to the ABC in Sydney. I handed the record to this guy and explained that we were a punk band,"" he said.
""He looked at me like he had just trodden in shit. He just walked back off through the door and I never heard from him again.
""It's a protest song about Australia's bereft culture. So of course no one was going to play that, because it wasn't a nice song about love.""
Black Chrome's appearance on This Day Tonight was the only time the band were on television.  (ABC)
He returned to Adelaide feeling rejected and defeated. He decided he was going to have nothing more to do with the music industry. He pursued his legal career and eventually became a judge.
Fast forward to the year 2000 and the onset of the internet and Black Chrome suddenly became cult heroes.
""It was bizarre. People started calling me and saying, 'Can we book your punk rock band?'"" Judge Stretton said.
""I resisted for a long time because I thought people would think, 'Who's that old idiot trying to be in a band?' And then I realised that all the other bands are still playing like The Buzzcocks. And people weren't going to treat us like a joke.""
Judge Stretton continued with his legal career, retiring in May this year.
""I really did want to make the world a better place and it has been a worthwhile and rewarding job,"" he said.
""But I feel that I've done my bit now, and it's the right time to retire.""
Black Chrome performing in 2021.
""The big difference now is people will actually listen to us. And the technology means we can publish ourselves, and no one can stop us anymore.""
The band's latest project is taking ""appalling songs in history and fixing them by playing them in punk."" The first song which was recently released is based on the 1977 song Living Next Door to Alice.
""Happily, the dead hand of Bob Francis did not destroy punk.""

It's vindicating for Nugget's co-writers and stars — Australian comedians Vic Zerbst and Jenna Owen — who fought to keep the film's title when executives were worried audiences might not get it.
When asked for alternatives, Zerbst made a PowerPoint of intentionally ""horrific"" options, including Our Dog Nugget is Not Okay, A Christmas Tail, Nugget is Alive… for Now!, and Nugget Has a Terminal Illness. The title was one element that the duo, also known as Freudian Nip, didn't want to budge on.
""It doesn't take itself too seriously,"" says Zerbst. ""It's a very Australian thing: it's tongue in cheek, like He Died with a Falafel in his Hand.""
The film — the fifth of Stan's annual Australian Christmas movies — was inspired by one of Owen's more memorable silly seasons.
While she would usually wait until the eleventh hour to return to Wollongong from Sydney for festivities, a few years ago she rushed home early when family dog Zuri was sick. It was absolute chaos, with the illness only heightening existing tensions.
""The reason this was always a comedy is the voice messages Jenna would send me from Wollongong,"" says Zerbst.

""My family can be quite dysfunctional and there's a lot of it represented in the film,"" says Owen. ""It's not entirely a parallel. There's lots of bits of Vic's family dysfunction in there as well, which is good, because no one person will be deeply hurt and scarred.""
As echoed in the movie, each of Owen's family members reacted differently to the dog's illness. Her father was ready to throw all funds away to fix Zuri, even if it meant bankruptcy. Her mother, meanwhile, constantly followed the dog around, while her brother consulted Dr Google for cures. Owen wasn't immune, admitting she fixated on tricking Zuri into eating, freezing meat into icy poles that melted in the December heat.
""That felt too disgusting to put in the movie,"" laughs Zerbst. ""But it felt like such a funny contrast, dealing with something that is so full of pain while also wearing a tinsel hat.""
In Nugget is Dead, Zerbst plays Owen's proxy: Steph Stool, a dermatologist-in-training (or, as her dad says, a ""pimple popper"") looking to ditch her family's backyard barbecue Christmas to spend it with her wealthy, cultured boyfriend in his family's mansion home.

But when aging family dog Nugget is suddenly on his deathbed, she races to say goodbye. As he toughs it out, Steph is stuck in suburbia, all the while hoping to make it back to Sydney.
The self-styled black sheep who moved away to the city, Steph could learn to be a little less judgemental of what she sees as her family's low-brow lives, typified by her activewear-loving, lash artist cousin Shayla (Owen).
It's a tendency both Zerbst and Owen, now in their early 30s, see within their younger selves, having moved to Sydney's Inner West as soon as they could.

Nugget is Dead is something of an olive branch to their respective families, with Steph learning to love her family for, not despite, their differences (this is a Christmas movie, after all).
""I definitely feel quite disconnected from my family in a lot of ways,"" says Owen. ""They don't understand the concept of why anyone would want to live in the city. And that's something I love so much. I love a small plate! I love wine bars! I love not being able to find parking! All of those things, J'adore.
""I don't think we've always been able to find the middle ground. That's what a family Christmas movie means to me. It's that middle ground.""

Nugget is Dead is the first feature-length written project for the duo, and arrives just ahead of their first TV show: Optics, a six-part satire series for ABC out in January, co-created with The Chaser's Charles Firth.
The moment arrives just shy of a decade of working together as comedians, including a five-year stint creating headline-skewering satirical sketches on SBS's The Feed. But they're perhaps best known for creating and starring alongside rapper Briggs in a viral video about misinformation surrounding the Voice to Parliament referendum. (Or maybe you remember the Contact Tracies, a sketch about COVID contact tracers made with The Chaser?)
Contact Tracies
""We've been calling [Nugget is Dead] our love and softness venture,"" says Owen. ""An escape from the cynicism that we usually exist in — mentally, physically, spiritually.""
The two first met while both studying at the University of Sydney, bonding as fellow scholarship kids. Zerbst planned to become a venture capitalist, coming from a family of former artists, while Owen has been working as an actor since her teens. But after writing sketches and performing at a few university revues, Zerbst, Owen and friend Jess Bush founded Freudian Nip for a 2015 Sydney Fringe show called Tri Hard: Get Rich or Die Crying.
Bush moved onwards from Freudian Nip — an artist and actor currently in TV show Star Trek: Strange New Worlds — and later, Geraldine Viswanathan (Drive-Away Dolls; Miracle Workers) joined, ahead of a star-making role in blockbuster US comedy Blockers.
""Everyone that joins us in our sketch group will go on to become a major Hollywood celebrity,"" says Owen.
It starts with a conversation you might have had with a friend or family member over the last few months.
As a duo, Zerbst and Owen made topical sketches for youth publication Junkee and, in 2017, took part in the comedy shorts program, Fresh Blood, with Screen Australia and ABC. A year later, they started working on The Feed, which included co-creating Time To Buy, a half-hour musical about Australia’s housing crisis starring Montaigne.
""The first six months we were there, it was brutal, because everyone was like, 'F*** these girls. Bring back Mark Humphreys',"" says Owen. ""And you can say, 'Oh, that's so sexist'. And part of it was! But also part of it was [that] our videos weren't really good.""
The two say they're grateful they were given ""the chance to fail a little bit"" at The Feed and find their feet as both performers and writers — an opportunity they worry upcoming voices lack. The Feed was cancelled in 2022 (though they still create social videos), following the end of sketch and variety shows Black Comedy in 2020 and Tom Ballard's Tonightly in 2018.
While Zerbst and Owen have worked separately (Zerbst predominantly as a writer, Owen an actor), the two prefer navigating the industry together.

""We stepped away [from The Feed] thinking we were passing the torch onto this new generation who had more diverse perspectives, and it was all ripped away,"" says Zerbst.
""It's really sad. The Tonightly, The Feed, The Hungry Beast — these were institutions where young people could cut their teeth in a system bigger than their own thing.""
""We don't nurture our writers in Australia,"" says Owen. ""Black Comedy is one of our greatest shows, because it was a breeding ground of writing and performing.""
While Nugget is Dead is an earnest turn for Freudian Nip, Optics is billed as a satire, focusing on two 20-something women who fall upward into top jobs at a PR crisis firm and have to deal with external and internal scandals.

The show explores the idea of the ""glass cliff"", a cousin theory of the glass ceiling. It suggests a phenomenon where women are promoted into positions of power only as a company or corporation faces a difficult period — set up to fail.
Zerbst and Owen have given a lot of thought to the role of comedy and satire in political and social commentary — and are the first to say that a sketch isn't going to change minds.
""Satire is not there to change minds, but it's there to provide a spotlight,"" says Owen.
What the two never want to be is gloating — something Nugget's lead character Steph is certainly guilty of — acknowledging that some of their earlier work could be lectures, not sketches.
""It's something that feels so smug, feels so scalding, and it's laughing at people,"" says Zerbst.
""You have to have empathy in your comedy. So much of a division politically with comedy is that punching down is devoid of empathy. [You should] be able to laugh at yourself, and collectively laugh at things that have enormous power.""
Nugget is Dead: A Christmas Story is streaming on Stan. Optics will premiere on ABC TV and ABC iview on January 29.

For almost four years, this question has consumed Swinburne University of Technology researchers Liam Burke and Joanna McIntyre.
Since 2021, they've been conducting a longitudinal study as part of the Australian Children's Television Cultures (ACTC) research project, asking parents about the value they place on children's television being locally made.
The latest report from the project has found 83 per cent of parents think it's important that kids' content is Australian.
""Some of the reasons being that they want their children to see their experiences reflected on screen, and have a better sense of Australia and people across the country,"" explains Dr Burke, an associate professor in cinema and screen studies.
The qualities that parents most identified as constituting ""good"" children's TV were relatability and diversity, followed by positive educational messages and a distinctly Australian sense of humour.
Parents' Perspectives on Australian Children's Television in the Streaming Era
Given this, it's perhaps unsurprising the report identified Bluey as the number one TV show among children. It's also the one parents are most likely to want to watch with their kids.
With its Queensland setting, diversity, localised jokes and turns of phrase from ""bush wees"" to bilbies, the International Emmy Award-winning ABC iview show couldn't be more Australian if it tried.
The new data came days after the federal government delayed plans to introduce local content requirements for major streaming platforms, with little fanfare.
There is no indication of when work on the policy — which was a centrepiece of Labor's national cultural policy — might resume.
Global streaming services are subject to quotas in other countries, as are broadcast TV stations in Australia. (ABC News: Matthew Doran)
The ACTC team found the ABC was still the top destination that children and parents alike head to for children's content (93 per cent). But they also found viewing habits were changing, with global streaming services including Netflix (73 per cent), YouTube (66 per cent) and Disney (56 per cent) on the rise — none of which are bound by local content quotas.
This isn't the case everywhere. The European Union, for example, requires streaming platforms to offer at least 30 per cent European content to European consumers. And broadcast TV in Australia has long been bound by local content quotas.
Evie struggled to talk to her parents about being trans. Now she's starring in a show that explores what it's like to transition at school.
For example, the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 requires 55 per cent of the programs free-to-air TV stations show on their primary channel between 6am and midnight be locally made.
Streaming giants like Netflix have made high-profile Australian content in recent years, like Heartbreak High and Boy Swallows Universe.
But Dr Burke says, ""Quotas provide that assurance that even if we are gravitating towards global streaming services as audiences, there's a place for local within those global platforms"".
Senior media studies lecturer Dr McIntyre agrees, adding that while local children's TV may feel like it's ""stable and solid"" for now, it's actually in ""grave danger"".
""And we can't leave it up to Bluey. It's too much for one little blue dog to shoulder on her own,"" she says.
""We don't have the [population size] for [the industry] to function without proper government support, and that's always been the case with Australian film and TV.""
It was broadcast content quotas, Dr McIntyre explains, that ""ensured Australian kids' TV has had decades of evolution"" to this point, resulting in shows like Bluey, First Day and Lil J & Big Cuz.
And we already have some evidence to suggest what happens without quotas, after the government removed Australian children's content quotas for commercial TV stations in 2020.
Between 2019 and 2022, local kids' programs on commercial broadcasters dropped by 84 per cent according to the Australian Communications and Media Authority.
Everyone is impacted, according to Dr McIntyre, by the government's decision not to commit to local content quotas for global streaming platforms — including ""people who aren't parents yet or who will never be"".
""They were once children themselves,"" she adds.
As part of the ACTC research project, she and Dr Burke spoke to four generations of Australians, from Boomers down to Gen Z.
Each generation spoke in favourable terms about the impact of local kids' TV as a decades-long form of social glue, providing shared cultural references that simultaneously introduces Australia to a global audience.
Remember Round The Twist? It's back! In musical form.
""If you're 30, you can walk into a pub on the other side of Australia and have a discussion about a show like Round the Twist, for example, with great delight. It's a shared cultural understanding,"" Dr McIntyre adds.
""But people tend to think it's a given.""
That said, Dr McIntyre doesn't think local children's television will ""disappear entirely"" without the safeguard that quotas provide.
For now, at least, global streaming services are producing some locally made children's content.
""[And] there are some really clever, powerful, passionate people who work in the industry who will forge ahead regardless,"" Dr McIntyre says.
""So, not all hope is lost … but it would be better to have the support.""",Yasmin Jeffery,Thu 28 Nov,0

Bob Geldof and Ed Sheeran face off over Band Aid,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recap the pop culture and entertainment news that you might have missed over the past few days.
Let us get you caught up.
Get in, kids, the millionaire musicians are fighting.
Irish singer Bob Geldof has hit back at comments made by Ed Sheeran about his long-running Band Aid charity single. It's been 40 years since Geldof gathered the biggest stars from around the world to record 'Do They Know It's Christmas?' and raised £8 million ($15 million) for Ethiopian famine relief.

To celebrate the anniversary, a special remix is being released today, which incorporates famous voices from previous re-recordings. This includes the 2014 edition, featuring One Direction, Rita Ora and Ed Sheeran.
In response, Ed Sheeran publicly blasted the remix on his Instagram, claiming his approval for a re-release hadn't been sought, and that if he was asked to contribute again he would have ""respectfully declined"".
Alongside his comments, Sheeran reposted a statement from rapper Fuse OG who argued that the track perpetuates ""damaging stereotypes that stifle Africa's economic growth, tourism and investment"".
Geldof has now come out swinging to defend his project, saying Band Aid is providing food for the starving.
""This little pop song has kept millions of people alive. Why would Band Aid scrap feeding thousands of children dependent on us for a meal? Why not keep doing that? Because of an abstract wealthy-world argument, regardless of its legitimacy?,"" he told The Times of London.
""No abstract theory, regardless of how sincerely held, should impede or distract from that hideous, concrete real-world reality. There are 600 million hungry people in the world — 300 million are in Africa. We wish it were other but it is not. We can help some of them. That's what we will continue to do.""

There was nary a doubt in anyone's mind that Wicked — the MAJOR musical motion picture that has been in the works for two decades, stars one of the biggest pop stars in the world and has the advertising budget of a small country's GDP — was going to make bank at the box office.
But after streaming into theatres worldwide over the weekend, we now have a picture of just how much the film brought in.
Fans of the mega-popular stage musical Wicked have been waiting years for a film version to hit screens. We talk to two of the creatives who were tasked with bringing the impossible world of Oz to life.
Wicked: Part 1 (oh yeah, there's another one coming out this time next year, icymi) raked in a whopping $251 million worldwide. Which means it broke the following box office records *takes extremely large breath*:
Elsewhere, the film's two stars, Grande and Cynthia Erivo, have been hitting interviews hard and leaving a trail of deeply grateful tears wherever they go. The pair have cried in almost every single interview they've conducted.
But one interview with queer magazine Out has captured the attention of the ever-chomping meme machine.
In the clip, which has gone super-viral on X, interviewer Tracey E. Gilchrist informs Erivo that ""people are taking the lyrics of 'Defying Gravity' and really holding space with that, and feeling power in that"".
What does this sentence actually mean? Who knows! But it was enough to make Erivo's eyes well with tears and for Grande to grasp onto her co-star's heavily clawed finger for support.
It's all painfully sincere and vague (Gilchrist clarifies her statement by saying she's seen that space-holding in ""a couple of posts"") so, of course, the internet has latched onto it straight away. Enjoy!
It seems as though the legal proceedings that saw actor Jonathan Majors kicked from the Marvel roster are coming to a close.
Over the weekend, Majors's ex-girlfriend, dancer Grace Jabbari, dropped her assault and defamation civil suit against the actor after both parties came to a settlement.
Jabbari's lawyer said on Friday that the suit was ""favourably settled"", but declined to elaborate.
""Grace Jabbari has exhibited tremendous courage throughout this very long and difficult process,"" attorney Brittany Henderson said in a statement.
The former rising star of Creed III is sentenced to probation after he was convicted of misdemeanour assault by a Manhattan jury last year.
""We hope that she can finally put this chapter behind her and move forward with her head held high.""
Jabbari filed her civil suit against Majors's back in March, alleging escalating incidents of physical and verbal abuse during their relationship, including assault, battery, defamation and infliction of emotional distress.
The civil case was launched months after Majors was found guilty in a New York criminal court of one misdemeanour assault charge and one harassment violation related to a single previous altercation with Jabbari.
He was acquitted of a different assault charge and of aggravated harassment. Majors avoided jail time, but was ordered by a judge in April to complete a year-long counselling program.
Following his guilty verdict, Marvel immediately dropped Majors, who played Kang the Conqueror, a character that was envisioned as the tent pole villain for many future films and TV programs in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Sebastian Stan's performance as Donald Trump in biopic The Apprentice may have garnered him Best Actor buzz but he says he's missed out on a prestigious award-season press opportunity because other actors are too ""afraid"" of the president-elect.
Stan claims he was unable to take part in industry magazine Variety's annual Actors on Actors series — where performers interview each other — as no actor wanted to be paired with him.
The former US president attempted to stall The Apprentice's release ahead of the 2024 election, citing Hollywood interference. Does he have a point?
During a Q&A in Los Angeles, Stan said: ""I couldn't find another actor to do it with me because they were too afraid to go and talk about this movie. So I couldn't do it.""
He added that he and his team were not talking to any one actor directly. ""I've got to do a lot of great things, and that's not pointing at anyone specific,"" he said.
""We couldn't get past the publicists or the people representing them, because [they were] too afraid to talk about this movie.""
Variety co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh confirmed Stan's claim to People Magazine, explicitly stating that ""other actors didn't want to pair with him because they didn't want to talk about Donald Trump"".
The film centres on Trump's rise as a real estate mogul in the 1970s and 1980s, and depicts his alleged 1989 rape of first wife Ivana Trump (an allegation she later recanted as metaphorical), as well as alleged plastic surgeries he has denied.
Ahead of its October release, Trump deemed the film ""garbage"", ""election interference"", ""pure fiction"", threatening to sue director Ali Abassi and others involved. Abassi refutes that The Apprentice is a hit piece, suggesting that Trump might even like the film.","Velvet Winter, Jared Richards",Mon 25 Nov,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-24/wicked-harnesses-barbies-marketing-magic-at-the-box-office/104620188,Wicked tries to harness Barbie's marketing magic in the hopes of defying gravity at the box office,"When Greta Gerwig's Barbie surpassed the $1 billion mark at the global box office, its tireless, unashamedly pink marketing campaign was hailed as a masterclass.
The film – and its build up – was a cultural phenomenon, due in part to its source material, but also thanks to the deep pockets at Warner Bros.
Fans eagerly awaited each of Margot Robbie's Barbie-inspired red carpet outfits, and there was more branded merchandise than you could fit in a Malibu Dream House.
So it is no surprise that Universal's latest blockbuster is getting a marketing rollout that is just as elaborate – and pink – as Barbie.

After decades in development, the film adaptation Wicked, Broadway's second-highest grossing musical, has finally hit theatres, telling the story of the witches of Oz long before Dorothy arrives.
With its stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo at the helm, Wicked will be hoping to defy gravity at the box office.
And because Hollywood loves a sequel, Wicked flew into US theatres on the same day as Gladiator II in the hopes of creating the same lightning in a bottle success as Barbenheimer.
Graeme Hughes, a business and consumer expert from Griffith University, says when it comes to Wicked's marketing campaign, ""there are a lot of parallels with Barbie"".
""Barbie-core was a huge phenomenon and a marketing masterclass,"" Mr Hughes told ABC News.
""We know that it's a multi-generational story, much like Barbie, so there's a lot of different groups that they're trying to tap into.""
From fashion to cosmetics, there is an endless stream of Wicked-branded products on the market. (Universal)
A dizzying amount of Wicked brand collaborations started hitting shelves more than a month before the film's release.
There are endless fashion collaborations, from clothing to shoes and accessories, multiple makeup collections (including one with Grande's own brand), plus hair-styling tools and nail polishes.
Then there's a sprawling array of toys, including dolls, plushies, playing cards and board games.
Not to mention the more quizzical Wicked-themed food items — from macaroni and cheese to cake mixes, which turn either pink or green when stirred.
After more than 20 years of raging success on stage, the origin story of the Wicked Witch of the West has finally made it to the big screen. And the lush, visual spectacular does not disappoint.
Karen Ferry, an executive creative director and regular panellist on ABC's Gruen, says Wicked's campaign blitz is ""probably not as big as Barbie"" because ""Barbie was definitely the biggest one that we've ever seen"".
""Barbie, I believe, had removed its licensing fees so it had an unlimited amount of brand partnerships,"" Ms Ferry told ABC News.
""What Wicked has done is they've followed the importance of brand partnerships, but they've been much more selective in who they've partnered with.
""But it's still very big and it follows that need to try and get a cultural Zeitgeist happening for months before the launch of the film.""
In Wicked, Grande's Glinda arrives at Shiz University with more trunks full of pink outfits than what Elle Woods hauled to Harvard in Legally Blonde.
Wicked's branding in 2024 relies just as much on pink as it does on green. (Universal)
Any Broadway fan would tell you Glinda's stage wardrobe isn't just pink – there's the glittering blue gown she wears as she enters stage left via bubble and the yellow sundress she dons for her one short day in the Emerald City.
So why has pink become just as much of Wicked's marketing as green?
""They would realise that green alone wouldn't have been strong enough,"" Ms Ferry says.
""They're riding on the coat-tails of two very famous colours of the year – the Barbie pink, the Brat green.
Ms Ferry says that while they're ""not exactly the same matching Pantone shades"", Wicked is ""driving on the fact that people are choosing to wear these colours"".
""They're picking colours that people already have, are comfortably wearing in their wardrobes, can match into things they've already got.
""It's not necessarily that they're trying to be Barbie, it's more that they're rolling off the back of the fact that pink is having a moment, as is green.""
Wicked's film adaptation is full of elaborate costumes, and Elphaba and Glinda's distinctive outfits don't end when the cameras stop rolling.

""Method dressing,"" a riff on the concept of method acting, is the latest trend sweeping Hollywood's red carpets.
Coined by Zendaya's stylist Law Roach, method dressing involves actors channelling their on-screen characters through the looks they wear in real life.
Margot Robbie went hard on the concept for her Barbie press tour, with Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo channelling their respective witches through pink and green gowns for Wicked's premieres.
To get even more referential, Grande channelled Billie Burke's costume from 1939's The Wizard of Oz for the film's Sydney premiere.

Wicked's costume designer, Paul Tazewell, told Forbes that Burke's costume was the original inspiration for Grande's on-screen wardrobe, saying: ""I adopted the same distinguishing pink, which I used throughout the rest of Glinda's colour story.""
Ms Ferry says method dressing creates a media story that then allows you to grab headlines.
""So that way if you've been doing your media tour of going to seven different screenings around the world, you've then got seven different days across a few weeks reminding people that your movie is coming out,"" she says.
Ms Ferry also notes that Grande – who is a natural brunette — has been emulating her character Glinda through her own hair and makeup choices.
""The way she does her makeup, her skin and hair colour, we've seen it change a lot through time,"" Ms Ferry says.

""But at the moment she's being more Glinda than anything else with her face and her makeup, which is quite interesting because it's more than just [a] dress, it's actually about her physical appearance changing.""
Wicked's marketing blitz hasn't been entirely faultless.
Mattel had to issue an apology after customers noticed the website listed on the packaging of its Wicked dolls led to an adult film website, instead of to WickedMovie.com.
Fans were also divided when Universal threw a private screening of Wicked for the Kardashians a month in advance with the film's stars in attendance – in fact, it was the first time Grande and Erivo had even seen the film together.
Hosted at Kim Kardashian's house, the watch party involved matching pyjamas, themed drinks and a green carpet that transformed Kim's at-home theatre into a cinema foyer.
""To be honest, this is the biggest turn-off for me that the movie has done,"" one user wrote on Reddit.
""To honour these people with a special screening? With the actresses showing up? Why? I feel the studio hasn't actually understood the story or the message of Wicked.""
Mr Hughes says Wicked is ""obviously looking to gain traction via multiple mechanisms and they know that [the Kardashians'] following is quite powerful.""
""Unfortunately some will be upset by that privilege, but at the same time, the risk versus reward is certainly on Wicked's side with this one,"" he says.
Cynthia Erivo steps into the role of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West. (Universal)
No matter your opinion of them, Ms Ferry says ""the Kardashians are the biggest celebrities in the world"".
""They've influenced culture and they've influenced people's lives in a way that we can't even fathom. They changed the identity of how we see women literally, physically, how women change their body. It's all because of the Kardashians.
""[Wicked] understood that they do have that cultural impact. I think what they probably misunderstood is that people love to hate them.
""I think the exclusivity of allowing them to see it weeks before everyone else was probably not right when […] the rest of the way Wicked has always appeared is accessible.""
As Wicked opens in theatres around the world, the only thing higher than the notes the stars have to hit are the expectations from fans.
""I believe out of Wicked fans, I think Australia's like the second biggest market,"" Ms Ferry says.

""We have a country filled with people who are just obsessed with musical.
""I think the issue might be, does the movie deliver on the things that people love about the musical?
While Wicked has a well-known narrative, Mr Hughes says Barbie's ""blank slate"" meant ""it could be anything"" to audiences.
""It could be whatever you wanted it to be and there's been so many interpretations of what the true storyline of the Barbie movie was,"" he says.
""But for Wicked, they probably have a much tighter path to walk.
""It is going to be interesting to see how that resonates with the market.""",JBy Jessica Riga,Sun 24 Nov,0

In recent weeks, pop culture doppelgangers have descended on parks and public squares across the US and UK to battle it out for the coveted title of best look-alike, cash prizes, and bragging rights.
The internet's favourite 'it' boys have all been featured such as Timothee Chalamet, Harry Styles and Paul Mescal.
Even Australia's own Dom Dolla has been represented via hundreds of men with moustaches.
Early last week, Triple J Drive decided to run the contest.
Drive presenters Tyrone and Abby said they were ""absolutely"" influenced by the contests they've seen over in the UK and US.

""With the rise of celebrity look-alikes happening across the world, we thought it would be fun to try our own but on a national (and some international) scale across radio and socials,"" they said.
""We had over 250 Dom Dolla look-alikes apply from every state and territory and quite a few international.
""All we needed was a man with a stache and mullet, and in this country, there is no shortage.""
Many fans wanted ""justice for Beanie Dom"" after he came second in the competition. (Instagram: @triple_j)
Look-alike contests, drag performances and impersonators of icons — from Elvis Presley to Marilyn Monroe — have been around for decades.
But here's why this craze has been going viral.
It all began when a New York City-based contest was launched to find a Timothee Chalamet look-alike.
Posters advertising the contest appeared across Manhattan and social media in the weeks leading up to the event.
On the fateful Sunday, thousands of Chalamet wannabes, journalists and spectators gathered.

The winner, 21-year-old Miles Mitchell, earned the loudest applause, donning a Willy Wonka costume he thrifted.
Chalamet himself even made a surprise appearance — prompting others to organise their own contest in the hopes their favourite celeb would turn up.
The event took social media by storm, with one person commenting on X it was a ""historic pop culture moment"".
Lauren Rosewarne, an associate professor and pop culture expert at the University of Melbourne, has an idea about why these contests are so popular.
""Celebrity look-alike contests are yet another way to participate in celebrity culture,"" Ms Rosewarne said.
""They are also social opportunities that are a bit fun and silly and potentially an opportunity for participants and onlookers to be part of a media event.""

Flinders University associate lecturer Katharine Perrotta says their popularity was indicative of broader trends in youth culture.
""I also think that these contests offer an option for a non-threatening way to engage in public desire.
""Because of their position as 'vintage objects', these contests offer an opportunity for people to engage in objectification in ways that are perceived as less predatory or 'problematic'.""
And when it comes to what it could mean for a contest winner, Ms Rosewarne imagines that someone ""distinctly entrepreneurial might be able to parlay their success into certain kinds of influencing"".
Caitlin Adams, lecturer in the department of media at the University of Adelaide, says social media has made it easier to spread the discussion about these events.

""Its capacity to allow users and media outlets to post and reply to updates in real time is a large reason why these events are going viral,"" Ms Adams said.
""Also, the idea that a celebrity might attend feeds into the fantasy of it all.
""This perceived possibility is exacerbated at the moment because of Chalamet's attendance, but also some of the folklore about other celebrities attending their own contests and losing.""
Dolly Parton and Charlie Chaplin are some names that get tossed around for this.
Our fascination with celebrity look-alikes is nothing new.
Television game show Stars In Their Eyes allowed look-alike contestants to impersonate their favourite singers.
But the latest competitions have one thing in common — the celebrities are all young and male.

It's a complete switch in the traditional power dynamics.
""There is a very long history of beauty pageants centred around appraising women's appearances,"" Ms Rosewarne said.
""I imagine that there would be concerns that having a look-alike competition for a famous woman lends itself to being a bit too ""beauty contest""-ish and veering a little too close to the scrutinising of women's bodies that is widely understood to already be prolific and often viewed as problematic.
""The contests centred around male celebrity look-alikes tend to be less about ""beauty"" and more about capturing ""something"" that makes the celebrity unique looking.""
This could link back to the 'hot rodent men' trend that was all the rage earlier this year.
These men tend to have lean physiques, scruffy hair, beady eyes — essentially, they're unconventionally attractive.
The likes of Jeremy Allen White, Timothee Chalamet, Barry Keoughan and Matty Healy (among others) have all been classified in this category — and two of them have had a look-alike contest in their honour.

Ms Perrotta says it's simpler to engage in this kind of desire in regards to men, because it's not understood to be dangerous to them.
""To publicly judge a woman in any way on her appearance, no matter how innocent the impetus for this may be, aligns too closely with misogyny.""
According to a flyer posted on Reddit, a Zendaya look-alike contest — the first competition with a female subject — is set to be held in the actress' hometown of Oakland, California this week.
Users on Reddit have expressed their concern for the event.
The winner will reportedly receive a cash prize and some hair products. (Instagram: @consequencedaily)
""I don't think this is a very good idea. Some of the male celebrity ones have been funny, but I think that people are too likely to start getting very mean about girls participating in Hollywood actress look-alike competitions,"" one user wrote.
""People are going to be really mean about this one,"" another said.
Ms Perrotta says it's difficult to gauge what the response will be at a female event.
""There is always the opportunity for bad actors to comment and/or share the event on social media to a broader and more dangerous online community.
""Given that Zendaya, and presumably those who will enter this contest, are Black women, this further opens up the possibility for harassment and misogynoir.""
Who knows how long these viral look-alike contests will be coming to bless us.
But, one thing we do know is that, right now, they're still happening.
Another Paul Mescal competition is set to go ahead in an Irish Pub in London this week, Miles Teller in Philadelphia, plus Zendaya's as well.
Ms Adams says the sheer number of these events currently is in part because of the pop culture hype around them.
""That said, given how long we've been having look-alike contests, it's likely that these will continue once the current hype has passed, just with much less fanfare.""
Meanwhile, Ms Rosewarne believes the hype will deteriorate as ""audiences will very quickly move onto something else"".
Here's a look at some of the contests we've seen so far.

Journalist Katrina Mirpuri organised this contest in Soho Square.
She told the BBC the reason why she started it was because ""people need to have some fun after all the dreary news we're having"".

Zayn Malik fans were quick to criticise the look-alike contest, stating it drew less than realistic expectations.
""None of them looked anything like him,"" one user wrote on X.
""Zayn I'm so sorry,"" another commented.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-23/australian-fashion-industry-survive-clothes-morally-fraught/104634586,I want the Australian fashion industry to survive. But the making of clothes is a morally fraught concept,"Her name is Look 28. She walked the haute couture runway in Paris earlier this year: a simple black velvet bodice, a butterfly-curved explosion of black tulle for a skirt, decorated below with a mosaic of fine beading, that continued down the leg of the model, making her part robot, part ancient Byzantine ceiling. A little felt skull cap with a small spout of feathers completed the whimsy.
It was an astonishingly beautiful and intricate dress made by the creative designer of the storied house of Schiaparelli, Daniel Rosebery, and it stepped off the runway and into the real world this week, worn by Cynthia Erivo in London, one of the stars of the new movie juggernaut, Wicked. The dress looked glorious on a singer and actor who knows the power of costume and design to transform. It is a dress of dreams — one we mere mortals will never get to wear. And that's its point.
It is almost embarrassing to admit how much pleasure seeing this dress out in the world gave me, but then again, I am well past apologising for the pleasures of design, fashion, couture and the remarkable creations that have entranced us for millennia. It's not just me. The stolen Egyptian and Roman costumes and jewellery treasures found in museums around the world prove it's not just me.
That dress represents the pinnacle of an industry that here in Australia is worth $27 billion, and while our designers may never work at the level of true haute couture, the trickle-down effect in fashion is real, just as Miranda Priestly reminded us all those years ago: our ""cerulean blue"" version of Look 28 is coming for us soon.
Devil Wears Prada - Cerulean Top
The Australian fashion community is in survival mode at the moment, trying to draw attention to the critical need for Australian Fashion Week to continue, now that the entertainment juggernaut IMG has abandoned the event they have owned and run since 2005.
Designers and labels have made public representations to state and federal governments to help save an event that is tied to fashion, manufacturing and retail industries that employ thousands and economically contribute billions.
The event has always represented a significant moment of tension between Sydney and Melbourne, which had to take a more retail-based approach with its Melbourne Fashion Week (fashion that was in the stores and ready to buy at the time of runway) while AFW instead was an attempt at an industry event representing our highest echelons of style and design, the closest you might get to a London or New York fashion week.
The 2024 ARIA Awards are here and Australian music royalty are strutting their stuff on the red carpet.
Over the years the event has launched genuine design stars like Akira Isogawa, Collette Dinnigan and the Zimmermann sisters, and was always the happy hunting ground of icons like Carla Zampatti.
Australian designers now fear that if they lose the focus of the signal event that is fashion week, the industry loses as well in terms of attention and ultimately sales.
I find it sad that a significant industry event that follows a celebrated runway tradition might be about to end, but I also have a nagging question in mind: what is a fashion show anyway?
If you are not actually revealing a new season collection to potential local or international buyers anymore — and nobody comes over the waves these days to see our designs — then what is the purpose? In a digital-led space, do you hold a costly event like fashion week just to keep sweet with influencers, who certainly seem to be the majority presence at the Melbourne event?
Like filmmakers and musicians, our contemporary designers work in a connected, international world: one well aware of what the Schiaparellis are up to and what their artistry and innovation means for the fashion lover of the towns and suburbs of Australia. They need to continue presenting designs that may be aspirational only for some, but in reality, become the bedrock of a local, retail market.
But we the consumers don't help. Our addiction to cheap, fast fashion — one of the biggest in the world — throttles design, production and sales of Australian fashion in ways that I'm sure many of us don't allow ourselves to admit.
Clothing and the fashion industry are well-known now as some of the biggest polluters on earth: so how much new stuff – well-made or mass-produced — do we really need?
In the end, the Victoria's Secret show this week was a spectacularly failed reboot, because the one issue that this ultra-successful brand was trying to fix — diversity — was made even more obvious by its attempts at inclusion.
In my many years of journalism I've been an industry and manufacturing reporter — a private passion of mine in the state of Victoria that has lived through both rust-belt and innovation periods. I've been an art, fashion and design reporter, as well as a happy consumer of new styles, so I feel the pull of many influences when I write this.
I want Australian fashion to survive — and I want it to develop into the leading aesthetic industry that is has always had the potential to be. But the making of clothes is a morally fraught concept now.
I am delighted and creatively stimulated by the brilliance of Cynthia Erivo's frock: a mad folly of extraordinary craft, labour and money that will be worn only once, maybe donated to a museum, but will live on in memory and in the diffusion of its aesthetic down through the more affordable items we will be buying next.
So, even extravagant confections like this play a role, and not only in keeping alive crafts that we revere enough to fill our museums with their examples, but also employ generations, and keep alive retail markets that still matter.
You may wish that that such retail wasn't as economically significant as it is — but I bet you weren't thinking that when you last found that perfect little black dress at 50 per cent off. Or paid only $14 for a dress that won't last you a month.
This weekend we have a lovely little reflection on the magical acting partnership that is at the heart of Wicked, as well as insight into the murder mystery that still shrouds one of our greatest designers.
Have a safe and happy weekend and raise a glass to the champion of the ARIA awards this week, the elusive and quicksilver singer Troye Sivan who won album of the year with Something to Give Each Other. This will help with the celebration:

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-21/swiss-region-to-vote-on-cost-of-eurovision-2025/104632938,Swiss region to vote on cost of 'blasphemous' Eurovision 2025,"Basel voters are expected to decide on Sunday whether they should spend tens of millions of dollars to host the 2025 Eurovision Song Contest, with opponents decrying a ""waste"" of public funds for a ""blasphemous"" music performance.
A controversial Eurovision has come to an end with the winner crowned.
If inhabitants in the northern Swiss region of Basel-Stadt block the 34.96 million Swiss francs ($60.78 million) needed to put on the annual TV extravaganza, ""Eurovision will need to be scaled way back,"" 2025 edition communications lead Edi Estermann said.
He said the event, currently planned to last around 10 days with numerous public happenings around Basel, ""would be reduced to a big TV show"" on a single evening.
""And that would of course create far lower value for the city and for all of Switzerland.""

Swiss singer Nemo's 2024 Eurovision victory in Malmo, Sweden, gave Switzerland the right to host next year's event. The city of Basel secured hosting duties after winning out over other Swiss cities in August.
But last month, the Christian fundamentalist Federal Democratic Union of Switzerland (EDU) submitted the signatures needed to push through a referendum on whether to grant the funds approved by regional authorities for the show.
""The first argument is financial,"" EDU board member Philippe Karoubi said.
""This is a totally disproportionate public expenditure, a true waste.""
It may seem a bit weird Australia is competing in a contest that starts with ""Euro"" given we're so far away from the continent. But we've been taking the Eurovision stage for years now.
The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) media alliance, which owns Eurovision, finances the contest — but deems that given the financial benefits host cities typically reap, they should help to cover security costs especially.
EBU says Malmo has seen ""a large number of international visitors coming to the city, spending generously while there"" since this year's contest began in May.
Based on recent contests in Malmo and Liverpool, Basel hopes to make about 60 million Swiss francs ($104 million) from the event.
The problem was that public funds would be used while the financial benefits would mainly be pocketed by private actors, Mr Karoubi said.
Mr Karoubi called Bambie Thug's performance a ""public form of Black Mass"". (Reuters: Jessica Gow)
Besides the financial argument, he said EDU opposed financing a show that it believes has become ""a vector of ideological provocations, which are clearly contrary to Western Judeo-Christian values"".
He slammed ""blasphemic performances"", some verging on ""the occult"", decrying that this year's performance by Irish artist Bambie Thug as ""almost a public form of Black Mass"".
The competition, he charged, had also become ""an international platform that has been completely instrumentalised to promote ideologies"" promoting things like ""wokism"".
EDU has also decried how the contest increasingly finds itself mired in debate over international conflicts.
Russia was excluded in 2022 after the country invaded Ukraine, so why is Israel still participating in 2024?
The party, which states on its website that it ""stands unconditionally alongside the state of Israel as the fulfilment of biblical prophecies"", has also expressed shock at the ""true harassment"" of Israeli contender Eden Golan in Malmo.
Mr Karoubi slammed the ""anti-Israel and anti-Semitic demonstrations"", insisting the hostility shown was ""unacceptable and incompatible with the 'United by Music' spirit of the competition"".
While some of EDU's statements may appear fringe, its financial arguments could gain traction among Swiss voters who typically like to keep a tight hold on the purse strings.
But if the credit is rejected, there is little room left to manoeuvre in time for the May 17, 2025, finale.
It could be moved to another Swiss city, Mr Estermann said.
But that ""would have to be carefully considered"", he said.
""Preparations are already well advanced in Basel.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-18/jake-paul-mike-tyson-netflix-yellowjackets-oscars/104613684,More than double the Australian population tuned into Tyson vs Paul but not everyone was happy,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recap the pop culture and entertainment news that you might have missed over the past few days.
Let us get you caught up.
It might sound like it was ripped straight from an Onion headline, but this weekend's hottest viewing was the big fight between 27-year-old YouTuber/general nuisance Jake Paul and 58-year-old retired heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.
The high-profile bout was a big swing for Netflix — the platform has been dabbling in live-streamed events for the past year, but nothing to this scale — and it seems to have very much paid off.

Netflix is reporting that 60 million households tuned into the fight, which was broadcast on Saturday afternoon, Australian time, peaking at 65 million concurrent streams worldwide.
But while more than double the entire Australian population watched the fight, not all were happy with the service. More than 85,000 viewers lodged complaints on media-monitoring website Down Detector about buffering and lags during the event.
Both #netflixdown and Unwatchable trended on X (formerly Twitter) at points during the event, with many fight fans flooding the platform to complain.
For anyone that didn't catch the stream or are still waiting for Netflix to buffer, the 27-year-old won after a unanimous decision from the judges.
Tune in next week to catch Joe Exotic fight that kid who makes millions unwrapping toys on YouTube (probably).
Yellowjackets fans might be gearing up for the soon-to-be-released third season of the show, but the creators have just been hit with a lawsuit that accuses them of ripping off the whole thing.
The series, which debuted on Showtime back in 2021, follows a New Jersey girls soccer team's struggle to survive after their plane crashes in a remote forest in 1996. The series also flashes forward to survivors in the present, as their experience continues to haunt them into adulthood.
Showtime, Lionsgate Entertainment and show creators Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson were all named in a lawsuit that claims Yellowjackets ""borrows heavily"" from 2015 survival thriller film Eden ""to the point at which they are substantially similar"".
In the filing, Eden is described as ""a survival drama/thriller about a US men's soccer team that crashes on a deserted island after a World Cup match"".

""Comparing the film to the show's plots, setting, mood, pace, stories, characters, sequence of events, themes, and scene/dialogue similarities, demonstrates that the two works, in most respects, are identical,"" reads the complaint.
""These substantially, strikingly similar elements leave little doubt that most substantive elements of Yellowjackets are copied from Eden.""
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages and an injunction that would bar Showtime from further promoting and airing the series.
Lyle and Nickerson have previously said that Yellowjackets was partly inspired by the real-life 1972 Andes flight disaster, which saw members of a Uruguayan rugby team resort to cannibalism for survival.
Several films have been directly inspired by the 1972 crash, including 1993's Alive, and 2023's Society of the Snow.
The creatives at the centre of the Yellowjackets allegations have yet to comment on the lawsuit.
It's not John Mulaney waxing lyrical about Field of Dreams, but we'll take it: Comedian Conan O'Brien has been tapped to helm the 97th Annual Academy Awards in 2025.
It's the first time the former late night host (and former Simpsons writer: monorail forever) is picking up the gig, after back-to-back years with Jimmy Kimmel as emcee.
""He is the perfect person to help lead our global celebration of film with his brilliant humour, his love of movies and his live TV expertise,"" Academy CEO Bill Kramer and president Janet Yang said in a joint statement.
The 2025 Oscars ceremony will take place on Sunday, March 2 (Monday, March 3 for us Aussies) but the race has already begun with the Governors Awards, which are considered a de-facto campaign stop for Oscar hopefuls as awards season gets underway.
The event, put on by the film academy's board of governors, is honouring the late Quincy Jones, James Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, filmmaker Richard Curtis and casting director Juliet Taylor.
Good news for fans of tiny little red undies.
Aussies have been drooling over singer Troye Sivan's *ahem* provocative performances on his Sweat tour in the US with Charli XCX for MONTHS, and now the prodigal son has returned to the homeland (Perth).
Sivan is back in the country to tour his latest album, Something To Give Each Other, which recently nabbed a Grammy nomination for the Bag-Raiders-sampling 'Got Me Started' as well as four ARIA nominations, including Album of the Year.
He took home four ARIAs at last year's ceremony, including Song of the Year for 'Rush'.
Charli XCX seems to be already missing her Sweat friend, pulling out a Sivan impersonation during her SNL hosting gig over the weekend.
Sivan immediately made Charli-as-Rush-Troye his Instagram DP because of course he did.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-14/cross-aldis-hodge-ryan-eggold-ben-watkins-interviews/104602472,New TV series Cross goes where the books and films don't,"When ABC News caught up with the cast and crew of Cross, Aldis Hodge who plays the titular decorated homicide detective and forensic psychologist Alex Cross was quick to point out that the new TV series is nothing like the two movies starring Morgan Freeman or the one starring Tyler Perry, saying he didn't draw from them to portray his character.
""That's not a slight,"" Hodge said.
""My performative process, I can't allow other influences to shift my perspective or my approach to something, right?
""And I would impose that other artists make sure that their perspective is solely theirs and their own, because the best thing that you can bring to it is your own full perspective.
""I needed to figure out how I connected to the character, and that came about from conversations with Ben Watkins, the showrunner and creator, and then also [author] James Patterson.
""Much due respect to the work that has already transpired but I let nothing disrupt my process.
""I'm very singular, quite focused and very strategic.""
Cross (Aldis Hodge) and Sampson (Isaiah Mustafa) have a tight bond. (Supplied: Prime Video)
Isaiah Mustafa who plays fellow detective and Cross's best friend John Sampson agreed this was important.
The TV series is a fresh take on the James Patterson crime thriller novels. The first in the series Along Came a Spider was published in 1993, followed by Kiss the Girls in 1995.
In the TV show, Cross is faced with a sadistic serial killer leaving a string of bodies strewn around Washington DC. As Cross and Sampson track the killer a mysterious threat from Cross's past returns to destroy everything he's done to keep his grieving family, career, and life together.
In a complete 360 to the type of role we're accustomed to seeing him in, New Amsterdam's Ryan Eggold plays the serial killer Ed Ramsey with so much charm, it's unsettling.

""It starts with the script that Ben Watkins wrote,"" Eggold said.
""This character was so on the page. The writing was so alive, and that duality was very present.
""And in terms of the charm, we see in so many of these docu-series and things, so often, these killers are very charming in terms of being able to lure people in and things like that.
""And then ultimately, the question was, what does that look like in real life?
""How in this life would you get to that point where you didn't have the empathy or the remorse and you were able to inflict this kind of pain?
""Trying to find that truthfully was the challenge.
""And then I had an amazing scene partner to play all that with, who was an incredible counterbalance and very much informed, I think, my performance so much because so much of my performance was just listening and watching and reacting to her incredible authenticity in the part.""
Eloise Mumford played Shannon Witmer, but not as your typical victim. (Supplied: Prime Video)
Eloise Mumford is the scene partner he's talking about.
Mumford plays Shannon Witmer who meets Ramsey on an online dating site and is intrigued by his charm and connections only to become one of his victims.
""I mean, it's twisted, right? But all of it's twisted. And in survival, it becomes twisted.
""If she could get him to like her, love her, even, then maybe he wouldn't kill her.
""And there's even some Stockholm syndrome in that.
""So, exploring all of it was really fun. And honestly, I think it gives real stakes to the whole show when you are invested in the victim's story.""
Showrunner and executive producer Ben Watkins's name comes up again and again when you speak to the cast.
But Watkins was at first nervous about stepping into the franchise.

He did exactly that, putting a fresh spin on an old tale, with the television series going where the books did not.
""I got very excited as I read the books,"" Watkins said.
""I started to see things in the books that I felt like I could bring to television that we haven't seen on screen yet.
""The television version would have the room to do that, because we have more hours to tell the story.
""And more importantly, I started to get into this idea of where we are in this day and age this would be a good time to have a hero like Alex Cross.
""And so, from that point on, any reservations I had went out of the window, and it was all about what the opportunity was.""
Watkins says the show doesn't shy away from the fact that the main character is a Black cop.
Cross faces some unique challenges as a Black detective. (Supplied: Prime Video)
""This is something that I think is evident throughout countries all across the world, but is obviously very present in the US, is, where we're at with the conversation between law enforcement and the community, and specifically the Black community,"" Watkins said.
""I think that's a conversation that's being had every day, and unfortunately, periodically there are headlines that bring it back to the front of the topics of discussion.
""And so, some people would shy away from controversy.
""But I got a really key piece of advice at some point in my life from a director who was signing on to a project that had a controversial topic, and I said, 'are you afraid of that at all?' And he said, 'if you consider yourself an artist, when there's a controversy, you don't shy away, you lean in.'""
He says that stuck with him, and sometimes creators underestimate audiences.
""So, I can't do a show about a Black cop and then tiptoe around the fact that there's some conflict between law enforcement and the Black community from time to time, but I want to make sure that the way that gets handled in our show is organic and built into the fabric of the show through these characters and they have a nuanced perspective.""
There's long been a debate in publishing circles about whether authors should only write what they know.
But Watkins doesn't buy into this.
""There's things in these books that are more specific and feel like they really are paying respect to the DC that a lot of people don't know, the Black neighbourhoods in DC, instead of just the Capitol and the power player side of things,"" Watkins said.
""And there is a really honest and sincere reflection of a Black family in the books, and that was written by a white man.
""And I would put it to you like [this].
""If someone told me that, 'oh, a white man invented the typewriter' and I want to write, I'm not going to not write because that was the typewriter.
""I feel like I can take that story and bring something fresh and new to it, and the way I hit those keys is going to be very specific to my experience.
""And the fact that he created a story that had a Black man at the centre of it creates a great opportunity for me, and he'll acknowledge this too, I can take it to a place he couldn't because of my experience.""

The American composer, record producer, film and television producer, arranger, conductor, instrumentalist, record company executive, magazine founder, artist and humanitarian has died. He was 91.
Media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who worked with Jones when he was a film producer on the 1985 film The Color Purple as well as the 2023 reboot, posted her ""favourite photo"" of the two of them to Instagram with a caption stating ""I had never experienced, nor have since, anyone who's [sic] heart was so filled with love"".
Jones reached EGOT status — he was part of an exclusive club of artists to have received an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.
Fellow EGOT Elton John said on Instagram: ""Nobody had a career as incredible as Quincy Jones. He played with the best and he produced the best.""
Singer The Weeknd posted a photo to X of the two of them together, later sharing the foreword he wrote for Jones's 2022 book 12 Notes: On Life and Creativity saying: ""My fans know how important Quincy was to the fabric of my music. I was given the opportunity to write a foreword to his book and tried to capture what he meant to me as a human.""
Jones's iconic productions included The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. He was an executive producer and composer for the show and was an EP on 2022's Bel Air. Star Will Smith said Jones was ""the true definition of a Mentor, a Father and a Friend"".

Jones was a master at inventing musical hybrids, fusing pop, soul, hip-hop, jazz, classical, African and Brazilian music across mediums that included music, movies and television.
Jones's historic career ranged from producing Michael Jackson's record-setting Thriller to prize-winning film and television scores and collaborations with Frank Sinatra and Ray Charles.
He won 28 Grammys and was nominated 80 times.
The list of artists he worked with is long and includes Michael Jackson, Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, and Aretha Franklin.
Here are a few of the hits he produced.
Jones produced the Michael Jackson albums Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad and many of the classic Jackson hits we know today such as Thriller, Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, Dirty Diana, Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, The Girl Is Mine with Paul McCartney, Man In the Mirror, Rock With You, Beat It, and Billie Jean, which spent seven weeks at number one on the Billboard charts in 1983.
Jones and Jackson connected when they worked together on the 1978 film The Wiz, which re-imagined The Wizard of Oz with an all-Black cast.

Written by Bart Howard in 1954, Fly Me to the Moon was first recorded by Kaye Ballard.
By the time Frank Sinatra covered the song in 1964, it's estimated more than 100 other versions had been recorded.
Jones arranged Sinatra's version which was on the album It Might as Well Be Swing, accompanied by Count Basie.
Fly Me To The Moon (2008 Remastered).
Lionel Richie approached Jones in 1985 suggesting an all-star African famine relief concert.
Jones suggested a record instead.
The result is We Are the World which involved a host of artists such as Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Cyndi Lauper, Tina Turner and Diana Ross.

Jones produced Lesley Gore's It's My Party from her 1963 debut studio album I'll Cry If I Want To.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-29/teacup-tv-series-review-yvonne-strahovski/104527432,Teacup is a slightly silly horror TV show and the perfect comfort watch,"It's a great time to be a fan of horror.
If you're into serial killers, hammy melodrama and religious symbolism, Ryan Murphy's Grostesquerie (Disney+) will give you all that and Travis Kelce playing a nurse. If you prefer supernatural monsters, survival horror and intricate worldbuilding, then you can't go wrong with From (now in Season 3 on Stan).
And if you want more of From but you also like conspiracies, an (un)healthy dose of body horror and a touch of family drama, then Teacup may just be the new horror show for you.
What: Puzzlebox mystery horror about a family stuck on their farm with a mysterious entity hunting them down. Produced by James Wan and loosely based on Robert R. McCammon's book Stinger.
Starring: Yvonne Strahovski, Scott Speedman, Chaske Spencer and Caleb Dolden.
When: Streaming on Binge now.
Likely to make you feel: Intrigued, anxious, thrilled.
Teacup and From are cut from the same cloth. A cursory Google didn't result in a clean collective term for this horror/thriller subgenre, but you know it when you see it:
Take a group of people with disparate personalities and/or pre-existing tensions; stick them in a single location they can't escape from; give them a mysterious existential threat to survive, overcome and solve.
There are also elements of puzzlebox mystery and survival horror at play, and they usually hinge on the interpersonal drama between the characters.
This is not a new phenomenon; think of shows like Lost (2004-2010), Under the Dome (2013-15), Wayward Pines (2015-16) or The Society (2019). And there are countless more.

Most of them, if we're being honest, end up failing to give satisfying answers to the tantalising questions they ask at the beginning of their runs. Some even get cancelled before being able to provide any answers at all.
But we keep being drawn back to them, over and over again.
As most of these shows are, Teacup is centred around an isolated rural property. This one is in Georgia, USA, owned by veterinarian Maggie Chenoweth (Yvonne Stahovski, Handmaid's Tale) and her husband James (Scott Speedman, Felicity). The pair start to notice the animals on their farm acting erratically, but when their neighbours come to Maggie with a distressed and injured horse, things really begin to spiral.
The Chenoweths' young son goes missing while chasing after one of the animals and, meanwhile, there's a mysterious stranger wearing a gas mask lurking about with a paint gun spraying a line around the property's perimeter.
So what's going on? It all certainly seems mysterious. And the show does a good job of creating a sense of dread during that first night, drawing you in.
Is the masked stranger friend or foe? (Supplied: Binge)
But if you think you've seen this set-up before, you're not wrong. Teacup can feel like a veritable bingo card of genre tropes.
A strained marriage between the protagonists? Check. A child becoming a conduit to a mysterious entity and saying spooky things? Check. A stranger telling the main characters to ""trust no one""? Check.
But familiarity is not necessarily a bad thing.
There's a comfort in watching a show hit the familiar beats of its genre. And having that framework lets a new series get on with telling their story without having to spend too much time setting the table.
Produced by horror master James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring) and written by Ian McColluch (Yellowstone), Teacup is loosely based on Robert R. McCammon's book Stinger — so if you know what the book's about, then you have some idea of where the show is going.
In these early episodes, the pacing of the show takes a leaf from The Walking Dead: short bursts of mayhem interspersed between stretches of quiet and contemplation. It's a lot of two people walking through the woods talking about their feelings while trying to figure out what's going on.
Ruben (Chaske Spencer) and James (Scott Speedman) reluctantly work together to figure out what's going on. (Supplied: Binge)
But the half-hour episodes ensure things never get too bogged down and it only has eight episodes — with two released each week so the final episode airs on Halloween (of course!)
By the middle of the series, a lot is revealed through exposition and flashbacks, which moves the series into a different direction.
This means the show doesn't lead you into multiple annoying red herrings, as others in the sub-genre are wont to do, but you also never feel like you're an active participant in figuring out the mystery, which is really half the fun of these shows.
Strahovski is effective as the protagonist Maggie — a strong, calm, natural leader in the face of adversity on multiple fronts, and a far cry from the often monstrous Serena Joy she played on The Handmaid's Tale.

Chaske Spencer (The English) is the other stand-out on the show, playing the Chenoweths' neighbour Ruben Shanley, who is reeling from his own personal dramas and wants nothing more than to get off the farm and be as far away from the people on it as possible.
Teacup ultimately doesn't have much that's new to say, and the reveals are disappointing given the great promise of the set-up. But there is still plenty of fun to be had, with a handful of genuinely creepy, thrilling sequences and solid performances.
It might be strange to think of a horror show as a comfort watch, but that's what Teacup is. If you're a fan of the sub-genre then you will definitely relish this show. All the elements are there.
From a twisted take on Freaky Friday to a deeply satisfying 'eat the rich' fable, here are some Halloween movies that might give you a jolt but won't keep you up at night.
And being only four hours long, it's easily bingeable over a weekend (or a long Halloween night). Teacup never overstays its welcome.
As one mysterious character on the show says: ""Coming over to this side's a piece of cake. Heading back the other way, that's the problem.""
That could apply to the show's creators, as well as your experience of it as a viewer.
Teacup is streaming on Binge.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-23/heath-ledger-scholarship-winner-2024-andrea-solonge-interview/104507284,Sydney actor Andrea Solonge is the winner of the 12th Heath Ledger scholarship,"At a ceremony in West Hollywood, Australians in Film announced on Wednesday that Sydney actor Andrea Solonge is the 12th winner of the coveted Heath Ledger Scholarship.
""It's still a really big shock,"" Solonge told ABC News.
Solonge, 28, will receive a prize package valued at $US60,000 ($90,0000), as well as a year-long precentorship by former recipient Bella Heathcote (Pieces of Her, Relic).
Solonge was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo and came to Australia when she was a baby. Her mother is Congolese and her father is Nigerian.
""My mum was a lawyer back in the Congo,"" Solonge said.
""And her first language is French, so she did her studies in French. And when my mother and father got married at the time they immigrated, because we lived in the Congo, [there was a] civil war there, so they could give me a better life here.
""They since split and Mum had to give up her home, her law degree, her family to move here to give me a better life.""
Solonge says her mother has been working full-time, taking care of her and believing in her.
The 12th Heath Ledger Scholarship Prize includes:

Solonge starred in the Stan series Prosper alongside Richard Roxborough and Rebecca Gibney.
New Australian drama series Prosper stars Richard Roxburgh and Rebecca Gibney as the Quinns: the powerful family behind a fictional megachurch.
She was also in Taika Waititi's Apple TV+ series Time Bandits, and wants to do more of what she's being doing but on an international scale.
""It's been my dream for as long as I can remember to be working in the American film and TV industry,"" Solonge said.
""So, with the scholarship, I hope to attain a US agent and hopefully start writing projects, meeting producers and telling more of the stories I want to be in service to.""
She also wants to do more locally.
""That's one of the first things that I was exposed to being in Australia.
""And I have such a deep love for that.
""And I would love to once I've gone to the States and experienced this and had a taste of that, to come back to Australia and use any acquired networks or knowledge to come back and tell stories that reflect my experience as an African Australian, and also be in service to any narratives or even give back and do courses because the people in Australia have been so helpful to me in teaching me what I need to know, and what I need to do to be an artist in general.""
Established in 2012 in memory of award-winning actor Ledger, the scholarship is regarded globally as the hottest barometer for the best acting talent coming out of Australia.

Ledger, who died in 2008 at just 28 years of age, was known for his generosity and support of fellow actors and the scholarship carries on his legacy by offering a life-changing education and career development program to winners.
Solonge says Ledger was truly a creative artist in every sense of the word.
""I remember I used to watch his movies [when I was] a lot younger as a kid,"" Solonge said.
""And then I revisited them when I first started acting as a 16- to 17-year-old.
""And for me, that was a really lonely time of [being] quite a bit of an outcast, but there was something about him.
""You can watch an amazing actor and think, 'Oh, my gosh, I wanna do that.'
One of the judges, and multi-award-winning international film, television and theatre actor Sarah Snook (Succession, The Picture of Dorian Gray), said while there was tough competition for the scholarship, Solonge stood out.
""I loved getting to watch fresh faces showcase their talents and passion for acting,"" Snook said.
""It was a tough decision, as all the finalists were brilliant, but one stood out with a captivating depth and strength.
""I'm very excited for Andrea Solonge to be this year's 2024 Heath Ledger Scholarship recipient.""",MBy Mawunyo Gbogbo,Wed 23 Oct,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-23/kween-kong-global-all-stars-interview-chit-chat/104396444,"Raised a Jehovah's Witness, Kween Kong 'mastered the act of double lives' early on","Kween Kong is Australian drag royalty — and might soon reign globally, too. She's currently a finalist on the inaugural season of RuPaul's Drag Race: Global All Stars, where 12 queens from 12 versions of the drag reality show compete for a crown.
But Kween, real name Thomas Fonua, was already recognised as a leader within our drag community before she made it to the finals of Drag Race Down Under's second season in 2022.
Originally dabbling in drag while working as a professional touring dancer, the Kiwi-born Kween soon became a mainstay of Adelaide's scene as a talent on stage and as a community leader.
Inspired by the legacy of ballroom houses, Kween is the mother of the Haus of Kong, a collective for LGBTQI+ people looking for work, housing and support, and is a staunch advocate for queer people of colour in Australia. She is also a powerhouse performer: Watching her barrel roll through the air during a lip-sync is unforgettable.
Ahead of the finale this weekend (but before her drama with Italian queen Nehellenia kicked off, sorry!), ABC Entertainment chats to Kween about Global All Stars, how fellow Down Under queen Hannah Conda has sabotaged her algorithm, and her questionable viewing habits.
It means everything.
I'm a storyteller. Everything that I do in terms of my craft — costumes, inspiration, performance styles — is all derivative from my culture. I represent lots of other brown girls and island girls who approach drag from a different lens.
Hannah Conda stood tall against the globe's best on RuPaul's Drag Race UK vs the World. She hopes it changes how people view Australian drag.
And having that on a global stage, with 12 queens from 12 different countries, is so exciting. It is literally the biggest season of Drag Race. The werk room is ridiculous — It felt like we were at a Miss Universe competition.
And to get to make my mark as a Down Under queen! Our franchise gets a lot of shit for being low-budget. But the thing is, most of us are! That's our beauty, that's our grace. Look at our winners. They’re all cheap — well, not Isis [Aivs Loren] — but the rest of them. [Laughs]
People haven't necessarily connected with our franchise and our style of drag but I feel like, after Global, they won't be able to deny us.
My grandmother was such a warrior.
I'm a [trained] dancer but I didn't start with conventional Western forms. My grandma used to teach my sister and me to sing in language and traditional styles of dance, which is super-ceremonial.
Where I come from, all performance is ceremonial: There's such a weight and meaning to each movement. That's trickled into everything that I do across the board with drag. Everything has a purpose, everything has a message.
Some people used to think that [makes me] really serious, including Ru [on Drag Race Down Under season 2], but on Global, you see Ru look at me in the ways that I deserve to be seen this time.
In my first season, audiences saw a version of Kween who was introverted and struggling to get out of her head.
My intention this time was just to have fun. I had no pressure on myself. I just wanted to prioritise fun, joy and happiness of this experience over anything, because I know I got the skill set to blow the rest of these bitches out of the water.
I had the intention of just being an absolute dickhead and making RuPaul laugh.
I do. [Laughs]
Me and one of my best mates — we were dancers in the Australian Dance Theatre  — did a Halloween variety show called Gorelesque. It's gore and it's burlesque, so a bloody burlesque show.
When I say this was amateur hour, this was amateur amateur hour. One of the other acts did a ""ritual"" on stage where they were sacrificing all this meat, but it just looked like they were doing an on-stage barbecue. That set the tone for the day.
Our beautiful friends came to support our first gig, which was supposed to go for an hour [in total]. It went on for three-and-a-half and we were right at the end, so none of them could leave.
We first did a mega-mix of Scary Movie where I played Brenda and they played Cindy from the movie. Then we did 'I Will Survive', but it was Glee's mash-up of that with 'I'm A Survivor'.

That was day one drag for Kween Kong. We said, ""Listen, we will never be on Broadway, but let's give you the off-off off-Broadway of Gorillas in the Mist"". [Laughs]
Oh, I like Jacob. There's something about a short king that just gets my blood boiling. Team Jacob for sure.
It wasn't necessarily a sexual awakening, because I was raised in a very strict Jehovah's Witness family, but I had a sexuality awakening watching Xena: The Warrior Princess.
Lucy Lawless and Kevin Sorbo may have played the heroes, but Erik Thomson (right) as Hades had Kween Kong's heart. (Supplied: Universal Pictures)
I feel like if you look at Kween Kong next to Xena, she sets the tone of why I'm such a big warrior butch woman. I didn't realise [at the time] she was a lesbian, but there's something about that, right?
I did find Hercules very attractive, but my favourite in that whole series was Hades. Oh, my god!
On a flight back from Vancouver, I watched The Color Purple [the 2023 musical version] — a bad decision, because it's a horrible movie musical. I really tried to give it time and space, but I think it's meant for the stage and not for the screen. And I love Taraji P. Henson and Fantasia Barrino, but it was trash. I'm so sorry, it was absolutely trash!
I also watched the lady next to me watch Rabbit Proof Fence. There was something in the air on this Qantas flight coming home from Vancouver. People were feeling really fragile.
Oh! I also watched The Hunger Games again. I love the last two movies, and I always watch from the same point every time. Watching that one again did nothing for me, but I have just had to do it to myself. I'm a creature of habit.
Every time, from where they've just bombed one of the districts in [fourth film] Mockingjay: Part Two and they go to the bunker. I always have to watch from that point. Don't ask me why, but yeah, always.
I love this artist called Spice, she's a dancehall Jamaican queen. She's so dirty, and raps in Patois. My favourite song of hers is Bruck It.
Spice, Jugglerz - Bruck It (Official Video)
Because I was raised a Jehovah's Witness, I mastered the act of double lives very early in my life. I was such a naughty little kid. I'd be an angel at home, but at school, I'd be an absolute little arsehole.
I split my sister's netball skirt when I tried it on before rugby training — that was really funny. Oh, and I stole a Spice Girls album and hid it under my bed, even though I had no CD player in the house, because we were very poor. But I'd just look at it every night and read the liner notes.
Hannah Conda is responsible for Kween's Instagram explore page. Here's the most safe-for-work section.  (Supplied)
Well, [fellow Down Under finalist] Hannah Conda's done this to me.
When we were touring in the US, she kept whispering 'feet' next to my phone. Now my algorithms on Instagram and Tiktok are serving content of people doing weird things with their feet.
If anyone had no idea, they'd be like, 'Are you into feet, Kween?' No, I'm not! I'm a dancer. Keep your nasty things away from me!

""I was single when I wrote Top End Wedding,"" Tapsell told ABC News.
""And then I became pregnant while I was writing this show.
""So, I feel like becoming a screenwriter really has made me manifest what I wanted in my life.""
Bub is used as a term of endearment. (Supplied: Prime Video/John Platt)
Tapsell, who has a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Grace, wants you to know, though, that the Bub in Top End Bub is an eight-year-old.
Top End Bub is a follow-up to the 2019 smash hit film Top End Wedding. In the series, Tapsell (Love Child, The Sapphires, The Artful Dodger) and Gwilym Lee (Bohemian Rhapsody, The Great) reprise their roles as Lauren and Ned.

Lauren is a dynamic Indigenous lawyer ticking off her life goals in Adelaide. When her eight-year-old niece is orphaned, Lauren and her husband Ned reluctantly abandon their big-city goals and move to the Top End to raise the child.
Gladys-May Kelly makes her acting debut as Taya, aka Bub.
""She took the role with both hands and ran with it,"" Tapsell says of Kelly.
""She was just so inspiring to watch. As an adult, more and more doubt comes into your mind, whereas, seeing the beautiful kind of youthful curiosity that Gladys brought to the show made me realise, 'Oh, wow, I can just be here with you'.
""She was just so present and a delight to be with.""
If you think it's unusual for a series to follow a movie as its sequel, you're right.

""It's kind of crazy to think that we wrote the film almost 10 years ago,"" Tapsell said.
""And after it was released in 2019, we thought to ourselves, 'well, there's so much more to a marriage than just the wedding.'
""We were so proud of the film, and I had built up such a rapport with Gwilym that we thought, 'no, there's more to their marriage. We've only scratched the surface.'
""And we felt that a series was a perfect opportunity for Lauren and Ned to learn about each other and we felt that the NT [was the place to do that].""
Top End Bub showcases the natural beauty of the Northern Territory without resorting to stereotypes. (Supplied: Prime Video/John Platt)
Tapsell, a Larrakia and Tiwi woman, was born in Darwin and grew up in Kakadu National Park from the age of five.
""Most of my school holidays were spent bush walking, swimming, camping, fishing, so I really lived in the outdoors, essentially, and I didn't really appreciate it back then,"" Tapsell said.
""I really wanted the kind of childhood that Hollywood presented to me. I wanted to go walking through malls and checking out my crushes and eating pizza and burgers and sharing milkshakes with my girlfriends.
""Can you tell I watched Clueless?
""But as I've gotten older, I realised what a beautiful childhood that was. That time was more important than money and it wasn't the root of your happiness, and it was the simple pleasures that this place brought to me that I really thought would be the heart of the show.""
Top End Bub also stars Clarence Ryan (pictured), Ursula Yovich, Huw Higginson, Shari Sebbens, Elaine Crombie, Tracy Mann, Rob Collins, Brooke Satchwell and Guy Simon. (Supplied: Prime Video/John Platt)
Tapsell says the show provides a more authentic portrayal of the Top End than we're used to seeing.
""I think the show really does subvert the kind of stereotypes that we know the Territory to be,"" she said.
""Yes, it can be a hot, isolated place, but there's so much more to it. And I think we celebrate all of those parts.""
The portrayal of family also shows that one size doesn't necessarily fit all.
""I think it really does champion the kind of families that are formed in a non-conventional way,"" she said.
""I feel like so often the Aboriginal community can be depicted as a negligent kind of community that forgets about their children. But that's not what I grew up seeing.
""I grew up with a lot of attentive family members that loved the children in their community.
""So, at the heart of the story, that's what I wanted Top End Bub to celebrate and show.
""I really do believe that this show is going to cut through so much noise in terms of how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people actually are.
Tapsell says Top End Bub depicts non-conventional families. (Supplied: Prime Video/John Platt)
""I think using the world of the rom-com was the perfect fit because you always want to root for the characters in a rom-com. You always care about what happens to them.
""And so, for me to show you a family that really does try its best to work together despite how much they infuriate and press each other's buttons, I felt showing their humanity was the best way … to share my experience as an Aboriginal woman living with my community.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-21/g-flip-musician-melbourne-fashion-week-2024-ambassador-queer/104484648,G Flip brings their jorts and bandanas to Melbourne Fashion Week as the first non-binary ambassador,"Melbourne Fashion Week (M/FW) is here and this year it's trying very hard to be queer.
The event has come a long way since its launch 30 years ago, when it was mostly about increasing clothing sales in the city's CBD. The M/FW of today is more about the actual fashion.
It's also increasingly about sustainability, having become a dedicated space to consider the industry's future.
And this year's event, which runs from October 21-27, is focused on being inclusive, attempting to spotlight the needs and creations of diverse consumers and designers.
Hence the 2024 theme, ""You're Invited"", which organisers say is all about the ""individuality, community and expression"" of Melbourne's fashion scene.
Fashion is increasingly important to the queer, non-binary indie-pop artist. Born and raised in the leafy suburbs of Melbourne's south-east, the singer/songwriter/drummer has reached international levels of recognition just six years on from their 2018 debut single.
International audiences may best know G Flip from their marriage to Chrishell Stause, a US real estate agent who rose to prominence on the exceedingly popular reality show Selling Sunset.
But in Australia, they're most well-known for their inescapable, drum-heavy music, which also happens to be unapologetically queer.
Gay 4 Me — official music video
This year, they broke the record for the highest number of entries in a single triple j Hottest 100, and they have two ARIA Awards to their name. From next year, there will even be a wax figure in their image at Madame Tussauds in Sydney. (Which the museum is somewhat bizarrely touting as ""Australia's first non-binary wax figure"".)
As G Flip has risen from a wedding band drummer to super-stardom, they have made a conscious effort to remain delightfully true, not only to their sexuality and gender identity, but also to their decidedly masc sense of style.
""My mum recalls me telling her, 'I don't want to wear this outfit, I don't want to wear that outfit' and I used to choose my own outfits as a stubborn two-year-old and they always tended to be shorts, T-shirts, hats and sunglasses,"" G Flip tells ABC Entertainment.
When G Flip's emails to music producers went unanswered, the drummer-singer hatched a plan — they gave themselves a year to learn the ropes and make an album, and kicked off a clever campaign to make sure people paid attention.
Their relationship to fashion became complicated when they were in year 7 in high school, and remember witnessing the reactions to an older student's decision to come out.
""They were whispered about as the gay person in the school and that made me, as a 12-to-13-year-old, not want to share with anyone that maybe I thought I was queer. It definitely made me retract and feel a bit uneasy.""
That experience led G Flip to attempt to ""conform"" to the cis-het norm, by donning clothes they didn't want to wear.
It wasn't until after high school that G Flip felt safe enough to return to wearing what they wanted.
For them, that meant jorts, hats, bandanas, chunky belts, oversized garments and tank tops — which they say are a must for playing drums because of the shoulder movement they allow.
Since sharing their non-binary identity in 2021, G Flip has experimented with gender-affirming garments and cuts that help them feel more confident.
They've also leaned further into what they describe as their ""relaxed skate, kind of grunge vibes … with surfer hair … but definitely queer"" aesthetic.
""I love wearing a binder with certain outfits — it makes me feel better in my skin and with my gender identity,"" they say.
""And when you wear an outfit that makes you feel more confident, your mental state is better and that then directly impacts your life and your day.""
Then came Chrishell — whose fashion G Flip describes as more of the ""formal"" type you'd expect from a reality TV star — and who has influenced their style in recent years, too.

""Since marrying Chrishell, I've attended a lot more fancy events and red carpets, which has [plunged] me into a world of formal wear,"" G Flip says.
""I've always loved the suit, but since we [met] I've tried to learn the art of smart-casual, which I think I'm starting to nail: When we go for a dinner date, I always try to leave my ripped jeans aside, put on some nice, fitted slacks, maybe some suspenders, a nice, fitted suit.""
They have also been working on their more formal going-out looks so they can better complement Chrishell, who is ""always dressed so, so beautifully"".
""So definitely, I've got more suits and shirts in my closet these days.""

G Flip says it was ""beautiful and lovely"" to be asked to serve as M/FW's 2024 ambassador — the first ever non-binary person to hold the title.
Given their complicated history with fashion — and what they're trying to achieve by showing up unapologetically as themselves in front of the world — this makes a lot of sense.
""The backbone of my G Flip project, although it's music-based, is being the representation for the little me; the representation for younger kids who need someone that's queer and in the music industry [and] dressed in T-shirts and baggy clothes and caps,"" they say.
They believe clothing is ""an extension of who you are as a person"", describing it as ""everything"" for the queer community.
""So, I really want to let anyone growing up know you can express yourself and wear whatever you want to, no matter if it's from the 'men's' section or the 'women's' section, it doesn't matter.
""I think that would be giving off hectic Kanye energy,"" they argue, laughing.
""If somebody else thought that, then maybe, yeah, but I don't feel comfortable saying that. That's for other people to do.""
Would they like to be considered a queer icon in future? Possibly.
""If I can help someone else, I'm down for it. And if people think I'm an icon for doing that, then I'm down for it.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-16/power-book-ii-ghost-michael-rainey-jr-interview/104473384,Michael Rainey Jr ready to pick up phone if 50 Cent rings for more iterations of Power franchise,"In the early days of the television series Power, one of its stars Michael Rainey Jr filmed a skit with comedian BenDaDonnn in which Rainey is being hassled after getting into an elevator.
""The crazy thing is, I was with him that night, and he kind of sees the reaction that the fans get when they see me,"" Rainey Jr told ABC News.
""So, he was like, 'Yo, people really be trippin' when they see you.' And he was like, 'No, we gotta make a video about that.' And then we made that video, and it went crazy.""
Rainey Jr embodies the role of Tariq St Patrick so convincingly on the show that to some fans the two are one and the same, so much so, he used to get death threats.
""Oh yes, all types of death threats,"" Rainey Jr said.
He laughs, saying ultimately, it was validating as an actor.
""At first, I was like, 'What the heck is going on?' And then, after a while, I was like, 'okay, it makes sense,'"" he said.
""That means I'm doing something right.""
Power Book II: Ghost, also referred to as Ghost, is one of three spin-offs from the hit series Power, which is created by Courtney A Kemp who is also an executive producer on the show along with Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson. There is another spin-off in the works that explores the origin of its popular characters.
Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson is an executive producer on Power along with creator Courtney A Kemp. 50 Cent also starred in the series as Kanan Stark.
In Ghost, Tariq tries to balance his drug operation with his grades, love life, and family, and while he initially attempts to shed his father's legacy, he figures out that the only way to avoid the same fate is to become his father, only better.
Rapper 50 Cent is a major player in television, with a number of successful series to his name, Power being among them. The Power franchise first launched in 2014 and was centred around James St Patrick (Omari Hardwick), Tariq's father and a drug dealer nicknamed Ghost whose wish was to leave the criminal world behind.
So addictive is the Power Universe, as it's referred to, more than 1.6 billion hours have been watched globally.
The series performs particularly strongly in Black households in the United States in key markets including Washington DC, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles.
Streaming service Stan says in Australia, it has ""amassed a cult following, with each iteration of the franchise adored by fans across the country"".
Rainey Jr doesn't know what's next for Tariq, but if executive producers Courtney A Kemp or 50 Cent call, he'll be quick to answer. (Supplied: Stan)
Rainey Jr says seeing 50 Cent go from ""the greatest rapper ever"" to an entrepreneur, mogul and executive producer, and being part of that journey, is a blessing.
""I'm just blessed to be part of anything that he has going on, because anything he's doing right now, it's really history because it's not easy for people to come from the business that he was in, and then pivot, and then become as successful as he is now.
""So, he's just a great role model for me and a lot of people.""
50 Cent isn't the only music icon Rainey Jr works with on Ghost.
Rainey Jr says Mary J Blige, known as the queen of hip hop soul, was just as excited to meet him as he was her on the set of Power Book II: Ghost. (Supplied: Stan)
""And going from that to being on set with her and meeting her at the table read and her being just excited to meet me, as I was to meet her…that's crazy.
""And then even with Method Man, me and him were very familiar, because we're both from Staten Island. I play sports with his son.
""So, we're super familiar, but just being able to share the screen with each other, especially being that we're repping Staten Island, that's like the Forgotten borough of New York. Nobody claims Staten Island.

While fans disliked Tariq at first, Rainey Jr says there was a ""complete 180"" once Ghost was in train.
""Obviously, towards the end of the original Power, nobody liked Tariq,"" Rainey Jr said.
""So, that was the first thought in my head when we started the spin-off. I'm like, 'oh, man, I don't know what we're gonna do. I don't know how we're gonna do this.'
""But Courtney and her team of writers, they had a plan the whole time.
Rainey Jr says he appreciates all the fans of the Power Universe, even those who hate on him. (Supplied: Stan)
But with the final season of Ghost done and dusted, what's next?
""Who knows what's next?"" Rainey Jr says.
""I'm super excited to see what's to come. If they call me, I'mma pick up the phone.
""Obviously, they have the origin story coming, the prequel with little Ghost, little Tommy and everything, little Kanan and all of that.
""So, I'm super excited about that. But who knows what else they've got? They always got something up their sleeve,"" he laughs.
Rainey Jr is grateful for fans of the Power Universe.
""You guys have been such great supporters…I appreciate every single last one of them, even the ones that still throw hate to me.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-15/britpop-legends-oasis-sell-out-stadium-shows-in-melbourne-sydney/104473188,All Oasis shows in Sydney and Melbourne sell out within hours as extra date added,"Tens of thousands of fans have scrambled for tickets to four now sold-out stadium shows in Melbourne and Sydney from Britpop legends Oasis, with some paying more than $800 to secure a seat.
The band has announced a fifth and final show in Melbourne on November 4 next year due to the huge demand.
Pre-sale tickets for the shows at Melbourne's Marvel Stadium on October 31 and November 1 sold out yesterday and tickets for general admission, released at 10am on Tuesday, were gone within the hour.
The two Sydney shows at Accor Stadium on November 7 and 8 are also now sold out after thousands joined the online queue.
After 15 years of refuting any suggestion they might reform, Oasis are reuniting to headline a series of live concerts.
Prices started at $183.28, with the most expensive ticket advertised online for more than $800.
Earlier today, the Victorian government declared the tour a major event, which means tickets will be protected under anti-scalping laws.
Tickets cannot be resold for more than 10 per cent above their original value, and ticket package sellers are required to be authorised by the event organiser.
Sydney super fan Lesley Martin secured her spot in the pre-sale for $400.

She was just 16 when she saw Oasis play at her first ever concert in her homeland, Scotland.
""The price of my very first ticket was £17.50, so to pay $400 is a bit steep… I know a lot of people would find that really expensive,"" she said.
Ms Martin, whose dedication to Oasis led her to host a podcast about Britpop, said it was ""worth it"" but ""disappointing"" for people who can't afford the high cost.

""When you love a band and you love music, it's supposed to be about enjoying the music and that particular artist, to price people out of that isn't really what I think music is all about,"" she said.
""I’m just such a huge fan, and I never thought they would get back together. They will just be phenomenal.""
Liam and Noel Gallagher are getting the band back together after 16 years marred by a bitter sibling rivalry.
In October, Australian tour dates were announced to follow a sold out tour of 28 shows through the UK, Ireland, North America, Canada and Mexico through next year.
It will be the first time the band will make their way Down Under since 2005.
The reunion coincided with the 30th anniversary of the group's debut album, Definitely Maybe. A new anniversary reissue of the record earned Oasis their 8th UK number-one album and hit the Top 10 on the ARIA Charts in early September.
The shows are presented by the Australian and New Zealand arm of global touring titan Live Nation, which has been under scrutiny since Four Corners revealed the company was squeezing out local competition by acquiring smaller independent operators.
The investigation also found Live Nation, which earned $US23 billion last year, has been given millions in taxpayer funds to put on multiple events that never eventuated.",HBy Holly Tregenza,Tue 15 Oct,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-14/kanye-west-lawsuit-simu-liu-boba-tea-stevie-nicks-snl/104468658,Kanye West accused of drugging and assaulting former employee in updated lawsuit,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recap the pop culture and entertainment news that you might have missed over the past few days.
Let us get you caught up.
Rapper Ye, otherwise known as Kanye West, has had two more lawsuits added to his growing list of accusations over the last week.
Last Thursday, a former employee referred to only as John Doe lodged a lawsuit that alleges retaliation and infliction of emotional distress. The lawsuit also alleges that Ye tasked Doe with investigating the Kardashian family for links to ""sex trafficking"", and with hiring private investigators to trail his wife Bianca Censori while she was visiting family in Australia.
Sean “Diddy” Combs has been a revered artist and entrepreneur in the world of hip hop since the early '90s. Now, he’s awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. How did we get here?
Two days later, it came to light that Ye's former assistant Lauren Pisciotta amended a lawsuit she filed in June to include allegations that she was drugged and sexually assaulted by West during a studio session co-hosted by Sean ""Diddy"" Combs.
In documents obtained by Rolling Stone, Pisciotta says she attended the studio session and was supplied with a drink that caused her to black out, with West admitting later that they ""did kind of hook up"".
When Pisciotta originally filed her lawsuit earlier in the year, West's legal representative refuted the claims and said that they would be pursuing legal action against her.
While the session was hosted by Combs, he is not named as a party in the suit and no wrongdoings are alleged against him.
West has yet to comment on the updated lawsuit.
It was not a good time to be boba tea company Bobba this weekend.
The Montreal-based start-up went on Dragon's Den — Canada's version of Shark Tank — to spruik their ready-to-drink teas and popping pearls, but were shot down by actor Simu Liu.
Businessowner Sebastien Fiset tried to nab $CAD1 million in investment money by calling the widely beloved beverage, ""that trendy, sugary drink you are queueing up for, and you are never quite sure about its content"".
Liu, who is the show's first Chinese-Canadian ""Dragon"", called out Bobba for trying to ""disrupt bubble tea"".
""Then there's also an issue of cultural appropriation. There's an issue of taking something that's very distinctly Asian in its identity and quote-unquote 'making it better', which I have an issue with,"" he said.
Fiset doubled down to defend his product, claiming that bubble tea is not an ""ethnical"" product anymore.
""You know, I started [my] venture company for a lot of reasons, but really, primarily to uplift minority entrepreneurs,"" Liu explained.
""And not only do I feel like this is not happening here, but that I would be uplifting a business that is profiting off of something that feels so dear to my cultural heritage. I want to be a part of bringing boba to the masses, but not like this. So for that reason, I'm out.""
The video went wild on TikTok, grabbing more than 7.1 million views and thousands of comments disparaging the business owners. So much so that Liu came out with his own TikTok telling people to back off.
""First and foremost, I think we hit on a really important cultural conversation,"" he says.
""On the flipside… I just want to say that, full-stop, it's never OK to make threats, it's never OK to bully and harass online.
""And I don't mean the business owners don't deserve valid criticism, and I don't believe that you should not be vocal about your disagreement, but you know I think we can all agree — common sense — there's a line that you don't and shouldn't cross.
""I just don't want the legacy of this segment to be pitchforks and people fearing for their safety, I think we're starting to lose the plot of the positive energy of this, which is: let's educate people, let's make the world a better place.""
Saturday Night Live is pulling out all the stops for its 50th season, with this weekend featuring Stevie Nicks's triumphant return to studio 8H after more than four decades.
In between a delightful Oasis takedown and host Ariana Grande showing off her Jennifer Coolidge impression, the 76-year-old singer took to the SNL stage to perform classic 'Edge of Seventeen' and her new single 'The Lighthouse', which was inspired by the overturning of abortion protections in the US.

""I have often said to myself: this may be the most important thing I ever do, to stand up for the women of the United States and their daughters and granddaughters — and the men that love them,"" Nicks said when she released the single in September.
The last time Nicks performed for SNL was in 1983 when she was 35 (and had much bigger hair), singing 'Nightbird' and 'Stand Back' after wrapping her tour for her album The Wild Heart.
If you've been hearing a faint, high-pitched squeal around town at the moment, don't be alarmed: Olivia Rodrigo's tour has just hit Australia.
The 21-year-old pop star is wrapping up her massive Guts tour for 2024 with eight Australian stadium shows (four in Melbourne, four in Sydney), and reviews from the first nights have called the elaborate show ""nothing less than spectacular"".
But, more importantly, Rodrigo made sure to take some time to meet the most famous figure in Melbourne right now: Pesto the penguin.
In case you don't know (seriously, how do you not know), Pesto is the largest penguin that Melbourne aquarium has ever housed, already dwarfing his parents at just nine months old.
His internet fame hasn't only attracted Olivia; Katy Perry stopped by to say hi to the chick last month when she was here to play the AFL grand final.
Someone get Pesto a Met Gala invite, stat! (His penguin suit should be coming in any day now, hehehe.)

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-12/miranda-july-all-fours-risky-menopause-book-shake-change/104460024,Miranda July's All Fours is blowing up on group chats for good reason. It might even leave Germaine Greer in shock,"You might recall me only half-jokingly suggesting here, a short time ago, that Anna Funder's award-winning book Wifedom was breaking up marriages all around Australia, with her searing critique of the entrenched reality of a married woman's mental load.
I knew many women who seethed as much as they marvelled at Funder's brilliant social history of Eileen, George Orwell's unknown wife, and the life of woe she lived devoted to his service.
It was a tricky time in a lot of households.
And here we go again…
The writing in All Fours by Miranda July is delirious, glorious, even bizarre for some I know who have read it. (Supplied: Allen & Unwin)
Because the book blowing up on group chats, in book clubs, on social and every other kind of media right now runs the risk of endangering heretofore unassailable heterosexual status quos, and you can hear the ground shaking.
The book is All Fours, the quasi auto-fiction of celebrated, multi-platform artist and writer, Miranda July, about a woman who starts to pull at a thread of herself within her marriage by detouring off a road trip and into a motel, becoming infatuated, debilitated and ultimately liberated by an encounter with a young man which opens up her understanding of what is happening to her mid-life body, its change and potential.
It's been described by some as ""the menopause book"" but it's a lot more risky than that.
The writing is delirious, glorious, even bizarre for some I know who have read it. And it is personally, deeply, dangerous. As Guardian journalist Eva Wiseman noted before she interviewed July and as her friends finished the book, they started to send her quietly anxious texts: "" I'm worried, oh no, I think this might change my life.""
The ""oh no"" comes in, because July's unnamed narrator — a woman at once apparently falling apart even while she seems to be becoming the truest possible expression of herself — is upending almost everything in her married, motherly life and finding unlimited artistic, emotional and sexual freedom. And as any bloke from history will tell you — from the guys who put together the Eve and the apple story, to the Salem witch hunters, to US Supreme Court justices — a woman realising any of that is a very dangerous thing.
Like Funder's work, this book threatens to shake up and change not only because of the quality of the writing, which is exceptionally good, but because like all good artists July reaches deep and finds the small grain of universal truth at the heart of her fantastical story, so much that even its most unhinged parts start to seem possible.
Could it be true that midlife crises are worthy, necessary expeditions and not simply cringey, cliched self-indulgence? The central character in Miranda July's new book, All Fours, thinks so.
But, without spoiling too much for you, is it unhinged? Can it be that unhinged with women globally making this book an international best-seller? Is the story she tells really that implausible?
A fascinating multi-generational social movement is swirling around this book, as much younger readers, many of them on BookTok, celebrate this book as a staggering find.
Miranda July's vulnerable, questing, sexually thirsting protagonist is being read by the generation that has made the steamy and/or smutty erotic novel one of the best-selling segments of the international publishing market.
Sexy books — oops, not ""sexy"", I am told: publishers prefer ""spicy"", with actual chillies on the back of their books as numbered ratings for the heat of the content within. It amuses me that, much like the men on the Tokyo subway I used to watch openly reading the most confronting sexual Manga (giving a new meaning to ""strap-hanging""), Australian women happily sit in transit, engrossed in their four-chillies book.
Booktok is dominated (ahem) by analyses and recommendations of such books, so this readership is apparently primed for a much more intellectually challenging variation of a woman in search of sexual fulfilment.
I found this generational embrace incredibly surprising, wondering what 20 and 30-year-old women could possibly connect to in a story of a peri-menopausal woman realising she is closer to the end than the beginning?
I asked someone I admire very much, writer and Mamamia podcaster Jessie Stephens, why she thought younger women were so taken with a tale set at such a particular point of a woman's life. She said she found many young women read ""up"" to the next stage of their life, and that the ""bonkers fantasy"" of successful women's erotica probably made it feel very familiar; another aspect of the escapist erotica trend, even while, Jessie said, the book is so ""transgressive"".
Transgressive. That word pulled me up short. Transgressive? I wondered if women older than Jessie might say ""proximate"" instead? Remember Wiseman's texting friends — ""Oh no… I'm worried""?
Germaine Greer never saw what Miranda July celebrates in All Fours. (Flickr: Helen Morgan CC-BY-2.0)
The most shocking aspect in this book for some, has turned out to be the most possible for others, as many women I know mutter among themselves about the turn off the freeway that seems for them more possible than fanciful: a newly chosen life just a finger-stretch away.
This is the grain of truth that July has selected: The complexity of a woman's sexuality - the ugly/needy, and demanding/transcendent nature of a woman's lifelong search to understand who she is and what she wants.
The last big book about menopause that was also a best-seller and sparked an international conversation about its realities was from a very different time: Germaine Greer's The Change. And while Greer shares July's ultimate conclusion of the liberty offered by this life change, Greer never saw what July celebrates: that rather than embracing social power because menopause has disqualified them sexually, July digs out the sexual awakening that it can instead afford — something far more attractive to a younger generation of readers familiar with sexy vampires and erotic knights.
It all feeds into a discussion about age, sexuality, beauty and change that seems to be reaching fever-pitch, with anguish about how high-profile women are seemingly refusing to age, undetectably using any all treatments and means to stay looking permanently young, while actresses like Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson and Andie McDowell insist on their right to age as they are.
""My envelope might be less aesthetically pleasing, but inside I'm much more interesting and dynamic now,"" the actress Helena Bonham Carter told the BBC Woman's Hour recently about her younger and older selves.
Start your weekend with the best of the ABC's journalism, presented by Virginia Trioli. Discover compelling features, big ideas and revealing analysis to understand the stories that matter to Australians.
Which brings us straight back to Greer. She never had any truck with the notion of ageing and worthlessness, of trying to stay pleasing-looking to anyone, least of all men. True liberation meant throwing out the drawings and re-drafting what a whole woman would look like. Miranda July's design of such a woman — a portrait in livid, heaving colours — might leave even Greer in shock.
This weekend, we have some marvellous reads including a deeply moving and very affirming testament to the right to step off the IVF treadmill, and seven delightful answers to my You Don't Know Me questions from the incomparable Christos Tsiolkas, who like all of us just gets better with age.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-11/ll-cool-j-interview-new-album-the-force-/104459466,'It was underdog music': LL Cool J on how hip hop has evolved,"At the height of the coronavirus pandemic LL Cool J donned a black mask, dark shades and hoodie and rode the New York subway with no security, in an experience he describes as ""amazing"".
""What's so simple for most people, quite frankly, for me, is a very unique experience because it's been so long,"" LL told the ABC.
""People can think that they can relate to people because of where they come from.
""You don't realise you in a bubble.""
The two-time Grammy winner, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee, actor, author, entrepreneur and philanthropist is a hip hop icon, who first hit the scene in 1984 as Def Jam's flagship artist.
""And the reason why I bragged about having a gold chain or I bragged about having money in my early albums, was because we never had anything, and to have those things was a badge of honour.
The Force is out now. (Supplied: Cover art by Q-Tip via Def Jam Recordings)
""Now it's like it's been turned on its head, where it's almost elitist. And it's kind of like, you know, when people talk about money, it's like, 'I have more than you so you're not worthy'.
""It's like everybody's turned into a Marie Antoinette.""
The last time LL spoke out about the state of hip hop today, he was trolled on social media.
He's leaned into that in the music video for Murdergram Deux featuring Eminem, the lead single on his new album The Force.
""It became like this homage to all of this hip hop history, and like a new interpretation of that,"" LL said of the various Easter eggs in the video.
""And then, one little, as they say in London, little cheeky thing I did was that back in 2017 I had told them, 'yo, if I hear one more terrible rap record, I'mma do it to these meatballs'.
""And Twitter was trolling me…so, in the video, in the black void, I got a plate of spaghetti and meatballs floating in the video.
""It's like little things we did just to let them know I remembered that.""
LL Cool J and Eminem collaborated on the track Murdergram Deux. (Supplied: Jeremy Deputat)
The Force also features Nas, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes and Saweetie and is produced by Q-Tip.
It feels fresh, and yet rooted in history.
""I wanted to do something new,"" LL said.
""And when I say new, I don't mean modern, because when people think new, sometimes they can think about dates, or they can think about current times. I didn't mean neither one.
""I meant new and innovative. New in that sense, pushing the envelope sonically.""
He says songs like Basquiat Energy, Black Code Suite and 30 Decembers don't sound like anything else that's out there.
LL was four years old when his father shot his mother and grandfather, almost killing them both.
""In that moment the world turned into a movie for me,"" LL said.
""I learned two things in that moment. I learned to follow advice and instructions, and I learned to think on my feet.
LL described the scene in front of him that day.
""[I] come out, bullets whizzing, grandfather says, 'go back'.
""He's there bleeding. I'm walking towards him. The bullets are flying in front of me, hitting the refrigerator. I'm little, I'm short. You walk up the steps of the house, so the bullets are at head level. I'm walking, he's like, 'go back'.
""I listen. I go back. I go to the closet. I see he's bleeding. I grab towels. I go around the other part of the house, because I figured whatever was happening over there that he didn't want me to cross in front of the door. I went around the other way. It's like a circle…gave him the towels.
""So, the go back was the instructions, the towels is the thinking on your feet, and then the giving of the towels is the [generosity and caring about other people].""
LL Cool J says if you can follow advice, think on your feet, and if you're generous, you'll go far in life. (Supplied: Chris Parsons)
When asked about his 1990s rap battle with rapper Canibus and how it compares to the Drake versus Kendrick Lamar beef, LL said there's no comparison.
""The Drake and Kendrick battle, by far, is more documented and will be more probably, discussed on that level, there's just no comparison, because the internet is a game changer.
""Now that doesn't mean that historically as a footnote, the LL Canibus, it'll be mentioned, and historically as a footnote, some of my other battles will be mentioned, but those battles didn't take place on the internet.
""So, because they didn't take place on the internet, it's not the same level of impact.
""I'm just keeping it real. You know what I'm saying?
""But that doesn't mean that the people that were involved weren't as impacted. It's just it might be, you know, 100,000 people impacted, as opposed to a million people impacted, or 10,000 people as opposed to 100,000 because of the internet.
""The internet adds a visual component. It adds engagement. There's an interactiveness. So, it's just a whole 'nother level.
""Now, does that make it better? No, it doesn't because just because you sold more hamburgers don't mean you make the best hamburgers.""

The first Monday in May is the biggest night on the fashion calendar; an exclusive and lavish haute couture fundraiser thrown by Vogue's editor-in-chief Anna Wintour at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
And as celebrities descend upon the steps of The Met, it gives the rest of us mere mortals the chance to play the ultimate game of toot or boot.
We've seen it all: Doja Cat as a, well, cat; Jarod Leto holding a replica of his own head in his hands; Gaga's 16-minute four-in-one ensemble; and everything from the iconic Zendaya x Law Roach collaboration.
Today, the Costume Institute at the Met announced next year's exhibit and thus next year's theme, as well as the co-chairs.
Here is everything we know.
The 2025 Met Gala theme is ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style"", in line with the Costume Institute's spring exhibition of the same name.
The theme is inspired by Monica L Miller’s 2009 book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.
The theme will explore the history of Black dandyism. (Supplied: The Metropolitan Museum of Art)
The exhibition will ""present a cultural and historical examination of the Black dandy"", according to a statement from the Met.
""Fashion and dress have been used in a contest of power and aesthetics for Black people from the time of enslavement to the present,""  Miller said in a video statement posted by the Met.
""The history of Black dandyism illustrates how Black people have transformed from being enslaved and stylised as luxury items, acquired like any other signifier of wealth and status, to autonomous, self-fashioning individuals who are global trendsetters,"" she added.
Sydney-based model Samuel Barrie commended the Met Gala for exploring the ""rich history of the sartorial traditions"" that ""has and continues to shape mens fashion"".
The artist, model and actor said his heart was ""full of joy"" to know that menswear would be on display, especially pulling from the African diaspora.

""At the vanguard of this revitalisation is a group of extremely talented Black designers who are constantly challenging normative categories of identity,"" he said.
""While their styles are both singular and distinctive, what unites them is a reliance on various tropes that are rooted in the tradition of dandyism, and specifically Black dandyism"".

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-30/p-diddy-crimes-pink-zachary-levi-snl-donald-trump/104412676,'No truth': P!nk shuts down Diddy rumours as new civil case is filed,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recap the pop culture and entertainment news that you might have missed over the past few days.
Let us get you caught up.
When rap mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was arrested on federal sex-trafficking charges earlier in the month, it shook the foundations of the music industry, leaving dust clouds of rumours in its wake.
As part of this huge upset, people started to laser in on the celebrities who ""deleted their tweets"" following Combs's arrest.
Well, aerial acrobat and popstar P!nk has set the record straight on her IG, confirming that she actually wiped her X account all the way back in February.
""There is no truth to the rumours spread this week, and while I've met people in passing, I'm not associated with any of the people mentioned,"" P!nk said.
Usher's tweets are also back in action: the rapper — who was one of Diddy's musical proteges — tweeted that they had been deleted by hackers.
In an actual verifiable update to the accusations against Combs, another Jane Doe civil suit was filed against the rapper over the weekend. The new complaint, filed in New York and obtained by CNN, alleges that Combs drugged and sexually assaulted a woman on more than one occasion in 2022.
This takes the total number of civil suits filed against Combs to 12, in addition to multiple federal charges.
Ever since the US Democrats swapped Joe Biden for Kamala Harris as their presidential nominee, names have been flying around about which Saturday Night Live alum would step up to play the collection of new characters.
Well, all speculation was cleared up during this weekend's season 50 premiere. As was widely assumed, Maya Rudolph is back to play Harris, nailing her exuberant laugh to a tee.
Lonely Island stalwart Andy Samberg showed up as Harris's husband and potential First Gentleman, Doug Emhoff. All fake hair and ridiculously high forehead, Samberg as Emhoff espoused the power that lies in supporting your woman AND being the little spoon (men take note!!! Let us spoon you!!).
Comedian Jim Gaffigan brought ""big dad energy"" to his SNL debut as Harris's running-mate, Tim Walz, with whom he does share an uncanny resemblance.
Joe Biden has been played on SNL by everyone from Jason Sudeikis to John Mulaney, but for the big 50th anniversary, the show brought out legend Dana Carvey to portray a Biden who has also forgotten he is currently president.
Get used to these guest stars — you'll probably be seeing a lot of them as the US lunges closer to its November 5 presidential election.
On the other side of politics, James Austin Johnson is reprising his pretty spot-on Trump impersonation, and Bowan Yang brings the awkwardness as Trump VP pick JD Vance. Of course, the REAL Trump was tuning in and expressed his distaste for the sketch on Truth Social.
HOWEVER, Yang razzing on Vance's lack of rizz wasn't even his finest work of the evening. That would have to go to his Weekend Update appearance as Moo Deng, the Thai hippo baby who has been the internet's STAR of late.
Apparently, Moo Deng and Chappell Roan have quite a lot in common — they're both begging their overzealous fans to respect their boundaries!!
Donald Trump's presidential campaign has historically not attracted the most high-profile celebrity endorsements unless you're really into wrestling or Twitch streamers.
But this weekend, Zachary Levi, star of 2019 superhero comedy Shazam! and Disney favourite Tangled, took the stage at Team Trump's Reclaim America Tour to facilitate a conversation between recent presidential candidate drop-out Robert F Kennedy and former Democratic rep Tulsi Gabbard.
""We're here to make sure that we are going to take back this country. We are going to make it great again. We are going to make it healthy again,"" Levi said on stage.
""I stand with everyone else who is standing with President Trump. Because I do believe, of the two choices that we have, and we only have two, Donald Trump, President Trump is the man that can get us there.""
Levi previously threw his support behind Kennedy before he dropped out of the race to make room for Trump.
""In a perfect world, perhaps I would have voted for Bobby,"" Levi said at the Michigan rally.
""But we don't live in a perfect world. In fact, we live in a very broken one. We live in a country that has been hijacked by a lot of people who want to take this place way off the cliff. And we want to stop that, right?""
Levi — who rose to fame in long-running sit-com Chuck — is fresh off starring in Harold and The Purple Crayon. The film flopped at the box office, bringing in $US28 million on a $US40 million budget, and was described by Vulture as ""worse than you imagined"".
Welcome to the world, Ronin Walker Cobain Hawk! You have absolutely no concept of the cultural capital you've been born with.
Frances Bean Cobain — daughter of late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain — and Riley Hawk — son of Tony — shared the news of their new addition on Instagram on Sunday morning.
The post attracted words of affirmation from celebs like Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, Christina Ricci and Tony Hawk, who christened Ronin his ""favourite"" grandson (Ronin is his only grandson atm).
Cobain and the younger Hawk have been together since 2022. They wed in 2023 with a Las Vegas ceremony that was officiated by R.E.M. vocalist Michael Stipe, who is also Cobain's godfather.

Little Monsters rejoiced last week when Lady Gaga announced Harlequin — a companion album to her upcoming film Joker: Folie à Deux, and her first full album in three years.
The album is chock full of covers that appear in the movie, which is being billed as a jukebox musical. But one cover has really caught Australian ears …
Yes, Gaga covered The Joker from the 1964 musical The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd. But it's better known to those Down Under from Gina Riley's powerful rendition for the Kath and Kim theme song.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-27/will-and-harper-review/104393620,"Will Ferrell's new Netflix doco takes on transphobia in the US, but it's really about friendship","What: Following her recent gender transition, ex-SNL alum Harper Steele travels across America with Will Ferrell.
Starring: Will Ferrell and Harper Steele.
When: Streaming now on Netflix.
Likely to make you feel: Fuzzy, but left with lingering questions.
Will & Harper is a transgender movie made with a cisgender audience in mind. This is not so much a criticism, as it appears to be a deliberate choice on behalf of those involved. For its main subject, ex-SNL comedy writer Harper Steele (Eurovision Song Contest), an important reason to make the film was its potential to counter the intensified campaign against trans rights that has aggressively dominated contemporary culture wars.
The other half of the film's title is Harper's lifelong friend and collaborator Will Ferrell, who suggested the idea for the coast-to-coast road trip across America that this Netflix documentary follows — the very first they'd taken together since Harper transitioned in 2022 at the age of 61.
It's a softball, feel-good movie with a narrow interest in the social and political realities of being trans in America. The road trip aspect, with its various stops between the liberal poles of New York and Los Angeles, is characterised as something of a litmus test — ""I love this country so much; I just don't know if it loves me back right now,"" Steele says to the camera early on.
Premiering at Sundance in January, Will & Harper was routinely referred to as the feel-good hit of the film festival. (Supplied: Netflix)
Yet only a handful of encounters gingerly test the waters; they attend an early basketball game in Indiana and brush shoulders with the state's anti-LGBT governor, drink at a dive bar in rural Oklahoma decked in confederate paraphernalia, and participate in a Texan steak-eating contest that turns sour.
Ferrell aptly uses his own privilege and celebrity status as a safeguard, but also as a spotlight through which he can reintroduce Steele to the world. It inevitably opens them up to negative attention; for the first time, the actor has to contend with being on the end of transphobic vitriol and is branded as ""a satanic Illuminati paedophile"" after they're witnessed in public together.
While Will & Harper's subjects expose themselves to potential threat, the film itself cuts away from any lingering discomfort, hesitant to reckon with the nature of that very prejudice. It's a frustrating approach that isolates transphobia to fleeting, barely glimpsed incidents, even when various encounters suggest a deep-seated, nationwide rot.
Mostly, the film makes a point of demonstrating the inherent kindness in strangers. While there's a ceiling on how rude someone will be to a celebrity while a camera is trained on them, it's encouraging to observe Steele tackling her own anxieties head-on, and finding people from all walks of life willing to treat her with respect.
While conceptualising the documentary, Ferrell and Steele considered creating comedic set-ups and situations, but decided to go for a more naturalistic documentary. (Supplied: Netflix)
Both Ferrell and Steele remain fundamentally unserious in their middle age, channelling a real-life goofball energy that can be directly traced to their comedy work (which, all things considered about the 2000s, has held up surprisingly well).
Watching their affectionate, long-running relationship gradually unveils a simple truth amid the muddied waters of recent trans discourse: that trans allyship and acceptance require nothing more than the moral clarity to be a good friend.
Director Josh Greenbaum also hails from the world of MA-rated comedies, having recently made last year's Strays and the underrated cult oddity Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar.
His return to his documentary background results in a film that's as treacly and overproduced as you'd expect from a Sundance documentary picked up by Netflix. Frequent needle drops pierce any sense of stillness, as does an overbearing score consisting of stock guitar twangs and high-pitched, reverbed piano keys.
As much as Will & Harper yearns for more than its surface-level approach – there are more appearances from SNL alum than there are discussions with strangers on the road – it is appreciably uncommon to see trans women of Steele's age on screen. The spectacle of trans bodies that are allowed in the mainstream generally hinges on their youth and beauty, their ability to be invisible and desirable.

It is, of course, not the reality of many trans people, especially those who emerge into themselves later in life. Steele's story, as she recounts both to Ferrell and the audience, is defined by a devastating shame. It's the humiliation of being a husband and father who secretly dresses in women's clothing, then being told it's a sickness when asking for help.
Those traumas are, thankfully, not at the forefront of the film – but they do add a crucial emotional undercurrent to its story of self-acceptance, however gradual and reluctant it may be.
There are certainly more incisive, challenging trans documentaries that are actually made by trans filmmakers — films like No Ordinary Man and Dressed in Blue are a testament to this fact. But for an accessible insight into trans lives, and possibly the first trans film that some will encounter when browsing Netflix's catalogue, Will & Harper at least succeeds in its emotional honesty.

""That's what's going to be the most exciting [thing] to hear, 100,000 people singing all the songs at the top of their lungs,"" Perry told ABC News Breakfast.
""Especially footy guys singing Firework, that's what I'm here for.
""I know that the performances for the show have just kind of started happening in the past few years, so I'm really excited to take it up a notch,"" she added.
In a 2020 interview with The Guardian, Perry said she struggled to know where to go after the career peak of performing at the Super Bowl in 2015. (Kevin Mazur/WireImage)
Butterflies, helicopters and a futuristic-looking Tesla will make an appearance at the big performance, Perry hinted.
Reportedly, the American singer will perform some of her classic hits along with a song from her controversial new album, 143.
The album that came out a week ago has received significant backlash, with Perry's single Woman's World becoming her worst-performing single release from an album in her 16-year career.
Woman's World is Katy Perry’s worst-performing single release from an album in her 16-year career. What went wrong?
From the lyrics to the music video, the song has not translated well for fans and critics alike.
And it's not just the satirical messaging that is not sitting well with people, it's also the song and the comeback album's link to Dr. Luke.
Real name Lukasz Gottwald, Dr. Luke was accused in 2014 by pop star Kesha, in a dismissed claim, of sexual assault and emotional abuse, allegations he has always denied.
Since the release, Perry has claimed the album, in particular the Woman's World single was satire.
She credited the album's creation to her growth as a mother.
""So much has bloomed, and I feel so much wholeness,"" she said on becoming a mother.
""I've been operating and riding from that place of just feeling, feeling that unconditional love for the first time.""
Perry said the album comes from that joy of unconditional love and her ""connection with femininity"".
143, the album name in texting lingo, stands for ""I love you"", an ode from the singer to her realisation of total and irrevocable love.
With the footy frenzy at its peak, as Sydney Swans take on Brisbane Lions on Saturday, the pop star finds herself at the very centre of it.
While Perry is thrilled to be the entertainment at the G – it is not footy but rather a fluffy creature from Australia occupying her thoughts.
""I would like to hug a penguin named Pesto.
""I don't know if I'm actually allowed to hug it, but it really looks huggable,"" said Perry.
Pesto is a chocolate-brown, obscenely fluffy penguin at the Melbourne Sea Life Aquarium.
The big baby penguin went viral earlier this month and not surprisingly the American pop star was not immune to his chubby charm.
""If I could just stand two feet away from it and feed it a fish, I would love that,"" laughed Perry.
At just nine months of age, Pesto is already far bigger than the adult king penguins at Melbourne's aquarium.
So perhaps along with red and purple scarves, some Pesto pictured flags will be present in the stands this Saturday at the MCG.
While here in Melbourne, Perry has announced a tour in Australia in 2025.
It's called The Lifetimes Tour, with Perry revealing the name as a tribute to her fans who have grown alongside her songs.

""I see photos that they [Fans] show me online of them being 12-13, and now they're like, 26 or 28… and they've been enjoying my music the whole time, and that feels like an incredible lifetime,"" shared Perry.
""So, it'll be a really great celebration. I think Australia will know how to do it.""

""It was, do we want to rehearse and start midwinter somewhere or summer and be home?""

It is an understatement to say the news of the tour and her brand new album has everyone excited – including the pop princess herself.

""I love touring,"" said Minogue laughingly.
Selecting the set list when you have such a celebrated back catalogue is not an easy task.
""It's just the hardest part of every tour, what is the set list going to be?"" pondered Minogue.
With three albums that haven't been toured before – there's plenty for the star to choose from.
""I feel like I've done quite a few Greatest Hits tours or shows of late… so I'm excited to have some of that new material.
""Of course, I'll have the biggest hits, and I'm definitely already knowing I'm going to leave some space for some oddities,"" said Minogue.
""Positive and joyous"" – that is the vibe she is going for in her live shows.
""It's something that I want people to feel from the show and from the music,"" Minogue added.
It is a vibe that her last album's hit song Padam Padam achieved.
""I didn't set out to do that,"" Minogue laughed.
""It's been incredible, like mind-blowing, life-changing.
""Padam did that for me,"" she said.
It is the song that put her back on the map – adding a whole new audience to the legions of fans the pop star already had.
""I've just consistently worked and consistently try and keep achieving, and then once in a while, you get thrown a bit of, you know, everything coming together to make a good moment for you.""

And the fun doesn't stop there.
While Tension has still got us grooving, Minogue is keeping the magic going with a sequel, Tension II.
""I think we got on such a roll,"" Minogue started as she thought back to how the album came about.
The first song of the new album is called Lights, Camera, Action with a zappy ""that's it!"" that follows the beats.
Fans will be able to listen to the new song in full on September 27 with the whole album being released on October 18.
If you can't wait till then, there's a teeny-tiny tease on Minogue's socials to keep you appeased till the song's release.
""It's quite hypnotic. It's lots of fun, and you will probably just be throwing in Lights, Camera Action to general parlance from now,"" she added.
""And I'm sorry, you're welcome whichever way you want to look at it,"" Minogue shared laughingly.

""Like its author had to have feminism explained to her by the top half of the first page of Google."" ""Made me feel stupider every sorry time I listened to it."" ""Stuck in 2016.""
These are just some of the reviews for Katy Perry's comeback single Woman's World, which led to a disastrous rollout of the pop star's sixth album, 143, out today.
Perhaps more damning than the reviews was the discourse within the Katy Kats (the pop star's devoted fan group) when a song snippet leaked pre-release. Some were sure it was an AI-generated fake, if not a complete troll ahead of a real comeback single.
Its music video — a parody of girlboss feminism that sees Perry and female dancers wear decidedly non-OHS outfits on a construction site, among other confounding scenes — only alienated audiences further, unsure whether the song was intended as a sincere feminist anthem, a piss-take or both at once.
In July, Woman's World became Perry's worst-performing single release from an album in her 16-year career, debuting at #63 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and at #47 in the UK before dropping off both charts entirely the next week.
In Australia – early adopters of Perry, in no small part due to her single Hot n Cold being MasterChef Australia's theme song for more than a decade – the song did not appear on the ARIAs charts at all.
Add in follow-up single Lifetimes failing to chart, anger over Perry's choice of producer, early tepid album reviews and a mini-ecological scandal with the Balearic Islands, and 143 has been a masterclass in how to not launch an album in 2024.
But can Katy Perry — whose album Teenage Dream provided five #1 US singles, a feat only matched by Michael Jackson's Bad — turn it around? Or does 2024's pop landscape have no room for the queen of kitsch?
Katy Perry - Woman's World official video
To understand how Perry got here, let's look back at how she became one of the highest-selling artists of all time.
Raised by Pentecostal preacher parents in California, Perry began her music career as a Christian artist. In 2001 at 16 years old, she released a self-titled album under her legal name, Katy Hudson, which sold less than 200 copies.
In a 2020 interview with The Guardian, Perry said she struggled to know where to go after her career peak of performing at the 2015 Super Bowl. (Kevin Mazur/WireImage)
Hudson resurfaced as Perry in 2008 with I Kissed A Girl, a pointedly un-Pentecostal debut single that landed at #1 in more than 20 countries, including the US and Australia. Tinged with the lightest touch of pop-punk, Perry's debut album, One of the Boys, established her as an unfussy fun time during a period when pop stars were more tightly wound.

But it's Teenage Dream that's considered Perry's magnum opus, filled with cotton-candy pop, anthems about fun in the sun (California Gurls), living for the weekend (T.G.I.F) and embracing your inner spark (Firework). It's timeless in that it has spent 390 weeks — or seven-and-a-half-years — in the US Billboard 200 charts.
""This is not an artist who had a one-hit wonder or had one album that popped off and then she was not able to repeat it,"" says Sam Murphy, an Australian pop music critic who has written extensively about Perry (and considers himself a huge fan).
""She did it three albums in a row,"" referring to the back-to-back hits of One of The Boys, Teenage Dream and Prism (2013).
If you need proof of her prowess, look no further than last week's VMAs performance, where she performed a medley of hits to accept the Video Vanguard Award.
Katy Perry – 2024 VMAs performance
Tides shifted with Witness (2017), which Perry billed as a turn to ""purposeful pop"".While Perry changed her Twitter bio to include the word ""activist"", it was unclear what Migos collaboration Bon Appetit or a Taylor Swift diss track were activating.
""Witness got so much heat for being a flop because the height she fell from was so high,"" says Murphy. ""But in the context of any other pop star, it wouldn't have been that much of a disaster.""
But 143 is shaping up to be worse on another level.
""This new album is already a proper flop. What I find interesting is that there's a lot of attention around her, but none of it is translating to streams. Not even, 'I want to see if it's really that bad' streams. There's just no chart love for her.""
Katy Perry has insisted that the cringey Woman's World single (and its even cringier music video) was satire.
But Grace Sharkey, a lecturer in the Department of Gender and Cultural Studies at the University of Sydney, says that satire was ""clunky and weak"", out of sync with our current moment.
""It was clearly meant to be an exciting pop culture moment,"" she says. ""One that would capitalise on our popular investment in feminist politics, but people are increasingly resistant to what they perceive as the commodification of feminist politics.
""I also think part of the negative response to Woman's World is because it is simply bad.""
For critics and fans alike, the single's satirical feminist messaging was made more flaccid by the news that one of its six co-writers and four co-producers was Dr. Luke.
Real name Lukasz Gottwald, Dr. Luke was accused in 2014 by pop star Kesha, in a dismissed claim, of sexual assault and emotional abuse – allegations he denies. The two reached a settlement in 2023, after almost a decade of suits and countersuits.

He is also the producer behind Perry's first three and most successful albums, as well as #1 hits for Rihanna, Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus and Doja Cat, among others. But after lukewarm commercial and critical reception to Witness and Smile (2020), the duo aimed to recreate past magic on 143, which credits Gottwald on every track.
When asked about Gottwald during an interview on popular podcast Call Her Daddy, Perry dodged the question, avoiding mentioning his name entirely.
""I understand that it started a lot of conversations, and he was one of many collaborators that I collaborated with. But the reality is, it comes from me,"" says Perry.
Thankfully for major labels, misguided first singles don't spell the end for a pop album.
ME!, the lead single from Taylor Swift's 2019 album Lover, is accepted by even the most ardent Swifties as a strange choice. Ariana Grande's Focus was scrapped entirely from 2016's Dangerous Woman when it didn't connect as intended. The Weeknd's Beauty Behind The Madness and Rihanna's Rated R both landed #1 hits after so-so lead singles. (It happens often enough that perhaps there's a strategy, albeit confusing, with releasing a controversial or weak release to generate press, followed by more conventional hits that people can root for?)
But in all of these instances, the artist climbed the charts with each subsequent release. Arriving less than a month after Woman's World, 143's second single, Lifetimes, is far more palatable, if less interesting. It's a straight dance track and ode to the loves of her life: husband Orlando Bloom and four-year-old daughter Daisy.
Katy Perry - Lifetimes official video
""Lifetimes was a major course correction,"" says Murphy. ""Here's a dance record that nobody can poke holes in. But it is so generic that it's sucked any kind of Katy Perry personality from it. Lifetimes is a Rita Ora song, essentially.""
That's not to say Lifetimes sidestepped controversies entirely. Shot on S'Espalmador, a picturesque Spanish island near Ibiza, the video sees Perry rave, rest and love. After the video went live, the government of the Balearic Islands stated that Perry was being investigated for potential damage to ""ecologically important sand dunes"", and did not seek authorisation for shooting.
It's enough to believe that Perry is cursed by a nun. Almost.
Lifetimes is far more representative of 143 than Woman's World was. Its 11 tracks make up an album that largely forgets about Perry as a kitsch figure, in favour of respectable, digestible, house-tinged pop that can steadily generate streams via gym and cafe playlists. (Having said that, that wink-wink usually comes through clearest in music videos and live performances.)
143's third single I'm His, He's Mine features rapper Doechii and uses Crystal Waters's Gypsy Woman as its backbone - a current pop trend when it comes to house samples. (Supplied: Cynthia Parkhurst)
Highlights are Gorgeous featuring Kim Petras , even if its naughty flirtation with SOPHIE-like mechanical sounds is more PG than PC Music, and Crush, which is clearly the next single, even if it doesn't quite go far enough with its manic Europop beat.
Nothing here is exactly an inspired choice, but it is safe, and dance-pop is traditionally a reliable route for pop stars past their imperial phase, where their commercial and creative peak coincide. (Kylie's Padam Padam is the most recent example, but Lady Gaga, Madonna, Cher and plenty more have gone down this route).
""I think that there's a very obvious play to go into the dance space because of the moment that dance had off the back of Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia,"" says Murphy. ""But she's a bit late to that trend.""
It's understandable for two reasons. First, Perry, 39, would be freshly aware of the ageism within an industry that prioritises youth (not to suggest 39 is old by any regular metric). Secondly, Perry's bread and butter of maximalist, candy-cotton pop rarely breaks charts in the 2020s, due to an (arguably Swift-led) move towards diaristic, confessional pop or ""lore"".

Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter's recent success suggest this could be turning around, but they both turn away from the gaudiness of, say,  Left Shark, or leaning so heavily into a joke like with Woman's World, or as Perry did in 2007 with Ur So Gay. (Both artists also balance that pure pop edge by pulling from their own experiences more directly than Perry ever has, with songs about queer identity and famous exes, respectively.) By the reaction to Perry's latest satire, maybe her brand of kitsch is simply too ""cringe"" in 2024.
Murphy foresees tours in her future, potentially taking a version of her 2022 Las Vegas residency out on the road as a way to ""restore good faith"".

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-20/korean-wave-hits-melbourne-koreatown-made-official/104348242,How Australia's newest K-town reflects the growing influence of Korea's culture on our cities,"When Changhoon Yi first arrived in Melbourne, he was surprised to find Australian diners sipping soju and eating grilled beef with a side of kimchi in the CBD.
""It was very impressive, it was like I was back home in Korea,"" says Mr Yi, who came to the city as the Republic of Korea's Melbourne Consulate-General in 2022.
He soon discovered the extent of Korean influence in Healeys Lane, locally referred to as ""Kimchi Street"".

As Korean cultural influence has grown over the years, so too has the number of Korean restaurants and businesses around the city — in particular, in and around the cobblestoned lane.
In a part of the city historically associated with Melbourne's legal precinct, lawyers in court robes arrive for the lunch time rush during the day.
But at night the area is abuzz with people lining up for authentic Korean food, with 25 Korean eateries for diners to choose from, including celebrity chef Paik Jong-won's Paik's Noodle.
""As one of the civil servants of Koreans, I was very proud of that [Healeys Lane],"" says Mr Yi.
Earlier this month, the City of Melbourne officially recognised Healeys Lane as Koreatown, and its entrances on Lonsdale and Little Lonsdale streets will soon be marked by traditional three-metre tall Korean totem poles, or jang-seung
The structures will be funded by the Republic of Korea's Melbourne Consulate-General office.
""In Korea the totem poles are at the entrance of every village and are a kind of guard to secure the people living inside the village,"" Mr Yi explains.
In the past few years Healeys Lane has emerged as a go-to destination for Korean cuisine in Melbourne.  (ABC News: Jarrod Fankhauser)
Melbourne's Lord Mayor Nicholas Reece says the decision brings Melbourne in line with other cities like Toronto, Los Angeles, New York and Sydney which already have ""colourful Koreatowns"".
The council is also hoping Koreatown will become a new tourist attraction.
Since the formal launch earlier this month, foot traffic in Healeys Lane has already jumped by 20 per cent, according to the City of Melbourne data.
Twenty-year-old Lucy Codling, a K-pop enthusiast, says she and others who love Korean culture were excited by Koreatown and what it could offer to an already buzzing K-pop scene in Melbourne.
""It gives us more opportunity to explore restaurants and a place to meet up,"" Ms Codling says.

The pharmacy assistant from Warragul, a regional town about 100 kilometres south-east of Melbourne, is part of a global fanbase of non-Koreans who are consuming everything from K-pop and K-drama to K-beauty and Korean cuisine.
""I love the food, it's definitely [made me step] out of my comfort zone,"" Ms Codling says.
""I come from Warragul, a very Anglo Christian regional town, where there was like one Chinese restaurant [when I was] growing up.""
Ms Codling says her passion for K-pop began when her best friend introduced her to South Korean boy band BTS when she was a teenager.
Through the ""melbkpopfans"" page she manages on Instagram, she organises meet ups with other fans before K-pop concerts.
""There's always been a [K-pop] scene but it's definitely blown up since COVID,"" she says.
Ms Codling says she's also planning her first trip to South Korea next month, which she says she has been saving up for years.
The popularity of Korean popular culture has led to the growing demand for Korean food. (ABC News: Jarrod Fankhauser)
Sin Ji Jung, a lecturer in Korean Studies at University of Melbourne's Asia Institute, says the Korean wave, or ""hallyu"", began in the 1990s and spread to more Asian countries in the 2000s but Korean artist Psy's global hit song Gangnam Style catapulted K-pop onto the global stage.
The viral hit became the first ever video on YouTube to reach 1 billion views in 2012.
And it has only soared to greater heights since, Dr Jung says.
""During COVID, people couldn't go out and many people just watched Netflix,"" she says.
""At the time, lots of Korean movies, drama series and entertainment shows were available on Netflix … not just inside Korea or Asian countries, but also Western countries.""
The Korean business community is confident the growing love for Korean culture will attract even more people to businesses like Seven Star Pocha restaurant. (ABC News: Najma Sambul)
Dr Jung says the strong interest in Korean culture has also translated to economic benefits for Korean businesses.
""Watching these dramas kind of make people curious about Korean food and Korean culture,"" she says.
""Those scenes are depicted very attractively, and there's raised interest in visiting the country, trying out Korean food and trying out these Korean beauty products … business is flourishing.""
Although Koreatown faces strong competition from nearby iconic precincts including Chinatown, the Korean business community is confident the growing love for Korean culture will attract more businesses to Healeys Lane.
Hong Rim Kim, chairman of the Melbourne Korean Business Association and who owns three restaurants on Healeys Lane, says the demand for Korean food has been overwhelming in recent years.
He says whenever a popular K-pop idol group like Blackpink holds a concert in Melbourne, there are long queues outside every Korean restaurant on Healeys Lane.
""They [concert attendees] enjoyed the K-pop and after that want to eat Korean food,"" says Mr Kim, who is also chief executive of hospitality group Miracle Ventures Group.

Mr Kim says he wants to see Koreatown extend up to Williams Street, a move he hopes will make the precinct on par with Chinatown.
""Chinatown is three times bigger than us now, but nobody knows, one day we could take over Chinatown,"" he says.
As for Mr Yi, he believes the decision to make Koreatown official has created deeper ties between Korea and Australia, and will help to attract more Korean companies to Australia.
He pointed to South Korean defence manufacturer Hanwha's $170 million manufacturing plant in Geelong as the type of Korean big business he wants to see in Australia.
""Australian companies have special skills but don't have [enough] manufacturing facilities,"" he said.
""With Australian skill and Korean manufacturing, there could be great economic success.""",Najma Sambul,Fri 20 Sep,0

It's advice he stands by, but with a caveat.
""I may be not sure who I am today,"" Urban told ABC News Breakfast.
""But that's my authentic self, too.
""I'm in discovery mode. Maybe I'm changing who I am. Maybe my way of viewing the world is changing, and that's my authentic self as well.""
As one of Australia's most successful exports, Urban, who is promoting his new album High, out Friday, had to grind to get to where he is now.
""I had to stick with it when I got to Nashville because it took so much longer than I was imagining,"" Urban said.
""I mean, years and years and years of nothing.
Keith Urban says his way of viewing the world may be changing. (Supplied: EMI Music)
Urban has also spent a good deal of time in Australia's home of country music.
""Tamworth's like a second home to me,"" he said.
""I was nine years old when I first went to Tamworth, so I've got great memories of going to Tamworth in January and sleeping in tents and getting flooded out.""
Urban says he finds it ""impossible"" to give blanket advice to aspiring artists because ""everyone's got to find their way"".

But there is something he thinks is crucial.
""I think it's really important to have people around you that you trust,"" Urban said.
""That's really crucial.
""I don't think it matters what era we're in. That's always going to be something really important because you have to have some people around you that you can trust and believe in and will help keep you on track.""
Urban, who is one half of a high-profile couple, the other half being his wife Academy Award winner Nicole Kidman with whom he shares daughters Sunday and Faith, says at home, he's ""just dad"".
""I think it's an Aussie thing as well,"" Urban said.
""It's sort of an intrinsic Aussie thing to stay grounded. Australians are pretty quick to go 'get your bloody hand off it. What's all this nonsense?,' and that's how I was raised.
""I was raised in that way of always being grounded.
""I mean Aussies can take it so far that it's almost like they don't let you enjoy any success as well.
""But there's something good about that Aussie-ism of just staying grounded. You know, 'keep it real. Don't forget where you came from. Be yourself, be authentic.'
""I've never lost that and I'm really grateful for it.""
Urban is in his element on stage and says he feels the same now when performing as he did when he was still trying to find an audience. (Supplied: Brennon Williamson)
Born in New Zealand, Urban moved to Queensland with his family as a two-year-old.
""We were in Brisbane most of the time, but I went to four different schools by the fifth grade and lived in about nine different houses by the time I was 10,"" Urban said.
""So, although it was mostly in Brissy we were still moving around all the time.
""So, home was my family, originally, I felt was home and now my family now is home. But I mean it's even something like my guitar.
""My guitar feels home to me…it's been with me my whole life, so it feels home.""
Previously released songs on High include Go Home W U with Lainey Wilson, Messed Up As Me, which is resonating so strongly with audiences, it's already being requested at live gigs, and Wildside, which was inspired by the overworked school principal in the film School of Rock played by Joan Cusack, who lets her hair down after a few drinks.
Songs yet to be released include Daytona, which is about how it doesn't take much to trigger some memories, Laughin' All the Way to the Drank, where Urban invokes his working class family roots and a dad who worked hard, but also partied hard, and the song Love is Hard in which Urban sings ""I ain't quittin'.""
He says the hardest thing about love from his perspective is ""the power of it"".
""I think that song touches upon it as best it can,"" he said.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-15/perth-rapper-flewnt-cops-racism-after-americas-got-talent-show/104329228,A Perth father and son hip-hop duo shone on America's Got Talent. Then came the online trolls,"Joshua Egginton and his 11-year-old son were wrapping up a whirlwind US trip after performing on one of the biggest reality TV stages in the world, America's Got Talent.
WARNING: This story contains racist and offensive language.
Mr Egginton, known as Flewnt, and his son, whose stage name is Inkabee, are Noongar Wongi hip-hop artists from Western Australia who made it through to the live quarter finals, having impressed the judges and the audience at their first audition.
Flewnt and Inkabee perform on America's Got Talent
""We have just seen what I call a moment,"" the show's notoriously gruff and honest judge, Simon Cowell, said.
""Just the way you perform together, it was mesmerising.""
Despite not progressing to the next round after their quarter final performance, Flewnt was proud of himself and his son for their efforts on an international stage.
So before flying back to Perth, the 28-year-old father of four posted a photo of himself holding the Aboriginal flag while in California, a state on the west coast of the US, with the caption: 'West Coast 2 West Coast'.
Flewnt was expecting a few negative comments, aware of the ""toxic place social media can be at the best of times"", but says he was not anticipating the huge reaction.
""It just started to kind of snowball and there was just so many,"" Flewnt said of the negative and racist comments he received.
""I didn't feel upset or hurt, I felt anger because I was trying to demonstrate how proud I was as an Aboriginal person standing on the other side of the world up on a high peak.
""And some of the comments were just absolutely outrageous … didn't make sense … it was like they were coming at me with the intention to hurt.""
The comments referred to burning the Aboriginal flag and racist stereotypes.
These comments were just some of the negative ones left under Flewnt's post. Names have been erased for this graphic. (ABC News)
While not unexpected, the negative reaction hit hard, especially as Flewnt and Inkabee had been celebrated by audiences in America.
""We got to use language, our accent, there was so much of our culture involved, we wore our flag on our back … it was really special.""
After some consideration, Flewnt — who is a leader in his community and runs music programs across the state, including in youth detention — made the decision not to remove the post or the offensive comments.

""This is what's happening to Aboriginal people when they proudly display their culture, their flag, the colours that make them proud, the thing that motivates me to get up in the morning.
""Why can't I stand up and say, 'This is me?'""
Flewnt tries as best he can to shield his son from the offensive commentary but has spoken openly to Inkabee and all of his family about what happened.
""I think it's important that you build resilience in young people straight away and I think you've got to make them proud of who they are,"" he said.
""So we acknowledge that these things happen online and build strength up inside of them.
""It lights a fire in him (Inkabee) and he just goes off and writes crazy and comes out with better music.""

What shocked Flewnt and many of those around him was how many of the comments were made by users who did not appear to be hiding their identities.
One user who wrote several offensive comments appears to be the director of a nursing agency and home care provider in Perth.
The overt nature of this type of commentary is something Gamilaroi woman Marjorie Anderson, the national manager of Indigenous crisis line 13YARN, has also noticed.

""We've seen comments from senior police, senior public servants, and we report them to their employer,"" she said.
""The sad part is that people don't feel like they have to hide their feelings about it, and they don't have to hide their identity to be nasty little trolls.""
As documented, Ms Anderson said a rise in racist behaviour correlated with the Voice to Parliament referendum and its ultimate No result.
""A quarter of our calls have been on racism following the referendum,"" Ms Anderson said.
""I think we've gone backwards after the debate.
""I think that the No argument gave people permission to be racist and it's really impacting Aboriginal people.""
Flewnt said genuine sharing between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians would be a good first step to ending the offensive and often enduring negative stereotypes many still hold of First Nations people.

""If I sat with some of the people that had that sort of commentary, I don't think they would feel the same after our conversation,"" he said.
""I think they would meet somebody who is a dedicated dad, somebody who is a dedicated community member.
""I'm really open to sharing thoughts and ideas and I think they would see how hard working we really are, and who I really am.

The photo Flewnt posted now has more positive and supportive comments than negative ones, with many calling out the offensive behaviour.
""To see my people, and allies, jump in there to defend myself, to defend our culture, our right to display our flag proudly, that gives me the greatest of hope,"" Flewnt said.
""And it gives me the inspiration to want to keep doing what we do.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-15/ballerina-michaela-deprince-dies/104353076,"Ballerina Michaela Mabinty DePrince, who grew up in a Sierra Leone orphanage, dies aged 29","Ballet dancer Michaela Mabinty DePrince, who moved to the United States from an orphanage in war-torn Sierra Leone and performed on some of the world's biggest stages, has died.
She was 29.
""Michaela touched so many lives across the world, including ours. She was an unforgettable inspiration to everyone who knew her or heard her story,"" her family said in a statement posted on Friday on DePrince's social media accounts.
""From her early life in war-torn Africa, to stages and screens across the world, she achieved her dreams and so much more.""
A cause of death was not provided.
DePrince was adopted by an American couple and by age 17 she had been featured in a documentary film and had performed on the TV show Dancing With the Stars.
After graduating from high school and the American Ballet Theatre's Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School, she became a principal dancer at Dance Theater of Harlem.
She then went to the Netherlands, where she danced with the Dutch National Ballet.
She later returned to the US and joined the Boston Ballet in 2021.

""We're sending our love and support to the family of Michaela Mabinty DePrince at this time of loss,"" the Boston Ballet said in a statement to The Associated Press on Saturday.
""We were so fortunate to know her; she was a beautiful person, a wonderful dancer, and she will be greatly missed by us all.""
In her memoir, Taking Flight: From War Orphan to Star Ballerina, she shared her journey from the orphanage to the stage.
She also wrote a children's book, Ballerina Dreams.
DePrince suffered from a skin pigmentation disorder that had her labelled ""the devil's child"" at the orphanage.
""I lost both my parents, so I was there [at the orphanage] for about a year and I wasn't treated very well because I had vitiligo,"" DePrince told the AP in a 2012 interview.
""We were ranked as numbers and number 27 was the least favourite and that was my number, so I got the least amount of food, the least amount of clothes and whatnot.""
She added that she remembered seeing a photo of an American ballet dancer on a magazine page that had blown against the gate of the orphanage during Sierra Leone's civil war.
She said she saw hope in the photo.
""I ripped the page out and I stuck it in my underwear because I didn't have any place to put it,"" she said.
Her passion helped inspire young Black dancers to pursue their dreams, her family said.
""We will miss her and her gorgeous smile forever and we know you will, too,"" their statement said.

Her sister, Mia Mabinty DePrince, recalled in the statement that they slept on a shared mat in the orphanage and used to make up their own musical theatre plays and ballets.
""When we got adopted, our parents quickly poured into our dreams and arose the beautiful, gracefully strong ballerina that so many of you knew her as today. She was an inspiration,"" Mia wrote.
""Whether she was leaping across the stage or getting on a plane and flying to third-world countries to provide orphans and children with dance classes, she was determined to conquer all her dreams in the arts and dance.""
She is survived by five sisters and two brothers.
The family requested that in lieu of flowers, donations could be made to War Child, an organisation DePrince was involved with as a War Child ambassador.
""This work meant the world to her, and your donations will directly help other children who grew up in an environment of armed conflict,"" the family statement said.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-14/how-capybaras-became-asia-s-spirit-animal/104335784,Have you heard of the capybara? Meet the South American rodent that's risen to global stardom,"After years of following them online, Li Jing finally met her spirit animal – the capybara — at Sydney's Taronga Zoo.
""I first fell in love with capybaras when I saw their videos online. They were taking a bath in a Japanese zoo,"" Ms Li said.
The 31-year-old, who works in the pet industry, said she adored them because they were ""so cute, so quiet, and so chill"".
""When I realised Taronga Zoo had them, I got really excited and immediately went to see them.
""Only four people can interact with the capybaras every day. People were lining up half an hour before tickets started to sell.
""Luckily, we got in. I fed them bamboo and they are just as cute as they are on video!""
The rodent species is a herbivore and can be found across most of South America, living in both wetlands and forests.
Semi-aquatic, they live partly on land and partly in water.
And they've won hearts all across the world in recent years.
Their rise to global stardom started in 2023, when a Russian blogger released a song called Capybara that went viral on TikTok and received millions of likes.
In parts of Asia, the animal's popularity took off years earlier, with an active fandom developing in Japan in the early 2010s, followed by China.
There are many cute animals around, but there is something special about capybaras, according to Ms Li.
""They have the vibe of being able face everything with a relaxed attitude … walking slowly, eating slowly and standing very still.
""They are also so friendly and can live harmoniously with other animals without conflict.
How did capybaras become Asia's favourite rodent?
Like Ms Li, many young people on social media are increasingly using capybara content as a form of self-expression.
Its emojis are widely used and translated into different languages.
And in China, an online community of capybara lovers have identified themselves with the phrase ""túnmén"", which carries the connotation of piously following the capybara way of life as if it were a religious teaching.
Qian Gong, a researcher of Chinese popular culture at Curtin University, said the ""highly volatile and super competitive"" environment of the post-COVID era was one reason why the animal had become so popular among young people in Asia.
""Capybaras seem to be favoured particularly for their temperament — emotionally stable and having a calm attitude,"" Dr Gong said.
""Young people have been struggling to cope with pressure and many could not see the point of trying hard and joining the rat race.""

Dr Gong added that internet neologisms like ""lying-flat"" and ""quiet quitting"" reflects the same kind of sentiment — but in comparison, a capybara's temperament carried a more positive connotation than these terms.
The idea of ""lying flat"" refers to working just enough to get by in China.
And instead of the rat race, it turns out young people have embraced a very different rodent.
The online popularity of capybara has created business opportunities as well.  (ABC News: Iris Zhao )
Beyond the internet craze, capybaras have also found their way into people's lives and created new business opportunities.
Pinyu Chen is the manager of a capybara-themed cafe called Mogu Kabi in the Taiwanese city of Tainan.
It opened in January 2022 and is home to five of the animals.
""At the time, capybaras weren't as popular in Taiwan as they were in Japan,"" Ms Chen said.
""We started doing this after seeing them on a Japanese tourist show. We imported baby capybaras from the United States.
Capybaras at the Mogu Kabi cafe in Taiwan are adored by locals and tourists from around the world. (Supplied: Mogu Kabi)
According to Ms Chen, the cafe immediately became popular, attracting customers from all over the world.
""We are really surprised about the level of enthusiasm people have for capybaras.""
But, she said, capybaras have a ""timid and sensitive nature"", so are often nervous around strangers.
""Therefore we limit the number of customers allowed to interact with them.""
Fans have sometimes lined up at the cafe for more than two hours just to get a chance to see them.
Capybara-themed merchandise can also be found almost anywhere in Asia in the form of soft toys, key chains, backpacks and blankets.
These kind of products have been relatively rare in Australia, but recently a variety of capybara toys made their debut in several Melbourne stores.
Polly Zeng is the owner of a store that sells capybara toys in Melbourne.  (ABC News: Iris Zhao)
Shop owner Polly Zeng, 28, said her capybara products sold out in under three weeks.
""I brought them here because I personally really love capybaras,"" she said.
""I had no idea whether they would appeal to Australian consumers.
""It turns out that they sell so well.
""The younger generations are more focused on their own wellbeing and want to reject overthinking.""
The popularity of capybaras has prompted some people overseas to keep them as household pets.
However, many owners have lacked the necessary expertise in caring for them, prompting animal welfare concerns from advocates.
Under federal and state law it is illegal to have a capybara as a pet in Australia. Whereas it is legal in some parts of Asia.
Huang Yuan, a vet from China's central city of Wuhan, said he once treated a capybara which was found abandoned.
""The capybara got septicaemia. It stopped eating and its stomach bloated.
""It died soon after the surgery,"" the vet added.
Ms Chen said although many of her cafe's patrons had expressed the desire to have a pet capybara, it wouldn't be right for the welfare of these tranquil animals.
""It is an aquatic animal, it likes to play with water,"" she explained.
""You also need to have at least two capybaras at a time, because they are social.""
Therefore, she said, they are ""not suited for the conventional home environment"".
Capybaras are particularly adored for their calm temperament.

Ms Li shared a similar sentiment.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-12/mtv-vma-key-moments-2024/104338248,Here are the key moments from the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards,"Fortnight is nominated in nine different categories at the MTV Video Music Awards, while Olivia Rodrigo, Chappell Roan, Charli XCX, Eminem and *NSYNC are also up for awards.
It was déjà vu when Eminem opened the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) with a bunch of look-alikes in blonde wigs, Eminem wearing one too before switching to a baseball cap.
It was a call back to his performance at the 2000 VMAs when he walked in with scores of ""Slim Shady"" characters dressed like him.
It wasn't the only throwback with host Megan Thee Stallion dressing up like Britney Spears during her 2001 VMA performance of Slave 4 U during which she carried a live snake.
It didn't take long for Megan Thee Stallion to discard her reptile friend.
From a surprise pregnancy reveal to Madonna and Britney's infamous kiss to Lady Gaga singing while covered in fake blood, the MTV Video Music Awards have hosted memorable performances.
There were plenty of awards handed out off camera, but when the ceremony began it was Taylor Swift and Post Malone who accepted the first award.
They won Best Collaboration for Fortnight.
""I wanted to say, you know, waking up this morning in New York on September 11, I've just been thinking about what happened 23 years ago,"" Swift said.
""Everyone who lost a loved one, and everyone that we lost, and that is the most important thing about today and everything that happens tonight.""

She went on to sing Post Malone's praises.
""There is a very clear reason why Post Malone is everyone in music's favourite person to collaborate [with], and it is because you are so ridiculously talented, you are so versatile, and you're the most down to earth person, honestly, so unfailingly polite,"" she said.
""It has taken me forever to get him to stop calling me ma'am.""
Of course, Post Malone couldn't resist a quip.
""Yes Ma'am,"" he said when asked by Swift if he wanted to say a few words.
The duo also won the biggest award of the night, Video of the Year, again for Fortnight, with Swift giving a shout out to her boyfriend Travis Kelce. Swift also urged Americans to register to vote.
Girls want to have more than just fun, apparently.

Carpenter went on to lock lips with an alien during her performance, before winning her first ever MTV VMA for Song of the Year for Espresso.
She thanked her cats and dogs, who she said were watching at home.
The Video Vanguard award is essentially a lifetime achievement award, and this year it went to Katy Perry.

The award was handed to her by her partner Orlando Bloom.
""Thank you so much to MTV for believing in my weirdness from day one and for helping artists extend their world beyond a song,"" Perry said.
""There are no decade long accidents.""
Perry also thanked ""the LGBTQ community who I recognise I would not be here without, and who showed me that you can be both kind and cut"".
Chappell Roan read from her diary when she took to the stage to accept the award for Best New Artist.

""I dedicate this to all the drag artists that inspire me and I dedicate this to the queer and trans people that fuel pop,"" Roan said.
""Thank you to the fans who listen to me when I share my joys and fears.
""To all the queer kids in the Midwest watching this right now, I see you, I understand you and don't let anyone tell you you can't be exactly what you want to be, bitch!""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-10/james-earl-jones-star-wars-the-lion-king-the-simpsons/104331850,"From Mufasa to Darth Vader, here are some of James Earl Jones's most iconic characters","Veteran actor James Earl Jones — who has died, aged 93 — boasted a career that spanned more than seven decades. He is also one of only a handful of figures who have nabbed themselves an EGOT (that's an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony).
Jones's impact was so wide-ranging and eclectic that each generation was blessed with a new touchstone of the actor's trademark low growl and stabilising on-screen presence.
Here are some of our favourite moments from Jones's illustrious career.
In the early 20th century, much to the horror of genteel (read: racist) society, Black heavyweight champion boxer Jack Johnson couldn't be beat. And many white boxers tried, with each promising hopeful labelled the ""Great White Hope"".
This term became the name of Howard Sackler's 1967 play about Johnson and a challenge from Jim Jeffries, the white boxer who came out of retirement to fight Johnson in 1910.
James Earl Jones delivered a Tony Award-winning performance as Johnson in the stage show, opposite Jane Alexander as his first wife, white Brooklyn socialite Etta Terry Duryea. Their interracial marriage was scandalous among white high society, and Johnson drank heavily and violently abused her.

But it was the film adaptation of the story in 1970 that helped catapult Jones further forward, earning him a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer, and a nomination for the Best Actor Academy Award.
As Variety said of his performance: ""Jones's re-creation of his stage role is an eye-riveting experience. The towering rages and unrestrained joys of which his character was capable are portrayed larger than life.""
— Katherine Smyrk
Darth Vader is, unimpeachably, one of pop culture's most iconic villains.
A space-age samurai clad in black, his towering silhouette framed by the sinister hum of his crimson lightsaber. More machine than man, his mysterious yet menacing mask accompanied by the cyclical gasp of a respirator.
But that intimidating vision wouldn't have had the necessary impact without the correct voice.
Unhappy with the muffled, West Country accent of David Prowse – the almost 2-metre actor inside the suit – director George Lucas initially sought Orson Welles to voice Vader.
Jones eventually landed the part, and his rich bottom-end proved the perfect fit. His gravitas helped immensely in selling the good versus evil stakes of the cinematic space opera, and in the process created an instantly renowned voice.
YouTube: Darth Vader's Greatest Quotes
If 1977's Star Wars: A New Hope was a powerful introduction, then the Empire Strikes Back arguably perfected the formula. Nearly every one of the lines Jones delivered in the 1980 sequel is memorable – a string of the most quotable lines in movie history, all etched with Jones's particular phrasing.
""Impressive. Most Impressive.""
""I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.""
And of course, the famous misquoted delivery to Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker that is one of cinema's biggest plot twists. (Do we really need a Spoiler Alert at this point?)
""No… I am your father.""
It speaks volumes that subsequent Star Wars villains never surpassed Vader's authoritative tone. Characters instead pivoted towards the mute or magisterial (the prequel trilogy's Darth Maul and Count Dooku respectively) while Adam Driver's Kylo Ren was (perhaps somewhat intentionally) a pale imitation.
It all underscores that Vader, and Jones's booming baritone, is an immortal one-of-a-kind.
— Al Newstead
Darth Vader might be Jones's most iconic villain, but the evildoer he played between the second and third Star Wars films showed he could be just as frightening in person as in voiceover.
His agent, Barry McPherson, confirmed Jones died Monday morning at home in New York's Hudson Valley region.
Thulsa Doom is the cruel antagonist of 1982's Conan The Barbarian, the film that catapulted Arnold Schwarzenegger – in the titular role – into Hollywood.
Doom is the leader of a savage snake cult and Jones plays him with a calculating sense of condescending menace. He doesn't say a word in his first appearance, in which he attacks Conan's tribe and beheads the young boy's mother, using only his steely glare and precise movements to instil fear.
We learn that Doom has supernatural powers, capable of hypnotising others to do his bidding and – in a sequence that gave countless kids of the 80s nightmares – transforms into a man-sized serpent.
Displaying his abilities to an imprisoned Conan in another scene, Doom wills a woman to fall to her death, declaring to his captive: ""That is strength, boy. That is power! … What is steel compared to the hand that wields it?""
He takes credit for gifting Conan his bloodthirsty determination and self-made strength because, you know, he ruined his childhood and set him up for revenge.
Fleshing out what could have been a mere comic book villain, Jones's Doom works so well because he is the deadly, controlled Yin to Conan's brawny, bull-headed Yang.
Conan The Barbarian has aged far better than other swords-and-sorcery flicks of the era, and the film's cult status is arguably due to Jones's performance as much as Schwarzenegger's.

In 1920, in the small town of Matewan, West Virginia, coal miners went on strike. The violent response and suppression of their action is the inspiration behind this iconic film. It's a story about worker solidarity, and the fight against an exploitative employer whose power stretches beyond just the workplace.
Jones plays Few Clothes Johnson, the leader of Black workers brought in by the mining company. One of the first scenes in the film is of a group of Black men being attacked as they get off the train by a number of angry white men; setting the tone for the furious animosity that existed on many fronts.
Jones's rumbling power comes out when he joins a union meeting early in the film, and is met with anger and cries of ""scab"".
""Now you watch your mouth, peckerwood. I've been called n*****, and I can't help that's the way white folks is, but I ain't never been called no scab!""
That scene is a turning point in the film, and slowly sees the hostility between the Black and Italian workers hired by the mining company and the local white coal miners start to ebb away.
They find a sense of camaraderie as they try to fight the mining company for better conditions, and a liveable wage.

In the 1988 cult Eddie Murphy film Coming to America, Jones plays a character that is seldom written for Black men in Hollywood: the loving father who can admit when he is wrong, and change.
Coming to America | Official Trailer | Paramount Movies
As ruler of the fictional wealthy African nation of Zamunda, Jones's king Jaffe Joffer commands the space of every room he enters — always behind servants tasked with throwing rose petals to the ground for him to walk on. He is also used to getting his way.
But when Jaffe's son, crown prince Akeem Joffer (Murphy), refuses the marriage he has arranged because he wants a wife who will ""arouse his intellect as well as his loins"", the king ultimately puts his son's happiness before the outdated traditions he long upheld.
On the surface, Jones's Jaffe was a humorously out-of-touch royal and comically stern parent. This exterior, characterised by Jones's trademark powerful voice and imposing stature, makes the reveal of the soft, loving and tender father that lurks beneath all the more moving.
There's a lot that's (iconically) ridiculous about Coming to America, from the all-pervasive Jheri curls and the knock-off McDonald's called McDowell's to the fact Murphy and his co-star Arsenio Hall play four characters apiece (one of whom is white). But Jones brought glorious depth to the film, and his multifaceted portrayal of Jaffe is a big part of why Black diaspora audiences still raise their children watching it.
""Son, please. I am more than the exalted ruler of this land and the master of all I survey,"" Jaffe tells prince Akeem one morning from the opposite end of a long breakfast table.
""I am also a concerned dad.""
— Yasmin Jeffery
You might be thinking: ""Oh yeah, I remember JEJ in The Simpsons from when Mufasa and Darth Vader come out of the clouds with Bleeding Gums Murphy.""
But sadly, you are mistaken — this was actually Harry Shearer doing his best impression.
Jones appeared in Springfield even earlier, with his voice featuring in all three segments of the very first Treehouse of Horror in 1990 — he remains the only guest voice to hold this distinction.
He has a single line as a snarky moving guy in Bad Dream House. He is moved to tears as Serak the Preparer, after Lisa accuses the octopus aliens of planning to eat the family (""You're not the only beings with emotions, you know!""). And his mammoth voice talents were finally allowed all the space to move in The Raven: The Simpsons take on Edgar Allen Poe's classic, which features Jones as the narrator.
Jones just couldn't stay away from the Halloween episodes, returning a of couple years later to voice Maggie Simpson, of all people. Of course, this is an alternate-world Maggie, who has just plunged an axe into Groundskeeper Willie's back (""This is indeed a disturbing universe."")
His voice popped up in just one non-Treehouse episode: in season nine's Das Bus, a parody of Lord Of The Flies. You can hear Jones in the very last seconds of the episode, yadda yading about how the kids got rescued, the hilarity of the one-liner only enriched by the actor's dulcet tones.
— Velvet Winter
As much as it might seem like the time for it, don't go back and watch 1994's The Lion King today in Jones's memory. It's hard enough on a regular day to watch Jones's voice embody World's Best (lion) Dad, Mufasa.
Don't be tempted by his iconic speech about the Pridelands being everything the light touches. I know it's difficult to resist how he condenses the circle of life so concisely and kindly that even a toddler could understand. You don't want to dwell on how he heroically saves baby Simba from the hyenas, quickly forgiving the rebellious cub before explaining to his child that he'll always be watching over him in the stars. Don't even think about how he appears to adult Simba in the clouds and in pools of water to give him worldly advice.
It's hard, I know you want to relive all of Jones's flawless voice work as the elder Lion King, in a role that introduced his low growl to a new generation, in a film that remains the highest-grossing traditionally animated film of all time.
You simply must resist because in order to revel in all of the gloriousness of Jones's work as Mufasa, you have to watch THE scene. You know the scene. You know the sound of the stampede coming down the gorge. You know the desperation in Mufasa's voice as he calls for Scar, his brother, to save him. You know the roar as he falls. You know tiny baby Simba pleading with his unmoving Dad to get up 'cause they have to go home. You might be tearing up just reading this.
So protect yourself, wait until the weekend to bust out The Lion King and have a good, ugly cry as you remember the impact Jones's voice has had.
— Velvet Winter
In James Earl Jones Reads the Bible: King James Version, the actor lends his voice to the New Testament.
That's more than 17 hours of his sonorous tones delivering lines like: ""Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren… And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.""
There are a lot of ""begats"" where the ellipsis lies.
According to Guinness World Records, the bible is the best-selling book of all time with well over 5 billion copies sold. The version narrated by Jones was also an international bestseller, selling more than 600,000 copies.
His soothing, melodious voice captures the poetic grandeur of the sacred text, with the Washington Post saying: ""Somehow that voice of his, calm, deep, powerful…makes the words seem more thrilling than ever.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-09/icymi-kendrick-lamar-superbowl-linkin-park-new-singer-apology/104327470,'I wanted to clear the air': New Linkin Park vocalist addresses controversy,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recap the pop culture and entertainment news that you might have missed over the last few days.
Let us get you caught up.
Just hours after Linkin Park announced they were reforming with new vocalist Emily Armstrong, the singer was criticised by peers and fans for supporting disgraced That '70s Show actor Danny Masterson.
Masterson was charged with three counts of rape in June 2020 for incidents from the early 00s, when he was at the height of his fame. Last September, Masterson was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for two of the three alleged rapes.
Four of Danny Masterson's That '70s Show cast mates wrote character letters in support of the convicted rapist, including Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis.
Masterson met his victims through the Church of Scientology. The victims claimed the church discouraged them from contacting authorities following the rapes.
Following Masterson's conviction, backlash grew towards his former That '70s Show co-stars Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, who wrote character letters in support of the actor.
Armstrong's connection to Masterson was spotlighted last week following her debut performance with Linkin Park, thanks to a resurfaced comment from Mars Volta singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala.
""Do your fans know about your friend Danny Masterson? Your rapist friend,"" Bixler-Zavala wrote in a comment on a post on Armstrong's band's Instagram page last year.

Bixler-Zavala, who is a former member of the Church of Scientology, went on to suggest Armstrong and people from the Church supported Masterson in court, and harassed victims.
Bixler-Zavala's wife, Chrissie Carnell Bixler, was one of the multiple women who accused Masterson of assault, but he was not convicted on the charges related to her allegations.
Without mentioning Masterson by name, Armstrong denied any ongoing friendship with the actor in an Instagram story on Friday.
""Hi, I'm Emily, I'm new to so many of you, and I wanted to clear the air about something that happened a while back,"" she wrote.
""Several years ago, I was asked to support someone I considered a friend at a court appearance, and went to one early hearing as an observer. Soon after, I realised I shouldn't have. I always try to see the good in people, and I misjudged him. I have never spoken with him since.
""To say it as clearly as possible: I do not condone abuse or violence against women, and I empathise with the victims of these crimes.""
Linkin Park is set to kick off a world tour in support of their upcoming album From Zero in September.
Even if you don't follow US football, the Super Bowl halftime spectacular remains an international show stopper, attracting every artist from Prince to Katy Perry.
Now, it's Kendrick Lamar's turn to helm the halftime entertainment show, which regularly attracts more than 100 million viewers.
The Humble rapper announced he'd be headlining next year's event with a very patriotic IG Reel.
""You know there's only one opportunity to win a championship, no round twos,"" Lamar says, as he feeds footballs through a throwing machine.
""I wouldn't want you to miss it. Meet me in New Orleans, February 9, 2025. Wear your best dress too, even if you're watching from home.""
While this will be Lamar's first go at headlining the big game, he featured in Dr Dre's 2022 halftime show alongside Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige. The production went on to win three Emmys, including Outstanding Variety Special (Live) — a first-ever for the show.
Lamar's audiovisual production company pgLang — which helmed the artist's We Cry Together music video, as well as his last live tour film — will provide creative direction for his halftime show.
This show will be the culmination of a massive year for the rapper, after his Drake diss track 'Not Like Us' debuted atop the Billboard 100 back in May, and broke multiple streaming records (and you know, also won the beef).
""Rap music is still the most impactful genre to date,"" Lamar said in a statement announcing his upcoming Super Bowl gig.
""And I'll be there to remind the world why. They got the right one.""
The Australian team behind Love on the Spectrum US has won two Emmy awards for the show's second season at this year's Creative Arts Emmy Awards.

Co-created by Karina Holden and Cian O'Clery and produced by Australia's Northern Pictures, Love on the Spectrum U.S. won both Outstanding Casting for a Reality Program and Outstanding Directing for a Reality Program. This brings the show's total Emmy count to five, after winning three trophies for its first season in 2022.
This documentary series follows young adults on the autism spectrum as they explore the unpredictable world of love, dating and relationships.
The Netflix show echoes the format of the original Australian version created for ABC TV, following people on the autism spectrum as they approach dating and relationships.
In a statement, Holden said, ""It's an incredible feeling for our cast and crew to be acknowledged by the Academy here in Hollywood."" The show's third season is currently in production.
The Creative Arts Emmys continue Monday afternoon Australian time, celebrating technical and behind-the-scenes work.
The Primetime Emmy Awards will be held Monday September 16, with The Morning Show and The Bear leading with 11 and nine nominations, respectively.
Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar has taken out the top honour at the 81st Venice International Film Festival with his first English-language drama.
The Room Next Door, starring Tilda Swinton and Julianne Moore, won the Golden Lion (best film) over the weekend.
The movie — which is an adaptation of What Are You Going Through, a 2020 novel by Sigrid Nunez — focuses on friends who reconnect after one (Swinton) is diagnosed with stage-three cervical cancer and considers euthanasia.

At Venice it debuted to a 17-minute-long standing ovation, among the longest of the festival's recent history. It is Almodóvar's second Golden Lion, after receiving an honorary one in 2019 for his body of work, which features more than 20 movies including All About My Mother and Volver.
This year's Grand Jury Prize, the runner-up award, went to Italian director Maura Delpero's Vermiglio, a drama about an affair, set against the backdrop of World War II.
Other In Competition awards include: the Silver Lion for best director, going to Brady Corbet for his three-and-a-half-hour epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody and Guy Pearce; the Special Jury Prize, awarded to Georgian filmmaker Dea Kulumbegashvili for abortion drama April; and best screenplay, going to writing duo Murilo Hauser and Heitor Lorega for Brazilian drama I'm Still Here.
The Australian actress leaves the film festival after learning the news her mother had died aged 84.
Nicole Kidman won best actress for her performance in Babygirl, an erotic thriller where she plays an e-commerce CEO who has an affair with a young intern (Harris Dickinson, The Iron Claw). Kidman was unable to accept the award on Saturday night due to her mother's sudden death, with film director Halina Reijn taking the stage in her place.
Best actor went to French actor Vincent Lindon for The Quiet Son, while best young actor went to 22-year-old French actor Paul Kircher for And Their Children After Them.
As previously announced, Australian filmmaker Peter Weir (Dead Poets Society, Picnic at Hanging Rock, The Truman Show) was awarded a Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement, alongside actor Sigourney Weaver.","Jared Richards, Velvet Winter",Mon 9 Sep,0

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-02/oasis-ticketmaster-trump-leunig-adele-break-anna-delvey/104298958,Trump campaign says biographical film belongs in a 'dumpster fire' after release date confirmed,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recount the pop culture and entertainment news from over the weekend that you might have missed.
Let us get you caught up.
Director Ali Abbasi has had one goal for his upcoming film, The Apprentice, a loose biography of Donald Trump's early life: get it in theatres before the November US election.
Well, Abbasi has got his wish, with Briarcliff Entertainment picking up the film for an October 11 release in US and Canadian theatres — and the Trump campaign is not happy.

The Apprentice chronicles Trump's (played by Sebastian Stan) rise to power in 1980s New York City under the tutelage of infamous defence attorney Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong).
In a statement on Friday, Steven Cheung, communications director for the Trump campaign, called the film's release, ""election interference by Hollywood elites right before November"".
""This 'film' is pure malicious defamation, should never see the light of day, and doesn't even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store, it belongs in a dumpster fire,"" Cheung said.
The Apprentice initially struggled to find a distributor following its premiere at this year's Cannes, in part due to the threat of legal action. At the time Cheung called the film ""pure fiction"" and said the Trump team would file a lawsuit ""to address the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers"".
No lawsuit has yet materialised.
The Apprentice is slated for release in Australia on October 10.
After 55 years, controversial cartoonist Michael Leunig has published his last work in Victorian newspaper The Age.
Leunig says his final filing is ""not a cartoon"" and instead a farewell offering in the form of an ""odd little painting"" titled Grandpa in the Garden.
""Through Leunig's work, we have contemplated life's beautiful and occasionally baffling moments,"" Spectrum editor Lindy Percival said.
""Mr Curly arriving home to his curly-headed family; a simple soul dreaming of floating coloured petals; and a father and son watching the sun set on TV, oblivious to the real thing happening outside their window. All the while, his angels have looked on – often in sorrow, sometimes in anger, but always with love.""
On his personal website, Leunig categorised his departure as a ""sacking"", but that leaving the newspaper had left him ""exhilarated"".
""Suddenly, there at last after all those years in newspapers, in one bound I was free; free to have a life without the compliance and worry of thankless mainstream media deadlines,"" he said.
""I have been refreshed and granted a precious new chapter of life in which to plant trees, to paint pictures, to talk to the birds and kangaroos, to harvest my own vegetables … to get on with the memoir and various projects.""
First contributing to The Age back in 1969, Leunig lost his prime Monday position in the newspaper in 2021 over a cartoon that compared objections over mandatory vaccinations to the iconic Tiananmen Square ""tank man"" protest.
He continued to provide cartoons for the newspaper's Saturday Spectrum section.
Getting tickets to see Oasis in their first gig in 15 years was always going to be a headache. But fans of the mouthy Mancs were unprepared for the drama that unfolded as tickets to their UK and Ireland Live '25 tour were released over the weekend.
Tens of thousands of fans queued online for hours only to realise that standing tickets, originally advertised at £135 ($261), had soared to as high as £355 ($688).
The price of tickets became inflated under Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing mechanism, where tickets that are deemed ""in demand"" can be sold for a higher price than initially advertised (similar to how the cost of a rideshare can explode during surge times).
Irish fans encountered the same issues, with tickets for Oasis's Croke Park gigs going from €86.50 ($141) to up to €415.50 ($677) for the same ticket.
Oasis has issued a warning against resellers after some tickets were listed for thousands of pounds minutes after pre-sale.
Following the outcry from Oasis fans, UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said dynamic pricing would be included in a government review of the secondary gig sales market.
""It's depressing to see vastly inflated prices excluding ordinary fans from having a chance of enjoying their favourite band live,"" she said in a statement.
Harry Styles, Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran have used dynamic pricing for past international tours.
Ticketmaster says on their website: ""Promoters and artists set ticket prices. Prices can be either fixed or market-based. Market-based tickets are labelled as 'Platinum' or 'In Demand'.""
Adele has told audiences they won't see her for ""an incredibly long time"", after she wraps up her two-year Las Vegas residency this November.
The 36-year-old made the comments on Saturday, the final night of a Munich residency where a custom Adele Arena was built for a series of 10 performances.
""I'd like to thank you so much for coming to my show this evening,"" she told audiences, as seen in footage shared on social media. ""I'm not the most comfortable performer, I know that. But I am very f***ing good at it. And I have really enjoyed performing for nearly three years now, which is the longest I've ever done and probably the longest I will ever do.
""After [Las Vegas], I will not see you for an incredibly long time and I will hold you dear in my heart.""
""It has been amazing, I just need a rest. I have spent the last seven years building a new life for myself and I want to live it … I will miss you terribly.""
Adele has hinted at a break previously, telling German press in July that she did not ""have any plans for new music at all"". Her fourth and latest album, 30, was released in 2021, ahead of her Las Vegas residency, which began in November 2022 after a series of COVID-19-related delays.

Fake heiress and convicted con artist Anna Delvey — real name Anna Sorokin, who was the inspiration behind Netflix's popular miniseries, Inventing Anna — is tipped to join the next US season of Dancing with the Stars.
Under her Delvey moniker, Anna defrauded multiple people and businesses out of approximately $US275,000 ($406,357) in the 2010s, fronting as a German heiress working on creating an elite Manhattan social club.
She was sentenced to prison for 4-12 years in 2019, and convicted by a US jury of attempted grand larceny, three grand larceny accounts and four misdemeanour charges of theft of service. Since 2022, the Russian-born German citizen has been under house arrest in New York and is currently seeking asylum in the US, as she faces deportation for allegedly overstaying a visa.
Inventing Anna tells the story of a fake German heiress who fooled New York's elite, but the major talking point is the character's unusual accent.
Although owing more than $US200,000 in fines for her actions, Delvey has so far not seen any of the reported $US242,500 ($358,211) Netflix paid her for Inventing Anna, due to a US law where convicted criminals cannot profit from their crimes.
Now, Page Six reports Delvey has been granted ""special permission"" to travel to Los Angeles from New York to appear on Dancing with the Stars' 33rd season, which will premiere on September 17.
In 2019, Variety reported that contestants could make up to $US295,000 ($435,778) by appearing on the show. ABC has declined to comment on the reports, but the cast will be announced on September 4.
Delvey's other post-prison endeavours include podcasts, music, art, non-fungible tokens and the launch of Outlaw Agency, a PR company with influential publicist Kelly Cutrone.","Jared Richards, Velvet Winter",Mon 2 Sep,0

""Oh, gosh, yeah, that was my childhood,"" Donovan told ABC News.
""They're the movies I grew up watching. And I just absolutely love Whoopi, and I think she's an amazing actor, and just her wittiness and hilarity and front footedness that she gives Deloris is, yeah, it's quirky and fun and joyful to try and get that out of me.""
Donovan takes on the role of Deloris in Sister Act the musical, which is currently playing at the Capitol Theatre in Sydney.
Deloris is a disco diva, who is placed under protective custody after witnessing a murder. She's hidden in the one place she shouldn't be found – a convent – where she poses as Sister Mary Clarence, taking leadership of the struggling choir and helping her fellow sisters find their true voices as she unexpectedly rediscovers her own.
Donovan, the Indigenous double and triple platinum-selling recording artist who in 2004 aged 16 was the youngest winner of Australian Idol and whose theatrical productions include The Sapphires, Rent, Chicago, and 9 to 5, is relishing playing the lead role of Deloris.
""I like to think when I'm going on stage every night, she kind of takes the wheel as soon as that curtain goes up,"" Donovan said.

Donovan left her role as Angelique in & Juliet a month early so she could play Deloris.
She's been doing musicals for about 12 years, but this is her first lead role.
""She's a joy to play and to see her soft side and her vulnerabilities once she gets into the convent,"" Donovan says.
""She's this loud-mouth soul singer that just wants to be famous, and at the end of the day, she finds solace with her sisters in a convent.
""They listen to her, and they protect her, and they're her true friends by the end of it.
""It's such a beautiful arc that she gets. She finally gets that stardom where she never thought she'd ever have it. And it's in a convent!""
Donovan was conscious of making the role her own and putting her own unique stamp on it.
""With these big roles and having [someone] like Whoopi play Deloris Van Cartier, trying to fill those shoes is a massive thing,"" Donovan said.
""So, the one thing I love is bringing myself to a role and seeing what I can also bring with the light and shade.
""I get to play this role for nine months. So, it's with me for a long time. So, you want to make it as comfortable and as joyful as you possibly can.""
The recently engaged Donovan was born in Bankstown in south-west Sydney, and although she lives in Melbourne now, her schedule is such that she hasn't been home in 12 months.
""Melbourne's up next, so I can't wait to get home and just nest for a few minutes before I have to pack another bag and g-o,"" she said.
Joining Donovan on stage is Genevieve Lemon as Mother Superior (The Power of the Dog, The Piano, Sweetie) and Rhonda Burchmore (Love Child, Hairspray, Mamma Mia!) plays Sister Mary Lazarus.
""It's fun, it's joyful, it's silly, and it's full of a powerhouse cast.""
Although the show will be nostalgic for those who grew up in the 1990s, the incredible movie soundtrack is missing.
Gone are the spins that the nuns put on songs like My Guy (My God) and I Will Follow Him.
This was quite deliberate.
The musical has a distinctly different soundtrack to the movie. (Supplied: Daniel Boud)
Tony and eight-time Oscar award-winner Alan Menken (Disney's Aladdin, Enchanted, The Little Mermaid) composed new songs for the musical with lyrics by Glenn Slater.
""The music in the movies actually was just song parodies,"" Menken says in a video publicising the musical, which has also appeared on Broadway and London's West End.
""People think of it as a musical, but the fact is, those were pre-existing songs where the lyrics were just kind of bent a little bit to fit the nuns.""
Some would argue that that was the joy in it, however.
Donovan says the new tunes are a fitting accompaniment to the story, and Menken has done an ""amazing"" job.
""[Sister Act is] something new to Australia, which we've never had.
""There's a lot of shows out there at the minute that have been here before, but Sister Act is making its Australian debut into the musical theatre scene … and it's just such a great night out at the theatre.""
With Sister Act 2 one of those rare sequels that was just as good as the first movie, if not better, will there be a part two to the musical?
""I would love if there was a part two,"" Donovan said.

In honour of its 25th anniversary, this month we're looking at cult classic Freaks and Geeks.
Freaks and Geeks was ahead of its time.
What: A near perfect dramedy that follows the lives of ordinary teens in 1980 Detroit
Starring: James Franco, Linda Cardellini, John Francis Daley, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, Martin Starr, Samm Levine, Busy Philipps
Created by: Paul Feig
Where to watch: Stan
Likely to make you feel: nostalgic for the heady highs and lows of the high school experience
Paul Feig and Judd Apatow's short-lived 1999 dramedy was unconcerned with the melodramatic trappings of shows like Dawson Creek and 90210. Instead, they drew on their real-life experiences, and captured high school in all its embarrassingly authentic glory.
""[Freaks and Geeks] was the accumulation of many, many years of watching high school shows and movies and just feeling so alienated by them because they always tended to be about the cool kids,"" Feig told the Washington Post in 2021.
""I would watch and go, 'That wasn't anybody I knew. I only hung out with the immature people or the awkward ones.'""
Despite being cancelled in its first season, Freaks and Geeks remains a cult classic with a very loyal fanbase. This month marks the 25th anniversary of the show's first broadcast, so there's never been a better time to jump in (or learn just enough about it to get your superfan friend off your back).
Freaks and Geeks revolves around siblings Lindsay (Linda Cardellini) and Sam Weir (John Francis Daley) who live with their mum (Becky Ann Baker) and dad (Joe Flaherty) in an unremarkable Detroit suburb in 1980.
The Freaks and Geeks and SCTV star is remembered as ""the nicest guy you could know"".
Sixteen-year-old Lindsay has been excelling through high school as an over-achieving mathlete. But the death of her grandmother shakes her belief system so much that she starts looking to hang with a different crowd — the titular freaks.
There's hot/cold couple Kim Kelly (Busy Philipps) and Daniel Desario (James Franco), both as volatile as they are damaged, loveable stoner Nick Andopolis (Jason Segel) and gruff Ken Miller (Seth Rogen).
Sweet and sensitive Sam is two years younger than his sister and stuck on geek island with his best friends Neal Schweiber (Samm Levine), a Vegas ventriloquist's puppet brought to life, and the supremely awkward Bill Haverchuck (Martin Starr).
An essential part of Freak and Geeks' lore is the show's brutal cancellation.
US network NBC was already taking a risk commissioning an hour-long dramedy focused on the unglamorous trappings of real-life teens, with nary a supermodel in sight.

Then-NBC Entertainment president Scott Sassa championed Freaks and Geeks to the network but, in a case of dreadful timing, a new president was appointed in the time between the pilot and the full series being aired.
Garth Ancier, who was responsible for putting shows like The Simpsons and Buffy The Vampire Slayer on air at other networks, did not see the value of Freaks and Geeks.
Ancier and the network thought the kids should have more outward victories.
""And the intention of the show was to show how kids handle failure and difficult experiences, and how you get through those things with the support of your friends and family.""
Despite pulling in between 5 and 7 million viewers per episode (a hit by today's standards), NBC deemed Freaks and Geeks devoid of an audience.
The show was cancelled after 12 episodes went to air and, to add insult to injury, NBC just never showed three episodes (they were aired during later syndication).
But the Freaks and Geeks fanbase was a strong one, quickly turning the show into a cult classic.
Apatow, who had developed close relationships with his young cast, brought his Freaks and Geeks crew with him as he revolutionised slacker comedy in the early 2000s. Rewatching the iconic Joan-Jett-soundtracked opening titles now is like looking into a crystal ball of future A-listers.
Freaks and Geeks (1999) Opening Titles
Seth Rogen went on to create his own comedy empire. James Franco managed to be both a movie star and an indie auteur before his grot actions caught up with him (kind of). Linda Cardellini is one of the most consistent film and TV actors in Hollywood. Busy Philipps is killing it on Netflix's Girls5eva. John Francis Daley took a turn behind the camera, penning scripts for blockbusters like Spiderman: Homecoming and the recent Dungeons and Dragons film. And Jason Segel has spent 25 years proving he is as competent in dramatic roles as he is in comedies.
There's also plenty of names lower on the call sheet that Freaks and Geeks helped uncover. Rashida Jones, Shia LaBeouf, Lizzy Caplan and Jason Schwartzman all found some of their first TV spots on the show.
Paul Feig created a solid precedent against any ""women aren't funny"" arguments with his 2011 film Bridesmaids. Mike White wrote three episodes and produced 17, a good training ground before he created White Lotus. Director and consulting producer Jake Kasdan went on to EP all 146 episodes of New Girl. Casting director Allison Jones has had a glittering journey since Freaks and Geeks, most recently putting together the insane ensemble cast for Barbie.
In 2014, Rogen shared on Twitter that he confronted Ancier at a party for cancelling Freaks and Geeks.
""He oddly tried to justify it. He was like, 'You know, Judd wouldn't listen to my notes.'"" Rogen told Huffpost Live.
""He was like, 'You know, I kept telling Judd, give them a victory, give them a victory.' And I was like, 'The whole show was about how in high school you always lose all the time.'""
""He went to a private school and was very rich as a child.""
Responding on Facebook, Ancier said: ""[Cancelling Freaks and Geeks] was an awful decision that has haunted me forever.""
In Chokin' and Tokin', Lindsay takes a giant step away from her good-girl persona, trying marijuana for the first time.
In classic first-time-on-drugs fashion, Lindsay is called in for babysitting duty right after she sparks up.
Her ex-friend Millie (Sarah Hagan as the hilarious Christian do-gooder) begrudgingly offers assistance, and then gently guides Lindsay through her drug-induced existential crisis.
Stoned Lindsay promises to return to Millie and the mathletes but, in an aching recreation of the fragility of teen friendships, those promises disappear when she sobers up.

As for the geeks, bully Alan decides to test Bill's peanut allergy by sneaking some nuts into his sandwich, sending sweet Bill straight to the hospital.
After being forced by his father to apologise to a comatose Bill, Alan breaks away from his bully archetype for a heartbreaking monologue, proving that even the side characters in Freaks and Geeks are written in three dimensions.
Feig and co. have said the looming threat of cancellation spurred writers to tackle then-taboo subjects in their remaining episodes. The Little Things is one of those.
A few episodes after Ken gets with his band-nerd girlfriend Amy (Jessica Campbell), she confides in him that she was born intersex, with her parents deciding she would live as a girl.

Ken initially goes the bonehead route, questioning if it means he's gay. But not once is Amy's biology presented as an oddity. Instead, conflict is derived from Ken's naive reaction.
Parents in Freaks and Geeks sit on a spectrum — from Kim's cruel and dismissive mother to Lindsay and Sam's strict but kind father.
Up until The Garage Door, Neal's charming dentist father is the gold standard. He lets the geeks stay up late to watch Saturday Night Live and supplies Neal with the latest doodads.
Then Sam catches Mr Schweiber getting close to a woman who is not his wife at the mall.
Neal is initially reluctant to believe Sam, until he finds a garage remote that does not belong to his family.
Bridesmaids and Ghostbusters director Paul Feig on his new film Jackpot!
Off Neal, Sam and Bill go on their bikes to find the door the remote opens. But when Sam and Bill have to abandon the search and go home, Neal continues without his friends, determined and indignant.
The discoveries he makes, while all alone, encapsulate the disorienting moment of adolescence when you realise your parents aren't who you thought they were.
This was one of the episodes that was never aired in its original run, which is such a shame, because it contains sublime examples of dialogue-free characterisation.
Bill Haverchuck is the purest example of the geeks; he's not really concerned with girls or climbing out of their social pit. He's an outcast among the outcasts.
Four minutes into this episode, there is a wordless scene in which Bill makes himself a simple after-school snack, before settling in to watch comedian Garry Shandling on TV. Set to The Who's song I'm One, the camera cuts closer and closer to Bill's face as he laughs euphorically and his wide eyes meet Shandling's pixelated ones.
In other hands, this quiet scene would be used to sappily emphasise Bill's loneliness. But in a minute and a half, Bill is shown to actually be the most self-actualised of all the teens. Bill knows his life is small and sometimes humiliating, but at this moment he's happy.
It's a validating balm for anyone who has found company and comfort in popular culture, and a reminder that small moments of joy can be found even in the deepest perils of adolescence.

After much speculation online, the English rock band this week announced dates for 17 shows across the UK and Ireland in August and July next year.
A limited number of fans were able to purchase the first round of tickets through a ballot on Friday evening.
But tickets appeared on resale websites within minutes of a pre-sale, listed for thousands of pounds.
Fans shared screenshots of ticket listings on StubHub with asking prices of more than £6,000 ($11,644) for lower seating and general admission.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
Oasis said according to the terms and conditions, tickets could only be resold at face value via Ticketmaster and Twickets.
""Tickets sold in breach of terms and conditions will be cancelled by the promoters,"" they wrote in a post to X.
Oasis promoters had previously issued a similar warning, telling fans tickets sold through ""unauthorised resale platforms"" would be in breach of terms and conditions and ""may be cancelled"".
Ahead of the pre-sale, promoters said standing tickets would cost £150 and standard seated tickets would range from £73 to £205.
The most expensive official package, available for five concerts at London's Wembley Stadium, is priced at £506.
After 15 years of refuting any suggestion they might reform, Oasis are reuniting to headline a series of live concerts.
About 1.4 million tickets are expected to be sold for the band's 17 shows across the UK and Ireland next year.
General sales will open on August 31 at 9am BST (6pm AEST) for the band's UK shows and 8am IST (5pm AEST) for its Ireland dates.
The English rock band announced they were reforming for the first time in 15 years earlier this week.
In-fighting between brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher boiled over on August 28, 2009, culminating in a backstage scuffle moments before they were set to play the Rock en Seine festival in Paris.

When you're on his level, your mates just happen to include Swizz Beats, Pharrell Williams and Timbaland, who were executive producers on Blockbusta, along with Rhymes himself.
On Friday, the 52-year-old released the music video for Legacy, which features three of his six adult children Cie, Trillian and Rai. He gives a shout out to T'ziah, T'Khi and Sacario – his other children – at the end of the track.
Rhymes is heading back to Australia in October for the first time in almost 15 years. He was last here for Supafest in 2011. This time around he'll perform at Promiseland on the Gold Coast, followed by live shows in Sydney and Melbourne.
From a health battle that could have killed him to stories about the golden age of hip hop, we look at the making of hip hop royalty, in anticipation of his visit down under.
Trevor George Smith Jr was born in Brooklyn, New York to Jamaican migrant parents, telling Men's Health last August that his licensed electrical contractor father wanted him to follow in his footsteps and took him out on jobs ""routing cables"" and ""nailing stuff into the walls"" when he was just 12 and 13 years old.
""We worked in abandoned buildings in Bed-Stuy with basements flooded with water, with rats and cockroaches running around,"" Rhymes told the magazine.
""I didn't wanna do that. Hell no!""
Rhymes says his father wanted him to follow in his footsteps as an electrical contractor, but it wasn't the job for him. (Supplied by artist)
Rhymes attended George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School in downtown Brooklyn where other famous alumni include the Notorious B.I.G. (aka Biggie Smalls) and Jay-Z.
On an episode of All the Smoke with Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, Rhymes said, prior to its official release, Biggie had a long queue of people lined up to get copies of his 1994 debut album Ready to Die, which he was giving out in his neighbourhood for free.
When Rhymes asked Biggie what he was doing, he said he was going to make it look like the person who didn't have his album was the hater.
""It was the illest way of thinking at the time because it was brilliant marketing,"" Rhymes said, adding that DJs got promotional material anyway, so why not the streets?
Rhymes went on to reveal that the bars Biggie spits on the track Dangerous MC's, which is on his 1999 posthumous album Born Again, were recorded in front of him at a studio session he'd booked.
He says the verse contained a 2Pac (Tupac Shakur) diss, which Rhymes chose not to release because he was friends with both rappers, and didn't want to fan any flames.
""My relationship with 'Pac was super-duper beautiful,"" he told Barnes and Jackson.
""Biggie and me was closer than me and 'Pac.
""But my relationship with 'Pac was incredible.""
Rhymes was friends with Biggie and 2Pac. (Supplied by artist)
Rhymes said he had some insight others don't and feels it's regrettable that Biggie and 2Pac became the faces of the East Coast-West Coast beef in the 1990s, because things weren't as they seemed, with Rhymes privy to the ""real dynamics"" of what was going on.
He said it was important to keep the legacies of both men alive.
""Those dudes were both heroes to me,"" he said.
Rhymes has been active in the hip hop world since the late 1980s, and while his verse on the 1991 track Scenario by A Tribe Called Quest caught the attention of the streets, Rhymes was not yet a solo artist, but part of the group Leaders of the New School, with whom he released two albums.
Rhymes has been nominated for Grammys 12 times and never won. (Supplied by artist)
On Off Air with Big Boy, Rhymes said he discovered he was dropped from the group while on a movie set.
""I found out that I was kicked out the group while I was in LA shooting Higher Learning,"" he said.
Rhymes was at first anxious about going solo. But his debut solo album The Coming was certified platinum in the US and peaked at number six on the Billboard 200, and went to number one on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.
He is 12-time Grammy nominated, making him one of the most nominated artists who has never won a Grammy. But the Recording Academy has never really got hip hop.
Crucially, Rhymes has the respect of his peers.
He received a standing ovation when awarded the BET Lifetime Achievement Award in 2023, the same year the world was celebrating 50 years of hip hop.
""I'mma wear it on my sleeve,"" he told the crowd.
""I do want to cry.""
He then removed his sunglasses and wiped away tears.
Rhymes was emotional when presented with a lifetime achievement award from BET. (Supplied by artist)
His hits include Woo Hah!! Got You All in Check (1996), Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See (1997) and his collaboration with the Pussycat Dolls Don't Cha (2005) is his most-streamed song on Spotify. Rhymes has worked with many other artists including Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey.
Chuck D gave Busta Rhymes his moniker. (Supplied by artist)
Known also by the nickname Bus-a-Bus, Rhymes got his moniker from another hip hop legend – Public Enemy's Chuck D, who named Rhymes after the NFL wide receiver George ""Buster"" Rhymes because, he said, there was a resemblance.
Given his name also works as a double entendre for an artist who busts rhymes, it's a name that's stuck.
Believe it or not, this is something that has been studied. Rhymes is capable of averaging about 143 words per minute. This is incredibly fast and puts him in league with the speediest rappers of all time. Just listen to Break Ya Neck or his verse on Chris Brown's Look At Me Now.
Rhymes has a rapid-fire flow. (Supplied by artist)
While his rapid-fire delivery would leave most breathless, Eminem and Twista are considered slightly faster, both having been crowned at different times the fastest rapper in history in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rhymes told All the Smoke that he was prompted to speed rap, after hearing his first example of it when Papa San and Lieutenant Stitchie battled it out in 1986.
In 1993, Rhymes gave it a go himself on the second Leaders of the New School album on a track called Daily Reminder.
Rhymes told Steven Bartlett on The Diary of a CEO podcast that he was lost after the death of his manager and friend Chris Lighty in 2012.
""I never really had to manage my career without a manager, and he wasn't just a manager, he was my brother, so it got scary for a minute,"" Rhymes said.
""I couldn't get it together. That's why I didn't put out no record for nine years.""
Rhymes has also opened up about gaining weight, which led to serious health problems. He told Men's Health his weight gain came from not properly dealing with the loss of his father in 2014.
Rhymes was scared to have surgery for the polyps because, he said, his voice is how he feeds his family.
""I ran from the surgery as long as I could, but … I saw the doctor and he looked at my throat and he said I could die in my sleep,"" Rhymes said.
""That's when I got surgery and started to get back in shape.""
Rhymes lost about 45 kilos, transforming his body and restoring his health.
Rhymes didn't release an album for a period of about nine years. (Supplied by artist)

Rhymes wasn't looking to tolerate audience members who were sitting down and hiding behind their mobile phones at the Essence Festival in July.
He did have a smile on his face, but was crystal clear about what he wanted from the crowd, telling them all to stand.
""Let's get back to interacting like humans,"" he said.

This year, she returned to the show as a judge, following the death of judge Jock Zonfrillo in 2023.
In each episode of You Don't Know Me, Virginia Trioli expertly peels back the public persona of some of our most beloved Australians. What they love, the road not taken and the things they do only when the camera and microphones are off.
Poh was born in Malaysia and came to Australia with her family when she was 9, eventually settling in Adelaide.
She sat down with Virginia Trioli for the You Don't Know Me podcast to answer a few questions that reveal her ambitions as a celebrity chef, and her guilty secret meal.
I am very introverted. I realised that was the case when I went to my first awards night.
I spend a lot of time alone. And it's where I find my joy. All the things that I love doing are solitary activities: gardening, painting, cooking.
Poh is happiest when she's doing things on her own.  (Australian Story: Lincoln Rothall)
It doesn't actually surprise me, because performers are often observers, especially actors, comedians, and journalists. So I think it takes a certain kind of person to be standing back and watching.
Being a Mormon. At one point I was quite religious. I was 16.
I think at the time I was quite unformed as a woman. I don't feel like my self-esteem was fantastic at that point. If the right man had scooped me up at that point, I would have happily been a homemaker, a wife, and traditionally in the Mormon culture you have many children very early.
I think it would have really spoken to me at that period of my life; I would have found my self-esteem in that.
Poh was part of the Mormon faith during her teenage years. (Supplied)
[My family was] going through some really hard financial times and we felt quite ostracised at that point in time, and we were really vulnerable.
[Mormonism] gave us this whole social infrastructure of really kind people to walk into. And it was a very safe space for me as a teenager who was starting to be interested in boys.
In that regard, I don't regret it, but I think there's a reason why it spoke to me then. I think I could have easily gone down that road and none of this would have happened.
I really have trouble answering that question because I'm a real believer in things happening for a reason.
And whether that is true or not, or whether that's just a device I've employed to get through hard times, it has worked so well for me. And I think it's the reason why I have a lot of emotional fortitude.
I was incredibly naive as a young girl because I did grow up in such a closeted environment, because not only did we have the religious element, but we were also culturally very conservative.
My parents wanted the best for me, but that comes with lots of very strict rules.
Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks … and you don’t need to be a scientist to find it!
I feel like everything that goes wrong, if you can walk away learning something from it, it's great for you.
I used to think it could be genetic because my mum seems quite resilient like that. And I used to give myself a lot of credit for it, but I realized maybe it's because I've got a shocking memory and I forget the trauma!
Cancel culture. It really bothers me [and] it keeps me up at night.
I feel like we've become so hedged in by political correctness and using the exact language.
I think it's very justified for many things … but I feel like the notion of intent has just become completely diminished. To cancel someone in retrospect is a really toxic thing, I think.
I do have the hugest belief in forgiveness. And I think that people should be allowed to make mistakes, especially when they're young and silly and if that's clearly not the person that they are now.
Spam and rice.
I don't even fry it. I literally just … squeeze it out of the can. It makes that disgusting slurping noise as it lands on the chopping board and I just dice it up and throw it on some steamed rice and it is delicious. I relish it.
We don't have a culture of cold meats because [Malaysia's] a tropical country I grew up in.
I am a hard worker. I think so many people love to believe in overnight fame or that it's luck.
Look, there is some luck, but I think so much is related to just good old hard yakka.
I'll still finish a solid week at MasterChef and I will go home and bake for my market stall [in Adelaide].

I'll bake for 10 hours on Saturdays and I'll run my market stall on Sundays and then I'm on a plane on Sunday nights back onto set for Monday morning. I love being able to have that feeling of community.
It's my church. My Sunday market is my church. I see my people. I get to do these things with very old-fashioned values.

Last week, the 26-year-old took to social media to again ask her 4 million Instagram followers to respect her boundaries, saying she does not want to be approached when she is ""clocked out"", i.e. not performing or partaking in press.
We can all agree that stalking, non-consensual touching or doxxing of family members is not acceptable. But Roan's comments that she doesn't ""owe a mutual exchange of energy"" to fans have divided people — and, in the case of the ABC Entertainment team, co-workers.
What do artists and celebrities owe fans? I (Jared Richards) think Roan's comments are refreshing as parasocial relationships seem to be intensifying in the 2020s. Velvet Winter argues that it's par for the course of celebrity culture, albeit one that desperately needs to change. In the spirit of Charli xcx and Lorde, we chat it through.
Velvet: Chappell Roan has landed right in the middle of the parasocial relationship discourse, which has ramped up significantly as celebrities share more and more of their lives online.
Now, I could harp on about the psychological roots of parasocial relationships, but the most succinct explanation of parasocial relationships I've come across is from Bo Burnham's 2013 comedy special what.
Fan in audience: I love you!
Bo Burnham: You love me? That's very nice. You love the idea of me. You don't know me but that's OK. That's called a parasocial relationship: It goes one way and is ultimately destructive but please by all means keep buying all my shit forever.
It's not new for fans to be besotted with an artist, but what is new is openly leveraging fans' parasocial relationships to move more stock.
Taylor Swift is the queen of massaging her parasocial relationships with fans until the millions fall out. She shares so much of her life with fans and uses language that directly speaks to the individual, convincing Swifties that if they buy four versions of the same album they're really just supporting their friend Taylor.
But not all artists are as on board with parasocial relationships are they, Jared?
Jared: Maybe even Swift seems a little tired of it. A few lyrics on her latest album The Tortured Poet's Department around ""vipers dressed in empath's clothing"" have been interpreted as responses to fans criticising her dating life.
Velvet: Maybe she should have thought about that before dating Matty Healy … Sorry, go on.
Jared: Careful. You might anger the Swifties and The 1975 fans at once!
Much more direct than Swift is Hottest 100 winner Doja Cat, who has an outright hostile relationship with her stan base known as Kittenz. Last May, she posted that anyone calling themself a Kitten should ""get a job"" and ""delete [their] entire account and rethink everything"".
But it's not just our biggest pop stars who face parasocial relationships.
Back in 2022, co-hosts of Australian pop culture podcast Shameless Zara McDonald and Michelle Andrews told The Guardian they had intentionally started sharing less personal information on the podcast, after they received a few too many hostile DMs. After Andrews shared her own experience of sexual assault, she was so bombarded with confronting messages from fans detailing their own experiences she had to ask them to stop.

One thing that unites Doja, Chappell Roan and the Shameless co-hosts is that they are all, in some part, beloved for being ""real"" in their output. Doja and Chappell are social media natives, both of them gaining fans in part due to their unfiltered, funny online presence, while McDonald and Andrews' podcast is built around their friendship. Naturally, fans feel like they know these people. In some ways, that approachability is what's made them so successful.
But the line seems to be crossed time and time again. Do we just have too much access to everyone now — are these oversteps simply, like approximately 75 per cent of our cultural conundrums, the result of social media? Or is this just the longstanding Faustian bargain for fame, heightened by Instagram?
Velvet: It's true that the advent of social media has made celebrities more accessible simply because we have the technology to more accurately track them. But the public's disregard for their privacy has existed for as long as the concept of celebrity.
Look at 19th-century actor Sarah Bernhardt, who some consider the first modern celebrity. She had people threatening to throw acid on her at performances, men were locked in asylums convinced she loved them, and the press wrote about her every move. She was facing the same lack of privacy 175 years ago that Roan does today.

In a recent documentary, Liz Taylor talks about how the paparazzi, who are merely more unscrupulous proxies for fans, used to break into her home dressed as priests and workmen to try and get a picture of her ""off the clock"".
The Rolling Stones had stalkers, The Beatles had stalkers, Madonna had stalkers.
It might not be right, but lack of privacy has always gone hand in hand with celebrity. It is our culture, the same culture that presents fame and celebrity as something achievable through proximity (remember when Kim Kardashian was Paris Hilton's assistant?).
I hope that fans listen to Roan and cease their problematic behaviour towards her. But if history is anything to go by, the problem is larger than one artist who got too big too quickly.
Jared: It wasn't always quite like this. Lisztomania is commonly cited as one of the first examples of celebrity hysteria, where audiences of Hungarian composer Franz Liszt were whipped into a frenzy at his 1840s concerts. Fans would even steal his used cigar butts or coffee grounds.
But where Lisztomania would rise and fall in cities with Liszt's arrival, on the internet, excitement builds and builds with little release. There is a constant context of new information, whether that be a new interview, paparazzi shot or streaming statistics. And it's easier than ever to find community within this shared energy.

Technology has also bridged whatever distance there once was between audience and artist: If you see Lorde at a cafe, you can text a friend to come down immediately. Or post about it to a stan base. Designer sunglasses and a baseball cap no longer ensure anonymity; we're all basically paparazzi, trading photos and images of artists.
There's also something disposable about how people treat their so-called favourites in public: I'm thinking of a fan throwing a phone at Bebe Rexha because he thought ""it would be funny"". Or, to a less dramatic but still odd extent, of Addison Rae's verse on Charli xcx's Von dutch remix, where she talks about how people ask for selfies, only to post them with captions about how much they hate her.
I'm beginning to see why Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian, for example, tend to live in their own bubbles. Gated communities, round-the-clock security and rarely going out in public becomes necessary: Roan might not yet be that famous, but getting stared at while trying to watch a movie would certainly be weird.
Velvet: Yes, it would be weird to be stared at in the cinemas, but to most of us it would also be weird to perform to 100,000 people. It would be weird to have the influence and cultural capital (plus regular capital) Roan has.

Part of being famous is learning how to manage that fame: whether that be by stepping away from social media or locking themselves away in compounds. But Roan got too famous too fast and this boundary-less desire to be close to the next big thing is a symptom of rapid notoriety. Harry Styles had years in One Direction learning how to manage fame, Roan has had, what, 10 months?
She said in her posts that when she's on stage she's at work and she wants to clock out when she's not. Every job has its downsides (who hasn't been hounded by an overzealous boss out of hours?). I again would like to reiterate that regardless of occupation no one deserves to be threatened, harassed or made to feel unsafe.
Artists take an active part in their own fame, and fame is — famously — fraught. It's great that we've progressed far enough that artists like Roan are free to share their feelings plainly, but it will take a change in the entire culture to halt antisocial behaviour.
Jared: To paraphrase late English philosopher Mark Fisher (to 'well actually' myself, it's Fredric Jameson trimmed down by Fisher. Sorry to be so annoying!), that's exactly the problem: Our current idea of fame makes it ""now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it"". But just as Australia's new-found legal right to disconnect from work and ignore that overzealous boss once seemed impossible, maybe there is a version of fame that isn't so soul-sucking or depersonalising.
Right now, we're in flux with fame: we'll chew up a star, and then 20 years later, a documentary or tell-all memoir about their pain allows us to collectively reappraise them. It's happened to Britney, Janet, Sinéad and Paris Hilton, to name a few recent examples: I don't want people to break in order to be respected down the line.

We also don't just do this to celebrities, either. There are countless stories of ordinary people getting abused, mocked and doxxed after going viral. Remember Alex from Target? This poor boy's family had their social security numbers leaked, all because one girl thought he was cute and took a picture of him without his consent and posted it on Tumblr.
Anyone, even if they don't have a social media account, can go viral and become an object, completely without will. Maybe there's a chill, fun version of this, but like Roan says, it gets creepy quick.
Velvet: Roan also spoke a lot in her comments about how gendered the attacks on her feel, which speaks to how women are treated in a post-#MeToo culture.
She compared the backlash to her requests to ""the idea that if a woman wears a short skirt and gets harassed or catcalled, she shouldn't have worn the short skirt in the first place"".
""It is not the woman's duty to suck it up and take it; it is the harasser's duty to be a decent person, leave her alone, and respect that she can wear whatever she wants and still deserve peace in this world,"" she said.
So chuck in a massive systemic change needed in gender relations in addition to how we pedestal celebrity. This isn't an issue that's going to be solved in a single Instagram post or news article. Roan speaking up has reignited an ongoing conversation that needs to continue if we ever want to reach the utopian version of celebrity culture.
Jared: I just hope Roan doesn't have to suffer for us to get there.",Unknown,Wed 28 Aug,0

It's an ideal we all fall short of.
But when you're a K-pop star, perfection is what's expected.
""Sometimes I do enjoy the pressure because it drives me even more to be better as a performer, as an artist, as a writer [and] musician,"" Blackswan's Fatou says.
""It's difficult, it's hard, but I enjoy it.
Bandmate Sriya agrees.
""Sometimes I also enjoy pressure,"" she says.
""Because for me, there needs to be pressure to become better.""
Fatou, Sriya, Gabi and NVee, who make up Blackswan, were speaking to ABC News ahead of the premiere of the Apple TV+ series K-Pop Idols, which follows the group as they experience internal tensions and grapple with a dramatic shake-up.
The six-part series also features K-pop star Jessi as she embarks on her first solo tour, and the group Cravity as they navigate industry pressures.

And the pressures are immense.
They're expected to be role models.
And yes, perfect — physically and artistically.
It's got to the stage where NVee has come to enjoy burpees, leg raises and push ups, because being in peak physical condition is what gives her the vitality to sustain back-to-back concerts and world tours.
""You have to have a lot of stamina and endurance because a lot of our songs have tough choreography,"" NVee says.
""And it's not just the dance that needs energy.
""It's also the vocals and your rap. Everything that you need to use your voice for.
""That's also a muscle that you have to prepare and use because if you don't prepare your body, it's going to sound very shaky, it's going to be flat.""

With a camera around 24/7, a few dust-ups are documented.
Fatou doesn't shy away from the emotions she felt in the moment.
""I was grateful that the camera was there,"" she says.
""I was so filled up with so many words [and] thoughts that I just had to let it out.""
NVee says allowing audiences in at times when there is infighting shows they're human.
""You're always seeing an idol or an artist through a camera,"" NVee says.
""And so, you think, 'Oh, they don't have problems. They just go on stage. They probably have some small bad days, but I'm sure it's not bad.'
""But you get to see we're human, and so we have emotions too, and sometimes you've just got to let it out. And that's how humans deal with emotions instead of bottling it up.
Fatou is the only original member of the group left. She says at first it was difficult to adjust, but they're now a dream team.
Blackswan now has no Korean members. (Supplied: Apple TV+)
""I've gained these amazing three human beings beside me,"" she says.
""I'm very grateful it changed because if that didn't change we wouldn't have the really, really, really big dream team like right now.""
The change in line-up caused a significant shift in the make-up of the group, which was left with no Korean members.
That's right.
A K-pop group with no Koreans.
""At first, when I heard we were going to be an only-foreigner group, I was like, 'Oh, this hasn't been done yet. So, is it going to work?' Gabi says.
""I had that thought, a little bit questioning.
""But at the end, it worked so well.
""We are treated so well here in Korea.
""We are sharing our culture to Korea, and we are showing Korea to [the] outside [world] too.
""So, it's a good give and receive match that we've got.""
The group is based in South Korea, they all speak the language, and some of their lyrics are also in Korean.
""At the end of the day, we're a K-pop group,"" NVee says.
""So, it is what it is.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-26/jenna-ortega-chappell-roan-macklemore-justin-bieber-miff-awards/104269070,Wednesday's Jenna Ortega says she quit Twitter after seeing explicit AI images of her teen self,"Welcome to ICYMI, where we recount the pop culture and entertainment news from over the weekend that you might have missed.
Let us get you caught up.
Jenna Ortega quit X (formerly known as Twitter) after seeing explicit AI-generated images of her teenage self.
While it might seem that the Wednesday star appeared out of a goth bubble two years ago, the 21-year-old has been acting professionally since she was nine. And while that means there is a wealth of Ortega's work for fans to enjoy, it also exposed her to the worst corners of the internet from a very young age.
""I hate A.I,."" she told The New York Times.
""I mean, here's the thing: A.I. could be used for incredible things. I think I saw something the other day where they were saying that artificial intelligence was able to detect breast cancer four years before it progressed. That's beautiful. Let's keep it to that.
""Did I like being 14 and making a Twitter account because I was supposed to and seeing dirty edited content of me as a child? No. It's terrifying. It's corrupt. It's wrong.""

Ortega said the first Twitter direct message she read, at 12 years old, was ""an unsolicited photo of a man's genitals, and that was just the beginning of what was to come"".
She deleted her Twitter account about three years ago because of the ""absurd images and videos"" flooding her feed.
""It was disgusting, and it made me feel bad. It made me feel uncomfortable,"" Ortega continued.
""That's why I deleted it, because I couldn't say anything without seeing something like that. So one day I just woke up, and I thought, Oh, I don't need this anymore. So I dropped it.""
When asked if she regrets entering the industry at such a young age, she said she and her parents sometimes have ""regrets"", but she wouldn't change anything.
""I'm incredibly grateful for the lessons that it did teach me. I love that when I go on a set now, I'm incredibly knowledgeable,"" she said.
Now, let's all cleanse our eyeballs with Ortega's wonderful homage to Death Becomes Her in pop star Sabrina Carpenter's just-dropped music video.

Canadian director Matthew Rankin has taken out the top prize at the 72nd Melbourne International Film Festival at Saturday's awards ceremony, winning $140,000 for his second feature Universal Language — one of the largest cash prizes for film in the world.

Universal Language is a drama-comedy about the inhabitants of a surreal Winnipeg that resembles 80s Tehran, imagining Canada's dual languages as French and Farsi. Rankin, who plays a version of himself in the film, describes it as an ""autobiographical hallucination"", drawing from the deaths of his parents and his longstanding connection to Iranian culture and cinema.
Universal Language beat out nine other films selected for the Bright Horizons competition for early career filmmakers.
The award was determined by a festival jury led by Australian filmmaker Ivan Sen, who also awarded a special $15,000 Jury Prize to Flow, an animation by Latvian filmmaker Gints Zilbalodis.
The jury also awarded Australian director Jaydon Martin the $70,000 Australian Innovation Award for his debut feature Flathead, a work of docufiction about a man returning to his hometown of Bundaberg.
Wiradjuri Scottish artist April Phillips won the Uncle Jack Charles Award, given to an outstanding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander creative with a film at MIFF. She is the lead artist of kajoo yannaga (come on let's walk together), a digital artwork that is screening at ACMI through to Saturday August 31 as part of Melbourne arts festival Now or Never. The award is valued at $45,000, with $20,000 cash alongside a set of financial services.

Rapper Macklemore has pulled out of an October concert in Dubai in protest over the United Arab Emirates' role in ""the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis"" in Sudan.
The Thrift Shop rapper took to Instagram over the weekend to explain his decision, citing accusations the UAE is supporting a paramilitary force in the country.
""Over the last several months, I've had a number of people reach out to me, sharing resources and asking me to cancel the show in solidarity with the people of Sudan and to boycott doing business in UAE for the role they are playing in the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis in the region,"" Macklemore said.
""It was important for me to learn and really get a grasp on the situation. I never want to make a decision out of fear but a measured one from the heart.""
Since April 2023, Sudan has been in the midst of a civil war between its military and paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces. The UAE has repeatedly denied supporting the Rapid Support Forces, but United Nations experts found ""credible"" evidence the UAE were supplying weapons to the paramilitary.
It's believed more than 18,800 people have been killed in the civil war so far, with more than 10 million having to flee their homes, and hundreds of thousands on the verge of famine.
""At the end of the day I have to ask myself what is my intention as an artist? The last 10 months I've been learning what factors/motivators feed genocide and global systemic oppression,"" Macklemore continued.
The internet reacts to the Thrift Shop rapper's new pro-Palestine rap.
""I keep getting led back to self interest over collective interest at the root. Capitalism is the glue that holds this ideology together. And if I take the money, while knowing it doesn't sit right with my spirit, how am I any different than the politicians I've been actively protesting against?""
Macklemore said his learning had been spurred by ""the plight of Palestinian people"". Earlier this year, he released the  protest song Hind's Hall, calling for a ceasefire.
""That is where it [change]starts. When we realize our individual liberation IS Palestinian liberation. Is Sudanese liberation. Is Congolese liberation. We are being called in this moment to advocate for the most marginalized around the world,"" he concluded.
""I know that this will probably jeopardize my future shows in the area, and I truly hate letting any of my fans down. I was really excited too. But until the UAE stops arming and funding the RSF I will not perform there.""
After a whirlwind 12 months, rising pop star Chappell Roan has had enough.
Over the last few weeks, the pop star has issued a series of statements requesting the public respect her privacy, calling out ""predatory behaviour disguised as 'superfan' behaviour"".
Roan's fame has skyrocketed dramatically since the release of debut album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess in September, following a decade of relative obscurity as a musician. Earlier in August, the 26-year-old drew an estimated crowd of 110,000 for her set at Lollapalooza, among the largest crowds ever for a single act at the more than 30-year-old festival.
On Saturday she spoke to her fans directly, posting a seven-slide statement to her 4 million Instagram followers, asking them to not approach or harass her outside of her ""work hours"" of performing and promoting.
""For the past 10 years I've been going non-stop to build my project and it's come to the point that I need to draw lines and set boundaries,"" she wrote.
""When I'm on stage, when I'm performing, when I'm in drag, when I'm at a work event, when I'm doing press…I am at work. Any other circumstance, I am not in work mode. I am clocked out. I do not agree with the notion that I owe a mutual exchange of energy, time, or attention to people I do not know, do not trust, or who creep me out — just because they're expressing admiration. Women do not owe you a reason why they don't want to be touched or talked to.""
She asked fans to not touch her in public, to stop following her, to ""stop being weird to my family and friends"" and to not call her by her legal name, Kayleigh. Pre-empting criticism, she stated this should not be the flip side of fame.
""I embrace the success of the project, the love I feel, and the gratitude I have. What I do not accept are creepy people, being touched, and being followed,"" she wrote.
""I feel more love than I ever have in my life. I feel the most unsafe I have ever felt in my life.""
Roan has previously spoken about her uneasy relationship to fame, including in a series of TikToks last week where she said, ""It's weird how people think you know a person because you see them online or listen to the art they make.""
In a July interview on The Comment Section podcast, Roan told host Drew Afualo she may step back from her career due to ""creepy"" behaviour, including fans discovering where her parents live and her sister works.

But the couple decided to subvert all expectations, revealing via Instagram that they are now the proud parents of a little boy named Jack Blues Bieber.

She had been to Africa before, about six years ago.
""I just felt drawn to it,"" Kelis said.
""It feels like it's so rich and going through this kind of resurgence of energy and excitement.
""And I just think it's time.
""I wanted to be a part of its growth and of this new era that I believe is coming here.
""It's already starting.""
The star is known for the hit Milkshake and has a catalogue that includes earworm singles such as Bossy, Trick Me, and Caught Out There, as well as the critically acclaimed album Food.

She says her trip to Kenya was only supposed to last a month.
""I brought my whole family, like, literally, my whole family, like my mum, my auntie, my kids, my sister,"" she laughed.
""I was like, 'we're all going' and then, yeah, you know, now it's seven months later, and I'm still here.
""I think that as Black people, we all should be here at some point in our lives, even if it's just to visit, but just to put your feet in the dirt and on the ground.
""This is kind of where everything started. And I love that.

This is an artist with her finger on the pulse.
The UN estimates that by 2050, one in four people will be African, and many from the diaspora are taking the opportunity to journey to the motherland.
Kelis, who is also a farmer, has bought land in Kenya.
""It's just raw land now and it's never been farmed or anything,"" she said.
""We need more farmers that look like us.
""And, yeah, you just gotta do it. You gotta get your hands in the dirt. So that's what I'm doing.""

When she's not in Kenya, she's is in Temecula, California, where she lives with her family on a 26-acre farm.
Kelis Rogers was born and raised in Harlem in New York City to an African American jazz musician, then Pentecostal minister father Kenneth and a Chinese-Puerto Rican fashion designer mother Eveliss.
Her name is a portmanteau of their names.
Kelis grew up in the church.
""I am a woman of faith now, not Christian the way that I grew up, but definitely clear about what I believe,"" she said.
""I'm Hebrew and so for me, how I position myself and how I see myself, and how I understand human beings and creation and where we come from, and all of that stuff is definitely a huge part of my life.
""It's the centre of my life, really.""
The 45-year-old is still celebrating her August 21 birthday, as she was in the lead-up to it.
""I think as a woman, the older we get … I think you get really solid, and you get really clear,"" she said.
""I think no-one ever talks about that either. We talk about looking young and feeling good, which is also really important.
""But I think, the older we get, if you're doing things the right way, I think the goal is to be really settled and really clear and really confident and really comfortable in your own skin.
""And faith and all those things are all a part of that.""
The musician is blending more than just milkshakes these days. She's a Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef, and author of My Life on a Plate: Recipes from Around the World.

She says travelling the world has re-iterated to her that we're all the same.
""We all eat the same food, right?"" she said.
""Especially as Black and brown people around the world. We eat the same food, and we have the same sensibilities, I think.
""By design, we've been so separated that we don't realise how we are all one people and how we have so many similarities, right?
""And we have so many things that connect us.
""And I always say that food and music, they are really the universal language. I used to think it was music first, but it's not. It's food.
""Food is the one solitary thing that connects us the very most.""
Kelis says food and music are part of the universal language. (Supplied)
Fans can rest assured there's new music coming from the artist who has sold millions of albums and been nominated for two Grammys, with her song Midnight Snacks a potential taster for what's to come.
""I do have an album coming out,"" she said.
Kelis's travels will continue when she heads to Australia to deliver the major keynote at BIGSOUND, which has a massive conference and festival schedule planned.
She'll also perform live at Sweet Relief! in an Australian exclusive.
Kelis is ""excited"" to be heading back to Australia. (Supplied)
""To me, Australia has always been such a welcoming and interesting place.
""I've always had such a good time there.
""So, to be able to do something in both mediums of my life is really dope.
""I love that.
""Being able to talk about the things I care about and the things that I love and the lifestyle choices that I've made, I think is really exciting.
""And then obviously being able to perform is always great.""
It's been a while since she was in town. She calculates exactly how long by invoking the ages of her children.
""My middle son was probably about two [when I was last in Australia], and he's eight now,"" she laughs.
""To put that in perspective.""

Like a beating heart directing the flow of punters to venues, their weekly gig guides, entertainment reviews, and news fuelled sub-cultures and kept people in the know.
Adelaide's faltered when Rip It Up closed in 2016 — having gone digital-only in 2014, which followed the closure of dB Magazine in 2014.
Adelaide is in desperate need of a comprehensive gig guide after the loss of street magazines leave a ""significant hole"", insiders say.
For a time B-Sides Magazine, launched in 2015 by former Rip It Up editor the late Robert ""Bertie"" Dunstan, tried to fill the gap, but he too went digital-only before turning his attention to a Facebook page.
Aside from a few minor listings on various websites, public knowledge about gigs was left to word of mouth, community radio, and social media algorithms geared mostly towards antagonism rather than offering useful information.
In late 2022, however, a new street magazine was launched to fill the void, The Note, which is celebrating its milestone 21st edition this month.
Director Oliver Raggatt, who had worked at Rip it Up until it ceased its print edition, returned from Melbourne to Adelaide in 2020 to rejoin his family business, HWR Media.

""I found myself wondering where to go and who to listen to as Adelaide's scene had changed dramatically since I left in 2013,"" he said.
""I missed out on so many good gigs, even though I was following artists and venues on social media.
""After consulting industry, venues, punters, and colleagues, everyone said the one thing Adelaide missed was a good gig guide.""
Mr Raggatt said the live music industry needed ""a vehicle like print media to reach the people who aren't actively seeking it"".
The magazines are distributed to pubs, cafes, and venues across the city where people can pick them up for free.
""That's how you reach a new audience,"" Mr Raggatt said.
""They pick up The Note for Beck or G Flip on the cover, but then they discover local artists like The Empty Threats, Aleksiah, or Ricky Albeck and don't miss any gigs.
""Our goal has always been to get the people who go to one gig a year, to go to one a quarter, or from one a quarter to one a month.""
Working with his family business and a small team, including senior writer Zara Richards, Mr Raggatt said they put in ""the hard yards early to make it possible"".
Robert ""Bertie"" Dunstan, the irrepressible SA music champion, passed away in August 2023.
""He came on board for a regular column [and] we were stoked to have someone of his knowledge involved.
""It's just been a year since he passed. It's important to keep his memory alive for his important services to the industry.""
Mr Raggatt said venues and artists had been ""incredibly helpful"" in contributing to the magazine's gig guide, which he admitted was not ""an easy job"".

""Many venues are owner-operated so occasionally deadlines are missed, which is to be expected when you wear so many hats,"" he said.
The magazine last year held a small festival named Notestock for its first birthday, which featured a number of local and national bands.
It also has a presence at music festivals like Harvest Rock, although that festival recently joined so many others across the country that have cancelled their annual events by announcing it would be postponed this year.

""The SA music industry is an ecosystem that we aim to help when and where we can, but the ecosystem is in danger for various reasons — cost of living, rising insurances, changing behaviours, fragmentation of media, higher taxes on alcohol, etcetera etcetera.
""The challenges change all the time in this constantly evolving world. The past five years have shown nobody has a crystal ball.""
He said celebrating the magazine's 21st edition was ""a bit of fun"".
""The team put our heart and soul into this, so it is cool to see,"" Mr Raggatt said.
""We have a few fun things planned to keep your eye out for, but the joy of working in such a small team allows us to be nimble and change with the market.""

Publisher of the media and marketing newsletter Unmade Tim Burrowes cited fresh research from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) that showed a definitive shift.

""We hit an inflexion point in recent months where, for the first time, the number of hours of content being consumed, and this is screen content, was more via streaming than it was via broadcast television over our aerials,"" Mr Burrowes told ABC News.
""I think obviously the attraction of streaming is the level of choice, of being able to choose what you want to watch when you want to watch it.""
It seems counterintuitive, with the shift to streaming coming at a time when many Australians are dealing with cost-of-living pressures.
During her Logies Hall of Fame acceptance speech, Gibney said she looks forward to “many, many more women” joining her in the honour in the future.
But Mr Burrowes said there was a clear parallel with viewers' waning tolerance for advertising.
""Although, of course, we do now — perhaps this is because of the kind of rise of the challenges of cost of living — … have advertising tiers with a lot of the paid streamers as well, where people can make that saving if they're willing to tolerate a few ads.""
The ACMA research shows:
Here is the complete list of Logies winners, updated as they were announced.
Even host of The Morning Show and The Chase, Larry Emdur, conceded anecdotally that younger people were not watching free-to-air TV.
He used his adult children as an example in a funny and self-deprecating speech after winning the coveted Gold Logie for the Most Popular Personality on Australian Television and the Bert Newton Award for Most Popular Presenter.
Mr Burrowes said there would come a time when the transmitters were switched off.
""One of the patterns we see is that watching traditional TV is skewing older and older,"" Mr Burrowes said.
""So, it would seem quite unlikely that, say, somebody moves into a new home, particularly if they're younger, they probably will never bother to connect their TV to the aerial.
""Now, that doesn't mean that they ignore free-to-air television altogether because, of course, it can be live streamed now as well.
""And also, there's that sort of on-demand component. All the free-to-air networks have their players as well.
""But the way that people are absorbing their television is absolutely changing.

The television business is all about competition, and Mr Burrowes said streaming services were now landing more prestige programming.
""One of the key things is that a lot of the streaming players have now got budgets to make or acquire shows that otherwise would previously have ended up with the terrestrial broadcasters, whether free-to-air or with Foxtel,"" Mr Burrowes said.
One of those shows is Boy Swallows Universe, an adaptation of Trent Dalton's bestselling semi-autobiographical novel of the same name.
It won five awards at the ceremony.
The show is a coming-of-age story set in 1980s Brisbane. Felix Cameron plays Eli Bell who, as the synopsis states, is just trying to follow his heart and understand what it means to become a good man as he deals with a lost father, a mute brother, a recovering addict mum, a heroin dealer for a stepfather, and a notorious criminal for a babysitter.
In his acceptance speech at the ceremony on Sunday, Cameron succumbed to tears in an emotional speech in which he thanked his drama teacher.
Boy Swallows Universe hit the Netflix Weekly Top 10 in 52 countries, including the number one spot in Australia, the fourth spot in the UK and sixth spot in the United States.
As long as Australians continue to be obsessed with reality TV, sport, and are keen to find out what's happening in news and current affairs, there will still be a place for free-to-air TV, especially given its content quotas.
Here are some of the bold and bright looks we saw on the red carpet for the 2024 Logies.
""There still is a sort of local content quota which covers things like news, drama, everything else and [ACMA] finds for the most part, they all do achieve that quota,"" Mr Burrowes said.
""But that's not necessarily for altruistic reasons. It's because local content is still what tends to rate.
""The most reliable content actually is sport and news because that's sort of habit forming as well.
""But also, locally made content that still speaks to the audience, there is still an appetite for it.""
Emdur, described by colleagues as being the same affable man behind the scenes as what you see on screen, perhaps made another telling comment in his acceptance speech.
In his acceptance speech, Gold Logie winner Larry Emdur said while the ABC's Tony Armstrong was ""Australia's boyfriend"", he was ""Australia's dirty, old grandpa"". Here are some of the other key moments from the 64th Logie Awards.
""To my late dad, who on my very first day going to the Channel Seven newsroom as a cub reporter, I said, 'Dad, what do I do in there for my job?'"" Emdur recounted.
""And he goes, 'Mate, just be nice to everyone, just be nice to everyone.'
""And that was 40 years ago, and I remember it to this very day.
""But I came home after a couple of weeks and Dad said, 'How did it go?' and I said, 'Dad, I'm trying but there are so many a***holes in this business.'""",MBy Mawunyo Gbogbo,Mon 19 Aug,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-17/samantha-jade-releases-love-sick-vol-2-album/104237822,"Samantha Jade opens up about love, anxiety, her Indian heritage and portraying Kylie Minogue","When Samantha Jade found her love match in husband Pat Handlin, it was a symphonic union made in music heaven.
""With Pat and I, one of the things we really connected on was music because he loves music as well,"" Jade told ABC News.
""But he, actually, is in a different side of music. He is an A&R [artists and repertoire representative].
""So, obviously that role means that you go to someone like Pat, and you say to him, 'I want to make a record like this,' and then he puts you in the right rooms with the right writers.
""And he has great ears so he can hear what the mix needs.""
Jade says music is a big part of their love story, and the two sit for hours listening to songs.
""We listen to old-school music. We listen to different genres.
""When we watched the Elvis movie, we got obsessed with that soundtrack.
""Then we went down a rabbit hole of watching literally every live performance of Elvis's that he'd ever done.
""So, I feel like that part of our love is really great that we can really connect on that level.""
When asked about her father-in-law, former Sony Music Australia boss Denis Handlin, Jade quickly shut down that line of questioning.
The singer/songwriter is promoting her new EP Love.Sick Vol 2, which is the type of satisfying treat made for those of us with a sweet tooth for sugary pop.
But don't be fooled by the candied package. While tracks like On and On are boppy fun, the tastefully moody song New Me is lyrically exquisite.
If it wasn't for one cringe-worthy line in Set Fire about a tired guy running through her mind, the EP's scales would tip in favour of nature's candy, like you get on Peachy.

""Singing is my favourite thing to do, but I love to write,' Jade says.
""And I feel like writing is a very interesting part of the job because you can really explore different things … you can take on a role. You can be someone else, and it's fun.""
Jade has had a journey of ups and downs.
""I started when I was really young and I started really, really high,"" Jade says.
""When I went to LA, I was so young, I was like 16 and I literally started by being signed to Jive Records. That was my first record deal.
""And they had Britney [Spears] and Justin [Timberlake] and P!nk and NSYNC, you know, all the people. And I was like, 'Oh my God, this is huge. I'm from Lockridge in Perth.'
Even when she's been on a roll, it's been a rollercoaster.
""Even on [The] X Factor, I was in the bottom two, three times.""
She went on to win the competition.
""I really am a believer in 'things are written' and things are as they're going to be, and you just have to ride the waves and you just have to try if you can,"" she said.
""And not that I don't have my bad days. I do. I have days all the time where I'm like, 'I should just quit. No-one cares.'
""But I do try very hard to live by the kind of idea of, you know, you go through stuff. If there's something you can take from it, that must be what that was for.""
There are some things, though, that are just unfair and unfathomable.
Jade says Dancing with the Stars was ""the best"" experience. (Supplied)
Jade was this week the runner-up in Dancing with the Stars and the one thing she would have loved to do was call her mother, who died of cancer in 2014.
""Of course, you learn to go on with life. You have to, there's no choice,"" she said.
""But there's just moments, even being on Dancing with the Stars, there's been that moment of being like my mum would have just loved this.
""And how great would it have been to hear from her after the shows and have her come and see it, you know?
""We were so close. I mean, she's my mum. She's the person that brought you into the world.
Jade's mother was born in Scotland. Her father has Indian heritage.
""My culture is very important to me,"" she said.
""I grew up with more of my Indian family because my Scottish family mostly is still in Scotland.
""My mum actually grew up in Africa, so she went from Scotland to Africa, then to Australia.
She grew up singing Bollywood songs around the house.
""My aunties, oh, my God. When I'd go get babysat by my nana, that's all we were watching, Bollywood films, and then sometimes The Bill.""
It's been 10 years since Jade starred as Kylie Minogue in Never Tear Us Apart: The Untold Story of INXS.
She said the experience was ""beyond nerve-wracking"".
""I was like, 'Wait, I'm going to play Kylie? And she might watch it? Like what?' That freaked me out.
Jade starred as Kylie Minogue in Never Tear Us Apart: The Untold Story of INXS. (Supplied)
And according to Minogue, she rose to the occasion.
""She said it was good, thank God,"" Jade said.
""Because I was like, 'Oh my God, if she says, 'Yeah, it didn't feel like it was like me at all,' I'd be like, 'Oh, my God, I can't sleep.'
""She was really sweet about it. She was like, 'I thought you did a great job. I was so happy that you played the role.' So, I was very grateful for that feedback.""
While playing Minogue may have caused Jade some anxiety, it is not something she has not dealt with before.
She is a vocal advocate for prioritising mental health, having suffered crippling anxiety.
""To be honest, when it first happened, I didn't speak about it,"" she said.
""Like you keep it kind of happy. I'm a singer, my music's pop and it's up[beat], and then I was like, 'hang on'.
""The only thing that made me feel better during that time was knowing that pretty much everyone has dealt with it.
""There are so many people you talk to. And I was like, I need to share that I'm going through this.
""If it can help one or two people, then that's good enough for me.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-14/tony-armstrong-gold-logie-interview-chit-chat/104218672,"As a kid, Tony Armstrong wasn't allowed to watch TV. Now he's up for the Gold Logie","Tony Armstrong knows what it's like to stare down the barrel of a big career change.
The ABC News Breakfast presenter was barely out of high school when he was drafted into the AFL. After 35 games for the Adelaide Crows, Sydney Swans, and the Collingwood Magpies over six years, Armstrong was — in his own words — ""sacked because [he] wasn't good enough"".
So, he pivoted. In 2020, he began hosting footy show Yokayi Footy for NITV, and producing and presenting sports content for ABC Radio. The next year he filled in on ABC News Breakfast, and was eventually appointed as the go-to sports presenter.
With his infectious charm on full-watt display for the entire country every morning, the Logie awards started rolling in.
First he took out most popular new talent in 2022, then the Silver Logie for most popular presenter in 2023.
In 2024, after hosting five-part ABC TV series Tony Armstrong's Extra-Ordinary Things, the 34-year-old's up for the big one, the Gold Logie (as well as most popular presenter again).
If he takes out the top gong, he'll be the first Indigenous Australian to ever win it. (Ray Martin, a five-time Gold Logie winner, has Kamilaroi ancestry but does not identify as Aboriginal.)
We caught up with Tony to have a little chit chat about changing careers, watching television and why his younger self would think he's a nerd.
In the back of the house, I'm assuming, I haven't looked [laughs]. I've got a nice little office out the back and that's where they are. It's a nice little spot.
My pool room is an office and it's conveniently always visible for everyone, so they're always reminded.
I've been asked that a bit and I think I was a bit flippant about it when I first got nominated.
The more I think about it, the less it seems about me. It would be so great to see brown kids and brown adults all over the country see themselves recognised at that level.
It would be very cool because these awards aren't really for us. That's how I feel.
It changes all the time and it really relies on recency bias. I think the story that went with [11-year-old Western Australian rapper] Inkabee. The whole story with his father was just incredible. I think that was super, super special.

Not getting to watch it!
Yeah, I didn't really watch it much as a kid!
I remember, it's quite funny, we didn't have much but I never felt deficit with anything else. The one thing I did feel like I didn't have was telly. We had a telly at home but my mum was restrictive, in a good way. She just wanted me to be clever.
I had allocated TV time but I wasn't allowed to watch The Simpsons. Don't worry, I've caught up, but it's like a cultural thing. You come into school, kids would be talking about it, and I hadn't seen it. It was the only time I ever felt like I had less than.
Far out… like, The Bill (laughs), Keeping Up Appearances.
I think if I was to sit down and watch Keeping Up Appearances now, I would howl with laughter. As a kid, you haven't fully formed the idea of a social construct and pride and status, but as you get older you're like, 'Oh my God, I get it.'
Hyacinth Bucket's best one-liners on Keeping Up Appearances
Oh now, that was one of those things where I probably felt like I had surplus compared to other kids.
I've read so much. I used to read Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl, The Twits and BFG. Secret Seven, Famous Five … all those types of classics.
Well, normally I'm just shitty that I'm awake, so I'm like, ""Get me a strong latte"" [laughs].
I'm just trying to be really mindful of what I eat but that tends to mainly happen when Rona's [Rona Glynn-McDonald, musician and Armstrong's partner] around. Maybe like, no bread, some fried eggs and avocado. But as soon as she's gone I'm like, ""Yeah, get me some vegemite on toast, what's up?""
Commit. You can't half do it.
The way society is set up, we're so concerned with keeping up appearances and so averse to taking chances on things that might fail. We will cut off our nose to spite our face.
When most people are making a career change, we're doing it aspirationally. Like, ""I'm dreaming bigger, I'm thinking more, there's more to me than what I am now."" That then means you're going to be doing something that you're not sure you can actually do.
So, you have to commit because, if you don't, there's no way it's going to work and you're just going to be doing yourself a disservice.
Get used to it [laughs].
It's never not going to be a possibility and not everything can be for everyone. Then there's timing, there's ability, there's luck; there's all these things that have an impact. Sometimes you're just not going to be good enough to do what you want to do and that's OK.
That's where I got to in footy. I wasn't good enough. I know that sounds weird for someone who played, but what I wanted to do was not what I did.
I think that is a high achiever thing, where you're always seeing where you could do better or do more. So, you've got to be gentle to yourself.
Yeah, but also I think ability and self-worth should be very different buckets, right? Like, how good I am at presenting shouldn't be the only thing that I hold self-worth in.
That's why it was so hard for me when I finished footy, because I was conflating my identity and my ability. My perception of myself and my perception of the way other people viewed me was all one concentric circle around that job I had.
Nowadays, I like to think that how good I am at my job has got nothing to do with whether or not I'm an honest person, it's got nothing to do with how much love I've got.
If you're thinking, ""Is this it?"" or feeling melancholy about your job, that's probably a sign that you're leaning too far into self-worth from external stuff.
Aww, I didn't expect that! There'd probably be some footy jumpers, some records, maybe a telly? I spoke about having a deficit before; now I can sit down and watch TV for hours.
Can I put friendships in there? I've been lucky to have lived in a lot of places and made very good friends, so if I could find a way to put my friendships with them in there it would be that.
Watch: Tony's top 5 most precious possessions
The Grudge. I went to boarding school and we all watched The Grudge together. These bedrooms were not separate rooms: It was like a big office building with partitions that didn't go all the way up. It was an old 1950s, 1940s building, so you can imagine the sounds it made.
When you went to the toilet at night there was just a fluorescent light that went kinda like, ""flick, flick"". I don't think I went to the toilet overnight for three months.
The Grudge trailer
That I work in the news? What a nerd.
No. Not at all. Sometimes people will call me a journalist and I have to be like, ""No, not a journo, not at all.""
I'm really lucky. I know that the way I came in is really freakish. The timing was right, I was the right person, so many other forces were at play. It's been a dream run really. But no training. None. So all of it is instinctual, I guess, rather than process.
I'd like to try acting. I'd love to do something like that.
Yeah, it's been a merry-go-round of tiny little roles that have come where people will like, ""We just want you as you."" And I'm like ""f**k off!"" [laughs]. I'll just have to be really particular about the first acting thing.
It was this classic New York comedian at the Comedy Cellar. He goes: ""So I saw this Michael Phelps dude the other day, eight miles an hour! He's the best we got! You know a tuna can do 40 miles an hour! This isn't the tuna, this is just a tuna!""
I was pissing myself! It's just so irreverent. You do have to be clever to be that dumb.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-12/raygun-slammed-as-audacious-as-others-come-to-her-defence/104215942,How did Raygun qualify for the Olympics? Is she really the best Australia has to offer?,"The 2024 Paris Olympics marked breaking's debut as a sport at the global event, with 36-year-old lecturer and breaker Rachael ""Raygun"" Gunn representing Australia for the first time.
Having failed to win a single point in any of her Olympic bouts, Raygun quickly became a viral sensation.
The question on many people's minds now is: How did she even qualify?
Lucas Marie is a breaker who has competed, performed, taught and judged breaking competitions over the past 25 years. He's also an anthropologist who recently co-authored an article with Gunn.
He says the answer to that question is simple.
Lucas Marie recently co-authored an article with Raygun. (Supplied)
""There was an Oceania qualifier in which any B-boy or B-girl from Australia [or] New Zealand could enter, and that was in Sydney in October 2023,"" he told ABC News.
""And leading up to that, there were a lot of other events in which breakers were competing.
""She won those battles fair and square and won the qualification in Sydney.
""And it wasn't really a surprise to anyone.
""She's been fairly consistent, winning or coming second or third at a lot of breaking events in Australia for the last five to 10 years.""
Marie said there was nothing out of the ordinary about Raygun's performance.
Why Raygun is breaking our brains.
""It's not like gymnastics where there's this kind of agreed-upon standard,"" he said.
""It's always had a rawness to it. It's always had an improvisational kind of quality. And I think looking different and trying different stuff has always been celebrated.
He described her efforts as bold.
""I thought — and this is how I judge a lot of breaking events — I thought, 'Oh, she's making some really interesting choices to mimic Australian animals.' And you can kind of see the choices that she's making in the moment.""
Team Australia chef de mission Anna Meares insisted after Raygun's performance that she was the best breaker the country had to offer. But is this true?

""It's sometimes just who's performing better on the day,"" Marie said.
""And at the qualification event in which she won, and other events in which she's won, she performed better on that day and won the ticket.
""That doesn't mean she's the best. It doesn't really work like that.
""I think she's a great breaker. She won the qualification. She's won other events in the past, and she was a good representative for Australia at that competition.""
Asked whether there were B-girls in Perth, regional Victoria or rural Brisbane who might have qualified but could not afford to travel to Sydney for the tryouts, Marie agreed this was possible.
""Of course, there's breakers all over the country that maybe should have been in that event, but they weren't.""
Australia's first breaker, Raygun, bows out of the Paris Olympics with a performance she described as ""different and creative"".
Breaking will not carry over to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, a decision made before Raygun's battle.
Marie described this as sad.
""Maybe, based on the ratings, they'll reassess that and maybe allocate some medals to breaking,"" he said.
""I really hope that's the case, and I hope that for other breakers who want to compete in it as a dance sport.""
Marie said that at the end of the day people should remember they were dealing with a human.
""As a friend of Rachael's, there's a human being who's getting a lot of negative attention,"" he said.
""I think people kind of miss that sometimes and forget the human aspect of all this.""
Malik Dixon is an African American who has been living in Australia for more than a decade and is a Sydney University graduate.
He said Raygun made a total ""mockery"" out of breaking at the Olympics.
Malik Dixon says too many people feel entitled to African American culture. (Supplied)
""She was dressed like a member of the cricket team or an Australian PE teacher, and from that point it just seemed like satire,"" Mr Dixon told ABC News.
""It just looked like somebody who was toying with the culture and didn't know how culturally significant it was being the first time in the Olympics and just how important it was to people who really cherish hip hop and one of the elements of hip hop, which is breakdancing.
""It made me think, was Borat her breakdancing coach?""
Mr Dixon said too many people felt entitled to African American culture.
""The African American space has been one where we've shared our community so much and without any restraints, any barriers, roadblocks, obstacles, any gatekeepers, that essentially what should have been African American cultural capital is just shared, which is cool,"" he said.
""We like to share, right?
""We shared 400 years of free labour.
""To see Rachael in her attempt to be a part of the culture just be grossly underwhelming made it seem like she didn't take it seriously.""
Watch Raygun perform at the Olympic qualifiers.
Mr Dixon criticised the body that qualified Raygun, saying she devalued breaking with her performance.
""Whatever governing body nominated her as Australia's entrant into the Olympics either did not understand the assignment or didn't really believe in the integrity or significance of breakdancing, because if they did they would just say, rather than disrespect the culture, we're just not ready to send an applicant this year.""
He said Raygun was extremely audacious and not self-aware.
""You've got to know your role, know your position, know your limitation,"" he said.
""And I think that part of privilege is saying that there are no limits to what I can do.
""Part of privilege is having the authority to say that there are no limits and there are no requirements, there are no prerequisites to what I can do.""
Australia's Raygun may have scored zero points in the breakdancing event, but the lead judge says her performance is exactly what the competition at the Olympics was all about.
Raygun's degrees do not hold much water with Mr Dixon.
""Due to consumerism, this Foundational Black American product, which is hip hop, is global,"" he said.
""And even people who have no connection to any African Americans or any local or regional things that come out in these songs, they have become a part of the whole experience now.
""If I came in and said that I was an authority on Greek music and I was going against the grain of what the mainstream Greek musicians thought, or the school of thought, and I've said that I was the authority, people would check me on that.
""If I had a PhD in sprinting, does that qualify me to go against Noah Lyles? No, it doesn't.""

Not only was Paris 2024 Australia's most golden games ever, it was a pop culture bonanza featuring muffins, musical moments and so many memes.
Let's get you caught up!
You could be forgiven for thinking the Paris closing ceremony was a mini Coachella, as Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig jumped up to sing with Phoenix, and Snoop Dogg brought out Dr Dre for a sneaky collab.
Los Angeles 2028 took every opportunity to signal that the next Olympics are in the United States with LA native Billie Eilish looking very red, white and blue dressed in the official Team USA polo. A damn sight better than her brother/creative partner, Finneas, who came dressed as someone who has a college interview at 3pm, but a hacky sack competition at 5.

Eilish softly sailed through her most recent single Birds Of A Feather for the closing ceremony. Did it sound lovely? Of course! Was she lip syncing? The internet certainly thought so.
Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen might have gone to Paris to strike gold, but he's come back with a different kind of prize — international virality.
The 27-year-old already had a sizeable TikTok following before the Games started, but it was a simple food review of the Olympic Village chocolate muffins (""11/10 insane"") that led to Christiansen being christened ""The Muffin Man"".
Soon his feed was full of TikToks about these illustrious treats, with other athletes (including Aussies) racing to the food hall to get their fix. Granted they do look fantastic: somewhere in between a chocolate mud cake and a brownie, injected with some kind of hot cocoa goo.
If you're craving your own Olympic muffin experience, Tiktokker @jordan_the_stallion did the hard yards to track down the recipe.
Bone app the teeth!
Some were perplexed to hear rapper Snoop Dogg would be one of the torch bearers, despite there being no doubt that he has ample experience lighting one up.
But Snoop's delightful appearance on the torch route was just the tip of the feel-good vibes the 52-year-old brought to the Paris Games.
There was joyful dancing with Simone Biles at the gymnastics, stopping by the tennis with sporting legend Billie Jean King, and his appropriately attired visit to the equestrian events with long-time friend Martha Stuart (Martha and Snoop travel spin off show when???) where he danced with some horses.
To top it all off, his Olympic pin, which features Snoop blowing smoke rings in the Olympic colours, has become one of the hottest collectables at the games.
As much as we share in the euphoria of athletes' successes, so do we share in their heartbreaking near misses. Like poor French pole vaulter Anthony Ammirati.
The 21-year-old was fighting for his life to get through the heats while attempting to clear a 5.7-metre bar. On his third attempt he managed to swing his full body across the bar but got caught on his… ummm, his uhhhh…
Just watch the video.
Ammirati wound up finishing 12th in Group A with a height of 5.60, but will forever be remembered by Olympics fans everywhere.
In high competition, things can get heated. Last week's women's beach volleyball gold medal play-off was proof of that.
A heated verbal conversation between the Canadian and Brazilian finalists started ramping up, so the Olympic DJ tempered the situation by spinning John Lennon's Imagine. Next thing you know, the crowd is singing along.
We'd love to show this beautiful display of Lennon-led reconciliation, but the Olympics has done what they do best and scrubbed the internet of any clips.
So here's a picture of the spat and a hyperlink to John Lennon's Imagine so you can put it together yourself.

Australia consistently over performs in the Olympic swimming, which makes sense as we're surrounded by water and most of us live less than two hours away from the beach.
Or as our national anthem puts it we're ""girt by sea"".
But when US film exec Franklin Leonard took to X to express his confusion over our in-pool dominance, Aus Twitter was quick to inform him that the answer is literally enshrined in our national anthem.",Velvet Winter,Mon 12 Aug,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-11/jimbo-australia-circus-tour-interview/104194770,Canada's adults-only clown is in Australia. We promise you've never seen a show like this,"In a cackle of drag queens, Jimbo stands out.
First introduced on reality show Canada's Drag Race in 2020, Jimbo immediately became a fan favourite for her off-kilter collision of clowning and drag, resulting in wonderfully wacky, hyper-feminine and divisive characters.
Wowing the world, Jimbo (James Isnell) has since returned twice to the gladiator ring of RuPaul's Drag Race, representing Canada on UK vs the World before last year winning All Stars season eight.
Highlights include throwing baloney at RuPaul while dressed in latex as a pregnant ghost named Casper, her equally filthy impressions of Joan Rivers and Shirley Temple, and outfits that can only be described as physics-defying.
Now in Australia touring her Drag Circus — an adults-only ""variety-adventure"" that incorporates Casper, Shirley, Joan and more — Jimbo sat down with ABC Entertainment to talk about her tour, TikTok habits and the only person odder than her: Nicolas Cage.
What was the last thing that made you laugh online?
It was probably this clip of JoJo Siwa's newest dance that she did, where someone turned down the music and added a lot of stomping, breathing and clapping to make it even more ridiculous.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
What do you make of JoJo's movements? To me, it feels like she's kind of approaching a new art form.
Oh my God. You know, I love seeing people out there doing their thing. I think she is just trying really hard.
You can sense when an artist or a performer is coming from an authentic place and point of view. [With JoJo] it all feels a bit staged, it doesn't necessarily feel 100 per cent authentic.
But also, I'm a little obsessed with child stars and people that were raised in stardom. They always end up a bit weird or different because of their circumstance.
She's a product of her whole life being a performer. At the same time, I feel kind of bad for her. I also think she's awesome for being herself and being out there. It's a weird one, like a car crash.
What was the last photo you took with your phone, and can we see it?

This is us [Jimbo and husband Brady Taylor] last night up at the Sydney Eye Tower overlooking Sydney — and before that, this is all of our luggage to come on tour. Twenty-five bags.

Wow. When you're travelling with that much stuff, surely something goes missing occasionally?
Luckily, it hasn't. We only have one of everything, and everything is important because we had to pare down the show to that. Twenty-five bags is just the essentials. We can't lose anything.
It's pretty crazy. If that happens, you're kind of screwed. But luckily, I'm a clown. I can deal with anything, and I'd make it work, if I had to.
I did a show recently over at Fire Island, and halfway through all my make-up just melted off. It was so incredibly hot — it was the hottest I've ever been performing. And I just said, ""Well, that concludes the make-up portion of the evening."" You know, the show has to go on.
At that point, do you wipe it all off, or do you keep it in its weird, melted form?
I just kept it on. The show was rapid-fire. And I hadn't really done a show like that without support acts. They said we just want you for 45 minutes, and there was no-one else to take over.
I had to just go from one act to the next to the next, and slowly the make-up just degraded, but that became part of it.
The people love seeing realness, especially in a performance. Anything that feels for you, specific to that performance in that night, makes it even more magical. They love that I perform through that, that I'm not like ""Stop the show! I don't look proper!""
At the end of the day, I just want to perform and make people laugh. That's what people want as well, so looking funny is part of it.
What was the last screenshot that you took?
This hot dog dress! Because I liked it. I'd like to show up as a hot dog sometime.
Jimbo's phone battery stresses us out. (Supplied)
What's the last Wikipedia rabbit hole you went down?
It was … [looks through phone] ""LGBT culture in Sydney"".
Did you learn anything?
I don't even remember reading it! [Laughs]
Was there a horror movie that you watched too young that scarred you forever?
I loved horror movies when I was really young, so I don't think anything scarred me. I'm more scarred by boredom than fear.
I had a little black-and-white TV in my room, and I would stay up late and watch Nightmare on Elm Street, Elvira, Jason. Whenever we watch movies, I tend to want to watch scary movies.
What horror have you seen recently?
We just saw Longlegs. It was really funny, I loved it.
Nicolas Cage makes these really bizarre, funny acting choices. Everyone in the theatre was laughing — I don't know if that was what they were hoping for or what they were expecting, but it's made people quote it on TikTok.
In your own words, what is this tour?
I've been told it's the best drag show people have ever seen!
I come from a theatre and production designer background — I used to make the sets and costumes for all the shows that I produced. I took the background that I have in visual presentation and production design, and I turned it onto my own storytelling.
Jimbo as Casper (right) with her right-hand clown Jeepers, and a dancing piece of baloney (left). (Mike Kim)
The element of the circus I love is you really never know what you're gonna get. It's a variety adventure where you [only] know that you're gonna be entertained. It's a theatre show that incorporates drag. You can expect a lot of comedy, I do a lot of improv and stand-up.
People really gravitate towards my [Snatch Game characters] Joan Rivers and Shirley Temple, where you have something that's familiar, but then you add a twist.
Like, Shirley Temple goes from being a tap star to a rap star. And so I have this hip-hop number where my dollies come to life — it's really surreal.
Shirley Temple is all grown up. (Mike Kim)
It's Monty Python and Pee-wee's Playhouse on acid. It's [about making] people laugh and go, ""What the f*** did I just watch??""

Here's why people hate the Colleen Hoover novel so much,"It Ends With Us looks like your average pulpy love-triangle romance novel, if you go by its pastel-pink, flower-filled cover and the genre it purports to belong to.
If you need help immediately call emergency services on triple-0
Even the blurb of Colleen Hoover's 2016 New York Times bestseller promises a ""captivating romance with a cast of all-too-human characters"".
CONTENT WARNING: This story contains mentions of rape and descriptions of domestic violence.
While romance does feature in It Ends With Us, it's actually an incredibly graphic story about the intergenerational effects of intimate partner violence.
Its myriad difficult storylines also touch on issues including alcohol abuse, mental illness, rape, suicide, self-harm and graphic violence.
Despite its dark subject matter, It Ends With Us was the most-sold book of 2023 in the US, according to Publishers Weekly, and has over 1 billion hashtags on TikTok.
Now it's been adapted into a Hollywood blockbuster starring Blake Lively (of Gossip Girl and plantation wedding fame) and Justin Baldoni (who also directed the film, of Jane The Virgin fame).
So why does It Ends With Us and its author get so much hate online?
Dubbed ""CoHo"" by the internet, the 44-year-old writer from Texas started off as a self-published author, which is why she's often accused of being a Wattpad darling (derogatory).
But in the 12 years since she self-published her first novel as an ebook, CoHo has enjoyed unprecedented mainstream success. As of October 2022, she had sold more than 20 million books.
CoHo has also been dubbed ""the queen"" of BookTok, which played a big part in the renewed popularity of her books, some of which have been out for the better part of a decade.
Her novels are plot-heavy, lightly smutty and easily digestible. Her female leads often undergo some sort of defining trauma and their love interests are always named something like Tate, Layken or Ridge (those are real examples).
All this is to say, CoHo is the Taylor Swift of darker romance novels.

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.
It Ends With Us was based on the relationship between Hoover's mother and father.
""I don't have a lot of recollections of what they went through, but I knew that he was abusive, and I never understood how it happened because she was such a strong and independent person,"" she said of her motivations in 2021.
The novel begins after the unfortunately named protagonist Lily Blossom Bloom, a steampunk (???) florist, has delivered a disastrous eulogy at her abusive father's funeral. In the aftermath, the 23-year-old takes a breather on a Boston rooftop.
It's there that she runs into the fancifully named neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, who is angrily attempting to destroy a chair after a bad day. Despite this, Lily is instantly attracted to the 29-year-old.
A few months later, they become intensely involved with each other. At the same time, Lily re-reads teen diary entries bizarrely styled as letters to Ellen DeGeneres, when her father's abuse of her mother was at its worst and 15-year-old Lily met her first love, 18-year-old Atlas Corrigan.
It's after an incident with a burnt casserole that Ryle attacks Lily for the first time by aggressively pushing her. He frantically apologises, promising to never hurt her again. When Ryle's sister Allysa asks about Lily's injuries the next day (at a restaurant Atlas happens to own), Ryle lies about the attack.

Atlas, a fellow victim-survivor, doesn't believe her excuses and leaves his phone number for her in case she ever needs help. When Ryle finds out, the physical abuse continues and he attempts to justify his actions by revealing a traumatic tragedy from his childhood.
One night, Lily returns home to find Ryle enraged over her teen relationship with Atlas and he attempts to rape her before physically assaulting her.
Lily leaves Ryle with Atlas's assistance, only to discover she is pregnant with Ryle's baby. The story ends with Lily co-parenting with her abuser, who she has now divorced. Ryle experiences no legal ramifications for his abuse.
Despite its heavy subject matter and the fact It Ends With Us was marketed as a romance, the book doesn't carry any content warnings.
And its graphic content blindsided many readers.
It certainly didn't help things when, in January 2023, the author announced her plan to release a colouring book based on It Ends With Us. The internet … did not take it well.
Following widespread complaints that the planned project trivialised the novel's serious subject matter, CoHo cancelled it.
She wrote on her Instagram story at the time: ""The colouring book was developed with Lily's strength in mind, but I can absolutely see how this was tone-deaf.""
Respect Victoria's director of communications and community change, Jacquie O'Brien, says: ""Whilst you can market a book or movie like this as a romance, you absolutely, by virtue of the fact that you are making money off this, have a responsibility to do this safely.""
""Content warnings are really important because there are people who are on a whole range of journeys,"" she says.
""Intimate partner violence … [these] are really serious situations with a lot of trauma attached to them, and you don't want to do harm by not at least allowing people to make a choice on whether they want to engage with this content or not.
Critics online say It Ends With Us simplifies victim-survivors' experiences at best and romanticises domestic violence at worst.
Responding to this, some It Ends With Us fans point out that fictional characters or stories aren't required to be unproblematic or educational.
But! CoHo said in 2021 that she intended to educate readers with this novel: ""I always say I write to entertain, I don't write to inform or to educate. But this book was a different beast.""
And whether CoHo intended to romanticise abuse or not, It Ends With Us's readers are romanticising it anyway.
Across social media, many CoHorts express their frustration Lily doesn't end up with Ryle. They describe him not as an abuser, but as a ""jerk"" — who's still ""hot"".
One reader admits: ""no cuz y'all don't understand how badly i had been rooting for them EVEN AFTER he hurt her the first few times.""
Ms O'Brien does praise how CoHo's book shows that ""men who choose to use violence are not monsters [but] easily recognisable people, who are probably in our lives.""
But she says depicting a character like Ryle as ""strong or masculine"" and interlinking that masculinity with violence is dangerous.

She says stories like It Ends With Us are part of the reason why, as a society, ""it's really important we are taught the signs of what's healthy and what's safe and what to do if you or a loved one is in a relationship like this as early as possible"".
It Ends With Us - trailer
The movie adaptation of It Ends With Us has been controversial since its announcement, and not just among the book's critics. Fans have big feelings about the project too, from the casting down to the costume design.
While the film follows a similarly pink-tinged, romance-heavy marketing strategy to the book, there's a lot that's different about this telling.
The main characters have been aged up significantly (at the time of writing the book, CoHo didn't know there is no such thing as a 29-year-old neurosurgeon) and, sadly, the infamous steampunk flowers do not feature. There's also a lot less Ellen DeGeneres.
This is a story that's absolutely benefited from screenwriter Christy Hall's deft hand and from having a slate of talented actors breathe life into it.
Blake Lively stars in the long-awaited movie adaptation of the 2016 New York Times bestseller (and #BookTok favourite).
But while readers often criticise CoHo's penchant for telling rather than showing with her writing, the It Ends With Us movie could have done with a little more telling than showing.
One of the strengths of the book were Lily's internal musings, where she grapples with the way our culture of internalised misogyny, victim-blaming and toxic masculinity has shaped her and her mother.
Those thought processes were part of what helped It Ends With Us answer the question it set out to: Why it can be so hard to leave an abusive relationship.
But there's been no attempt to externalise those thoughts — whether via dialogue or, as hit-or-miss as it can be, voiceover.
And, unlike in the book, there's no discussion of the fact Lily is privileged enough to be able to leave Ryle immediately, having the money and social supports to be able to do so as soon as she decides to.
The movie overall is less graphic, with only brief glimpses of the physical abuse and rape Lily's mother experienced at the hands of her father. Ryle's physical abuse of Lily is dispensed with quickly, and is glossed over much faster.
In a departure from the seemingly pro-life stance in the book, where Lily appears resigned to having her abuser's baby, the film frames it like she has a choice, even if she makes the same decision.
The fact Ryle experiences no repercussions for his abuse beyond Lily's decision to divorce him was another major criticism of the book — but the movie doesn't depart from this plot point.

And — also problematically — here, too, Ryle is depicted as broken as a result of his childhood trauma, and therefore deserving of redemption in the form of a relationship with his daughter.
The only real difference to the ending is that Lily tells Ryle she knows none of the abuse he perpetrated against her was an accident, which is a chilling moment — though not necessarily a win for the movie.
In the book, Lily had been forthright with him about it from the start.",Yasmin Jeffery,Sat 10 Aug,0

Associate director of In the Heights Clary Riven is revelling in the moment.
""It is absolutely bonkers,"" Ms Riven told ABC News.
""It's so so cool to have two Lin-Manuel Miranda shows playing in Sydney at the same time.
In the Heights is Miranda's debut musical set in New York's Washington Heights, a close-knit neighbourhood in Manhattan heavily populated by a working-class Latinx community.

It's won four Tony awards including Best Musical and Best Original Score.
Ms Riven says the cast and crew, some of whom have visited or lived in the neighbourhood, worked hard to bring Washington Heights to the Sydney Opera House.
This involved dramaturgical research, but also drawing on lived experience.
""Everybody shared stories of themselves and their background and their experience,"" Ms Riven said.
Here's what to look out for when you go and see the show.
She might not be your abuela (grandmother), but she's everyone's abuela. Someone who'll help you with your homework or make sandwiches for you.

""As immigrants, we all have this desire to find home,"" Ms Riven explains.
""So, when we speak about abuela, we all know somebody like that. Whether it's back home, whether it's here in Australia, we want to feel a sense of home.
""And when you're not home anymore, a lot of us travel far and wide, away from our biological family, so, when we do connect with others like us, it's this really gorgeous, unspoken feeling of community.
""And everyone just becomes a tia (auntie) or hermana (sister) or an abuela.
""You just become family.""
""The salon is so iconic,"" Ms Riven said.
""It's the same every single location.
""In this barrio (neighbourhood), it's so key to the community.""
Ms Riven says it was important to make sure the characters in the musical weren't stereotypes.
She describes the three women who run the salon as matriarchs in the community.
""They grab you, they kind of break you down a little bit, and then they make you feel amazing, and then they give you the real truth,"" she said.
Ms Riven says street parties are a real thing that happens, and music is everywhere.
Crates act as card tables, makeshift steps, chairs, a stage — they're everything.

""It felt like a really gorgeous way of bringing that level of reality into the piece because they seriously are everywhere in South America,"" Ms Riven said.
""They're just everywhere in Washington Heights.""

""It's in the lyrics a few times that these characters put their flags up on display to remind them that they come from miles away,"" Ms Riven says.
""And that they put them up with pride.""
""Our costume designer, Keerthi [Subramanyan], she did such a sensational job with all of that,"" Ms Riven said.
""And there was a lot of fun collaboration to make these characters dress in the most iconic 2008, 2009 [outfits].
Forget the ice cream man, in Washington Heights, it's all about the Piragua guy.

""They're kind of like the local ice cream man but instead of ice cream, it's shaved ice with flavouring.
""And again, they're everywhere,"" Ms Riven said.
New York City has a history of blackouts.
""They affected so many people and they were so, so scary,"" Ms Riven says.
""I think it really highlighted how economic hardship puts pressure on human beings.
""To feel so powerless, literally and metaphorically, they are literally powerless.
""And we hear and see some of what these characters experience in that scary blackout.""
Named after founding father George Washington, the landmark is visible in the stage production.
""It just adds a really lovely reminder, I think, of where we are,"" Ms Riven says.

Aerosmith put their plans to farewell their epic music career on hold in September, when vocalist Steven Tyler injured his vocal cords during a show on their Peace Out: The Farewell Tour.
The 76-year-old said in an Instagram statement at the time that the injury caused bleeding but that he hoped the band would be back after postponing a few shows. The classic rock group ended up cancelling the rest of the tour.
Now fans' worst fears have been confirmed following the announcement that the band will be retiring from touring indefinitely.
""As you know, Steven's voice is an instrument like no other. He has spent months tirelessly working on getting his voice to where it was before his injury,"" the band wrote in a statement.
""We've seen him struggling despite having the best medical team by his side. Sadly, it is clear that a full recovery from his vocal injury is not possible.""
""We have made a heartbreaking and difficult, but necessary, decision — as a band of brothers — to retire from the touring stage.""
The band, known for Tyler's powerful vocals on hits like I Don't Want To Miss A Thing, Walk This Way and Dream On, has been active and touring since the early 70s. They last performed in Australia in 2013 as a part of their Global Warming tour.
Queen guitarist Brian May paid tribute to the band on Instagram, calling Tyler ""one [of] the greatest vocalists and front men of all time"".
""The career of Aerosmith is truly something to celebrate forever. All things must pass — but the inspiring work of Aerosmith will live on — along with the memories of truly one of the most awesome bands to ever hit a stage.""

Even since Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden in the 2024 US election race, Harris has drawn comparisons to Selina Meyer, the long-suffering VP-turned-first-female-US-president played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus on sitcom Veep (2012-2019).
While Veep creator Armando Iannucci says that Meyer was not modelled on Harris, Louis-Dreyfus has confirmed she'll be using the inevitable comparisons to back the real VP in her race to the White House.
The former Seinfeld star told The Times of London that she ""will be extra involved"" with Harris's campaign, even dropping a small spoiler that she'll ""probably"" make an appearance at the upcoming Democratic National Convention 👀
Louis-Dreyfus isn't the only pop culture figure that has hitched their wagon to Harris's campaign for pres, with rappers Megan thee Stallion and Quavo coming out to show their support at an Atlanta rally last week.
There's been more legal fallout from the misinterpreted ""Last Supper"" tableau that ruffled feathers during the Paris Olympics' opening ceremony.
Last Wednesday, French police confirmed they were investigating online abuse targeted at DJ Barbara Butch after she featured in the Festivity segment of the opening ceremony, which was inspired by the Greek god Dionysus.
French DJ Barbara Butch says she's received death threats over her appearance in the Paris Olympics' opening ceremony.
Many online commentators wrongly assumed that the scene was mocking Leonardo da Vinci's painting showing Jesus Christ and his apostles.
Now, French celebrity drag queen and TV presenter Nicky Doll, who also featured in the Festivity scene, are suing former UK actor and current conservative commentator Laurence Fox over comments he posted on X.
Fox posted a clip from the scene accompanied by comments that implied the participants engaged in paedophilia.
The artist's lawyer, Anne-Sophie Laguens, said in a statement: ""Nicky Doll, who for years has received insults and hate messages, has been subjected to an unprecedented wave of hate and nastiness, going up to death threats, since her performance in the Festivity tableau.

""These messages go beyond artistic criticism, with some of them conveying a mixture of hate and defamation, associating drag performances with paedophilia. These comparisons are serious and unacceptable.""",Velvet Winter,Mon 5 Aug,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-04/teenage-girls-linguistics/104160082,"The way teenage girls speak is often derided, but they are in fact our linguistic trailblazers","When Alison McPhee-Harris sits down to dinner with her family, things can sometimes get lost in translation.
The Gold Coast mother says there are times where she struggles to understand what her two daughters, aged 17 and 19, are saying, and she's left asking, ""Is that even a word?""
Future Tense explores new ideas and new technologies.
""My older sister will know exactly what I'm talking about but my mum and dad will have no idea,"" she says.
Alison isn't the only one feeling out of touch. Linguists are discovering that teenage girls are trailblazers when it comes to language.
""If you're on … a train or a bus, what you should do is position yourself as close as possible to a group of young women and then shut your eyes and listen. What you hear … is the future of language in your community,"" Sali Tagliamonte, professor of linguistics at the University of Toronto tells ABC RN's Future Tense.
And while young people often lead the charge with language, Dr Tagliamonte points out that young women tend to be at least a generation ahead of young men.
""Young women tend to be the drivers, the accelerators of linguistic change and progress,"" she says.
Dr Tagliamonte's research involves sampling speech from male and female preadolescents to octogenarians.
Based on these conversational speech samples and statistical modelling, Dr Tagliamonte says she can quantify how different demographics' language changes over time.
""We can show that one group is different from another group and whether that difference is statistically significant,"" she says.
""It is the teenage women ...who are advancing [language] change.""
Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks … and you don't need to be a scientist to find it!
More than two decades ago, William Labov, the founder of modern sociolinguistics studies, observed that women lead 90 per cent of linguistic change.
Then in 2003, linguists surveyed 6,000 letters, written between 1417 to 1681.
The study found there was a quicker uptake of new language contained within the letters written by women compared to those written by men.
""What we see are the same types of patterns in language use, as we tap into contemporary language change,"" Dr Tagliamonte says.
Although, Dr Tagliamonte points out ""the changes that are promulgated by young women have probably been in the language for a long time"".
Often slang has originated from marginalised groups such as the queer community or POC (People of Colour).
Dr Tagliamonte's research shows language is changing and developing more rapidly than ever before, thanks to social media.
""Before breakfast, most teenagers have been in contact with someone from another country, another city, definitely from across town,"" she says.
""What that means is … there's infinitely more contact than there ever was before, which causes linguistic change to speed up.""
If aliens arrived, would we be able to communicate with them? These experts say yes
Dr Tagliamonte explains that biology is one major factor.
""Women seem to have an innate linguistic ability that's superior to men's,"" she says.
Additionally, there are cultural factors that come into play.
""What seems to happen is that women use language as social and symbolic capital,"" she says.
""If they are not as economically powerful as men, they use language as linguistic capital, which again, is part of why we see a gender difference between men and women.""
While some might celebrate linguistic change, others can find it threatening.
""When language changes, it's a complex adaptive system. It is not the same change from one generation to the next, as each generation distinguishes itself from another,"" Dr Tagliamonte says.
As she explains it, the teenage population is reluctant to sound like their parents and vice versa.
Mum Alison's main frustration is the Americanisation of phrases that her teenage daughters adopt.
For example, they refer to birth control rather than contraception, sweater rather than jumper and gas instead of petrol.
""I know it's irrational but I find it really annoying,"" she says.
Dr Tagliamonte says when we impose social value judgements on language, it's not because language is inherently good or bad.
""It's because we make judgements about other people based on the way they talk.""
Yet, it seems language will inevitably continue to evolve.
Alison's daughters are dedicated consumers of TikTok and reality TV, and their mother says they are constantly picking up and incorporating cultural references.
It's worth noting that many of these references stem from marginalised communities whose cultural products have entered the mainstream; take the hugely popular RuPaul's Drag Race or Beyonce's viral album, Cowboy Carter, which centres African-American culture.
And so while these things change oh so quickly, here are some key phrases for the bewildered to be aware of:

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-02/who-is-snoop-doggs-favourite-horse/104175284,Who is Snoop Dogg's favourite horse? It could be a case of mistaken identity,"For those not in equestrian circles, there is perhaps only one famous Olympic horse: the ""Crip walking"" one.
If you're unfamiliar with the backstory here, Kevin Hart and Snoop Dogg hosted a show during the Tokyo Olympics watching and recapping daily highlights.
One of those clips was of the freestyle dressage event, in which Snoop was impressed by a horse ""Crip walking"" (performing a half-pass).
""This horse is off the chain,"" Snoop said. ""I gotta get this mother f*** in a video!""
His comments had Hart, and the internet, in stitches, sending the clip viral.
Snoop told late night host Jimmy Fallon in May he was ""looking forward to the horses"" ahead of travelling to Paris as a special correspondent for NBC.
""I'm going to meet the horse in real life,"" he said after Fallon replayed the clip.
""He's the returning champ, so I've got to go meet him, you know what I'm saying, let him know I'm a big fan.""
An article by NBC said the rapper is ""excited to meet Mopsie"", quoting Snoop's appearance on Fallon.
""We can already tell that Snoop Dogg finally meeting Mopsie the 'Rave Horse' will definitely be a highlight of the Games,"" it read.
In a post to the Olympics website, a similar claim is made that Snoop is Mopsie's biggest fan, alluding to his Tokyo reaction clip.
It's a relatively common connection, too.
Mention ""Rave Horse"" at the pub, and chances are someone will ask you if that's the horse Snoop reacted to.
But Mopsie is neither the returning Olympic dressage champion, nor the horse in that clip.
That was actually a video of Isabell Werth riding Bella Rose 2.
It's perhaps not surprising Rave Horse has been mistaken for Bella Rose.
How often do we see two separate equestrian moments go viral at the same time?
Mopsie, also known by his registered name Suppenkasper, blew up on social media, also for his Tokyo Olympics freestyle dressage routine.

While movie soundtracks and the occasional pop music medleys are typical choices for riders choreographing their performances, Mopsie's rider, five-time US Olympian Steffen Peters, took things a little outside the box.
The result?
Piaffes, passages and pirouettes to the not-so-dulcet sounds of Calabria and Call On Me club remixes.
The surprising thing was, they meshed quite well.
Peters and Mopsie placed 10th out of 18 in the freestyle event.
They weren't so successful this year, however.
The partnership finished ninth out of 10 in their group at the dressage individual qualifier and USA was eliminated from the team event.
The music choice for Werth and Bella Rose 2 was worlds away from the Rave Horse set.
Think Beethoven's Symphony No. 5.
Werth and Bella walked away with a silver medal for the individual dressage and gold in team dressage for Germany.

We haven't heard much about Bella Rose since Tokyo, though.
That's because she retired following her 2021 Olympics appearance and has gone on to have her first foal at the age of 19.
In bad news for Snoop, it means she won't be making any appearances at the dressage grand prix kicking off in Paris on Saturday.
He'll have to make do with meeting Rave Horse after all.",EBy Elissa Steedman,Fri 2 Aug,0

Since Paris 2024 got underway, you might have missed the weekend's biggest entertainment, arts and pop culture stories, from announcements at San Diego Comic-Con to the winner of a prestigious Australian playwriting award — and don't forget the more out there artistic moments of Paris' four-hour opening ceremony.
If the superhero nerd in your life was in fits of excitement over the weekend don't be alarmed, it was just San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC). SDCC is one of the largest comic book conventions in the world and it's where all the biggest studios come to parade their upcoming projects.
Undoubtedly, the biggest news out of the weekend is that Robert Downey Jr is returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Many credit the success of RDJ's Iron Man (2008) as the catalyst for the MCU. But unfortunately for fans and Disney's wallet, Iron Man very famously died at the end of 2019's Avengers: Endgame (spoilers, I'm not sorry).
So, how in the convoluted multiverse timeline is RDJ coming back to the MCU? As a completely different character: this time a villain called Doctor Doom in the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday — slated for release in 2026.
Does this make sense? Of course not, but that has literally never stopped Marvel before.
The nostalgic/fan service-y return of RDJ definitely has nothing to do with the fact that Marvel had to drop their previously planned Big Bad Guy after he was found guilty of assaulting his ex-girlfriend last year, so stop asking!!
Aside from the Marvel drops (they also announced the return of the Russo brothers, who helmed a couple of Captain Americas and the last two Avengers movies, and more deets about the Fantastic Four's third reboot), there were more non-MCU announcements made over the weekend.
Superhero satire The Boys is officially getting ANOTHER spin-off: This time it's a prequel called Vought Rising starring Jensen Ackles's Soldier Boy and Aya Cash's Stormfront (both canonical fascists). Proving once and for all that you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the thing you're satirising.
And Bridgerton boo Nicola Coughlan has been roped into this year's Doctor Who Christmas special, with fans getting a first look at Comic-Con.

Playwright, songwriter and dramaturge Jules Orcullo has won this year's Griffin Award, a prize for Australian plays, worth $17,400, previously won by playwrights including Suzie Miller (international smash Prima Facie), Debra Oswald (Mr Bailey's Minder) and David Finnigan (Kill Climate Deniers).
This year's award was for an idea for a play with an ""authentic, inventive and contemporary Australian voice"", rather than a finished work, and includes a commission and development with Griffin Theatre Company.
At an event in Sydney overnight, Orcullo won the award for their new play My Dad Never Saw the Beatles, about a daughter trying to help her father achieve his dreams, with a ""musical, mythic retelling of an untrue event"" in the Philippines in 1966.
""Winning the Griffin Award means a whole lot. It means a validation of my writing practice and I'm really excited to hang out with the Griffin team to build this play. I am proud and pleased that I get to tell a story for my family — and the cycles of generosity, gratitude and grief that live inside families like ours,"" Orcullo said.

Declan Greene, Griffin's artistic director, described the play as ""unlike anything we'd ever read (or heard!) before; an ambitious, wildly imaginative fusion of playwriting, music theatre [and] personal storytelling"".
The two other finalists for the award were Christopher Bryant (New Balance) and Michele Lee (Going Down).
Orcullo's last show, the musical Forgetting Tim Minchin, premiered in Sydney last year to rave reviews. They're currently working on a movie adaptation, with The Deb writer Hannah Reilly, as part of a new screen comedy development initiative.
It's the latest in Orcullo's already impressive theatrical resume: They're currently a resident artist with Sydney Theatre Company, and have worked as a producer with Ilbijerri, Belvoir, Co-Curious and Contemporary Asian Australian Performance.

Oops! Britney Spears did it again. ""It"" being exuding big unreliable narrator energy.
On Friday, the iconic pop star's X account shared some negative thoughts about Halsey's new single 'Lucky', which samples Spears's 2000 hit of the same name and pays homage to the original in an accompanying music video.
Halsey — Lucky
In the clip, chart-topping 'Without Me' singer Halsey depicts herself as a famous pop star privately struggling with her health. The song and video arrive after the 29-year-old revealed last month she'd been diagnosed with both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a ""rare"" T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
Britney, however, may have missed the news and seemed to believe the video was targeting her. ""For obvious reasons I'm very upset about the Halsey video,"" the 42-year-old wrote in a since-deleted X post.
""I feel harassed, violated and bullied. I didn't know an artist like her and someone I looked up to and admired would illustrate me in such an ignorant way by tailoring me as a superficial pop star with no heart or concern at all.
""I have my own health problems which is why I took down my [Instagram] account yesterday. I will definitely be putting it back up to show I CARE. I'm speaking with my lawyers today to see what can be done on this matter. It feels illegal and down right cruel.""
Shortly after, the tweet was deleted and Spears posted another: ""Fake news !!! That was not me on my phone !!! I love Halsey and that's why I deleted it !!!""
Halsey – who claimed she'd gotten approval from Spears to interpolate 'Lucky' prior to release – responded ""I love Britney!"" in a quote tweet.
'Lucky' is expected to feature on Halsey's upcoming fifth studio album — her first since 2021's Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross-produced If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power.

Trust the French to put on a divisive/deranged opening ceremony.
Based around the river Seine, rather than some boring stadium, the rain-soaked ceremony featured a mysterious masked torchbearer (and non-binary legend?) dashing across the rooftops of Paris. They were joined by heavy metal band Gojira — with the help of Marie Antoinette's severed head — covering French revolutionary song Ça Ira, a jazzy Lady Gaga, a healthy dose of Eurodance and … Minions???.
It makes sense once you realise that those little yellow animated guys — who first rose to fame in Despicable Me before becoming an internet sensation/meme — were created by French animation studio Mac Guff, voiced and created by director Pierre Coffin.
However you feel about the French vision (and Minions), it's safe to say the entire world was happy to see Céline Dion take to the Eiffel Tower for the opening ceremony's final number. The French Canadian singer performed a moving cover of Edith Piaf's Hymne à l'amour in her first live performance since 2020, and her first since she revealed she had been diagnosed with stiff person syndrome.
We love you, Celine. We also eagerly await the closing ceremony offering: Will it live up to Sydney's campiest of closing shows, which included Kylie Minogue, Savage Garden and drag queens on stiletto floats in an homage to The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert? Tune in on August 12, Australian time, to find out.

US Vice President and presidential hopeful Kamala Harris has popped up on reality TV juggernaut RuPaul's Drag Race, encouraging viewers to register to vote.
The clip, which opened the weekend's season nine finale of All Stars, saw Harris in the werkroom alongside judge Michelle Visage and a selection of notable LGBTIQ+ entertainers with ties to the show, including singer Lance Bass, actor Leslie Jones, choreographer Jamal Sims and actor Cheyenne Jackson.
""Each day, we are seeing our rights and freedoms under attack, including the right of everyone to be who they are, love who they love, openly and with pride,"" Harris said.
""So as we fight back against these attacks, let's all remember, no one is alone. We are all in this together and your vote is your power. So please make sure your voice is heard this November and register to vote.""
While Drag Race has featured several Democrats in the past, including Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, this marks the first time a presidential hopeful has appeared on the show.
While the timing of the segment seems wild, with it airing shortly after Harris's campaign launched, it was actually filmed before President Biden announced his withdrawal from the election.
No other presidential nominee has unofficial endorsements from Drag Race and Charli xcx, who last week tweeted ""kamala IS brat"", prompting a live CNN panel to dissect what brat is. 2024, huh?

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-27/sinead-oconnor-wax-figure-taken-down-over-poor-likeness/104150802,'Something out of Thunderbirds': Sinéad O'Connor wax figure pulled over complaints it doesn't compare to late singer,"A Dublin museum has taken down its wax figure of Sinéad O'Connor after fans and family members raised concerns about its poor likeness to the late singer.
The museum unveiled the figure on Thursday, local time, in honour of the first anniversary of O'Connor's death.
The singer died in her London home of natural causes on July 26, 2023, aged 56.
Fans filled the street of her former seaside hometown for a funeral procession in August of that year.
The event followed a private service attended by then-Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar, President Michael Higgins and musical luminaries including Bono of U2 and Bob Geldof of the Boomtown Rats.
Look back on Sinéad O'Connor's life and career.
John O'Connor, the singer's brother, said the museum's wax figure was a ""hideous"" representation of his sister that looked like a cross between something in a department store window display and a 1960s sci-fi TV show that used electronic puppets.
""When I saw it online yesterday I was shocked,"" he told Irish broadcaster RTE.
""I thought it looked something between a mannequin and something out of the Thunderbirds.""
He said he was upset by the timing of the unveiling and the fact that no-one had contacted his family.
""As I said earlier, the world may have lost a star, and they did, but I lost my sister,"" he said.
The National Wax Museum Plus apologised to O'Connor's family and said it would immediately begin creating a more accurate likeness.
Paddy Dunning, the Dublin museum's director who called O'Connor a longtime friend, said she deserved a better tribute.
""In response to the public's feedback regarding the wax figure, we acknowledge that the current representation did not meet our high standards or the expectations of Sinéad's devoted fans,"" the museum said in a statement.

The singer is best known for her 1990 cover of Prince's ballad Nothing Compares 2 U.
O'Connor was considered a national treasure in Ireland, where she started out performing on the streets of Dublin.
She became a controversial figure after she tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II on Saturday Night Live in 1992.
Accurately capturing the likeness of celebrities has famously tripped up many an artist.
A Polish wax museum was ridiculed last year for what some called creepy depictions of Kate, the Princess of Wales, and her husband, Prince William.
A sculptor who was mocked for his bronze piece of Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, went back to his studio for a do-over that was more warmly received.
Likewise, US women's soccer star Brandi Chastain got a replacement for a panned plaque where she was compared to looking like actors Gary Busey and Mickey Rooney, and former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick.

She has played the part well for almost two decades: selling out shows, releasing hits and attracting fans.
But despite real success, she is not exactly real.
Miku is a ""vocaloid"", a voice synthesiser that producers can use in their songs.
The Japanese software has become so popular since its 2007 release that Miku ""performed"" alongside Lana Del Ray, Doja Cat and Blur at this year's Coachella music festival.
She is now embarking on her first official tour of Australia and New Zealand this November.
And while doomsayers may see virtual performers as a threat to the creative industries, some artists are using the technology to their advantage.

The forced closure of events during the pandemic sparked big interest in new types of performance, from Justin Bieber's gigs in the metaverse to virtual reality music festivals.
And while much of this experimentation ended with the lockdowns, virtual performers have long found fans in Asia.
Heart-throb virtual boy band Plave, which launched in 2023, has sold more than a million records and earned billing next to big Asian acts on the Idol Radio Live concerts.

And while they might look artificial, each animated avatar is controlled by a real person using motion capture to perform or chat with fans in real time.
""There are lots of factors or technologies that make this possible, but we think that the human element is the most fundamental success factor,"" said Kevin Chai, the chief financial officer of virtual entertainment company Vlast, which created Plave.
To date, Plave has been keen to prove they can do everything that a traditional pop idol can, including performing live by broadcasting their avatars into a real venue.
And they're not the only virtual kids on the block.
Five-member FE:VERSE was formed from a survival show dedicated to virtual performers while South Korean girl group Iiternity showed off their hyper-realistic AI avatars with their debut single I'm Real.
Lauren Deberardinis works at a Sydney K-pop music store and has seen fans flock to virtual idols like Plave, as they would other pop stars.
""They're still real people at the end of the day,"" she said.
How Japan reinvented itself from military empire to pop-culture superpower.
And while many emerging stars would welcome a growing fanbase, being in the spotlight can be dangerous.
K-pop has been plagued by reports of obsessive ""sasaeng"" fans who stalk, harass or try to kidnap their favourite stars.
There are even stories of fans trying to pass on love letters written in blood.
""So being a virtual idol helps [artists] maintain that level of creativity and still have something for the fans to interact with, but doing it in a much safer, protected manner,"" Ms Deberandinis said.

While the long-term viability of virtual idols remains to be seen, the genre that built their careers continues to grow.
Live Nation promoter Wenona Lok, who specialises in bringing Asian talent to Australia, says 2023 was a ""record-breaking year"".
""Melbourne Olympic Park hosted two sold-out Asian pop artists on a Tuesday night,"" she said.
While virtual artists are not new, Ms Lok said ""an intersection of technology and music"" was bringing them to the fore.
""With a lot of the Asian pop artists, and especially the virtual artists, there's a lot of strategy that goes behind how they engage with their fans,"" she said.
""There's a lot of thought that goes into the content, delivering the music and music videos, creating communities and forums for artists to speak to these fans.""

While the future may look bright for Asian pop, Australia's local music industry is facing an existential crisis.
The high-profile cancellation of major festivals like Splendour in The Grass, escalating operational expenses and cost-conscious consumers are making it harder for musicians to make a living.
So artists like Sally Coleman are looking for alternatives.
""I really love playing for live audiences but I don't always love the lifestyle of being on the road all the time and the financial precarity,"" she said.

""One thing I'm not trying to do is replicate or replace a conventional music gig,"" she said.
""But what I am trying to do is create something new. So for the audience, I want it to almost feel like you're stepping inside a video game or an interactive experience.""
Amid the excitement of new technology, the acceleration of AI is prompting discussions about the future role of humans in the creative industries.
Coleman said it all depended on the audience.
Just over half of Australian music festivals are actually turning a profit, according to new research from Creative Australia.
""So even though technically it's completely possible to do all this, without a human directly creating it, I think the bigger question is going to be, 'Is that what audiences want?'""
AI is also an ""open-ended question"" for Plave but Mr Chai said that's not why fans loved Plave.
""All of Plave's tracks, so far, have been composed by the members themselves, underscoring the essential role of human creativity,"" he said.
""Those persona created by the actual humans is what fans really love.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-24/australian-horror-film-birdeater-jack-clark-jim-weir/104131812,Birdeater is a new Aussie horror about 'a national male identity in crisis',"A group of friends gets together for a weekend in the country to celebrate one of their forthcoming nuptials.
It's a bucks party in the bush with booze, drugs and a blow-up doll — what could go wrong?
Well, plenty, as shown in the new Australian horror flick, Birdeater.
The Screen Show brings you reviews and in-depth conversations with leading film and TV directors, actors and screenwriters from Australia and around the world.
It's the debut feature film from Sydney-based friends Jack Clark and Jim Weir, who told ABC RN's The Screen Show that many of the film's details were inspired by real life.
Clark, who attended a Sydney private school, says: ""There are definitely parts of it that are … fragments of stories or often moments of parties that we wanted to re-create. There were never whole images of people, but we definitely stole wholesale from people in our social circles.""
In Birdeater, Mackenzie Fearnley and Shabana Azeez play Louie and Irene, a young couple who meet on a Sydney beach and soon become engaged.
As their relationship unfolds on screen, however, we can't help but notice something is awry.
Just what that is slowly comes to light as the action shifts to Louie's bucks party — a notorious setting for antisocial behaviour.
""The whole idea [of a bucks party] is: 'Let's partake in this bad behaviour together and thereby excuse all of us,'"" Clark says.

Only, in Birdeater, Louie takes the ""super modern"" step of inviting Irene and his friend's girlfriend, Grace.
The result is a disturbing re-evaluation of contemporary masculinity that explores issues including emotional abuse and coercive control.
""It's … reflective of a national male identity that's perhaps in crisis,"" Clark says.
Louie comes across as an archetypal nice guy, but that doesn't make him harmless.
Seemingly nice guys often get away with hurting other people because they conceal their actions behind a pleasant façade, Weir says.
""It's a pattern of subtly manipulative behaviour that you can only really observe over time,"" he adds.
""That's what we were trying to explore in the film — we have characters who when you meet them, you're like, 'OK, this guy's trouble. This is the guy you have to worry about.' And those are the guys that end up being total non-threats.""
In Louie, Clark and Weir wanted to create a character who was relatable, likeable and convincing in his protestations that his bad behaviour was just a big misunderstanding — he's a nice guy, after all.
""You often find in films like these that talk about masculinity that there's a distancing effect. There is a point in which a male audience can draw a line and then distance themselves from that character,"" Clark says.
The filmmakers wanted Louie (played by Mackenzie Fearnley, pictured) to be a character the audience naturally sided with. (Supplied: Umbrella Entertainment)
But male audiences don't get to distance themselves from Louie. Rather than a caricature of toxic masculinity, he's drawn from the filmmakers' thoughts, experiences and relationships — ""our own worst mental gymnastics"", as Clark puts it.
The filmmakers knew that the film's success hinged on the plausibility of Irene and Louie's relationship, despite his problematic behaviour.
They cast Shabana Azeez (In Limbo) in the role of Irene first.
""She needed to have that immediate chemistry with someone who could essentially trap her in this relationship,"" Clark says.
Mackenzie Fearnley (Operation Buffalo) provided that spark.
""As soon as she read opposite Mackenzie, she came and told us straight away, 'That was it. That was the first time I felt like I could actually fall for what somebody is telling me. I felt like he was telling me the truth,'"" Clark says.
The chemistry between Azeez (pictured, with Ben Hunter as Dylan in the background) and Fearnley was ""essential"", Clark says. (Supplied: Umbrella Entertainment)
The casting of Louie's friends Charlie (Jack Bannister) and Dylan (Ben Hunter) was equally strategic.
Clark says he wanted to present the trio of high school mates as a homogenous unit of young, white, privileged men.
""We knew they all should look similar … and everybody else in the ensemble would be othered from them in some sense, whether or not it was their gender, their [sexual] orientation, their social position, their height,"" he says.
Clark and Weir both first encountered the 1971 cult Australian horror film, Wake in Fright, while at the Australian Film Television and Radio School (AFTRS), where they met.
""It was a real kind of seminal watch,"" Weir says.
The upcoming Blu-ray re-release of 1971 film Wake In Fright prompted historian Andrew Mercado to start making a documentary to go with it.
He describes the film — a classic of Australian New Wave cinema directed by Canadian director Ted Kotcheff, about a teacher getting stuck in a remote outback mining town after accruing a bad gambling debt — as a ""subconscious"" influence on Birdeater.
""We wrote the film and went through pretty much all the pre-production without mentioning Wake in Fright once,"" he says.
The film's influence became more explicit when shooting started and Weir brought in his own Wake in Fright poster — normally pinned to his bedroom wall — to use as a prop to decorate a character's apartment.
""[At that point] we did realise how much we had unconsciously taken from Wake in Fright,"" he says.
Both films place urban professionals in unfamiliar settings far from the city.
Wake in Fright was filmed in the arid landscape surrounding Broken Hill (and famously featured graphic footage of a real-life kangaroo hunt), while Birdeater takes the claustrophobic bush surrounding the village of St Albans in the Hawkesbury as its setting.
Weir says the Birdeater budget was ""very low — a few hundred thousand"". (Supplied: Umbrella Entertainment)
And both films cast a critical eye over toxic male behaviour.
Wake in Fright calls on archetypes of masculinity, such as the lone cowboy or the drover, that held sway over the 20th century and shaped our national identity, Clark says.
""Our ideals about mateship, about camaraderie, our sense of humour, our sense of irony — a lot of it stemmed from that [archetype],"" he says.
However, Clark believes our ideas around masculinity have changed with the times, and millennial and gen Z audiences no longer see themselves in films like Wake in Fright.
""That man no longer seems to have a place in contemporary gender [and identity] politics,"" he says.
""[We were trying to] reckon with that image [of masculinity] in today's youth.""",Unknown,Wed 24 Jul,0

Which is why we're here to catch you up on what you might have missed from the entertainment world.
Chappell Roan has had a huge year. In 2024, the 26-year-old queer pop star played at Coachella, performed in Statue of Liberty drag at the Governors Ball, appeared on Jimmy Fallon, and opened for Olivia Rodrigo.
After years of slogging it out trying to get a big break, her 2023 debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, has suddenly roared towards the top of the charts and attracted millions of listeners.
A post shared by ABC Lifestyle (@abclifestyle)
But the Missouri-born singer says she has ""pumped the brakes"" on her meteoric ascent into fame, due to the extreme behaviour of some of her fans.
In the latest episode of The Comment Section podcast, Roan told host Drew Afualo fans not only follow her, but they've also discovered where her parents live and where her sister works.
""People have started to be freaks,"" she said.
The singer says she made a decision early in her career that if her family was ever in danger due to ""stalker vibes"" she would quit.
""And we're there,"" she said.
""It's kind of a forest fire right now.""
So is ""your favourite artist's favourite artist"" done for good? Only time will tell.

Superhero satire The Boys has never been subtle in its skewering of US politics, but the final episode of season four flew too close to the sun for streamer Amazon Prime Video.
You see — oh, and the following will have spoilers obvi — the fourth season of The Boys built up to a finale that hinged on the assassination of the in-universe US president, in order to install a puppet leader who can be controlled by big bad superhero Homelander.
And just by sheer coincidence, you might have heard there was a real-life, highly public assassination attempt on a former US president/current presidential candidate recently…
Superhero satire The Boys has been brutally sending up late stage capitalism for half a decade but the latest season might hit too close to home.
The comparison was all too much for Prime Video and Sony Pictures Television, who issued a statement affirming that The Boys is just a show and they don't condone real-world violence.
""The season finale of The Boys contains scenes of fictional political violence, which some viewers may find disturbing, especially in light of the injuries and tragic loss of life sustained during the assassination attempt on former President Trump,"" they said.
""The Boys is a fictitious series that was filmed in 2023, and any scene or plotline similarities to these real-world events are coincidental and unintentional.""
Just for good measure, Prime Video also changed the title of the finale from ""Assassination Run"" to the much-safer ""Season Four Finale"" and chucked in a ""viewer discretion is advised"" warning at the beginning of the ep.

Chart-topping R&B superstar Khalid is one of the key voices of his generation.
His new album Sincere, his first in half a decade, is one of the year's most eagerly anticipated releases, and today he revealed that a few thousand Australian fans will get to experience it in a very special way.
The American singer is coming to Sydney to perform Sincere in the Sydney Opera House Concert Hall for two shows on August 5-6.
Considering Khalid played two shows at the enormous Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney on his last visit in 2019, this comparatively intimate experience is a seriously exciting opportunity for fans. And given this in-the-round show will be the first time he's ever performed the album live, these gigs will go down in history.
General tickets are on sale from midday Thursday – we'd recommend taking an early lunch and being both really patient and really prepared if you want a chance to snag one.

Eminem's latest album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), has unseated Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department (TTPD) after three months atop the Billboard 200 chart.
Eminem's new album is frustrating, but there are four new Australian albums that more than make up for it.
Congratulations, Stans, and sorry, Swifties etc, etc. But on the plus side my dear Swifties, TTPD did spend 12 entire weeks at number one and enjoyed immense commercial success — despite accusations Swift's album re-release strategy deliberately sabotaged other artist's (namely, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish) chances of reaching the number one slot.
But back to everyone's favourite extremely white rapper. Reviews of Eminem's 12th studio album were mixed — our critics dubbed it a ""tiresome riposte against cancel culture"" — but that clearly hasn't stopped fans from hitting play.
The Death of Slim Shady is Eminem's 11th album to reach the number one slot, which reportedly ties him with Bruce Springsteen, Barbra Streisand and Ye (aka Kanye West) for the fifth-most number ones on the Billboard 200. (Swift is tied with Jay-Z for the 14th-most number ones.)

After wowing audiences across Australia with its tale of teenage girls and their fanatical obsessions with pop stars, Yve Blake's debut musical Fangirls opens at London's Lyric Hammersmith Theatre on Wednesday.
Writer and composer Blake interviewed more than 100 young fans before she started to work on the story of 14-year-old Edna, who is so desperate to meet her crush Harry — the lead singer of the world's biggest boy band, True Connection — she kidnaps him.
It's a celebration of teenage girls' capacity to love something in an all-consuming way.
""The whole message of the show is about how empowered it is to scream your lungs out about something you care about,"" Blake told ABC TV's Art Works in 2022.
""I realised that fangirls know how to do something almost none of my adult friends know how to do, and that's love something without apology.""
Yve Blake talks about Fangirls on ABC TV's Art Works in 2022
Fangirls premiered at Brisbane Festival in 2019, before travelling to Sydney's Belvoir St Theatre. It's since transferred to the Sydney Opera House and toured to sell-out crowds around the country.
Along the way, it's picked up its very own set of fangirls, who know all the words to all the songs, perform their own renditions on TikTok, and even make their own merch.
If you're having a brat-girl-summer in London right now, you could join them.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-21/the-blair-witch-project-film-changed-horror-genre-storytellers/104102466,The Blair Witch Project at 25: How one film changed the horror genre as we know it,"This year marks the 25th anniversary of The Blair Witch Project, a film that popularised the found-footage horror sub-genre and captivated a generation of horror fans.
Made on a shoestring budget of less than US$60,000 by writer/director team Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, the film went on to gross US$248 million internationally, becoming one of the most successful films of all time by return on investment.
It also inspired a generation of indie filmmakers to overcome the limitations of low-budget filmmaking by leaning into the explicit presence of a camera within the story, such as with the Paranormal Activity series (2007–15), Creep (2014) and Hell House LLC (2015). In more recent tributes to the genre, such as the 2023 film Missing, older-style cameras are replaced with phone and laptop cameras.
The Blair Witch Project (1999) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers
The Blair Witch Project famously opens with the following title card:
In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary called 'The Blair Witch Project'. A year later their footage was found.
This introduction — and the promotion of the film as a record of true events — was part of a successful viral marketing strategy that leveraged the burgeoning internet culture of the time.
This strategy included a website which presented further details about the disturbing legend of the Blair Witch and the police investigation into the disappearance of students Heather, Mike and Josh.
Combined with the buzz from a successful Sundance debut in January 1999, the mythology surrounding the film intrigued audiences. And some viewers considered the possibility what they were watching was a genuine set of recordings — and not just fiction.
This conceit of blurring the line between fiction and reality had already been established in cult horror movies such as Ruggero Deodato's 1980 film Cannibal Holocaust. But it was The Blair Witch Project that catapulted found-footage horror into the broader public consciousness.
The rise of reality TV in the 2000s meant viewers were increasingly being presented with documentary-style images which were claimed to be authentic (despite their constructed nature). In my book on found-footage horror, I argue the growing presence of screens and cameras in everyday life also contributed to the sub-genre's popularity.
Found-footage scholar Alexandra Heller-Nicholas describes the experience of watching found-footage horror as an invitation to ""indulge in an active horror fantasy"". Part of the appeal, she says, emerges from ""something we rationally know not to be true (the supernatural)"" being temporarily accepted as true because of our trust in the documentary-style aesthetic.
But of course, this temporary acceptance is underpinned by the knowledge the events are not real.
The film went on to gross more than $200 million internationally. (Supplied: IMDB)
Since the early 2000s, there has been a marked decrease in the power of such ""active horror fantasy"" at the cinema. This is no doubt related to the public's increasing scepticism of the visual image.
Speaking to The New York Times, The Blair Witch Project creators Myrick and Sanchez acknowledge that part of the success of the film was that it was a product of a unique window of time (before the media identified it as fiction). In 2016, a sequel to the two original Blair Witch films was met with a middling critical and audience response, seemingly confirming their beliefs.
This year, film studios Lionsgate and Blumhouse touted plans for a new sequel to The Blair Witch Project, although the original filmmaking team and cast were reportedly not approached for input. Upon hearing the news, the cast shared an open letter calling for retroactive compensation and meaningful consultation on the new film.
On a recent podcast, Sanchez shared his hopes for both a prequel set in the 1700s and a potential TV series that picks up where the original film ended.
While the presence of found-footage horror at the cinema may have declined in recent decades, the internet and streaming have provided a location for those inspired by The Blair Witch Project to continue to draw on the film's aesthetics and storytelling devices.
Running from 2009 to 2014, the web series Marble Hornets adapted the Slenderman mythology as a found-footage exploration of a mysterious entity haunting the lives and cameras of a group of college students.
More recently, YouTuber Kane Parsons created a viral sensation by adapting a creepypasta known as The Backrooms into a series of YouTube short films. The viral success of these led to Parson's recruitment to adapt the story into a feature film for studio A24.
The inventive 2022 series Archive 81 also became a critical success on Netflix, but was unfortunately cancelled after one season.
Horror as a genre will always find a way to infiltrate the media we consume. While it may seem unlikely any modern found-footage horror could captivate an audience the way The Blair Witch Project did, it's only a matter of time before the next generation of storytellers create a terrifying new monster to haunt us.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-20/brats-documentary-andrew-mccarthy-1980s-brat-pack-fame/104118446,Andrew McCarthy looks back on what it was like to be named a member of the 1980s 'Brat Pack'. It ruined him,"As the late George Michael struggled publicly with the exploding fame that his extraordinary talent had brought him, and as he wrestled privately with a sexuality he was not yet ready to reveal, Frank Sinatra reached the end of his patience.
George had spoken to the LA Times about his smash hit, Freedom 90, and his growing disillusionment with fame, but that old stager Frank was having none of it. Aged 74 he penned an open letter to George:
I don't understand a guy who lives 'in hopes of reducing the strain of his celebrity status', and now that he's a smash songwriter at 27 he wants to quit doing what tons of gifted youngsters all over the world would shoot grandma for — just one crack at what he's complaining about … c'mon George – loosen up. Swing, man … and no more talk about 'the tragedy of fame'…
I kept thinking about Sinatra as I dived with glee back into a cherished chapter of my youth with the documentary Brats, made by former teen star Andrew McCarthy about the 1980s rise of teen movies and the young talents that filled them who came to be known as the Brat Pack.
‘BRATS’ | Official Trailer | June 13 on Hulu
This was the famed era of John Hughes movies, of Rob Lowe and Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Demi Moore, and of all-powerful Hollywood studios that saw the revenue streams flowing from suburban America where the teen reigned supreme.
The studios pumped out dozens of films starring dozens of emerging 20-somethings and turned many into immediate stars. Most of them shared spiritual DNA with Sinatra and his desire to fly to the moon, and they leapt into their new life of fame with pills in one hand and booze and pay cheques in the other.
Sinatra was onto something in that letter of his: fame takes you as it finds you. All these young actors had talent and charisma, but the ones who punched through had something else — not only ambition, but a pre-ordained sense of deserving to be a star.
Tom Cruise, Robert Downey Jnr, Demi Moore: they all had swagger beyond their years, a lifted chin and an arrogant expectation of their goals, with self-constructed egos that were already well-reinforced.
They blew through their early roles and careers with speed and conviction. As an enthralled viewer back then, I was in no doubt that they justified the marquee status they grabbed for. Their self-destructiveness was no indicator of frailty: Drew Barrymore was challenged by two crew members to slam down a couple of glasses of champagne at the ET afterparty. She was eight.

Like their Rat Pack forebears, it went with the territory.
Unlike Sinatra and his fellow swingers, the Brat Pack moniker was not kind. Gifted by the New York magazine reporter David Blum, who is revealed in the documentary to be as bitter and jealous as you might imagine, the sobriquet was intentionally nasty. It was a term intended to imply that these kids didn't deserve the fame, accolades and money; that they were grasping and pouty. It stung some of the young actors. It rolled off others.
But it changed the course of Andrew McCarthy's life.
McCarthy's documentary is his real-time therapy session as he tries to figure out why an article that didn't even mention him ruined him.
McCarthy was different. As well as feeling like a pretender to Brat Pack status, he was uncomfortable in the spotlight. In the documentary we see an awkward McCarthy mumble his way through an interview after the single cultural moment of the St. Elmo's Fire film preview: he can barely look at the interviewer. Can you imagine Demi Moore throwing away a moment like this?
McCarthy seems to have been on a lifelong search to figure out why he couldn't fully inhabit the fame he sought, and why that name stung him so much.
Now and then: Demi Moore and Andrew McCarthy. (Instagram: Andrew McCarthy)
In the film, he seeks out and talks to, for the very first time, his fellow Brat Packers, asking them how they coped with that article, that name.
Emilio Estevez can still hardly talk about it, his tight jaw indicating how much he still wants to thump Blum. Ali Sheedy, who looks only five years older than she was in those movies, is phlegmatic and amused.
A surf-blown Rob Lowe shoots Andrew that brilliant smile and shrugs: why even let that name bother you? How good was it to be successful and famous?
And in a moment so powerful that Andrew himself seems to miss it, you see the different levels of joy these two men reached in two very different lives.
The documentary is awkward, and strangely shot and sometimes very badly recorded, which in the end makes sense of the awkward and unsure man who made it.

Sometimes McCarthy rambles to his fellow brats so urgently about his distress at those times that he barely gives them any space to speak for themselves. What shaped that fragility? He gives us a clue when he mentions the tricky lifelong relationship he had with his father.
The film, despite itself, becomes an object lesson in taking control of your life from the get-go. Watching Brats, you can't help but reflect on the steely-eyed careers today of people like Anya Taylor-Joy or Zendaya or Sydney Sweeney: can you imagine any two-bit writer getting the better of them? Sinatra, that swaggering bastard, was right: some swing, some just can't.
This weekend we take you to Arthur Boyd's Shoalhaven and you can come shearing with us, too: it's nothing like it was.
Have a safe and happy weekend, and after full immersion in the Brat Pack, how can I share with you anything other than this? From the very first bars — if you know, you know.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-18/hollywood-production-logo-history-streaming-studio-system/104103204,"The story behind Hollywood's all-powerful studio logos as Netflix, streaming services force change","They're synonymous with some of our most memorable moments in film.
The lights go down, conversations recede to the sounds of opening confectionary wrappers and a logo familiar to theatre audiences for more than 100 years appears loud and proud on the screen.
Universal, Paramount, Warner Bros (WB), Disney, and 20th Century Studios (formerly Fox) — some of these production logos have been around since the 1910s to 30s, reflecting both the dominance of Hollywood and, in more recent times, its acquiescence to streaming.
University of Sydney Film Studies associate professor Bruce Isaacs said the early classical Hollywood studios had a very ""strong sense of themselves as a brand in the movies"", ensuring their logo took pride of place during a screening.
He said the early so-called big five studios, which included Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM), RKO, as well Paramount, WB, and 20th Century Fox, functioned ""like oligarchies"".
Some of the Big Five studios' first logos emerged during the 1910s. (Source: YouTube)
They made the films and determined the branding, the marketing, promotion, audience outreach, and owned the cinemas as well — unlike in Europe where studios tended to just be places where companies made their films.
""Culture becomes a commodity and an industry in Hollywood, much more so than in Europe.""
Flinders University associate professor Mike Walsh said their ""equity ownership in every stage of the process"" changed in the 1940s when antitrust laws forced studios to divest themselves of movie theatres.
Associate professor Mike Walsh says distribution companies held the real power in the film industry. (ABC Radio Adelaide: Malcolm Sutton)
Up until then, they were churning out films, typically playing them for a week before another replaced it, and knowing precisely how many they needed to maintain a strong cinema audience.
""From the 1950s onwards, they needed fewer films but larger scale films because they had to provide something that you couldn't get from staying home watching television,"" Dr Walsh said.
The big studios, which by then had been joined by United Artists, Universal, and Columbia Pictures, were also distributors or investors for films made by other companies, meaning their production logos remained at the start of films.
""They have global distribution networks that can deliver films to screens all around the world.
""They also have revolving lines of credit with banks, so that they can advance producers hundreds of millions of dollars for blockbusters.""
As movie practices evolved with technology, so too did the logos.
When MGM peaked, it reached for the stars, creating some of the most famous films in history. But when it struggled, it fell deep, only staying afloat with a Las Vegas tycoon and selling all its memorabilia.
Disney, for example, was among those using cell animation for its logo from the 1940s through to the 60s, until special effects started growing and becoming ""more central to the studio system"" during the 1970s.
""Then it just absolutely explodes during the 1980s and you start to see major special effects work with the logos,"" Dr Isaacs said.
Studios also became less rigid over the use of their logos.
The WB logo in the 1990s was used heavily in marketing for the Batman franchise — even morphing with the character's symbol at the start of the third and fourth instalments.
""That film [Batman] became by far the most hyper-marketed film in the history of all of Hollywood and the logo was front and centre of that,"" Dr Isaacs said.
Dr Isaac's favourite example of logos being manipulated to suit a film was The Matrix. (YouTube: @WarnerBrosLogo)
Paramount Pictures too allowed the mountain in its logo to dissolve into a real mountain in the first instalment of the Indiana Jones franchise, to a mountain etched into a gong in the second, and to a rocky outcrop in the third.
""By the time of the fourth one, the joke is that the dissolve is to a mountain-shaped molehill,"" Dr Walsh said.
Studio logos from the 1980s to 1990s were also being followed by an increasing number of logos for production companies and funding entities.
""Often times, the most entertaining part of a film is watching the one or two minutes of logos at the start,"" Dr Walsh said.
""After all, a film is a bundle of rights and increasingly now different companies will acquire different rights, so that's a part of the funding mix.""
Film reviewing is disappearing as a profession and is being replaced by multitudes of ""enthusiasts"", experts say.
In the 2010s, as streaming services led by Netflix took off (and home theatre set-ups became better and cheaper), the big Hollywood studios started taking significant hits.
More people were opting to watch films in the comfort of their own homes, and big-budget television series were also becoming increasingly popular.
""The profit centre for most of the studios has for some time been in paid television, and paid television has kind of moved from established channels to streaming services,"" Dr Walsh said.
""The great thing about feature films is that they generate a lot of publicity when they first appear in cinemas, but then they cascade down to all the other platforms.
""That model is now under threat with so much content premiering on, or moving straight to, streaming services.""
As if to signify a changing of the guard, the ever-omnipotent production logos from the big studios have gone missing from some major productions.
Streaming services are creating and financing a huge amount of productions for television. (Supplied)
Their place is instead being taken by streaming companies distributing their own content.
""And the really interesting thing in the power of these long-established Hollywood companies is having to accommodate itself to the rise of streaming companies like Netflix and Amazon, which are really making a lot of content,"" Dr Walsh said.
""If you look at Disney, while they're making few films for theatrical release, they are still having to both make and acquire an enormous amount for their streaming service because that's where the action has moved to.""
A24's approach has struck a chord so strong with some they have tattooed its logo on their skin. (Instagram: @joe_george)
Dr Isaacs said a relatively new and highly visible logo was also emerging for independent entertainment company A24, which had a reputation for supporting unique and original ideas.
It has attracted a passionate fanbase proud of A24's independent mantra.
""What I've found astonishing, and which I've never encountered with other logos, there are audiences around the world currently tattooing themselves with the A24 logo as a signature of a new kind of studio mentality,"" Dr Isaacs said.
""It's a really new era.""

Australian ambassador to the US and former prime minister Kevin Rudd said it made him ""physically ill"" to see someone joking about violence.

""It's about the near-assassination of the former and prospective president of the United States … and it's about the murder of an innocent civilian and two people being seriously wounded.""
Mr Rudd spoke from the sidelines of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Trump has been officially confirmed as the Republican presidential nominee.
Black told his Instagram followers he no longer felt it was appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour and said: ""All future creative plans are on hold.""

In a statement, Gass said the line he improvised was ""highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake"".
The near-assassination of Donald Trump was a seminal moment in US history. Through multiple live streams, map data, and eyewitness videos, here's how the rally shooting played out over 11 minutes and 9 seconds.
He added that he did not condone violence of any kind.
A growing number of Australian politicians have criticised the comment, which has provoked global outrage.
Senior Liberal senator Anne Ruston told Channel Seven the comment was out of line and akin to inciting violence.
""There is absolutely no room in Australia for this kind of hate speech,"" she said. ""I don't care who you are.""
Lauren Rosewarne, a researcher in media, politics and popular culture at the University of Melbourne, said it was unclear if the band would recover from the comment.
""I'm not sure it's going to affect him one way or another,"" she said.

Don't worry, we've got you.
Actor Shannen Doherty died over the weekend from cancer, aged 53.
Shannen Doherty, who starred in Little House on the Prairie, Beverly Hills 90210, and Charmed, dies aged 53 following a cancer diagnosis.
Doherty — best known for starring in 90s staples including Charmed, Beverly Hills, 90210 and Heathers — has been remembered by a number of her peers and former co-stars.
In 90210, Doherty played Brenda Walsh, a teenager who moves to Beverly Hills from Minnesota, and is overwhelmed by the glitz and glamour. Throughout the series she is caught in a tumultuous love affair with bad boy Dylan.
Jason Priestley, who played Doherty's twin brother Brandon (yes, Brenda and Brandon) on the show, called the late actress a ""force of nature"".
Fellow 90210 co-star Jennie Garth (who played Brenda's frenemy Kelly) shared a tribute to Doherty on Instagram, describing her as ""one of the strongest people I have ever known"".
""She was courageous, passionate, determined and very loving and generous.""
In Charmed, Doherty played Prue Halliwell, the uptight eldest of the three Halliwell sisters. They are very cool 90s women living in San Francisco, who also happen to be witches living in a gothic house, trying to stop demons from infiltrating the modern world.
Rose McGowan — who joined the cast as half-sister Paige after Doherty was fired mid-series — acknowledged their lives ""had been intertwined in a unique way"".
""We laughed at dark forces who wanted us to hate each other, instead we chose love and respect,"" McGowan said.
Actor Olivia Munn, who shared earlier in the year that she underwent a hysterectomy as a part of breast cancer treatment, said she and Doherty bonded over their shared diagnosis.
""Looking back on the last text she sent me just a couple months ago, she asked how I was doing and if she could do anything for me…. True to form, Shannen was offering her support even though she was in the final stage of fighting this horrific disease,"" Munn said.

Last week, Katy Perry released 'Woman's World' from her upcoming album 143. This was meant to be the start of a new era, after the pop star sold her back catalogue for US$225 million ($332 million).
However, the comeback single and accompanying music video has been widely regarded as a flop, savaged in negative reviews from *deep breath* The Guardian, Pitchfork, Vulture, The Cut, The Music, Dazed, Consequence of Sound, and countless social media accounts.
Katy Perry — Woman's World
The criticisms largely centre on the song's cliched, outdated message of fempowerment, as well as labelling Perry a ""hypocrite"" for working with producer and co-writer Dr Luke, the hitmaker who recently settled a defamation lawsuit in which he was accused of drugging and raping Kesha (who released her own comeback song 'Joyride' last week).
In response to the backlash (or perhaps anticipating it), Perry has issued a clip, shot on the set of the 'Woman's World' music video, saying it was intended to be satirical.
""We're kind of just having fun being a bit sarcastic with it, it's very slapstick and very on the nose,"" she says.
The clip has already bombed, too, with Perry's posts on both X and Instagram flooded with negative comments. Most of them lean on the fact the 'Fireworks' singer forgot one of comedy's golden rules: If you have to explain that something is satire, then it might not be very good satire.

The tornado-chasing blockbuster is back, as Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones star in this hootin' and hollerin' tribute to the American heartland.
Actors Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell and director Lee Isaac Chung just wanted to promote their action blockbuster Twisters at the movie's LA premiere last week. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) had different ideas.
As Chung introduced the actors, a protester took to the stage to denounce the inclusion of scenes set at a rodeo.
""There's no excuse to promote the cruelty and the abuse and the whipping of animals,"" they yelled while resisting security's attempts to remove them, as seen in a clip shared on X (Twitter).
Other protesters were seen outside the theatre with signs urging people to ""lasso tornadoes, not animals"", think about the fact that ""calves' necks are twisted at rodeos"", and calling on Twisters' distributor, Universal Pictures, to ""stop glamorising rodeos"".
In a statement on its website, PETA said it wanted audiences to ""consider the exploitation behind the troubling rodeo scenes staged for [Twisters]"".
""Rodeos provoke and terrorise normally docile animals into appearing fierce and aggressive, using cruel electric prods, flank or bucking straps, and spurs — which burn, wound, or dig into their skin and sensitive tissue.
""Injuries and death are common for animals in these events … which is why this summer's biggest movie should condemn, not glamorise, this blood sport.
""PETA has urged Universal Pictures and the filmmakers to include a disclaimer in the movie's end credits to expose the cruelty inherent in rodeos … and to discourage audiences from attending them, but they've been silent.
What do we think PETA makes of the original 1996 movie Twister sucking a mooing cow up into a tornado?

On Friday at a concert in London, the legendary Stevie Nicks brought out Harry Styles to perform two songs in honour of her late Fleetwood Mac bandmate, Christine McVie.
McVie died suddenly in 2022, but would've turned 81 on Friday.
Nicks told the audience: ""Christine was Harry's girl, she was my girl, she was your girl, and she loved all of you, and today would've been her birthday.""
The duo performed 'Landslide' and 'Stop Dragging My Heart Around', and Styles wore a songbird pin in a nod to McVie's moving Rumours track.
Good luck not crying while you watch this one:
Stevie Nicks and Harry Styles perform together in London
This isn't the first time Nicks and Styles have performed together, with the duo's friendship beginning back in 2015 when the young pop star gifted his idol a hand-piped birthday cake.
But this was Styles's first public performance since he wrapped up Love on Tour in mid-2023, off the back of his Grammy Award-winning album Harry's House.
And some were shocked to see the ex-One Direction singer looking so darn grown up (with a mullet and moustache!).
But fam, he's 30. What do you expect? Even our (my) favourite boy band members inevitably become men. At least this one has great taste in 70s rock (and is still hot).

""There's only one thing stopping these men from infecting our hearts, souls and holes,"" is the unfortunate way host Abbie Chatfield lets us know that we're about to be accosted by a second series of FBoy Island, whether we like it or not.
The thing that will stop these apparently sick (?) men are the three ""independent"" women who are throwing themselves at the mercy of Binge's most eye-roll-inducing reality TV show.
Never heard of FBoy Island? Basically, they strand 24 dudes looking to kickstart their influencer careers on an island: half are FBoys (read: like to have a lot of sex and treat women badly) and half are ""genuinely"" looking for love. And it's up to three unobtainably beautiful women to sort one from the other.
If the gals get to the end and pick a nice guy, she and her beloved split a cash prize. But if they pick an FBoy, said boy walks away with all the moolah.
If that sounds like an awfully convoluted way to get dozens of hot people to get half-naked and scream at each other on camera then you would be correct.
But Chatfield has insisted this show is deeply tongue-in-cheek — they put the men in a house shaped like a penis, for instance — and a great place to host some ""teachable moments"" about misogyny.
""This isn't The Bachelor where the Bachelor is held to the highest regard. These are FBoys… they're getting called out and being exposed for who they really are,"" Chatfield told Punkee.
And audiences got on board the first time around, with season one even garnering a nomination for best reality show at the 2024 AACTAs, (it lost to MasterChef Australia).
The women competing in FBoy Island season two have now been revealed to be ""self-proclaimed corporate powerhouse"" and 2023 The Bachelors reject Krystal Thomas, Ally Woodfall — who reportedly already dated season one FBoy Vernon Lyon before he ghosted her — and Geelong-based model, Nicole Mitrov.
Check out the trailer for FBoy Island season two below if you're a fan of glistening flesh and keeping Australian reality TV crew in stable employment. The new season starts on August 5 on Binge.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-14/shannen-doherty-90210-charmed-star-dies/103796370,"Shannen Doherty, star of Beverly Hills, 90210 and Charmed, dies age 53","Shannen Doherty, who starred in Little House on the Prairie, Beverly Hills, 90210, and Charmed, has died aged 53, her publicist confirmed to People magazine.
""It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty,"" Doherty's publicist Leslie Sloane told People.
""On Saturday, July 13, she lost her battle with cancer after many years of fighting the disease.
""The devoted daughter, sister, aunt and friend was surrounded by her loved ones as well as her dog, Bowie.
""The family asks for their privacy at this time so they can grieve in peace.""
Doherty chose not to write a memoir. The closest thing was her ""guide to living life with style"" Badass, published in 2010.
Instead, she was busy documenting her life on the podcast Let's Be Clear with Shannen Doherty, after being diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer.
The actor was refreshingly frank on her podcast, which included several star guests.
Tori Spelling, her co-star on 90210 and daughter of Aaron Spelling — the producer who sacked Doherty twice — was her guest, with Doherty also appearing on Tori's own podcast, Misspelling.
Jason Priestley, who played her twin brother Brandon on 90210, was also a guest. As was Sarah Michelle Gellar, 90210 co-star Brian Austin Green, Charmed co-star Holly Marie Combs, Christina Ricci – all of whom went on to vouch for Doherty.
On one of the podcast episodes, Doherty answered questions from audience members, one of whom asked what the biggest misconception was about her that she would like to clear up.
""I think the biggest misconception about me is that I am … hmmm … a bitch,"" she laughed.
""I think that's probably the biggest one.
""I am definitely not a bitch. I am strong. And I'm smart. And I have an opinion.
""And if those things make me a bitch, there is something incredibly, incredibly wrong with this world and how they view women and what women are allowed to put out there.
""So, I don't really think that's on me. I think that's on society.""
On Misspelling, Doherty said her assertiveness on the set of Beverly Hills, 90210 would be applauded now — but back then she was considered a liability.

Doherty spoke about getting the boot from 90210 from Aaron Spelling, a man who she described as ""one of the most important, powerful, influential producers of that time period, ever"".
""I just remember Aaron never spoke to me, never having a conversation, just all of a sudden: 'Bam, you're fired Shannen,'"" Doherty told Green.
Green said the bad press Doherty used to get was unjustified.
""That was the first real example to me of sexism within the business,"" he said.
""And I used to say this to people all the time, I would say, you know, 'If a guy was acting like Shannen, he would be incredibly decisive with what he wants to do, very proud of his work, very up to fight for himself and he would just be hailed as this incredible professional on set'.
""'But because it's a woman doing it, you label her right away as a bitch.'
""And I was like, 'I don't get it.'
""I've always said to people you are an incredible example of someone that is … has always been incredibly kind. Always. To everyone. I've seen you around everybody.
""But at the same time, you're very good at balancing being kind with being sure of who you are and what you want and what is OK and what is not, and you will fight to the death for people.""
Green said he had never run into anyone who knows Doherty who had a bad word to say about her.
Doherty spoke on the podcast about disquiet on set.
When she was offered the cover of Rolling Stone and appeared on there with co-stars Jason Priestly and Luke Perry (who played her love interest Dylan McKay), she copped backlash from some of her other co-stars. (Perry died in 2019 after suffering a stroke.)
""Maybe it's because I'm female,"" Doherty said to Priestly on her podcast.
""But I remember when we did that cover, I had a bunch of cast members come into my dressing room and tell me how wrong it was that I did a cover of Rolling Stone without them and that I should have demanded that everybody be on the cover.
""And I was like 'a) I'm not in the position to tell Rolling Stone what to do, two, I have a career to worry about and what a huge honour to be asked to be on this magazine cover, so yeah, no that's your problem, that's not mine.'""
Priestly confirmed that he and Perry weren't pressured in this way.
""I think that that was a different day and age, right?"" Doherty said to Priestly.
""Men were paid more. You were paid more than me. You were number one on the call sheet, I was number two. And you were instantly deemed the quarterback and I think that was, particularly with Aaron, it was a very male mentality.""

Doherty told Green for the most part, she didn't enjoy doing press – it was exhausting and she would get asked the same questions over and over again.
""I think the expectation that was coming my way was that I should not be doing as much press as I was doing,"" Doherty said.
""And what nobody realised is that I didn't actually enjoy taking my weekends and going and doing photo shoots and doing publicity.
""But I had a network and I had producers who were telling me I had to go do it.""
Doherty was reluctant to work with Aaron Spelling again, but Combs convinced her to take a look at the script for Charmed given the director had sent it to Doherty himself.
Aaron Spelling, Doherty said, was enthusiastic about working with her on this next project and wasn't interested in talking about the fact that he had fired her from 90210 in what Doherty referred to on the podcast as an ""ugly situation"".
""But no, he didn't really want to discuss any of it. He just wanted us to move forward,"" Doherty said.

Doherty was drawn to Prue, the character she played on Charmed, partly because she was so different to the one she played on 90210.
""Brenda of 90210 … had so much teenage angst and made so many mistakes and was kind of selfish and self-serving in her own way,"" Doherty said.
""And Prue was the antithesis of that.
""She was all about her sisters and all about self-sacrifice, which I really liked as far as a career move and for me personally … I wanted to play a very solid, strong woman who put her sisters above everything else.""
But it wouldn't last, with Doherty once again fired from Charmed.
Doherty said the narrative that she had quit the show was assigned to her by other people. She never quit the show, she said — she was fired.
""One of the biggest myths out there was that I quit,"" Doherty said.
""I don't think that there's anybody in their right mind that would quit a hit show that's paying them a good amount of money, that they actually really enjoyed working on, which was my deal, I enjoyed it.""

Doherty was told by her representatives that her career would not survive another firing, so they would say she chose to leave.
Rumours would follow her anyway and her reputation, no matter how unfair, was something that preceded her.
Mallrats director Kevin Smith, who also appeared on Doherty's podcast, said he was warned about working with her, but the two got along famously.
Doherty's bad-girl reputation took its toll.
""I can be painfully shy and very self-conscious and things hurt me, really deep,"" she said on her podcast.
""I don't have thick skin and particularly since 2015 when I diagnosed with cancer, those walls that protected me from negative comments all sort of came down.
""And with them down, I sometimes often feel like I don't have a coat of armour anymore and that can be beautiful, but it can also be detrimental.""",MBy Mawunyo Gbogbo,Sun 14 Jul,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-13/japan-anime-creatives-manga-animation-report/104048050,Behind the screens: Japanese anime creators reveal a billion-dollar industry in crisis,"Yesterday we explored how Japanese anime transformed from a niche subculture into a billion-dollar industry adored by millions of kids worldwide.
While researching the story, we spoke to a number of Japanese artists and producers who work behind the scenes on anime films and spoke at length about some of the challenges that anime's booming popularity has placed on the industry.
How Japan used animation and soft power to rebrand itself from WWII aggressor to peddler of fantasies and dreams.
""I'm glad that the industry is expanding, but it comes at a price,"" Japanese animator Nishii Terumi says.
""We currently don't have enough manpower to sustain this level of production.""
In a report published earlier this year by the Nippon Anime & Film Culture Association (NAFCA), an organisation aimed at improving conditions in the anime industry, hundreds of creatives complained of ultra-long working hours, persistently low incomes, and an inability to pass on skills of the trade to younger generations.
""If things continue like this, [skills] will eventually stagnate and the anime industry may collapse,"" NAFCA concluded about the surveys findings.
Here's what some of those involved in creating Japanese anime films told us about life behind the scenes, their perceptions of the global fascination with anime, as well as some of the challenges facing the industry now and in the future.

Having worked in the anime industry for more than 25 years, Nishii Terumi says many animators — including herself — often remained unaware of just how big Japanese anime had become around the world until the rise of social media.
""Animators are usually just confined to their desks,"" Nishii tells the ABC, speaking generally about the industry rather than any specific production studio.

""They draw, they submit their drawings, and then they draw more.
""It's a very, very closed environment —  and they're often not really that concerned with anything happening outside of that.""
Nishii — whose resume includes work on Pokemon and One Piece films —   says that it was through Facebook that she first noticed just how far anime had spread around the world.
""There were a lot of Facebook groups where anime fans from all around the world interact with each other,"" she recalls.
Nishii was first drawn into the world of anime back in high school, when she watched Evangelion Neon Genesis for the first time.
She went on to become an animator and character designer, with credits in well-known productions including Rurouni Kenshin, Jujutsu Kaisen and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
Nishii Terumi live drawing Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
In those days, Nishii says anime was somewhat of a ""taboo topic"" frowned down on in Japan due to its association with consumerism and fandom culture, known as Otaku.
While internationally Otaku usually refers to enthusiastic fans, in Japan it carried negative connotations — particularly back in the 1980s and 1990s — that leaned more towards obsession and isolation from society.
""Directors and animators weren't really featured in interviews … there was a condescending attitude towards fans and anime itself in Japan,"" she says.
But Nishii — who was involved in the creation of NAFCA which conducted the survey and which she describes as a ""sort of labour union of animators"" — says that growing fandom around the world has led to an increase in interest in those working behind the scenes.
""Now finally, the people behind the craft [of anime] are being put front and centre [and] are no longer being looked down upon.""
Akira's mature and dystopian themes intrigued Western audiences.
While many anime fans around the world see Japanese anime as having distinct characteristics featuring mature themes or violence, these perceptions are often in contrast to how creatives see their own work.
Yoshida Ken, an anime producer and head of computer graphics company Picona Creative Studio, says foreign perceptions of Japanese anime's ""uniqueness"" are often different to Japanese perceptions.

""Overseas producers will come and say 'we want something typically Japanese' — usually meaning something violent or horror-oriented,"" Yoshida says.
Initially inspired by Pixar Animations, Yoshida — who has been in the industry for over a decade now — has worked on a number of animes that have had huge international success such as Chainsaw man and Dorohedoro.
""For example, Dragon Ball Z was considered a violent cartoon when it was broadcast in English speaking regions,"" Yoshida continues.
Yoshida thinks that it's an ""absence of taboo"" or censorship in the Japanese cartoon world that potentially leads to these perceptions, rather than a specific fascination with an isolated mature theme.

""Cartoons in other countries often have [limitations], such as no sex, or no violence or religion,"" he says.
The perception of Japanese anime as being risque or violent equally perplexes Nishii, who wonders why non-Japanese artists and cultures ever prohibited themselves from exploring similar themes themselves.

""Fans tell me how Japanese anime can be enjoyed by adults, that they're not as simplistic as animations in other parts of the world,"" Nishii says.
""It seems like the most natural thing when you have an expressive art form and people who want to express themselves through it.""
But despite anime now generating billions every year as some of the world's biggest media franchises — for example Pokemon is bigger than Star Wars, Barbie and Harry Potter combined — Japanese creatives surveyed from within the industry maintain it's in a state of crisis.
And it's a number of unaddressed factors — long hours, underpayment, a lack of proper training, labour shortages — that have contributed to the situation.
The NAFCA report found that anime creatives work hours 30 per cent longer than the national median for a median salary slightly less than minimum wage — while others reported working up to 84 hours a week, or for salaries well below the minimum wage.
""We're now in dire straits where people in management are scouting social media for young and inexperienced people who like to draw [to work on anime productions],"" Nishii says.
""Those people are then underpaid because their work doesn't meet the industry standards, which then leads to veterans being brought in to correct the work instead of allocating resources to train them properly.""

His journey into the world of anime began during high school after watching Studio Ghibli's Howl's Moving Castle, which he says ""really inspired me to become an animator"".
Driven by passion, Vann started to post his drawings on social media, which he says were discovered by a Japanese producer leading to his ""dream come true"" commercial debut in the series Fate/Grand Order.
""Surprisingly, that's how you get hired these days if you want to work in the anime industry,"" Vann says, before adding how he soon found out anime doesn't pay well.
""It's common for new animators to join the industry for less than three years, because they can't survive, especially in Tokyo.""
Vann says a ""newbie"" can often get paid as low as $40 to draw a very complicated scene, adding that if they don't know how to negotiate, they arrangement can often be exploited.
""But a lot of people stick to working [through it] because of the love of the craft,"" he says
Vann says he is working on Japanese anime productions to level-up skills. (Supplied: Vann Oba)
In terms of the future of anime, both Nishii and Yoshida say they believe anime may no longer be something exclusively Japanese in the future, as more countries enter the creative space, potentially looking to tell stories of their own culture.
""Many anime fans come to Japan from overseas to learn, and then go back to develop the anime industry in their home countries,"" Nishii says.
Such an arrangement is Vann's dream plan — currently drawing for big anime titles including Attack on Titan and Jujutsu Kaisen, Vann says he is trying to upskill himself as much as possible.
Clips from Flavors of Youth — a  2018 Japanese-Chinese anime co-production.
""[My dream is to] establish my own studio that can compete with the international studios,"" he says.
""I've never been to Japan, but hopefully I will one day.""
Yoshida explains how traditionally Japanese animations were produced ""by Japanese companies, for Japanese audiences"", but international co-productions appear to be the direction the industry is heading towards.
But some maintain that the issues highlighted by NAFCA and plaguing the industry must be urgently addressed in order to ensure a healthy and sustainable future for workers.
""We are trying to convince politicians to do something about the current situation,"" Nishii says.

Now, 28 years later, the epic collaboration is no longer a cartoonish work of fiction.
The hip hop group teamed up with classical musicians to put on a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London on Wednesday night.
""It's a dream come true, a collaboration only The Simpsons could have predicted,"" the band said in a statement announcing the show in March.
Here's a few snippet from the show shared on Cypress Hill's Instagram account:
The band appeared on an episode of The Simpsons called Homerpalooza (for anyone wanting to look it up, it's season 7, episode 24).
Homerpalooza first aired in May, 1996.
It features a scene backstage at a fictional music festival where cartoon iterations of Cypress Hill find themselves collaborating with the London Symphony Orchestra.
The scene went for less than a minute, but it had a lasting impact.
""It's been something that we've talked about for many years since The Simpsons episode first aired,"" Cypress Hill's B-Real told UK broadcaster the BBC.
The concert came years after the band and the orchestra joked about the idea on social media.
Cypress Hill tweeted a quote from the episode, to which the London Symphony Orchestra's official account replied: ""We mostly play classical… but we'll give it a shot.""
The concert was a long time in the making.  (X: @cypresshill, @londonsymphony)

The song is called Higher and is an ode to the Olympians who will compete at the Games from July 26 – August 11.
The singer recently debuted the song at the Prime Minister's Olympic and Paralympic dinner in Melbourne.
""It's an absolute honour to lend my voice in support of our incredible Aussie athletes,"" Mauboy said in a statement.
Mauboy will travel to Paris to cheer on Australian athletes and will perform Higher at the launch of the Australian Olympic Committee's Flag Bearer Ceremony on Wednesday July 24, set to be held at the French Mint (Accueil Monnaie de Paris).
It all began when musician and producer Will Hyde approached the Australian Olympic Committee to develop the creative project.

Australian athletes were invited to shape the theme, spirit and lyrical content of the song, which was written by Shannon Busch (known professionally as WILSN), and producer Stephen Mowat.
Chair of the Australian Olympic Committee and four-time Olympian Cate Campbell can't speak more highly of the song.
""Lyrically it speaks to the reality of an Olympian's path to the Games and melodically, it's a killer track,"" she said in a statement.
""It's uplifting and a great chorus — I can just see our Olympic athletes in Paris belting this out, some better than others.""
One person who won't have any trouble belting out the song and hitting all the right notes is Mauboy, who will also deliver a special performance of Higher during the homecoming ceremony on August 14.
Mauboy is the first Indigenous Australian artist to debut at number one on the ARIA Album Chart.
Her awards include an AACTA Award, APRA Award, Australian of the Year Award, MTV Europe Music Award, and MTV Australia Music Award.
She's also starred in numerous TV and film roles including The Sapphires, Bran Nue Dae and Windcatcher and was a coach on The Voice Australia in 2021, 2022 and 2023.

Most recently, she's toured the globe as the host of Madonna's Celebration world tour — capped off by performing to a crowd of 1.6 million in Rio de Janeiro — and is set to compete later this year in US reality hit The Traitors.
But first, the Georgia-raised, LA-based comedian, podcaster, rapper and activist is heading Down Under for the global debut of her stand-up tour This Is Wild!
ABC Entertainment caught up with Bob to talk Madonna's tour, deranged TikTok content, how Kendrick Lamar won the feud with Drake, and a whole lot more.

I know this is odd — everyone always goes ""what?"" when I say this, but I really like Adelaide. It has a really cool bar called Marys Poppin, and the drag scene there is pretty vibrant and fun. I know most people say Sydney, but I like Adelaide. Isn't that weird?
It's the most welcoming place I've been for the queens who stop by. They really roll out the red carpet for you in Adelaide.
I do and I'm not gonna tell you. I will NEVER divulge that information.
I'm in the part of TikTok where the Royal Guards' horses are biting people at Buckingham Palace. If you stand too close to the horses, they will bite you. And I absolutely love it. It's my favourite micro-genre on TikTok. For sure.
It's videos of tourists. There's a giant sign that says ""Do not stand near the horses. They will bite you, they will hit you. Do not bother these horses,"" and people just ignore it. They stand there anyway and then the horses bite them. Sometimes they get hurt, sometimes they don't.
And honestly? I don't care if they get hurt. Don't bother these horses! The horses are already literal slaves to the Empire, forced to work, and getting paid in oats. Leave these horses alone! So, I don't feel bad for the people who got bit by the horses.
Jared, this is … I am young. What do you mean ""young""?!
There we go [laughs]. Ask the question again. I was so thrown off by that I couldn't even listen.
Being a big gay drag queen is something that seventh-grade me would've been like 'That is CRINGE, everyone knows you're gay? That's crazy!'
But deep down, seventh-grade me would have been like, 'That is the coolest thing that you're so you, you're so yourself. That's amazing.'
The minimal make-up — no make-up, flat flat wigs, wet hair, jeans, T-shirts. It's not for me. I don't find it particularly inspiring, if I'm going to be honest. And I feel like I can be honest with you, Jared.
Right now, it is 'Not Like Us' by Kendrick Lamar. I listen to this song every single day, multiple times a day. It is the first time in the history of my Spotify I will ever have a straight cis man in my top artists of the year EVER. But this song is truly brilliant.
'Not Like Us' is a diss to Drake. It's just truly a masterpiece, a masterclass in ""fuck around and find out"".
Kendrick Lamar — Not Like Us
My favourite lyric is: ""I went from rags to riches/by straight gagging bitches/if I'm on Twitter talking shit/then I am tagging bitches"" [from 'Bitch Like Me'].
I also love: ""I take what I want/gimme gimme gimme/more late nights/than a n**** named Jimmy"" [from 'Bitch Like Me'].
The reason why I love those lyrics? Obviously, I work late nights — I'm a drag queen — but also there are two late-night talk show hosts named Jimmy: Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel. I don't know many people pick up on that, but I'm really proud of that line, too.
Bob the Drag Queen — Bitch Like Me

Madonna has never given me any advice. That's not part of our dynamic, offering me advice. I've learned lessons just from watching her and being around her, but she's never been like, ""You want some advice, kid?""
[But I've taken away that] she's a really hard worker. I love how much she really believes in her art, what she puts out and onto the stage, and how much thought she puts into what she's creating. She's the hardest worker I've ever seen in my life. Truly.
If you want to have a really light conversation, I would say, ""Which power would you want?"" and I give them some options — but each one comes with a benefit and a detriment.
So, you can fly, but flying is twice as exhausting as running. So you can't fly from LA to New York, and you also can't fly faster than you can run. So it will take you like a week-and-a-half to get to New York and you will be completely exhausted just from flying one block. Or, you can be invisible. But as long as you're invisible, when you re-appear, you are going to be completely unconscious for that amount of time.

I don't really like re-watching shows, there's only one show I've ever re-watched: Breaking Bad. Other than that, I watch shows once and experience them for what they were — I'll go back and watch the moments, and I've only re-watched Drag Race for work, to review it for a podcast or something. But I have a good memory. I'm like, ""I got it in there. It's in there. I'm good.""
But I do love making people watch The Color Purple. Introducing The Color Purple to people for the first time is just one of my favourite things to do. It is such a brilliant film.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-10/alec-baldwin-rust-trial-jury-chosen/104079610,The 12 jurors who will decide Alec Baldwin's fate have been chosen. Here's what we know so far,"Five men and 11 women, making up 12 jurors and four alternates, will decide the fate of Alec Baldwin after being selected for jury duty by Santa Fe County special prosecutors and the actor's team of defence attorneys.
Judge Mary Marlowe Summer swore them in, telling them to avoid news about the case.
They will report to the court on Wednesday, local time.
Getting chosen for the trial of a major Hollywood star is unusual even in Los Angeles, but it is essentially unheard of in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where Mr Baldwin's trial is taking place.
The actor and his wife Hilaria Baldwin were among those watching in the courtroom when 70 prospective jurors were questioned on Tuesday about numerous issues including their knowledge of the case and attitudes toward gun experts.

The jury will decide whether actor Alec Baldwin, 66, committed a felony while on the set of the Western film Rust at Bonanza Creek Ranch, about 29 kilometres from where the trial is being held.
In October 2021, Mr Baldwin was pointing a revolver at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins as she set up a camera shot inside a movie-set church, when the gun went off, killing her and injuring director Joel Souza.
In an interview with ABC America in December 2021, Mr Baldwin told George Stephanopoulos he did not pull the trigger.
Legal analysts and firearms specialists initially expected Mr Baldwin's case to be focused on whether he should have inspected the gun after being told it was ""cold"", which is an industry term meaning a gun is empty or contains inert, dummy rounds.
But by saying he pulled back the hammer, not the trigger, Mr Baldwin sent prosecutors and defence lawyers down the road of forensic firearms testing.
The New Mexico film shoot in 2021 was a quick one – only 21 days to film more than 130 scenes — but the fallout continues three years later, with a new chapter about to play out in court.
The gun in question is a symbol of the American Wild West, a Colt .45 Peacemaker revolver.
Mr Baldwin said he cocked the reproduction 1873 Single Action Army pistol before it fired a live round.
Santa Fe police tested Mr Baldwin's claims, with an FBI examination finding the gun worked normally and would not fire a round without the trigger being pulled.
State prosecutors filed charges after that, alleging Mr Baldwin was lying about not pulling the trigger.
Mr Baldwin's legal team said last year that the Italian-made Pietta gun's full-cock notch had been filed down, making it easier to fire, allowing a mechanical failure or ""accidental discharge"" without the trigger being pulled.
They provided photographic evidence of the filed-down revolver.
Convinced the gun was modified, prosecutors dropped charges last year, only for the grand jury to reinstate them in January after an independent firearms expert confirmed the findings of the FBI examination.
The FBI destroyed the gun during testing, with the actor's lawyers saying they were left with no way to prove it was modified.
Earlier this week, the judge in the case ruled Mr Baldwin's role as a producer on Rust could not be linked to Hutchins' death.
Prosecutors had argued he was the de facto boss on the set and responsible for overall firearm safety.
The evidence, which includes images and video from crew and a set photographer, shows Mr Baldwin pointed his gun at a crew member and fired a blank round, held his finger on the trigger when not supposed to and engaged in horseplay with the weapon.
Armourer Hannah Gutierres was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March for mistakenly loading a live round into Mr Baldwin's gun.
She received the maximum 18-month sentence.
First assistant director Dave Halls accepted blame in a plea deal, acknowledging he did not check the rounds in the gun. He was given a six-month suspended sentence after being convicted on a misdemeanour charge.
Mr Baldwin has been a major Hollywood figure for 35 years, starring in 30 Rock and The Hunt for Red October.
Hutchins' death was the first on-set shooting fatality in Hollywood in three decades and momentarily led to calls by some for an end to the widespread use of real firearms on film sets.
Hutchins was considered a rising star in film photography. She was 42.
The trail is expected to last until July 19.

We've got the antidote: what you missed in entertainment news recently.
You could barely hear John Cena over the sound of distraught fans as the actor/wrestler announced his retirement from World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) over the weekend.
Cena delivered a heartfelt speech at the WWE's Money in the Bank event in Toronto, saying his final competition will be in 2025.
""I've been doing this for a while, I've been in WWE for two decades and in that time I've seen incredible waves of prosperity … and I've also seen tremendous hardship,"" he said.
Cena told reporters after the event that he feels physically ""at my end"", but that doesn't mean he needs to distance himself from the sport he loves.
The 47-year-old was contracted into the WWE in 2001, originally performing under the moniker Doctor of Thuganomics, a rapper character decked out in gold chains and a backwards hat who challenged his wrestling opponents to rap battles.
Cena made the leap to acting in 2006, starring in action movie The Marine. Since then he's starred in studio comedies including Blockers, played the Peacemaker in multiple DC productions, and most recently starred alongside Zac Efron as the title character in Ricky Stanicky and as a Fak brother in season three of The Bear.
On Sunday, Cena promised fans a farewell tour before he hangs up his shorts, and said he would remain involved with the wrestling franchise that launched his career.
In addition to being a 16-time WWE champion, as of 2022 Cena also holds the Guinness World Record for Most Wishes Granted through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, at an eye-watering 650 wishes granted.
Let's hear it one last time for a real one.

We've brought you far too much bad news about music festivals lately, so it's exciting to instead report on the return of a beloved event.
It's been a long three-year hiatus but Big Pineapple Festival is back, juicier and plumper than ever.
Sunshine Coast's Big Pineapple Music Festival has had a few years off, but it is bucking the trend of festival collapse as seen with the likes of Splendour in the Grass and Groovin the Moo, and will return in fine style this October.
The line-up is suitably big and juicy, packed with some of our country's finest across a broad range of genres.
Its six headliners speak to the breadth of Australian music, with metalcore faves The Amity Affliction, pop superstar Tones and I, hip hop legends Bliss n Eso, electronic party starters Golden Features and Peking Duk, and indie pop wonder Vera Blue leading the charge.
The Big Pineapple itself has had a big face lift lately, and a party of this magnitude seems the perfect way to celebrate the old girl's new lease on life. It all goes down on Saturday October 19.

Do not cross Kendrick Lamar. His feud with Canadian star Drake has been the biggest thing to happen to rap music in recent memory.
After widely being declared the winner with the release of chart-topping diss track 'Not Like Us', the Compton MC enjoyed a victory lap last month, performing the song five times in a row at a hometown concert celebrating the LA rap scene on Juneteenth (a holiday to commemorate the emancipation of enslaved people in the US).
On the Fourth of July (America's ""White holiday""), Lamar released the video for 'Not Like Us', which hits like a figurative victory lap on Drake's grave.
A lot of Compton folks turned out for the proverbial wake, chanting and vibing in the clip, which was directed by Lamar and long-time collaborator Dave Free and has racked up more than 32.5 million views since it was released.
Kendrick Lamar — Not Like Us
The video has cameos from LA locals, some of which are strategically targeting Drake, including Tommy the Clown (who invented the ""clowning"" dance style, later known as ""krumping"") and NBA star DeMar DeRozan (who used to play for Drake's home team, the Toronto Raptors).
There's way more artfully shot, symbolic jabs at Drake than we have space to unpack here, but let's go over some of the highlights.
In the first verse, Lamar accuses Drake of being a ""certified paedophile"" and a lot of the crowd scenes are filmed outside the Compton Courthouse. Kendrick is also shown skipping across a hopscotch court during the lyric, ""It's probably A minorrrrr.""
Lamar's fiancée, Whitney Alford, and their children, Uzi and Enoch, appear in a sequence happily dancing, countering allegations made by Drake of domestic abuse and illegitimate children.
Lamar is also shown hammering a piñata shaped like an owl – the logo of Drake's record label, OVO – and the video concludes with him staring down a real-life owl placed inside a cage.
At this point, we can well and truly consider the coffin nailed shut.

Have you kept track of how many releases The Wiggles have put out? It's hard to believe (and even harder to fact check) but the iconic children's entertainers are set to drop what they're calling their 100th album next month.
It's titled Wiggle and Learn: 100 Education Songs for Children, and will feature ONE HUNDRED classic and new songs. Wow.
The Australian children's entertainment juggernaut began with just four guys in 1991 and, after winning triple j's Hottest 100 in 2021, has since grown to include a roster of eight Wiggles (including Caterina Mete, who recently gave birth to identical twin girls) and their loveable associates (shout out to The Tree of Wisdom).
The group is currently doing a string of shows in smaller venues (my two-year-old checked out Friday's gig at St Kilda's Palais Theatre and her review was to the point: ""I saw The Wiggles. They opened [what? unclear]. Can I see them again tomorrow?"").
But children and their carers can also catch the group live in arenas across the country at the end of the year for their Wiggle and Learn BIG SHOW! (not my caps, all theirs).

Don't worry if you have no idea what any of that really means. The TL;DR is: Australian high society descended on the Great Hall of Parliament House mid-last week for the annual Midwinter Ball, at which politicians and their partners cosplay being American, dressed in their black-tie finest.
And for some reason, Canadian fashion commentator Derek Guy — better known as ""The Menswear Guy""/@dieworkeek on X/Twitter — decided to pay attention. This was despite, by his own admission, not knowing anything about Australian politics.
No one was safe from his critique. Not the Nationals leader David Littleproud, not Treasurer Jim Chalmers, and *definitely* not Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

He invited 1,200 guests including former world leaders, tech tycoons and Bollywood's megastars — and was treated to a performance by Rihanna.
Billionaire Mukesh Ambani is kickstarting big fat Indian wedding celebrations for his son Anant Ambani who is set to marry his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant.
The guest list for March's pre-wedding bash included Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and former leaders of Canada and Qatar — as well as Bollywood's A-list stars Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone.
Akon and Diljit Dosanjh, a Punjabi singer who shot to international fame when he performed at Coachella, also took the stage.
It was only the start of the couple's months-long lavish pre-wedding celebrations.
In May, the family took guests on a three-day pre-wedding cruise from Italy to France.
The cruise experience reportedly included a DJ set from David Guetta, Katy Perry belting out her hit song Firework and a performance by Pitbull to cap it off.
The wedding is set for next week, with 29-year-old Anant Ambani marrying his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant in what many have dubbed the wedding of the year.

The father of the groom is 66-year-old Mukesh Ambani.
Mr Ambani is currently the world's ninth richest man with a net worth of $US116 billion ($AU171.83 billion), according to Forbes. He is also the richest person in Asia.
His Reliance Industries energy conglomerate reports over $US100 billion in annual revenue.
The Ambani family owns — among other assets — a 27-storey private apartment building named Antilia, worth $US1 billion, in Mumbai.
The building has three helipads, a 160-car garage, a private movie theatre, a swimming pool and a fitness centre.
Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani has hosted a lavish ""open house"" party at his opulent new skyscraper residence, believed to be the world's most expensive private home.
Ambani's critics say his company has flourished mainly because of political connections during the Congress governments in the 1970s and 80s and subsequently under Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rule from 2014 onwards.
They say ""crony capitalism"" in India has helped certain corporations, such as Mr Ambani's, thrive.
The family patriarch has started passing the torch to his two sons and daughter.
The eldest Ambani son, Akash Ambani, is now the chairperson of the family telecommunications business Reliance Jio.
Mr Ambani's daughter, Isha, oversees the family's retail operations.
The groom Anant, the youngest, has been inducted into the new energy business.
Anant Ambani has a bachelor's degree from Brown University, according to Reliance Industries' website, and oversees the conglomerate's renewable and green energy expansion.

He also runs a 1,200-hectare animal rescue centre called Vantara in Gujarat state's Jamnagar, the family's hometown where guests in March spent days celebrating at the extravagant pre-wedding party.
The bride — 29-year-old Radhika Merchant — is the daughter of pharmaceutical tycoon Viren Merchant and the marketing director for his company Encore Healthcare, according to Vogue.
She told the magazine she and her groom were introduced through mutual friends in 2017.
""That first meeting just sparked something special between us, and it wasn't long before we started dating,"" she said.
The main wedding ceremony is set for July 12, followed by a grand reception on July 14, according to local media.
Celebrations are expected to be split between the Ambani's Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai city and their family home.
The dates were reportedly chosen based on the couple's birth charts, as is typical in Hindu custom, and deemed auspicious.
Also keeping with tradition, the wedding will be preceded by days of traditional wedding events and rituals.
On Friday, videos from the couple's Sangeet began circulating on social media.
Sangeet is a ceremony where the bride and groom's families perform dances for the guests.
The Ambani ceremony also included performances by Bollywood stars including Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh and Salman Khan — as well as Justin Bieber, who flew to Mumbai for the event, according to local media.

The family also organised a mass wedding for more than 50 underprivileged couples last week, as part of the pre-wedding celebrations.
Extravagant parties are the Ambanis' specialty and next week's events are expected to draw more celebrities, billionaires and world leaders.
In 2018, when his daughter married, Mr Ambani made headlines for organising grand celebrations — including a performance from Beyoncé.
At the time, former US secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among those who rubbed shoulders with Indian celebrities and Bollywood stars in the western Indian city of Udaipur.

Landau worked closely with director James Cameron on the 1997 blockbuster Titanic, about the infamous 1912 maritime disaster.
Titanic was the first movie to gross $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) in global box-office earnings and won 11 Oscars, including best picture.
""I can't act and I can't compose and I can't do visual effects, so I guess that's why I'm producing,"" Landau said while accepting the award with Cameron.
The two also worked together on the 2009 film Avatar and its 2022 sequel Avatar: The Way of Water.

""A part of myself has been torn away,"" Cameron said in a statement.
""His zany humour, personal magnetism, great generosity of spirit and fierce will have held the centre of our Avatar universe for almost two decades.
Landau started out as a production manager in the 1980s, working his way up to co-producer on the 1989 film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and 1990's Dick Tracy.
Landau became a top executive at Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment and in 2009 their sci-fi epic Avatar surpassed the box-office success of Titanic, becoming the top-grossing film of all time.

""Jon was a visionary whose extraordinary talent and passion brought some of the most unforgettable stories to life on the big screen,"" he said in a statement.
""His remarkable contributions to the film industry have left an indelible mark, and he will be profoundly missed.
Born in New York on July 23, 1960, Landau was the son of the late film producers Ely and Edie Landau.

Since taking the wheel in 2016 for Mediterranean's second season, Captain Sandy has become an unlikely star of the dramatic Bravo-verse. She's a conflict-resolver rather than a starter, who steers her ship (and young, excitable crew) straight, all in the name of professional luxury service.
With the ninth season currently airing and the captain landing in Sydney for a short stay, ABC Entertainment sat down with her for a rapid-fire round of questions. All aboard!
It's unbelievable. It's been a journey.
I feel like when you're given this beautiful platform, you have a job — not just filming, it is staying engaged with your fans. Giving back, because they take their time and watch your show. Answering their questions.
You know, I'm not great at social media. Because I'm older, I'm not the social media person. I do my best. But the emails, the letters that come? I answer.
I began the show in 2016 with [Rajabi]. I met Leah three seasons in [and] I used to talk to her about Leah. She's followed our journey, and we became more like sisters. She was the one we wanted [to officiate].
Everybody that's watched the show has also watched my journey with Leah. So why not share that beautiful moment — and show people that two women can fall in love? And, for those people who are struggling to come out or not feel comfortable, that it's OK. Once you accept yourself, it's easier for others.
Stay out of the shark's house!
There's been a few shark attacks in Florida, and my sister sent me this [video]. This woman is so funny.
Stay Outta The Shark's House
Great people. Always a can-do attitude. Just kind, fun, hard workers. Focused. And I've had a lot of Australian crew before Below Deck: Med!
One at a time, right? So, deal with one, move on to the next, deal with that one, move on to the next.
It's [also] experience, age — you learn how to manoeuvre through situations to keep people motivated. So that comes with time.
For me, it's pausing. I use a [safety] stop, like in diving. Take a breath, don't react or respond. Rise above it. Don't make a decision quickly, take time. Pause. That's the big one. Think about the impact.
During filming, I retreat to my cabin, listen to music or I read a book — well, a few chapters if I can, but I'm going to say more music.
Oh my gosh, sometimes it's Cee-Lo's F*** You. *Laughs*
I love Southern rock. I love Pink. Adele, country music. Leah, my love, she sings — sometimes it's her cover of Put a Little Love in Your Heart, the Dolly Parton song.
Historian David McCullough's book The Path between the Seas won the 1978 US National Book Award in History. (Touchstone)
It's called The Path Between the Seas. It is about the making of the Panama Canal.
The undertaking blows my mind — how back in the day, people risked their lives to discover locations, to figure out where to slice a canal in this land that could kill you, because it's a jungle.
And how the [French and United States] governments paid to ship these people out there to figure out a place to put the Panama Canal. It's fascinating to me.
Jacques Cousteau put it so well. Let me look up the quote:
""The sea, once it cast its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever.""
It's really true.
[What] you see on TV, we're chartering, we're busy. But that is just a small part of what we do. When we do [ship] deliveries, it's just a crew. You drive this boat out into the blackest of night on the ocean — and you see the stars come up, then the Moon rises, and it's flat, calm.
Those moments are, 'This is why I'm doing this'. It's not all the chaotic stuff that we do. It's those moments that we have at sea together.
I just spent a day with two former crew I had back in 2002. They got married, they met on board, and we talked about all the times that we did our crossings. Every memory we had that we talked about was together — it wasn't with guests. It's those moments.
I just did a video for Leah. *Shows a video of herself smiling and then talking to someone off-camera* But you said photo!
Captain Sandy's last photo in her phone? A snap with Jessica Rowe. (Supplied)
I like the weather — as captains, we read the weather all the time. I was reading about weather trends historically — say I come here [to Sydney] for the first time, [I ask] 'What is the trend here?'.  So I was Googling the weather trends for here.
I just like to know. It's pretty cool — but all my friends are like 'not the weather again!'

The release date of the highly-anticipated screen adaptation of the Tony and Grammy Award-winning Broadway musical Wicked has been moved forward five days to November 22.
It was initially slated to hit theatres the day before Thanksgiving in the US, which this year falls on November 28.
Official Wicked trailer.
The shift means it won't face off against Moana 2, the sequel to one of Disney's most successful films in recent years.
It also means the musical will be released on the same day as Ridley Scott's gritty Gladiator 2.
From the dazzling facade of Emerald City to the brutal showdowns inside the Coliseum, the two films couldn't be more different in tone.
So it's no wonder the double feature is already drawing comparisons to the Barbenheimer double billing.
When Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer were both scheduled to hit theatres on the same day in July last year, it created a cultural phenomenon that grew to a scale no-one could have predicted.
Barbie and Oppenheimer both saw huge success at the box office. (AP: Warner Bros Pictures/Universal Pictures )
Dubbed Barbenheimer – as Oppenbarbie doesn't quite roll off the tongue – the hype around the strikingly different films releasing at the same time gave each flick a substantial boost at the box office, with many cinemagoers buying tickets for a double feature.
The sheer amount of memes and online conversation – do you watch Barbie first then debrief with the girls over drinks before heading into Oppenheimer? – created advertising that money can't buy.
Barbie became the highest-grossing film of last year, netting $1.4 billion globally at the box office.
More staggeringly, Oppenheimer – a three-hour biographical film about the creator of the atomic bomb – became the third highest-grossing film of 2023 with $975 million worldwide.
So far, the only film to gross over $1 billion at the global box office this year is Disney's Inside Out 2.
Universal Studios, which produced both Barbie and Oppenheimer, is also the studio behind Wicked, so it will no doubt be hoping for a similar outcome.
And fans are already getting into the meme-able spirit.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
ABC News Breakfast's resident film critic Zak Hepburn says ""it's a very good question"".
""It's going to be a very interesting experience to see if Hollywood can recapture that lightning in a bottle moment where two very different films collided at the box office with Barbie and Oppenheimer,"" he told ABC News.
Just three weeks after its release, Barbie has collected more than $1 billion at the global box office — and it's on track to become the biggest movie of the year.
""I don't think you can manufacture that sort of cultural impact that those two films had.
""They were sort of going along their regular release path and then the Internet decided that they were meme-worthy and then culture was created.
""So it's possible, and Hollywood does love a sequel.
""But I'm unsure yet if it's going to have the same impact. If any films can do it, it's certainly Gladiator 2 and Wicked.""
Earlier this year, Universal's international distribution president Veronika Kwan Vandenberg told news agency AFP that the organic nature of the Barbenheimer's joint success is ""an incredibly hard thing to do"".
But that hasn't stopped Wicked's director Jon M Chu from leaning into the trend, sharing a meme on social media with the famous Gladiator line ""are you not entertained?"" and the hashtag #Wickediator — though ""Glicked"" seems to be getting more traction online.
Wicked's legacy cannot be understated.
Since it began in 2003, the show has become one of the longest-running Broadway productions of all time.
It's been seen by nearly 65 million people around the world and surpassed the billion-dollar milestone years ago in 2016.
The production explores the untold story of the witches in Oz long before Dorothy crashes into town on a tornado.

The film adaption will see artist Ariana Grande step into the role of Glinda, with Grammy and Tony Award-winning performer Cynthia Erivo playing Elphaba.
Meanwhile, Gladiator 2 is a sequel to the 2000 film that starred Australia's Russell Crowe, and this time will spotlight Paul Mescal (Normal People) and Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us).
""Hollywood loves to counter programme and that's certainly what we're seeing here,"" Hepburn says.
Counter programming is when the film industry releases two very different products or narratives at the same time to offset each other.
""I think Gladiator 2 is going to be the victor purely on the fact that it has the incredible star power of Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal and also Denzel Washington,"" Hepburn says.
Hepburn adds that Gladiator already has an established legacy in cinema, and that the passion Broadway fans have for the stage show gives Wicked some very high expectations to meet.
""The interesting thing about Barbie and Oppenheimer was that they were two sort of unknown knowns and I think whilst Barbie has a huge legacy and fanbase, it didn't have the legacy and fanbase of a pre-existing narrative like Wicked.

Decked out in a black rhinestone cowboy hat and fluffy pink cape, Twain belted out crowd favourites including Man! I Feel Like a Woman! and That Don't Impress Me Much.
She did appear to be plagued by sound issues, however, much like Cyndi Lauper on Saturday and SZA later on Sunday night.
There was some criticism of Twain's vocals online but eagle-eyed viewers suggested there was a problem with her earpiece.
""Hope both Cyndi Lauper and Shania Twain's management kick Glastonbury's butt for the appalling sound issues. Most people sat at home critiquing their vocals have no idea how impossible it is to sing in time and tune when you can hear f***-all in your ear pieces…""
""People need to learn how live music works. Shania Twain was clearly having in-ear issues for the first couple of songs. Fingers in ears and on the battery pack constantly. Third song, it got sorted and she was in tune and in time. But nope, judgments have already been made.""
Spectators reported seeing Twain struggling with an earpiece. (Reuters: Dylan Martinez)
Twain has also previously spoken on her voice being affected by a two-decade battle with Lyme disease.
Appearing on The Graham Norton Show last year, the 57-year-old said she visited a neurologist about the change.
""[It's] not actually related to the vocal cords but nerve damage,"" she said.
Football fans took some time out of the festival to catch England's match against Slovakia at the Euros, thanks to Louis Tomlinson.
The former One Direction star hooked up a television to a power generator in the campsite after the festival's organisers opted not to show the game.
He was soon surrounded by a crowd keen to catch the action.
In case you were wondering: England scraped in a 2–1 win over Slovakia, with both goals scored during extra time.
Here's what one commenter said on social media:
""Louis is a man of the people for sure! Sharing joy at [Glastonbury] … He's also pretty freaking awesome as a musical artist. Just saying.""
But not everyone was watching the football…
Avril Lavigne was playing at one side of the venue called Other Stage which, as the name suggests, isn't Glastonbury's main venue.
While still a prestigious spot, it's got a much smaller standing area than the main stage, Pyramid, has.
And the number of the punk-pop rocker's fans caught organisers off guard, with stewards reportedly forced to close the Other Stage's entrance to manage crowd numbers.
The BBC later reported a whopping 70,000 people turned out for her set.

Longstanding characters were like friends to some, with those devoted to the show experiencing an outpouring of emotion similar to how they might feel when a real-life relationship ends.
Now, those who were grieving for characters such as Jarrod ""Toadfish"" Rebecchi played by Ryan Moloney will be forced to experience those emotions all over again, with Moloney announcing he's walking away from his on-screen role on the show.
""After 30 years playing Toadie, I will be leaving Ramsay Street,"" Moloney said in a video posted to social media.
""Now, I can't tell you what is going to happen to the character, whether or not we are going to see him again or not.
""You know, maybe I could be the next Jim Robinson and just [be killed off].
""Or maybe I'll be the next Harold Bishop and keep popping back over the years.""
Moloney, 44, joined the show in 1995 playing a troubled teen attending Erinsborough High, who was the antithesis of a teacher's pet.
He matured over the years, becoming a responsible member of his community.
Toadie married about five times, and was involved in some juicy storylines.

Moloney has been nominated for a Logie for Most Popular Actor for his portrayal of Toadie.
Reactions from fans have been congratulatory, with some reminiscing and others in disbelief.

Neighbours was launched in 1985.
It left television screens briefly when in 2022, UK broadcaster Channel 5 dropped the show from its schedule.
The final episode attracted an audience of about 1.5 million people in Australia alone and featured former members of the star-studded cast.
Neighbours experienced a revival when streaming service Amazon confirmed a partnership with production house Fremantle Australia to bring the show back.

Moloney won't be leaving the show altogether, telling fans he plans to work as a director on the show.
""Although I won't be bringing you our fantastic storylines from in front of the camera, I do hope to be bringing them to you from the other side, behind the camera,"" he said.
""I've just started director training and have just finished filming my first episode as director, so I really hope you enjoy that.""
Moloney thanked fans for their support and encouraged them to keep watching the show.
""I would just like to take the opportunity to say thank you all so much for all the love that you have shown me and Toadie over the years, for three decades in fact.
""I'm going to miss you and I'm going to miss him and I'm going to miss Erinsborough.
""But whatever you do make sure you do not miss what is going to happen on Ramsay Street.""
The peer-reviewed study found Neighbours fans felt a high level of grief emotions associated with the end of the series, and they had difficulty accepting that it had ended.
Neighbours executive producer, Jason Herbison has confirmed viewers might not have seen the end of Toadie.
""The street won't be the same without seeing him every week, however there's every chance he will pop back in the future.
""In the meantime, we're thrilled to support his directing ambitions and can't wait for viewers to see how Toadie's season-long story arc plays out.
""Ryan's been instrumental in the journey and has blown us away with his performance.""
Moloney will be in good company when he joins Neighbours alumni. Others who have trod Ramsay Street include Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Russell Crowe, Margot Robbie, Guy Pearce, Natalie Imbruglia, Holly Vallance and Natalie Bassingthwaighte.
Neighbours can be viewed Monday – Thursday at 4pm on 10 and 10 Play and 6:30pm on 10 Peach.",MBy Mawunyo Gbogbo,Fri 28 Jun,0

The decision comes after a months-long battle between the council and the owners of the home in the upscale Brentwood neighbourhood.
Next-door couple Roy Bank and Brinah Milstein bought the property in July 2023 for $US8.35 million ($12.5 million) with plans to demolish the house to expand their estate, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The couple obtained a demolition permit soon after.

But council member Traci Park last year introduced a motion to protect the home by granting it landmark status, receiving approval from the Cultural Heritage Commission and the Planning and Land Use Management Committee, the LA Times said.
""There's no other person or place in the city of Los Angeles as iconic as Marilyn Monroe and her Brentwood home,"" Cr Park said before the vote.
Monroe bought the Spanish Colonial-style home in 1962 for $US75,000.
It was the only residence she ever owned before she died there six months later of an apparent drug overdose.
Mr Bank and Ms Milstein sued the city in May for acting unconstitutionally in order to preserve the house, according to the Los Angeles Times.

""When I was 16 years old, I was ripped from my bed in the middle of the night and transported across state lines to the first of four youth residential treatment facilities,"" the 43-year-old said.
""These programs promised healing, growth and support, but instead did not allow me to speak, move freely or even look out a window for two years.
""I was force-fed medications and sexually abused by the staff.
""I was violently restrained and dragged down hallways, stripped naked and thrown into solitary confinement.
""My parents were completely deceived, lied to and manipulated by this for-profit industry about the inhumane treatment I was experiencing.""
Ms Hilton has previously spoken out about the emotional and physical abuse she's endured at youth facilities, including in the 2020 YouTube documentary This is Paris and her 2023 memoir Paris: The Memoir, as her parents looked for ways to address her rebellious behaviour.

While her experiences weren't through the foster care system, she acknowledged to Congress, Hilton said she knows from personal experience that children are being placed in harm's way.
""Today residential facilities are continuing to warehouse over 50,000 foster youth, and an unknown number of adopted youth, in lockdown facilities,"" she said.
""Innocent kids who've not committed crimes, kids whose parents didn't have resources to support them, kids whose parents passed away, kids who've already experienced trauma.""
She said the $US23 billion ($34.6 billion) industry operates without meaningful oversight.
Ms Hilton cited examples of children who were maltreated in care, such as 16-year-old Cornelius Fredericks, who in 2020 died at a Michigan centre after being physically restrained for 12 minutes as punishment for throwing food.
""Why can't we as a society see that these kids are hurting?"" she asked the committee.
""They need love and kindness, not beatings and restraints.
""As a mum, these stories break my heart,"" the mother of two added.
Ms Hilton, who is the great-granddaughter of Hilton Hotels founder Conrad Hilton, has previously called for a Utah boarding school she attended, Provo Canyon School, to be shut down, referring to it as ""the worst of the worst"".
The heiress shot to fame as a socialite and co-star of the early 2000's reality TV series The Simple Life with her friend, Nicole Ritchie, who is the adopted daughter of Lionel Richie.
In recent years, she has been a singer, DJ, podcaster, influencer and entrepreneur.

Shaped by the sense of isolation, loss and desire the singer-songwriter felt when she was the only guest at a hotel in regional Victoria in the early days of the pandemic, Summer of Love is raw, gentle and unstructured in the best of ways. It's not a high production record — Ribeiro didn't want it to be.
We had a little Chit Chat with the Naarm/Melbourne artist around the release of her latest hypnotic, experimental album, which she will be performing live in her hometown this week, before heading to Beechworth and Castlemaine.
Oh gosh, do you know what it is? It was Prince, 'Love… Thy Will Be Done'. I was listening to that version of the song specifically, because the Martika version just isn't as good.
I'd just got back from overseas and this terrible tragedy had taken place at one of the schools I was working at and the lyrics, to me, are very profound and brought me encouragement and vitality in a terrible moment in time in the school community.
My second top song was 'CUFF IT' by Beyoncé, which is a bit different…
Beyoncé — CUFF IT (Official Lyric Video)
What have I finished reading already this year? I like reading bits and pieces of things all over the place … I do feel like I've finished something this year, but I can't remember what it is.
At the moment I'm reading three different books — that I can recall.
Yeah… is that OK?
We caught up with the singer ahead of her Making It Through tour for 15 quick questions.
Well, one is entertaining and it's quite simple to read and the other two are a little more dense, so I'll read a little bit and then I just have to spend some time digesting them.
One of the dense ones is Descent to the Goddess: A Way of Initiation for Women, and the other one is Leaving my Father's House: A Journey to Conscious Femininity — and that is by Marion Woodman, who is a famous Jungian. (She's not alive anymore.)
And the third one is Half Deaf, Completely Mad: The Chaotic Genius of Australia's Most Legendary Producer Tony Cohen. That's the easy read and it's quite entertaining, you know.

Oh my god, at the moment? Well, OK, I bought this yellow vintage top by Valentino recently in Ghent in Belgium, when I was on tour in Europe.
You can expect an original, wonky piece of music.
Someone I know sent me a message saying, ""Jess, I love your wonky album"" and I was just like, ""That's a really good description. I love my wonky album too"".
I had a bit of music fatigue going into it. My energy levels felt different and I was world-weary and tired and sad from everything that was happening, and that impacted what I was creating.
What I wanted to say with it is that there's a lot of suffering going on in the world, and it's really important for us to keep cultivating wonder and awe among the moments of everyday difficulty and harrowing tragedy all around us.
There are still these beautiful moments that exist, and we see them in nature, and between people, and they keep us going and they keep us warm and that's really important because it's really f*****g hard to be here amidst the chaos.
The result is an album that's imperfect from a production perspective, and I like that about it, because I didn't want to create a high production record. There's less reverb on my voice and I didn't do as much conventional editing as what may have been done on my previous albums, and it's less structured in its formation. It's definitely a wonky listen.
Kicking back with the sports section is one of Ribeiro's favourite pastimes. (Supplied: Jess Ribeiro)
It was taken yesterday at 9:19am.
I just want you to know that the newspaper that is underneath it … I sent this photo to my friend saying, ""I'm back at the best retro supermarket in town, you get a free donut with every coffee"", and she said, ""Oh my god, this is amazing. I love that you're having a donut for breakfast and you're reading the sports section, you weirdo"". But I wasn't really reading the sports section — I was looking for the astrology page. I just want you to know that.
It was today at 7:41am.
It was an affirmation Rick Rubin put up on his Instagram and it was: ""Create an environment where you are free to express what you're afraid to express."" It spoke to me because I have a lot of fears and I think it's really important to find your people in places where you can express your anger or your fear, your true thoughts.

It's another thing I got on tour — a little whale I found in Slovenia in this little second-hand shop. I'd been dreaming a lot about the ocean and all of the animals in the sea, so when I saw this I was like, ""Yes, this is my talisman!"" and I carry it everywhere with me because I just … I don't know, I just need to.
The other day I started watching this documentary series about Black female artists called How it Feels to be Free — it follows Lena Horne and Nina Simone and all these other women and it looks at how they came to find their voices and how they were activists.

As a child, I spent a lot of time in Chinese restaurants in the small town I grew up in because that was the place where my father could go to speak Cantonese with other people. In the kitchens of these restaurants — so, we would go there to socialise.
There's a country town Chinese restaurant that we featured in the music video for Everything is Now.
Jess Ribeiro — Everything Is Now (Official Clip)
I came upon this restaurant during COVID lockdowns, because I left the city at one point and moved to regional Victoria and it was a really nostalgic experience for me. I felt like I had stepped back into my childhood from 30 years ago and I really wanted to share that because I love those restaurants. They're so visceral.
My default is congee, because it's easy and you can eat it for lunch and breakfast and dinner and there are so many different ways to prepare it. It's so comforting and restorative, especially if you're run-down. As a child, I didn't appreciate it, and now I do.
I'm pretty excited but I'm a bit worried about the weather in Victoria, because it's really cold. [When we speak, Ribeiro is wearing her winter coat while inside her house]. So, I really hope people come because it's so cold.
And I promise I'll never do a winter tour again.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-26/black-barbie-documentary-shondaland-lagueria-davis/104018172,The first Black Barbie was only made in 1980. A new Netflix documentary tells the story behind it,"For most of her life, Lagueria Davis ""hated"" dolls.
What: A deep dive into the history of Black Barbie and the three Black women responsible.
Starring: Lagueria Davis, Beulah Mae Mitchell, Shonda Rhimes.
Directed by: Lagueria Davis.
When: Streaming now on Netflix.
Likely to make you feel: Grateful for the pioneering women fighting for greater representation for decades.
Her reasons are all the usual ones. Davis, who is Black, felt like the white dolls she reluctantly played with as a child were telling her ""all the things [she] was supposed to be as a little girl that [she] didn't really embrace"", making her feel like ""less of a girl"" since she wasn't interested in changing nappies or fashion, and wasn't a white, blonde woman with blue eyes.
While Davis spent most of her life wondering what there is to like about dolls, her 86-year-old aunt Beulah Mae Mitchell has dedicated much of hers to them. In the 50s she got a job on the factory assembly lines at Mattel, the company behind Barbie, and went on to work as a receptionist at the toy maker's head office until she retired.
Just like her niece, Mitchell grew up playing with white dolls for lack of any that looked like her — but today the walls in her home are lined with Black dolls. And they mean everything to her.
""For me, the word 'hate' means having a lack of understanding,"" Davis explains. So began Davis's journey to understand why dolls — Black ones, in particular — are more than just dolls to people like her aunt.
Black Barbie trailer
After 13 years of development, Davis has turned what she learned into a documentary about the history of Black Barbie.
It starts in the early 60s, when Davis's aunt told Barbie's creator Ruth Handler: ""We want a Black Barbie.""
Later that decade, Mattel released two different Black dolls, but they had Eurocentric features and didn't carry the name Barbie, instead being marketed as Barbie's ""babysitters"" and ""best friends"".
After looking at what life was like for children before Black dolls in the first part of the documentary, the second act explores the era where they tried to make Mitchell's dream come true.
Unsurprisingly, hiring more Black women was a big part of making real progress.

Kitty Black Perkins was Mattel's first Black designer, and she would go on to create the Black Barbie in 1980.
Stacey McBride-Irby was another crucial hire, creating and designing new Black Barbie lines from 1996 to 2011.
The film's final act looks at what's changed since Black Barbie's introduction nearly 45 years ago (not as much as you might hope or expect).
""On the one hand, it feels ridiculous in the sense of … you can't place this on a doll's shoulders. It's a piece of plastic,"" says Davis.
In the 40s there was a landmark study called the Clark Doll Test, in which Black children were given a Black doll and a white doll and asked which doll was the ""nice"" doll and which was the ""bad"" doll, with the goal of determining the effect racial rejection has on self-esteem. The majority of Black children at the time ascribed the positive characteristics to the white doll and the negatives to the Black doll.
In Black Barbie, modern researchers sit down with several groups of children and show them a diverse range of some of the Barbies available today to hear how they perceive them.
This is interwoven with commentary from real-life Black Barbies, including screenwriter Shonda Rhimes (whose company Shondaland produced this film); Olympic fencing medallist Ibtihaj Muhammad; the first African American principal dancer for the American Ballet Theatre Misty Copeland, as well as collectors, parents and relatable everyday people with relatable white doll baggage.
Shonda Rhimes, who now has two Barbies made in her image, says in the documentary: ""There is damage done when you force children of colour to play with white dolls."" (Supplied: Netflix)
Together, they consider the importance — and limitations — of the type of representation dolls can afford.
Many of the women break down when speaking about the impact of not seeing themselves in the toys they played with as children.
""Seeing [that] proved to me how much it really does matter,"" Davis says resolutely. ""It does matter what our children are playing with and the media that they're seeing.
Davis started making the documentary Black Barbie in 2011.
She says it wasn't until about 2013 that she found out a live-action Barbie movie (that would go on to make more than $1 billion at the global box office and dominate the media for months) was in the works.
""I remember thinking, 'Gosh, I wonder how Black Barbie is going to show up in that movie?'"" Davis says.
(Reader: She did not. Though there were a handful of Black and otherwise diverse Barbies, there was no Black Barbie in the film, which instead focused on ""Stereotypical Barbie"", as depicted by white, blonde Margot Robbie.)
While the finer details of the plot of Greta Gerwig's film were kept secret ahead of its release, Davis says she knew ahead of time the live-action movie ""wasn't going to centre Black Barbie's story"", nor would it celebrate the women behind her.
And, despite any feelings she may have previously nursed when it came to dolls, if there's one thing Davis is firm on, it's that Black Barbie deserved her own movie.

Here are the entertainment and arts stories you might have missed this weekend, from Justin Timberlake addressing his DWI to the song behind the internet's new favourite meme.
It is not a great time to be Justin Timberlake (that would be 2002 when the noodle-haired singer had the world at his feet).
The last year has been spent re-evaluating all the women JT stepped on while making his way to pop stardom, thanks in part to Britney Spears's (bless her soul) 2023 memoir The Woman in Me and a re-examination of the 2004 Super Bowl controversy, where Janet Jackson was condemned for a ""wardrobe malfunction"" triggered by Timberlake (he escaped criticism).
Which is to say, many people on the internet indulged in a little bit of schadenfreude when, on June 18, Timberlake was arrested for driving under the influence by a cop that was reportedly too young to recognise the SexyBack singer.
It was also reported that when the cop pulled him over, Timberlake muttered: ""This is going to ruin the tour."" This hasn't been officially confirmed, but that hasn't stopped the hottest new meme format.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
But, in reality, and perhaps unsurprisingly, JT's arrest didn't ruin his tour (People magazine labelled him the ""Teflon man"" many years ago for a reason)and he used his Chicago stop over the weekend to address the situation in front of his most adoring fans.
""It's been a tough week, but you're here and I'm here, and nothing can change this moment right now,"" he said.
""I know sometimes I'm hard to love — but you keep on loving me, and I love you right back.""
It has become increasingly hard to love Justin Timberlake as the years have gone on, particularly after he started releasing some of the most unpopular music of his career.
But you know what's not hard to love? These ""ruin the tour"" memes… Roll the tape!

Established in 1984, the annual National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (NATSIAA) is the longest-running and most prestigious award for emerging and established First Nations artists. This year's exhibition opened over the weekend at Museum and Gallery of the Northern Territory in Darwin.
It displays the work of 72 finalists from across the country, including Arrernte and Kalkadoon artist and Archibald finalist Thea Anamara Perkins, Pitjantjatjara artist and Sulman finalist Iluwanti Ken, and Pitjantjatjara artist Betty Muffler, whose work recently featured at the National Gallery of Victoria's Triennial.
Past winners of the top prize, now known as the Telstra Art Award and worth $100,000, include the late Warlpiri artist Kumantje Jagamara, Kuku Yalanji artist Tony Albert, and Kamilaroi artist Richard Bell.
The winners of the seven awards will be announced on August 9. The exhibition runs until January 27.

On Friday, Charli xcx released a remix of 'Girl, so confusing', a track from her unmissable new album Brat, featuring a verse from the unofficial queen of Aotearoa, Lorde (and saviour).
When Charli first dropped the track, many had wondered — and guessed correctly — that Lorde was the pop star with the ""same hair"" that she was addressing in this candid treatise about insecurity within a friendship between women. (""Can't tell if you wanna see me/Falling over and failing/And you can't tell what you're feeling/I think I know how you feel"").
In the original track, Charli sings ""One day we might make some music/The internet would go crazy"" and, when Lorde finally returned the British pop star's calls to collab… it did.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
Lorde's reply verse to Charli's song is one for the ages, imbued with the Kiwi star's signature lyrical skill and a new level of honesty. Lorde basically admits that she's been AWOL at times because of her mental health and struggles with disordered eating.
Whether or not there was ever any real beef between the singers, this is certainly a mature way to handle broigus (*cough* looking at you Kendrick/Drake!). And maybe this is naive, but we're left feeling optimistic about the possibility of genuine sisterhood in an era when the culture seems determined to pit pop girlies against each other.

Gamers poured hundreds of hours into exploring its vast fantasy world (guilty as charged) and delving into its dense lore, made in collaboration with Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin.
Now, the critically acclaimed blockbuster is effectively getting a sequel. Well, an expansion, to be precise.

Released Friday, the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC (that's short for downloadable content) gives players access to a massive new world to explore.
While critics have been handing out rave reviews to Shadow of the Erdtree, fans are frustrated; over on popular digital gaming platform Steam, the DLC is facing a wave of negativity.

Difficulty, however, is the defining quality of FromSoftware, the Japanese developers of Elden Ring and dark, extremely challenging hits Demon's Souls (2009), Bloodborne (2015), and Dark Souls (2011) and its sequels.
FromSoftware's games have become such a cultural phenomenon because, unlike many video games, death is a design philosophy.
""[T]he sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience"", FromSoft president and creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki explained in an interview with The Guardian. ""Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy.""
So, don't expect any tweaks to Shadow of the Erdtree. Although, FromSoftware has made a mild concession: issuing a guide to help players ""improve their skill"".
In other words? ""Git gud,"" as per the mantra of the cult FromSoftware fandom. And hey, if they can rise to Herculean, frankly mind-boggling efforts, including beating Elden Ring using only their feet, then surely Shadow of the Erdtree is worth the struggle.

Pixar's post-COVID grand plan to prioritise the ""commonality of experience"" over original storytelling is going swimmingly, as Inside Out 2 broke global box office records over the weekend.
The sequel to 2015's Inside Out — which introduced the world to the personified emotions inside an 11-year-old's head — has pulled in a monumental $US724.4 million ($1.09 billion) around the world since it was released earlier this month. It overtakes the previous top seller of 2024, Dune 2, which made $US711.8 million (AUD$1.07 billion) in its run earlier in the year.
Inside Out 2 is set two years after the original film, and sees protagonist Riley enter puberty, introducing a whole set of emotions for Joy and her cohort (pictured) to wrestle with.   (Supplied: Disney)
It's expected that Inside Out 2 will surpass the $US1 billion mark within the next week, making it the first film since Barbie to do so.
Many reviews for the highly anticipated sequel have praised the movie for its design and the introduction of new, more mature emotions, while also pointing out that the second film doesn't hit quite as hard as the first.
Not that reviews matter that much to Disney when they're looking at a billion-dollar payday; Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter has already let slip that an Inside Out spin-off TV show is slated to land on Disney+ in 2025.
Can't wait to see how cute Depression's character design is!

Bestselling American author, humorist and This American Life mainstay David Sedaris is taking a break from collecting rubbish in rural England to return to Australia for a national tour.

The 2025 tour, his seventh to Australia, follows the release of his latest essay collection Happy-Go-Lucky (2022), in which he wrote about the pandemic and the death of his father.
It's just one in a string of humorous, autobiographical books, which often poke fun at his family and loved ones, including Naked, Me Talk Pretty One Day, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim and Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls.
At his Australian shows, audiences can expect never-before-read stories (and some you have), a Q&A, and a book signing that will run as long as it needs to (and that he might use as material later).
Don't worry, it's no burden on Sedaris, as he wrote in an essay in Happy-Go-Lucky.
Recounting when his sister, actor Amy Sedaris, asked him about his ""idea of perfect happiness"", he said: ""on tour, in a great hotel, and having enough time to take a long bath before I have to head to the theatre"". Sounds pretty lush.
An Evening with David Sedaris kicks off in Canberra on February 1, before heading to Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Newcastle, Sydney and Brisbane.

The third iteration of Vogue World has set up camp in the French capital, putting on a parade in the city's Place Vendôme.
With the Olympics just weeks away, the event saw plenty of celebrity cameos as models, musicians and athletes paid homage to fashion's relationship with sport.
Think of it as if the Met Gala collided with a travelling circus.
Now in its third year, Vogue World started in New York before popping up in London last year.
With all eyes on Paris ahead of next month's Olympics, it was hardly a surprise when it was revealed as this year's host city.
""If Vogue World: New York was a street fair, and Vogue World: London was a glamorous night at the theatre, Paris will be a kind of opening ceremony,"" Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour said in February.
To mark 100 years since the last Olympics were held in Paris in 1924, the event paired a sport with a French fashion house from every decade since the 1920s.
Singer Sabrina Carpenter surprised audiences when she strutted out during the 1940s portion of the evening, wearing retro-inspired swimwear as part of the aquatics section.

Later, Katy Perry became an even bigger surprise when she walked the runway — marching band in tow — during the 1980s portion of the evening dedicated to martial arts.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-23/marion-boyce-1960s-fashion-ladies-in-black/103986802,The timeless elegance of 60s fashion brought to life on screen,"When costume designer Marion Boyce spotted the elegant citrine-coloured hat by renowned French milliner Jean Patou, she knew she had to have it.
Weekends spent trawling for treasures often meant Marion would walk away with armfuls of ribbons, buckles and clothes from a bygone era.
It's resulted in an impressive collection of vintage clothing and accessories — one so large it needs its own storage space.
But it was decades before the Patou hat finally had its on-screen moment, when Marion received a call from the team behind ABC iview's new series Ladies in Black.

Set six months on from Bruce Beresford's film of the same name, Ladies in Black is a time capsule of classic early 1960s fashion.
Set in the ladieswear department of Goodes Department Store in 1961, the Patou hat can be seen on Angela, one of the women selling hats, gloves and dresses to the wealthy women of Sydney.
""I've lugged it around my whole life! It was thrilling to be able to use it,"" Marion says.
Marion's keen eye for fashion detail had previously been put to use in TV series Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries and Jocelyn Moorhouse's film The Dressmaker.
Ladies in Black gave her the opportunity to once again dig into her extensive vintage collection.
""As a costume designer, it was a delicious period because you have the best of the early '60s, which was really elegant fashion, but then you have the excitement of the youth movement.""
Kitten heels, trousers, pillbox hats and A-line dresses appear throughout the series, and in a testament to their classic appeal, some still appear on runways today.
Since its launch by Christian Dior in 1955, the A-line cut has become a mainstay of fashion.  (Ben King/Bunya Entertainment/Getty Images/Bettmann)
If you're a woman, chances are you probably own a dress or skirt modelled on the A-line cut.
Narrow and fitted at the top and widening out from the bust or waist in the shape of the letter 'A', the style was introduced in 1955 by Christian Dior with the launch of his ""A line"" collection.
""The [A] shape-shifted from the traditional hourglass silhouette and paved the way for the 'trapeze' and 'chemise' styles of Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent,"" says fashion historian Lydia Edwards.

""The easy-wearing nature of this style fit perfectly with the simple mini dress and growing defying of gender convention during the '60s.""
Popularised at a time when women rarely wore pants, Audrey Hepburn ushered in the age of the capri pant while filming the movie Sabrina in 1954.
The style would hang around until the early '60s and, propelled by women's desire for mobility, would eventually usher in the more androgynous-shaped pants younger women were beginning to favour.
""Women wanted to move around the world, through space,"" says Emily Brayshaw from the University of Technology's School of Design.
For Marion, the '60s signified brilliant suiting.
""Just think of Jackie Kennedy during that time – matching colours, the perfect hat and the perfect-coloured handbag,"" she says.
The cropped jacked, in particular, was a mainstay.
According to Lydia, there is speculation that the cropped, particularly bolero-style, jacket may have come from the French military jacket, the Zouave.
There is some debate about the origins of the cropped jacket but many believe it was inspired by those worn by Zouave soldiers. (Ben King/Bunya Entertainment/Getty Images/Heritage Images)
Named after French military units from then-French-colonised North Africa, its cut and fit closely resemble the style of the cropped jacket.
History costume and textile specialist Nicole Jenkins agrees that there is a military link but suggests the jacket was more likely a natural progression of the ""ensemble"" — a dress with a matching jacket of the same fabric.
""[The ensemble] was invented in the 1930s, perhaps by Norman Hartnell for the queen mother,"" says Nicole.
""The dress and jacket were always the same length until the '50s when they started being more tailored and hourglass … and similar to a suit jacket.
""Into the 1960s, the focus on the cinched waistline shifted to a more androgynous silhouette – the jacket became shorter and boxier, floating above the waistline.""
The pillbox hat became especially popular in the early 1960s, made famous by American first lady Jackie Kennedy who wore one, by American fashion designer Halston, to her husband's inauguration.
Pillbox hats, the bucket clouche and the whimsy were all hats worn in the early '60s.  (Supplied: Ben King/Bunya Entertainment)
Emily calls the pillbox hat a ""beautiful innovation"".
""It's eye-catching and the reason it popped is she had this outfit made to wear in Washington in 1961, but apparently eight inches of snow fell and it was freezing cold so the wealthy women wore their big mink fur hats and she stepped out in this small pillbox hat.""
Unsurprisingly, the pillbox hat also has links to military uniforms.
""Its origins are mixed but most often put down to military design over many centuries,"" Lydia says.
Hats, like Marion's yellow hat by Jean Patou, appear throughout Ladies in Black, alongside the turban.
The glamorous wrap, which more recently has appeared on Rhianna, Lady Gaga, Kate Moss and Kylie Minogue, has been appropriated by fashion for decades.
""Turbans were first made widely popular in the 18th century as a part of fashionable Turquerie clothing"" Lydia says.
Turbans are not only a practical accessory (pictured left), they can also add a touch of glamour, as seen here on Kate Moss. (Getty Images/MPI/Randy Brooke)
""In the 1910s, [French couturier] Paul Poiret renewed their importance and they became a practical choice during the '40s.
""This carried on into the '60s but was glamorised [and] formalised, partly in order to move away from the wartime association.""
The women who work in Goodes ladieswear face tumultuous lives navigating societal shifts and personal challenges amidst the fashion transformation of the '60s.
""Kittens"" were worn by teenage girls in training for grown-up stilettos.
""Previously, a girl would have made a very swift transition from flat shoes to adult-heeled shoes, but this marked that intermediary period,"" Lydia says.
By the early '60s, the kitten heel became fashionable for older teenagers, and eventually women of all ages.
""It was a move away from the stiletto of the '50s — again it's coming from wanting that ease of movement,"" Emily says.
Eventually, the beatnik world would come to view the kitten heel as hurting their freedom of movement and freedom of expression.
And proving fashion is constantly evolving, it would eventually usher in the age of the ballet slipper, allowing women to take even bigger strides.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-23/can-deadpool-save-the-marvel-cinematic-universe/103991886,"Is the Marvel Cinematic Universe doomed, or will Deadpool save the day?","The last time Marvel released just one film from its cinematic universe in a calendar year, it was 2012, and that film was The Avengers.
The box-office-shattering superhero team-up brought together the seeds sown in five previous films, and the MCU suddenly blossomed into a critically lauded mega-franchise that had Marvel laughing all the way to the bank.

But 12 years, a further 27 films, and about a dozen TV shows later, there are signs the juggernaut is slowing.
After cranking out an average of three films a year since 2017 (minus the pandemic-disrupted 2020), the MCU will have just one new entry this year.
The 2023 writer's strike has played its part, but Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed to Variety earlier this year Marvel was slowing down its release schedule to ""two or a maximum of three"" films per year, as well as dropping its TV output back to ""probably about two TV series a year"".
So after an onslaught that featured 11 movies that topped US$1b (including two over $2b) and four Oscars (from 27 nominations), is it possible the MCU is on the eve of its Endgame?
The first 23 MCU films make up the Infinity Saga, and within that remarkable run there is not a single genuine flop (The Incredible Hulk underperformed, but didn't technically flop), nor is there a single film rated as ""rotten"" according to the metrics of critic aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.

Ten of the 11 aforementioned billion-dollar movies come from that MCU 23-film hot streak, with five of those in the last six movies of the Infinity Saga (with Ant-Man & The Wasp being the exception).
The double-whammy of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame wrapped up an incredible decade or so of superhero film-making better than many expected.
But since then, Marvel has struggled to retain its mojo as it builds its next era — the so-called Multiverse Saga.
Eternals in 2021 gave the studio its first genuine flop and its first ""rotten"" score on Rotten Tomatoes, with Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania repeating the feat in 2023.
The most recent MCU film to date, The Marvels, released in November last year, received a warmish reception from critics, but copped a walloping at the box office, yielding the lowest gross of any MCU movie to date.

Throw into the mix actor Jonathan Majors being found guilty of reckless assault and harassment, leading to him being fired by the MCU from the role of the multiverse-traversing villain Kang, who was being set up via his appearances in Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania and TV show Loki as the Thanos-equivalent ""Big Bad"" for the Multiverse Saga.
It was in the wake of Majors' transgressions and the less-than-perfect financial landing of The Marvels that Iger made his slow-down comments, which many critics and industry-watchers took as a sign that Marvel was realising it was no longer the bullet-proof Hulk it had been five years earlier.
While you could argue the MCU is far from on its knees, all eyes are on the lone MCU film being released this year to save the day, or —  at the very least — be a canary in the caped coal mine.
A Marvel screenwriter couldn't have come up with a more unlikely hero to have the fate of the franchise in their hands.
Deadpool, a foul-mouthed fourth-wall-breaking assassin played by Ryan Reynolds, is making his MCU debut in cinemas on July 26 in the succinctly titled Deadpool & Wolverine.

While his brand of extreme violence and profanity is a million tonal miles from the largely family-friendly MCU outings to date, Deadpool has two incredibly successful MA15+ outings under his belt with 20th Century Fox.
The trailer seems to suggest that the Deadpool fans know and love will be there on the screen come July 26 — Marvel would have been nuts to ignore the formula that has made him a fan favourite and raked in more than $1.5 billion at the box office.
Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019 means Deadpool is now a fully fledged MCU member along with his co-star Wolverine, with Reynolds reportedly coaxing Aussie screen icon Hugh Jackman back into the adamantium claws for one final appearance (Jackman retired from the role with 2017's Logan).
It's the first time Marvel has used an X-Men character in more than just a cameo, and pundits are predicting the combination of two of the most popular comic book characters will give the MCU the much-needed hit it needs.
One hit won't solve everything though.
After all, the MCU's Multiverse Saga has had its winners, including Spider-Man: No Way Home, Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3.
But the problem that lies ahead for Marvel is a slate of films that are largely following in some very big footsteps.
Next year, the superhero formerly known as The Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie) will make his first big-screen outing as the new Captain America, a team of second-tier heroes and villains will combine as Marvel's answer to DC's Suicide Squad in Thunderbolts, and the MCU will reboot The Fantastic Four, having also regained the rights to those characters in its 20th Century Fox purchase.

Beyond that, amid possible Spider-Man and Shang Chi sequels, is a reboot of Blade and X-Men — two more films with big shoes to fill.
All of this is pointing towards more Avengers films with a new line-up of Avengers that will undoubtedly be compared to Infinity War and Endgame, two of the biggest movies of all time.

Warning: This story contains language that some readers may find offensive.
A car is crawling past her house. Then it stops, right in front. The doors open.
""Then I just hear four or five middle-aged women screaming, 'Olivia, you're a c***. Die, piggy!'""
She's scared. She doesn't know who these women are or how they knew where she lived.
This was just another in a long line of abusive incidents that Olivia has experienced since she appeared on Australia's TV screens in 2022. But this one was much closer to home.
She's been called Australia's ""most hated"" reality TV star. But is there more to her story than what you saw on screen?
Olivia went on Married at First Sight to find love, but instead, she lost almost everything.
She's been referred to as the most-hated reality TV star in Australia's history. So, how did she come to wear this dubious crown?
Olivia says she got a ""villain edit"" — where the show's makers manipulate the depiction of a participant to paint them as the bad guy.
Married at First Sight boss Tara McWilliams has previously dismissed claims of ""villain edits"", saying participants ""get the edits they deserve"" and are not wrongly characterised.
Olivia says the trolling she received for her depiction left her suicidal, and that in pursuit of ratings, the show abandoned its duty of care to her.
Her allegations come as the reality TV industry has been rocked by a series of lawsuits abroad against some of its biggest names, which onlookers say could change how shows are made.
The industry is notoriously secretive, with cast and crew muzzled by non-disclosure agreements.
But Olivia is willing to risk legal consequences to warn others of the risks of becoming a reality TV villain.
So, do ""villain edits"" exist, and did Olivia get one?
Married at First Sight, or ""MAFS"", is one of Australia's most-watched reality television shows. The premise is captured in the name — participants are married off to a stranger, meeting for the first time at the altar.
The show dubs itself a ""social experiment"", following the couples from week to week and asking: can a manufactured marriage work?
But as the novelty of the experiment has worn off after a decade on Australian screens, audiences have increasingly come for the drama — not just between the couples themselves, but between contestants.
Olivia says when she saw the ads for the first-ever Australian season of MAFS, it felt like destiny.
A few years later, she saw that they were looking for participants. She was a few wines deep, having just broken up with her boyfriend. It was her time.
By then, she was watching the show nightly — an exciting distraction during a difficult period studying for her teaching degree while caring for her dying father.
And now, a casting director had seen her half-baked application and wanted to hear more.
""I felt picked, for the first time in my life. And each time I got a callback, I'd feel more and more special.""
But there was a hitch.
""[They] said to me, 'We're worried we're going to put you in the shark tank, and you don't have a backbone.'""
So, desperate to get on the show, she told a story of a time she'd ""had teeth"". During a distressing friendship break-up, she'd cut up her bridesmaid dress for a friend's wedding and sent it to the bride.
Olivia says she felt like it was her ""destiny"" to appear on Married At First Sight (MAFS). (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)
It was the gold the program had been mining for.
""I think that was where 'we're going to cast her as a villain' started,"" she says.
Industry insiders say the casting of a TV ""villain"" can begin as early as the audition room.
""The thing that usually gets people cast as villains is when they say in their audition tapes, 'I'm a no-bullshit person. I'll just tell it as it is,"" says a reality TV editor, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardising his job.
The editor didn't work on MAFS but has wide experience across similar shows.
Olivia would ultimately interview three times before making it onto the show, and when she did, the bridesmaid story would come back to haunt her.
But she suspects that to cast her as a villain from the outset would have made for a boring story. She believes the program makers wanted to surprise viewers with a narrative arc, by introducing her as an angel.
Olivia Frazer says taking part in the show ruined her dreams of becoming a teacher and left her suicidal. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)
""With Olivia, there is a sweetness and a vulnerability due to the fact that she's recently lost her father,"" said one of the ""experts"" that guide the couples throughout the ""experiment"".
""She's gone through a lot of heartache in her life — difficult times at home, self-esteem issues, even struggled with her weight.""
Olivia says she was bullied for her weight for years and underwent weight loss surgery at 22. She told viewers she'd accepted being mistreated in relationships due to her low self-esteem.
Her then-TV husband, Jackson Lonie, was appalled to hear this beautiful woman who'd selflessly cared for her father had been treated so poorly.
They instantly fell for each other.
""There's potential for an incredible love story here,"" the experts gushed.
And that doesn't make for good television.

According to the industry insiders, after casting, the baiting begins.
""You're taking a bunch of normal people and putting them in an exceptional situation that's going to push them to have intense experiences … that will then generate real emotional responses,"" says the editor.
""Then … you exaggerate them.""
These shows need drama — and their filming conditions are ripe to deliver it.
But those same conditions struggle to stack up as a positive working environment.
Participants on reality TV shows are employees and can be paid around minimum wage.
The Background Briefing team brings you Notorious, a special miniseries dedicated to telling stories from the ""bad guys'"" perspectives, and the unexpected things we learn from them.
And this workplace can feel a bit like Britney Spears's experience of living under a conservatorship.
Program makers control most aspects of participants' lives, including when they can see other participants, and what they post to social media. The show can even post to participants' personal Instagram accounts under their names.
Olivia says for much of the ""experiment"", she felt like a ""naughty kid"" being ""reprimanded"" if she strayed too far, and having her personal devices taken ""as a form of punishment"".
Across most seasons, participants are forced to live for weeks with their new spouses, until recently complete strangers.
In Olivia's season, COVID measures further restricted their movements and prevented them from seeing anyone outside of the production, leaving participants ""stir-crazy"".
""We were basically inmates,"" she says.
When participants got to see each other at a weekly dinner party, it was like being let out of jail — and alcohol only fuelled the cabin fever.
Olivia says while alcohol was originally capped at the dinner parties, towards the end of filming, those restrictions disappeared, and things went, as she says, ""tits up"".
But such drama was welcome on set.
""One dinner party, we were all having such a lovely time … to the point where [a program maker] had to come out and be like, 'Right, you guys need to start drama or we're going to be here all night,'"" Olivia says.
Domenica smashes a glass in heated moment with Olivia.
""Australia's not tuning in to watch a tea party.""
Eventually, it was Olivia's turn to snap.
The target of her frustration was another participant, Domenica Calarco. The argument spiralled. Domenica stood up to leave. And then, in a moment that has gone down in reality TV history, Domenica smashed a wine glass.
The cameras kept rolling.
Olivia wanted to file a police report and leave the show: ""I'm an employee, and I should be able to show up to my place of work without fear.""
Program makers talked her out of both moves.
""Things were brought up like, 'No, [if police attend] then the footage will be subpoenaed and people will lose their jobs because of this,'"" Olivia says.
""They start sweet-talking me: 'You can't go. You and Jackson are our only genuine love connection. If you go, we don't have a show.'
""I just felt so immensely guilty thinking about leaving.""
Domenica told Background Briefing she received a warning from the program makers following the glass smashing.
Endemol Shine, which produces Married at First Sight, did not respond to any of Olivia's claims about filming conditions, or that she was deterred from going to police. Olivia ultimately went on to report the incident after filming wrapped.
After the glass-smashing incident, a fresh controversy arose. For the program makers, it was storyline gold. For the women involved, the decision to play it to a national audience would have massive consequences — for their reputations, mental health, and careers.
How exactly events unfolded has been contested. According to Olivia, she relayed the glass-smashing incident to friends, who Googled Domenica to put a face to a name.
MAFS sparked conversations about leaking nude photos, plus why we shouldn't call it 'revenge porn'
She says she was enjoying some downtime with other participants when her friends sent through a screenshot of a nude photo Domenica had posted to her own public social media accounts.
The image was advertising Domenica's account on Only Fans — a platform where creators can sell adult content to subscribers.
Olivia maintains she showed the other participants in the room to question why Domenica was allowed public social media accounts, which were forbidden by their contracts.
She didn't see an issue with showing the photo around, as it had been posted by Domenica for the purpose of advertising — ""so there's no privacy expected in that situation"".
The program makers prompted another participant to drop the bomb at the next dinner party.
Domenica was blindsided and devastated, but defiantly told the camera: ""If it's slut-shaming, I'll wear it like a badge of honour, because 'My body, my choice, b****.'""
Speaking with Background Briefing now, Domenica says the fact the photo came from her own public accounts is irrelevant: ""I couldn't care less where she got it, it's what she then went to do with that photo — to turn people against me, shame me, all those things.
""Revenge porn … doesn't have to be someone's photo that was given privately, it can be done in a different way.""
Olivia knew as soon as it played out at the dinner party that she had ""ruined her life"".
Olivia says she has lost her lifelong dream of becoming a teacher as a result of appearing on MAFS. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)
She says she was ""crucified"" by the show's ""experts"" for showing the photo to other participants.
The next day, she ""could not stop crying"" and asked to see the show psychologist.
She says program makers told her that first, she needed to complete a task: writing a letter offering relationship advice to Domenica.
This was not an attempt by the program makers to mediate the conflict between the pair.
""They wanted me to write all these trigger words, to criticise Dom's voice, and basically just incite more of a feud,"" Olivia says.
When she did get to see the psychologist, Olivia says their professional advice was to spend the weekend with her TV husband, Jackson, so he could look after her.
But program makers had another plan. The couple was tasked with spending the weekend apart — and Olivia says they took her devices so she couldn't contact anyone.
Left alone, she spiralled. Later that night, Olivia says she told a staff member her ""life was over"" and she wanted to ""fling [herself] off a balcony"".
""I was definitely suicidal, and it was completely undermined and not taken seriously,"" she says.
Endemol Shine did not respond to the claim Olivia's devices were taken, but her mum, Sandy, says she didn't hear from her until the next day.
""She wasn't allowed to contact Jackson at all,"" Sandy says.
""So the very thing that the psychologist said, 'this will keep you safe', was then taken away from her. And this is from a girl who said that she wanted to jump off a balcony.""
The show psychologist told Background Briefing they could not comment due to their non-disclosure agreement. Endemol Shine also declined to comment.
In the show, viewers are not told of Olivia's breakdown. Instead, she is portrayed as a clingy girlfriend struggling to spend a night alone.
In the reality TV production process, after the casting of villains and the baiting for villainous behaviour, comes the editing.
It's in the post-production suite that a villain edit can truly come to life.
Olivia Frazer appeared in the 2022 season of Married At First Sight (MAFS) and claims she received the ""villain edit"". (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)
It's foreshadowed in the opening pages of Olivia's contract, which Background Briefing has seen:
""You may or may not be shown in a positive light; You may be shown in a way you consider to be embarrassing or otherwise unfavourable; Your appearance on the program may result in others seeing or treating you differently.""
The reality TV editor who spoke with Background Briefing says these clauses give editors an ""open licence"": ""[Participants] have literally signed away their rights of reply or complaint.
The editor says there are a few techniques to achieve these characterisations. The simplest one is being selective in what gets included.
""The lovable princesses might actually be really bitchy and say lots of mean things, but that's not the character that we want them to be. So you won't include their bitchy things and you just make them look lovable,"" the editor says.
""And then you have villains who are meant to be really nasty … and sometimes they're not, and you really have to push to try and make them villains.""
The editor remembers one time this felt ""uncomfortable and ethically questionable"".
The second technique editors use is amplification — finding a moment amongst what the editor calls the ""boring crap"" that can be boosted into a storyline.
In Olivia's case, program makers seized upon a conversation about Jackson going to the gym five nights a week.
In the show, it's spun as a major conflict.
And then, the drama is further enhanced with a technique called ""frankenbiting"".
Like Frankenstein creating his monster, editors will mix together unrelated elements from the footage to make their own beast.
When Olivia met Jackson's friends, they asked how she felt about his reputation as a party boy: ""I don't feel very good about that — he's a grown man, not a frat boy,"" she said.
Olivia says she asked not to be filmed in a gym ""at any point"" on MAFS. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)
In the show, Olivia's answer is spliced onto the discussion of Jackson's gym routine.
""Those two completely different conversations got meshed together so that I was saying Jackson wasn't allowed to go to the gym, he's not a frat boy. He's got to grow up,"" Olivia says.
And it's not just words that get spliced together out of context: this editor says it's images too.
In Olivia's case, she appears crestfallen as she watches Jackson work out — but it's not because she disapproved of his passion, as the show narrates.
""I'd said, 'Please don't film me in the gym at any point,'"" she recalls.
""I'm doing my best not to cry because I'm thinking, 'They're putting me in a gym so that all of Australia can laugh at the chubby girl working out.'""
Between the glares at the gym and the ""frat boy"" comments, Olivia's storyline was complete: she was the crazy wife, threatened that her husband had a hobby besides her — and willing to undermine his health as a result.
""To be in one of these shows and then watch what comes out at the other end, I think would be very strange,"" the reality TV editor reflects.
Endemol Shine did not respond to Olivia's claim that she was misrepresented in the gym storyline. Married at First Sight boss McWilliams has previously told the Daily Mail: ""We don't manufacture storylines or characters. What you see is a reflection of absolutely what's happened on the show.""
When the show finally goes to air, the final phase of a villain edit begins: controlling the narrative.
Now, program makers try to ensure that no narratives that contradict the edit make it into the media.
""They would remind me in a very threatening way before every single media interview that I had signed a [non-disclosure agreement],"" Olivia says.
This becomes a problem for Olivia, because when the show goes to air, the backlash is swift.

When the nude photo storyline airs, all hell breaks loose.
A petition is launched arguing that Olivia should be reported to the eSafety Commissioner for ""image-based abuse"". About 120,000 people sign on.
A second petition demands she be prevented from working with children as a teacher — her life dream.
Domenica files a police report, and Olivia engages a high-profile defamation lawyer, costing thousands.
Olivia is summoned to a meeting with HR at the school she works for. Fearing what's coming, she offers to resign. Her teaching career was over before it had even begun.
""My mum's a teacher. If I had finished my teaching degree, I would be an eighth-generation teacher,"" she says.
""They made me look like a criminal on the biggest show in Australia. And I didn't sign up to be framed as a criminal.
Even Olivia's mum, Sandy, was waking to messages from strangers saying, ""you should have aborted your child"" and ""she killed her father, didn't she?""
""I probably felt like vomiting for a couple of months straight every day,"" Sandy says.
Olivia's mother Sandy says she has also experienced online trolling since her daughter appeared on MAFS. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)
As Olivia became increasingly suicidal, her mum, Sandy, reached out to the show.
When a representative phoned her, there was ""absolutely no sympathy"", Sandy says.
""She did say to me, 'Oh, Olivia's done worse things than what you've seen on screen' or something.
""I absolutely thought that was a threat.""
Endemol Shine declined to comment on this interaction. Olivia says she did receive some sessions with an independent mental health professional, who she felt was ill-equipped to advise on this magnitude of trolling.
For the penultimate episode, Domenica hosted a viewing party with posters of Olivia's face crossed out. Some of Olivia's former friends from the show joined in as the MC incited a cheer from the crowd: ""Can I get a 'one, two, three, F*** OLIVIA!""
Olivia is not the only person to experience suicidal ideation after appearing on a reality show.
In the UK, the suicide of former Love Island contestant Mike Thalassitis led the country's media regulator to rule that British shows must protect the mental health of cast members.
Rebecca Trelease was once a reality TV star herself.
""I wanted to experience the joy I watched on TV for so much of my life,"" she explains.
""But I also thought they'd see us as humans still. I guess I was naive.""
Since her own ""villain edit"", she's spent years studying the industry, including what researchers have dubbed ""post-reality TV stress syndrome"".
""You become really enveloped in this world,"" she explains.
""You're not allowed phones and you're completely cut off so you cannot have any perspective anymore.
""And so when you all of a sudden exit that production, you are very much on your own. For me, I had a lot of panic attacks. I lost like 12 per cent of my body weight in the two weeks after being eliminated, it was that stressful.""
Much like PTSD, participants find themselves triggered by things they associate with the production.
""Putting on make-up would feel like I'm about to be filmed. I'm about to be interrogated. I found myself always checking if I had a microphone on, and it's like this constant panic, 'Am I being surveilled?'""
""It needs to be acknowledged that there is something traumatic, you will change on the other side of this.""
Olivia says while she can take accountability for what she did and said on the 2022 season of (MAFS), she felt ""devoured"" by the show. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)
During the audition process, contestants are subject to a psychological screening process. But Dr Trelease says this can actually be weaponised against them.
""If you were to push back at any point and say, 'I haven't been able to handle being on the show', it's like, 'Ah, but you have a medical certificate saying you could be!'
Dr Trelease says there's a growing movement in the US to unionise participants, under the slogan ""Cast members are people, not props"".
In a landmark 2019 ruling, Australia determined that reality TV participants were employees entitled to compensation for psychiatric injuries inflicted by shows.
But the reality TV editor says in the edit suite, little has changed.
""I don't know if I've ever heard anyone be overly concerned with the contestants' mental health.
""We're not psychopaths, and we're not trying to hurt people or anything, but most of the time I think there's this attitude of, 'They know what they've signed up for … so we're just going to make the best show that we can.'""
Following the broadcast of MAFS, Olivia spent months suicidal and unable to find work.
So, in an ironic twist, she turned to a forum that wouldn't care that she was a villain: OnlyFans — the platform at the centre of the nude photo scandal.
Within a few days, she says she made tens of thousands of dollars. But in the flurry, one thing led to another.
Listen for free on ABC Listen on your mobile device.
""I went beyond my boundaries really quickly. And when you do that, you always have to escalate,"" she says.
""I've posted some things that I wish I could take back.
""It'll impact the rest of my life, what I've done for OnlyFans.""
Olivia is unsure she can continue with OnlyFans, but says she's still unable to get a regular job — people still shout from car windows when she walks down the street, or glare at her in cafes.
""If I was teaching, I'd be so proud of myself. Even when I was just an admin assistant, I'd watch the kids get better and better and be so proud of them.
""There's nothing with OnlyFans that I'm really proud of.""
It's been more than two years since MAFS first aired. But every time Olivia thinks the hate is cooling off, the show comes out in a new country.
""I think the last country it aired in was Sweden. And I only found that out because I started getting death threats in Swedish.""
Olivia Frazer's mother Sandy says her daughter will never escape how she's been portrayed. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)
On the flip side of the feud, Olivia's nemesis, Domenica, is also struggling: she told Background Briefing she's currently in a mental health care facility ""working through the trauma"" of the past few years, including how the photo scandal played out in the public eye.
""It's crazy: everyone's talking about what happened on that show at lunch for four months of the year,"" she says.
""I imagine [Olivia] was going through that same [scrutiny and abuse] but 10 times worse.
Olivia's mum, Sandy, fears her daughter will ""never escape how she's been portrayed"".
""I'm not going to defend everything that she did, and she has to wear that. But when you look at this season and you've got a guy who was an international drug smuggler and it hardly raises an eyebrow, and then you've got Olivia, who didn't like the fact that someone smashed a glass at her and that got pitched to being a girl-versus-girl battle — I have a real problem with that.""
Olivia says she can take accountability for ""what I said, and what actually happened"".
""But when you're that low and that dark and they know they're responsible for putting you there, and … they just let you be devoured… Yeah, there's something really f***ing wrong with that show.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-23/inside-out-2-film-brain-changes-puberty-child-new-emotions/103995788,Got your own Riley at home? Here's how Inside Out 2 can help you support your child through tricky new emotions,"Inside Out 2 invites us back into the mind of Riley, now a 13-year-old ice-hockey enthusiast on the cusp of high school — and puberty.
Literally overnight, her brain goes through a large-scale demolition and construction that sees Riley wrestling with four new emotions: anxiety, envy, ennui and embarrassment.
These emotions, along with the ""core emotions"" of joy, sadness, fear, disgust and anger, are now together operating a control panel hypersensitive to any and every emotion.
If this sounds like your household, you might be wondering how best to assist your child with these new emotions.
Much of Inside Out 2 is not only relatable but is also backed by science. As children enter adolescence, their brains go through rapid ""construction"", with new wiring designed for seeking out and prioritising social relationships with peers.
More emphasis is placed on risk-taking, to aid in exploration of novel experiences, fundamental to establishing their identity and sense of self.
Inside Out 2 | Official Trailer
Perhaps the most outward shift observed in adolescence is the broadening and deepening of emotional experience. Seemingly switched overnight, a once calm and content child now expresses novel and at times distressing emotions, with new levels of shifting intensity.
All of this ""newness"" can be overwhelming. So here is a quick guide to the emotions in the film, how to talk about them with your kids — and how to face them when they arise in your family.
The dominant ""new"" emotion for Riley is anxiety — a normal response to stress and challenge that ""activates"" us to engage in the tasks that move us towards our goals.
Ideally, anxiety encourages us to attend to activities that will reduce our stress long-term — think encouraging us to prepare for an exam. However, when anxiety takes over with too much intensity, too often, and makes us believe we cannot cope, it can stop us from behaving, thinking and feeling in healthy ways, and blocks us reaching our goals.
Inside Out 2 | Meet Anxiety
Parents can provide a frame of reference for anxiety — it is something we all need to feel sometimes, and it might be telling us something important to which we should attend.
However, it should not feel like it never leaves us alone, ""bosses"" us around, and keeps us away from the things or people that we care about.
Helping kids make healthy choices for their mental health can help reduce anxiety, such as regular exercise, prioritising sleep, and relaxation or mindfulness exercises. However, you know your child best. If you believe anxiety is frequently stopping them from doing the things they want and need to do, it may be best to seek help from a mental health professional.
Envy is the emotion felt when we lack something we desire that is possessed by someone else.
This emotion is particularly relevant in adolescence due to teenagers' increased capacity for self-awareness. With this new ability, we can feel painfully aware of what we don't have, be it an object, social status, skill or achievement.
Inside Out 2 | Understanding Envy
We again see an emotion that can motivate us, yet can also encourage unhealthy comparison and feelings of animosity.
Rather than tell ourselves (or our kids!) to not feel that way — which can actually make the emotion more intense — we can encourage responding over reacting.
Non-judgemental acknowledging of the emotion can help kids tolerate the potential distress of wanting what others have, and can encourage them to hold true two things at once: I can accept who I am and how I feel, while still wanting to self-improve.
Ennui is borrowed from French and is best described as a mix of boredom, weariness and angst.
Ennui is thought to be more prolific in adolescence, when young people feel disconnected and unclear about their role in mainstream society due to their status as no-longer-children but not-yet-adults.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
Occasional experience of ennui can initiate a drive to explore novel experiences, a process fundamental to identity development. However, persistent feelings of meaninglessness — or worse, hopelessness — might indicate more severe mental health concerns in your child.
Understanding for how long, and how intensely, children feel the complex emotion of ennui can help, but parents should try to not take it personally if their child ""can't be bothered"" (or are not yet able) to describe this complex state of being.
Even just letting our kids, and ourselves, know ""there's a word for that"" is likely to increase our tolerance of the anguish of feeling bored and listless.
In the movie, the emotions of embarrassment and sadness have an unspoken bond.
Memories that include these emotions are literally slingshot to the back of Riley's mind, so that they do not get tangled up in Riley's ""sense of self"" — who she is as a person.
Inside Out 2 | Embarrassment
Ultimately this backfires and we learn such emotions actually signal something important: the discomfort we feel when we've behaved in a socially unacceptable way can initiate us to repair our relationships (such as apologising!), helping us maintain our connection to others — a psychological need that motivates us all.
The instinct to protect children from discomfort is natural. However, showing our kids we can listen and empathise, without jumping in to ""fix"" how they feel, will assist with the ultimate goal of staying connected to us, even when they have done something they feel embarrassed about.
Many moments from Inside Out 2 could help spark a conversation with your child about the complex emotions that are normal when growing up.
Changes to Riley's ""personality"" islands see ""family"" island becoming more distant, its position of importance replaced by ""friendship"" island. Anxiety both idolises yet works against joy. There is the poignant question of whether feeling less joy is just a part of growing up.
Pixar president Jim Morris confirmed in May that the studio would be focusing more on IP expansion than original storytelling. It shows with Inside Out 2.
But, perhaps the best place to start is to adopt the mindset the core emotions adopt at the end of the film: make space for the good, the bad and that which seems to be a mix of both.
Modelling to your child you can tolerate and learn from two potentially contradictory feelings at once — in yourself and in them — will increase their capacity to do so, too, and is a hallmark of wellbeing.
And if that seems too complicated, take advice from Joy: ""New emotions are annoying at first, but they are good for Riley.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-22/michael-richards-interview-entrances-and-exits-memoir-seinfeld/104009786,How Michael Richards became Kramer and made a disposable character integral to Seinfeld,"Michael Richards put a lot of effort into crafting Kramer for the immensely popular sitcom Seinfeld.
""I combed every second-hand shop here in Southern California looking for a particular clothing out of the 60s,"" Richards told ABC News.
""And it was quite a quest.
""I'd built up a wardrobe. I probably had over 60 shirts and jackets and pants, but only two pairs of shoes. They were the shoes, down to the laces, that I felt comfortable in.""
Richards explains what went into becoming Kramer in his new memoir Entrances and Exits, which gives readers a behind-the-scenes look at the show.

Richards couldn't have anticipated the enormous success of Seinfeld, describing it as ""mind-boggling"".
""None of us saw that coming,"" he says.
""You do good work. And you see it's catching on, but not to that level. That was just extraordinary.""
Even the American network that screened it, NBC, didn't seem to have that much faith in the show initially, only commissioning it for four episodes.
The show ran from 1989 to 1998 and went out on a high, with the final episode attracting one of the largest audiences ever for a season finale.
Kramer was a crowd favourite and Richards won three Emmys for the role.
If you go back and watch the series, however, you'll realise he has a different name in episode one, and his first name — Cosmo — wasn't assigned to him till season 6. Richards put his stamp on what could have been a disposable character and made him an integral part of the show.

But Richards was so modest about his impact, that he was shocked into silence during an acceptance speech for an Emmy he didn't expect to win.
""I was speechless,"" Richards says.
""I would get on stage to receive I think the second Emmy and I couldn't speak.
""I just stood there looking around. And the audience that night started to laugh. They thought it was funny … I said, 'I really don't know what to say.'
""And I stood there for 30 seconds, not saying anything.""
Richards says people were patting him on the back backstage telling him how hilarious he was, but he was mortified that he hadn't thanked anyone. It wasn't an act like people had thought.
The curse of playing Kramer so well is that Richards struggled to land another substantial role when Seinfeld wrapped up, saying he was typecast.
The character is all casting agents could see when they saw his name pop up.
Richards says he was just doing his job on Seinfeld and had no idea how far it would go.
""I had a background in doing comedy, certainly in the area of eccentricity.
""Yes, I could be highly weird, and they wanted a highly weird next-door neighbour. So, I just worked each week to get the laughs.
""The material they gave me, I'd look it over and figure out how to get it to giddy up, just to get the laugh. Striving for the laugh.""
Richards isn't the only person in his family ""striving for the laugh"".
Always too critical of his own performances, Richards hadn't really sat down to watch Seinfeld until he was writing his memoir, taking in all nine seasons.

When asked what he learnt from his son's reactions to Kramer, after sitting down to watch the show with him, Richards says he learnt ""that Kramer had indeed arrived"".
""I mean, here's a generation … so many years have gone by and my son's laughing and getting into the show. Oh my. There are no words for it,"" he says.
""It's just a feeling of, I could say, great contentment to be there with my son enjoying the show like this.
""I think it's inspired him. He's got the fool. He's got the spark, so we'll see where that goes.
""But he's very inspired by comedy. He watches a lot of comedy.""
In season 4, episode 2 of Seinfeld, Kramer is arrested after being mistaken for a serial killer. He celebrates with Jerry and George when he is exonerated. (Supplied: Post Hill Press)
Richards says he would never push a career in comedy onto his son, but is happy to encourage an already active mind in that area.
""He already puts together little sketches and videos and he shows them to his class, and that's certainly a start.
""I mean, as a sixth grader, he's only 12, putting together these kinds of things is a big start.
""I didn't get into comedy until I was really 14, 15 years old, although I made my friends laugh years earlier, but so has he, so we'll see.""
The foreword to Entrances and Exits is written by comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who plays a fictional version of himself in the show that bears his name.
He's currently performing stand-up around Australia, with a second Sydney performance interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters this week.
Richards knows what it's like to be interrupted on stage.

In 2006, when a noisy group arrived during his stand-up comedy routine at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, Richards acknowledged them in a way that prompted one to call out ""You're not funny"".
Richards's infamous reaction to those three little words was caught on tape and went viral before things really went viral. This resulted in him ""cancelling himself,"" before people were really getting cancelled.
""It went deep,"" he says of his self-imposed exile and period of reflection.
Richards dedicates a chapter to this incident in Entrances and Exits, the memoir that has prompted him to re-emerge publicly 18 years later.
He's linked the rage he felt in that moment to a powerful slow reveal in his memoir, which ABC News has chosen not to publish so that fans can experience it for themselves the way it was intended.
Richards, who reads widely, put a lot into telling his story.
""I spent close to four years … finding the words for a memoir,"" he says.

Ms Garland was born in Grand Rapids, Minnesota in 1922, and was cast in the now-classic film in 1938 — when she was 16 years old.
Although the late actress wore several pairs of ruby slippers on set, only four remain today.

Memorabilia collector Michael Shaw lent one pair of slippers to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids in 2005, but they were stolen from their display case that summer.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recovered them in 2018, and the man who stole the slippers — 76-year-old Terry Jon Martin — pleaded guilty to theft of a major artwork in October last year.
He admitted to using a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case in what his attorney said was an attempt to pull off ""one last score"" after turning away from a life of crime.
Mr Martin received a sentence of time served because of his poor health.
In March this year, a second man — 76-year-old Jerry Hal Saliterman — was charged in connection with the theft.
Once the slippers were returned to Mr Shaw, the collector handed them off to a Dallas-based auction company.
The company will take the slippers on an international tour before offering them up to prospective buyers in December, and the town of Grand Rapids intends to buy them back.
A US man who has confessed to stealing a pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore while filming The Wizard of Oz receives no jail time but will pay a $US23,000 fine.
""We wanted to enable places that might not normally be able to raise the funds so quickly to have plenty of time to think about it and work out ways to do that,"" said Joe Maddalena, the auctioneer who previously sold two other pairs of ruby slippers.
""They could sell for $US1 million, they could sell for $US10 million. They're priceless,"" he continued.
Grand Rapids is fundraising at its annual Judy Garland Festival this weekend.
Funds raised at the festival will supplement the $US100,000 ($AU150,000) set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to purchase the slippers.
Mr Maddalena speculated on the town's chances of success.
""That'd be an amazing story. I mean, if they ended up back there, that'd be a fantastic story.""

Rihanna, Selena Gomez and Kylie Jenner are just a handful of stars who have launched their own cosmetic brands over the years, building empires in what has become a billion-dollar industry.
When a more natural aesthetic started trending, Hailey Bieber, Millie Bobby Brown and others launched their own skincare lines.
And while being famous doesn't guarantee success, the increasingly cluttered beauty space is growing yet again as some of the biggest names move into a previously untapped area.
Rihanna has amassed a net worth of $US1.4 billion ($2.1 billion) thanks in part to the success of her cosmetics line Fenty Beauty.
Upon its launch in 2017, the line made its mark by releasing 40 foundation shades — a range which has since expanded to include 50 skin tones.

The brand is co-owned by luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessey (LVMH) which allowed it to launch online and in more than 1,600 stores across more than 17 countries.
Soon after, Rihanna released a skincare line and a fragrance.
Now, the businesswoman has branched into haircare.
""You know how much switching my hair up matters to me,"" Rihanna wrote to her 151 million Instagram followers when announcing the new line.
Zara Wong, a brand consultant specialising in the fashion, beauty and lifestyle space, says haircare has been ""such a booming growth category.""
""Everyone's been really excited about skin and make-up, fragrance obviously has had a lot of attention,"" she told ABC News.

""But the next category which has been sort of seemingly untapped in the overall beauty industry I think is haircare — as well as body care.
""People are still buying haircare and bodycare products in a chemist but with everyone understanding there's different types of hair types [and] hair concerns, that allows more brands to enter the market or start up new categories that address those concerns.""
Whether it's Margot Robbie dressed in head-to-toe pink for Barbie, or Zendaya wearing a robot suit at the premiere of Dune's sequel, celebrities are using fashion to take their storytelling beyond the screen.
Graeme Hughes from Griffith Business School agrees, saying haircare is a ""significantly growing space.""
""It's worth about $US100 billion at the moment,"" he told ABC News.
""It makes sense for celebrities to be looking at putting a brand into that space.
While not yet as crowded as the make-up space, more celebrities are making their foray into haircare.
Jennifer Aniston, whose ""Rachel"" haircut was once the envy of millions of women around the world, launched her brand in 2021, as did Queer Eye's Jonathan Van Ness.
Actors Tracee Ellis Ross, Issa Rae, Taraji P Henson and Priyanka Chopra Jonas have all brought out their own lines as well.
But by far the most anticipated launch has come from Beyoncé, who released her haircare line Cécred (pronounced ""sacred"") earlier this year.

""I grew up sweeping hair in my mother's salon,"" the 32-time Grammy-winner wrote upon the brand's launch.
""I saw how she transformed hair by mixing mainstream products with textured haircare.""
While Beyoncé has had multiple fashion ventures in the past with varying success, this marks one of her most deliberate moves into the beauty space.
""She is quite reticent so she isn't very public-facing in a sort of spoken way that resonates with customers today,"" Ms Wong explains.
""[Cécred] could actually do quite well because it is addressing a market that is huge and hasn't been spoken to really so much before, except for in the last like maybe five years or so.""
The lines between beauty and wellness have become increasingly blurred over the years.

The wellness industry — which covers any kind of product, service or regime that assists you to become the so-called best, healthiest version of yourself — was estimated to be worth about $US5.6 trillion ($8.5 trillion) globally in 2022.
""Australia has a high propensity to spend on discretionary product, on luxury product, comparative to our population,"" Ms Wong says.
Mr Hughes says the wellness industry has ""absolutely"" merged with other industries — especially beauty.
""It really goes to the empowerment message that they really tend to push in that space and these products really being more than what they do, but what goes in them and also how it makes you feel,"" he says.
Skincare dupes are cheaper products that claim to match the look, feel, and effectiveness of more luxury offerings. But do they do what they say?
Just like with fashion, the beauty industry works in trends, Ms Wong says.
""Ten years ago make-up was all about contouring and trying to make yourself look like something else,"" she says.
""Whereas the last few years there has been sort of the pendulum swing where people are talking about embracing your natural beauty, embracing what you look like, and that's the same with hair.
""Most people tried to straighten their hair or perm their hair or manipulate their hair against what they were born with.
""More recently, the dominant conversation in haircare is about embracing natural texture and that kind of links to […] that wellness discussion.""
While celebrity founded cosmetics brands are nothing new, plenty of failed business ventures have proved that being famous doesn't guarantee success.
""Consumers are very switched on and they know that if a celebrity is just creating a brand or endorsing a brand just for financial gain, then consumers will back away,"" Mr Hughes says.
Ms Wong says the reason why some celebrity beauty brands thrive comes down to authenticity where the famous face ""seems like they really, truly believe in the product.""
""If a celebrity says 'this is my issue and this is what I've addressed with this product', I think that resonates really well,"" Ms Wong says.

Selena Gomez made a name for herself through being a Disney Channel triple threat, but in adulthood she's also become a businesswoman whose success has placed her in the same category as Rihanna.
Her cosmetics brand Rare Beauty launched four years ago with mental health and accessible packaging promoted as some of its core values.
Gomez is known for being open about her physical and mental health after revealing she has bipolar disorder and lupus, which required her to undergo a kidney transplant.
From Oprah to Reese Witherspoon, Kaia Gerber and now Dua Lipa — the celebrity book club trend has never been more popular. But do they have the same influence as they once did?
Last month, Time Magazine listed Rare Beauty in its list of 100 influential companies.
""I think it's really, honestly about putting what we believe behind it,"" Gomez told Time when asked what she believes her brand and Rihanna's have in common.
""Obviously I can't speak for her, but everything seems so true to who she is.""
As for what the future holds for the increasingly crowded celebrity-founded beauty market, Mr Hughes says inclusivity is key.

On October 11, 1991, cameras captured Jack Karlson dramatically protesting his innocence as police escorted him from the China Sea Restaurant.
One of those arresting officers, Stoll Watt, met with Mr Karlson at the same eatery on Wednesday to unveil plans for a documentary about the seminal moment and Mr Karlson's troubled life.
Jack Karlson became famous online after video of his arrest was widely shared — decades later, he shared lunch with Stoll Watt, who was one of his arresting officers. (ABC News: Morton Dobras)
What transpired during that arrest three decades ago became etched into Australian pop culture history.
Back in 1991, Mr Karlson had been enjoying lunch with a friend when police interrupted, swarming the eatery to arrest him.
They had believed Mr Karlson, a frequent guest at the restaurant, had been paying for lunches with stolen credit cards.
As he's escorted to a police vehicle, Mr Karlson looked at cameras capturing the incident and dramatically delivered the line, ""Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest"".
""Have a look at the headlock here. See that chap over there?"" he went on.

Mr Karlson then shouted: ""Get your hand off my penis! Get your hand off my penis! This is the bloke who got me on the penis before"".
Video of the rant has been watched millions of times, and the lines feature in popular memes on social media.
Speaking together on Wednesday, both are still surprised the incident gained the notoriety it has.
When it comes to the allegations of credit card fraud to pay for his lunches, to this day, Mr Karlson still maintains ""it was a case of mistaken identity,"" as he told ABC News Breakfast.
More than three decades after assisting with Mr Karlson's arrest, Mr Watt sat down to share a Chinese meal with him.
""[I was] released, I wasn't the person they thought I was,"" he said.
And that allegation of police touching his genitals? That was ""probably made up"" Mr Karlson admitted.
Mr Watt suggested Mr Karlson would've made a great detective in another life. (ABC News: Morton Dobras)
When asked if he was performing for the cameras, Mr Karlson said he can't remember his motivations at the time.
""It was a great line, I think he should have gotten the academy award,"" Mr Watt said.
""I think he would have been a great actor … I must say Jack would have made a good detective in a different line of work.""
Mr Karlson escaped jail three times. (ABC News: Morton Dobras)
The new documentary — The Man Who Ate a Succulent Chinese Meal, set to be released in early 2025 — will explore Mr Karlson's troubled past before the arrest.
He said most of his life, since the age of seven, has been spent in institutions, homes, and prisons.
He had been a criminal and escaped from jail three times.
Jack Karlson's friendship with Jim McNeil, his cellmate in Parramatta Gaol, changed the course of his life.
The ABC's Earshot recently retraced his misadventures including his first escape from Boggo Road Gaol in 1966, and when he jumped from a train on the way to his court hearing in Maryborough for breaking, entering and stealing.
But on Wednesday, there's one escape Mr Karlson said he's ""pretty proud of"".
It was the time he impersonated a detective and walked out of his court cell before trial, after he had been arrested in a stolen car carrying safe-breaking tools in Parramatta.
Mr Karlson has become unwell in recent years — developing prostate cancer, eye cataracts, and spinal problems — with his family launching an online fundraiser.

While you're hibernating, you can get up to date with the important entertainment news you may have missed over the weekend.
In a ceremony in Times Square on September 15, 2023, music mogul and founder of Bad Boy Records Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was honoured with the key to New York City.
""The bad boy of entertainment is getting the key to the city from the bad boy of politics,"" Mayor Eric Adams said at the time.
Combs has now handed that key back.
The mayor requested the key be returned, after the rapper and music executive was caught on camera attacking R&B singer and his partner at the time, Casandra Ventura, known professionally as Cassie.
Singer Cassie has issued her first public statement since CNN broadcast CCTV footage showing her being assaulted by rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs at a hotel. In an Instagram post, Cassie thanks her supporters and urges people to believe victims of domestic violence when they speak out.
Mayor Adams said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the footage of Combs attacking Cassie in a hotel hallway in Los Angeles in 2016, first broadcast on CNN in May.
""I strongly condemn these actions and stand in solidarity with all survivors of domestic and gender-based violence,"" he said.
While symbolic, the granting of the keys to the city is the highest honour a city can give an individual or an organisation, with the tradition dating back to medieval times.
Keys to Australian capital cities have been handed out to prominent people including the Matildas, the Bee Gees (Brisbane); Jørn Utzon, Nelson Mandela (Sydney); and Dolly Parton, Cathy Freeman, New Kids on the Block, Muhammad Ali (Melbourne). Singer Cher sparked outrage when her key to the city of Adelaide appeared on eBay in 2012.
Earlier this month, Howard University, a historically Black university in Washington DC, rescinded an honorary degree awarded to Combs, while ending a scholarship program in his name.
A lawsuit filed by Cassie against Combs has now been settled and, in a social media post, Combs said he was ""truly sorry"" for the attack.
The rapper is still facing numerous accusations of sexual abuse. His Miami and Los Angeles mansions were raided in March as part of an ongoing federal sex-trafficking investigation.

Kristina Ross has become the final-ever winner of The Australian/Vogel's Award for an unpublished manuscript by a writer under 35, with her debut novel First Year.
First Year is the debut novel from Kristina Ross, who is also a writer and producer for stage and screen. (Supplied: Allen & Unwin)
The book follows 17-year-old Maeve as she moves from Queensland to Melbourne to attend a prestigious drama school.
Rooted in Ross's own experience moving from the Gold Coast to Melbourne to train at the Victorian College of the Arts, First Year is billed as a book for fans of Sally Rooney's Conversations with Friends and Coco Mellors's Cleopatra and Frankenstein.
""I searched for a story like this when I was a young actor in training and just never found it,"" Ross told The Australian.
""I'm excited for readers to have a book that takes the craft of acting seriously. Often, actors will find the process is either inflated, or made a mockery of, and I wanted to rectify that.""
The prize includes publication, with First Year out now via Allen & Unwin. Past winners, including Tim Winton, Katherine Brabon and the late Gillian Mears, have gone on to become fixtures of Australian literature.
The two finalists for the 2024 Vogel were writer and actor Rob Johnson (Calamity Jane), for a collection of short stories, and Em Meller, for her novel about friendship between women.
However, after 44 years of incubating young literary talent, the $20,000 award has been replaced by the Australian Fiction Prize for an unpublished manuscript by an author of any age. The new prize, worth a total of $35,000, includes publication by HarperCollins.

The hype for Brat — the sixth album from British pop sensation Charli xcx — is very real. Even if you haven't heard its ravey, future-pop contents, you've likely been exposed to meme variations of its iconic green text if you've been online in the past week.
It's also one of the best-reviewed albums of Charli's career and her highest-charting effort in the US, debuting at #3 on the album charts (it also debuted at #3 in Australia).
In the pop star's native UK, however, Brat ended up being pipped to the post by… who else but Taylor Swift, whose latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, has now achieved a sixth non-consecutive week at #1 — her longest stint atop the UK charts.
Initially, the charts race was closely contested. On Thursday afternoon, the UK Official Charts said Charli xcx was on track for #1, until Tay Tay entered the ring with the release of a UK-exclusive version of The Tortured Poets Department.
Featuring live tracks and unreleased voice memos, the UK variant was only available for sale until midnight Thursday evening — the end of the chart tracking week — prompting a sudden surge in Swift streams and sales that kept her in pole position.
Charli stans were none too happy, accusing the Eras superstar of deliberately sabotaging Brat's chances of reaching #1.
Some have speculated the variant release was personal, pointing to the Brat song 'Sympathy is a knife', which is widely believed to be about Taylor Swift.
Do the main pop girlies really have beef? Or is the Taylor Swift juggernaut just too big to be stopped? Given the Eras Tour is currently rolling through Europe, it realistically could just be the latter.
Then again, Billie Eilish fans similarly lashed out at Swift last month, when the former's third album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, was kept from the top spot on the US charts by the latter pop billionaire unleashing three Tortured Poets Department variants in the same week.
Oh, and at last count? There are now a whopping 34 variants of Swift's new album out in the wild and smashing chart records.
Brat may have lost the sales battle but, with rave reviews and obsessive internet attention, it's arguably won the culture war.

The black-and-white drama — which bested Barbie and Oppenheimer in Italy's box office last year — stars the director as Delia, a woman in a toxic marriage in post-WWII Rome.
Announced on Sunday at closing night of the Sydney Film Festival, the jury celebrated the film's ""intensely relevant"" depiction of domestic violence:
""We relive every woman's struggle for equality through Cortellesi's ""Delia,"" we face the brutal cycles of domestic violence with an immense empathy that ultimately proclaims and affirms the virtues of democracy. [There's Still Tomorrow] deftly weaves humour, style, and pop music into a dazzling black-and-white cinematic event, then it delivers an ending that will take your breath away,"" the international jury said in a statement.
The film beat out 11 others in the Official Competition, including documentary Midnight Oil: The Hardest Line and Kinds of Kindness, Yorgos Lanthimos's follow-up to the Oscar-winning Poor Things.
A set of additional awards were also announced at the closing ceremony.
Director James Bradley was awarded the $20,000 Documentary Australia Award for Welcome to Babel, about Chinese Australian artist Jiawei Shen.

The inaugural $35,000 First Nations Award went to New Zealand filmmaker Awanui Simich-Pene for her short film First Horse, which follows a young Māori girl in 1826.
For her documentary Black Snow, American filmmaker Alina Simone won the Sustainable Future Award, for a film that ""highlights the urgent need for action to mitigate"" the effects of climate change.
The Dendy Awards for Australian Short Films also awarded five prizes, with Pernell Marsden winning best director for The Meaningless Daydreams of Augie & Celeste.
The 2024 Sydney-UNESCO City of Film Award, worth $10,000, presented since 2016 to an exemplary NSW-based screen practitioner, was presented to producer Debbie Lee.

Alternative rock royalty R.E.M. broke all our hearts when they split up in 2011, after a 31-year career that saw them strike that all-too-rare balance of remaining critically adored while dominating the charts.
""A wise man once said, 'The skill in attending a party is knowing when it's time to leave,'"" frontman Michael Stipe said at the time, and the band has remained annoyingly true to their word ever since.
Before being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in New York City on Thursday, the band granted a rare interview to American TV talk show CBS Mornings, where the following interaction took place.
Anthony Mason (CBS Host): What would it take to get you guys together one more time?
Mike Mills (bassist): A comet.
Bill Berry (drummer): Superglue
Anthony Mason: It ain't happening, is what you're saying?
Peter Buck (guitarist): No. It'd never be as good.
Which meant it was extra surprising when, the day after that interview aired, the four founding members of R.E.M. reunited for their first live public performance since 2008 (and their first with founding drummer Bill Berry since their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2007).
They performed just one song — a stripped back version of their iconic 1991 hit 'Losing My Religion'.

That said, don't hold your breath about this being the start of something bigger for the band. They remained adamant in their CBS interview that they'd pulled the pin at the right time, keeping both the band's legacy and their interpersonal relationships intact.
""We're here to tell the tale,"" Stipe told CBS. ""We're sitting at the same table together with deep admiration and … lifelong friendship. A lot of people that do this can't claim that.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-16/bluey-keeping-kids-connected-heritage/103965026,Wanting to raise bilingual children? Here's why these mums are using Bluey,"Known as Bù lǔ yī in China, Blæja in Iceland and Bluji in Lithuania, Bluey has proven so wildly popular internationally that it's been dubbed into more than 20 languages.
After capturing the hearts of children, adults and dogs worldwide it's been deemed a ""cultural ambassador"" for Australia.
Back home, the cartoon series is now also helping migrant families remain connected to their heritage.
Watching Bluey dubbed in Mandarin shows Yi Chen what an Australian-Chinese household might look and sound like. (Supplied: Jing)
Jing, who migrated to Melbourne from China in 2019, encourages her son Yi Chen to watch Bluey dubbed into Mandarin.
Yi Chen was born in Melbourne and mostly speaks English but Jing is determined to keep him connected to his Chinese heritage by raising him bilingual and speaks to him exclusively in her mother tongue.
""It's unimaginable if he doesn't understand his parent's culture and where he's from.
""How is he supposed to accept himself and his identity otherwise?""
Jing is raising her son to be bilingual to help with his future career prospects and preserve a connection to his heritage. (Supplied: Jing)
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows more than one-third of Australian residents like Jing and her Malaysian-Australian husband were born overseas.
And according to the 2021 census, about 5.8 million people speak a language other than English at home.
Bluey's duration, age-appropriate themes and positive messages make it popular among kids and adults. (Supplied: Ludo Studio)
Bluey's age-appropriate themes, snack-sized episodes, and accurate Mandarin translation made it an easy choice as a program for her active five-year-old to watch.
""He doesn't like to sit down and watch something,"" Jing said.
But she said he was more willing to watch Bluey because it was already part of his environment.
Jing and her husband take their son on regular catch-ups and play dates with his Chinese friends and their families. (Supplied: Jing)
Although there are plenty of Mandarin television programs from China for her son to watch, Jing said she wanted Yi Chen to have shared interests with his peer group.
For many migrants Bluey is a quintessential lesson in Australian sayings, dynamics, and culture.
""When [Bluey] plays games, they play similar or the same games to what my son plays.""
The ""cute"" illustrations of Vegemite bottles in Season Three's Pavlova episode even prompted Jing to try the polarising spread which she concluded was ""not bad"".
Jing and her husband make annual trips with their son to Malaysia and China to maintain ties with their family and culture. (Supplied: Jing)
When her husband is around, they switch to watching Bluey in English, which she says can also help multicultural families learn local English.
Seeing the cartoon dubbed in Mandarin makes Jing feel represented too.
Melbourne resident Lisa-Marie Hinton is another mother whose children watch a dubbed version of Bluey — in their case German.
She speaks with Australian-born sons Lenny, 4, and Henry, 2, exclusively in the language of her homeland so they can become bilingual and communicate with German relatives who don't speak English.
Along with Bluey, Lisa-Marie ensures that more than 90 per cent of the books and programs they watch and listen to are in German except for when their father, who only speaks English, is around.

Lisa-Marie said it was part of preserving their German customs, like taking off one's shoes before entering the home and the types of meals they prepare.
""[Lenny] loves sauerkraut and vinegared gherkin,"" she said.
""[He] is actually very proud he's German … he loves that he's a mix.""
Like Jing, Bluey's Australian references have left a mark on Lenny too.
""But he loves the word 'mate', and he asked me recently to make a pie which is really unique because I've never ever made a pie and I probably wouldn't choose to eat a pie myself.
""Obviously, we love Australia and accept that culture and want them to grow up with that but for me it's really important that they understand where they come from.""
About 90 per cent of the books Lenny and Henry read are in German. (Supplied: Lisa-Marie Hinton)
Lisa-Marie's goal is for her boys to flow seamlessly between speaking English and German, something Lenny has started doing.
""He can from one minute speak English to his dad, then speak to me in German,"" she said.
Henry has started following easy instructions too, even with her ""strong south German accent"".
Lisa-Marie encourages Lenny to practice speaking German by pretending she doesn't understand English despite having lived in Australia for 14 years.
But she sometimes slips up and catches herself speaking English mid-sentence because she thinks in English and reverting back to German is hard.
""[Speaking multiple languages is] actually a lot of effort and I can see why a lot of people give up on that,"" she said.
Lisa-Marie is currently on the waitlist for a German kindergarten and would like to see more bilingual schools open in Australia.
One day she would also like to send her sons to school in Germany for a term for language immersion.
For now she remains their teacher, which can be hard.
""Sometimes Lenny gets very frustrated, and he hates that I push him into speaking German but there's no other option,"" she said.

Joseph Lo Bianco, a professor of language and literacy education from the University of Melbourne, said preventing language attrition among migrant families took a lot of effort.
Professor Lo Bianco said children of migrant parents were under enormous pressure to stop using their home language as they learned English because of a desire to fit in.
He said most schools only offered a maximum of three hours a week of classes in a limited number of languages so it was up to parents and extra-curricular programs to make up that shortfall.

Professor Lo Bianco said parents could adopt a policy that designated a particular time, room, or activity where only the home language was spoken.
He also said the routine needed to be enjoyable and predictable so children knew to expect that at dinnertime, for example, only Greek could be spoken.
He said as children matured and started to expand their ability to articulate themselves with more complexity in English, it was important the parents were able to keep that level of expression up in their home language.
He said parents needed to ensure their language skills, vocabulary and expressions remained contemporary the longer they lived in a new country.
Professor Lo Bianco recommended using online streaming, apps, and books so parents could introduce new words, concepts, and activities to expand their vernacular in the home language.
""Young people prefer to sound like their peers rather than their parents,"" he said.
Watching Bluey in German provides a ""free language lesson"" for Lenny and Henry. (Supplied: Lisa-Marie Hinton)
He said learning a language also involved learning new cultural norms.
Trying to focus on both aspects at the same time could be challenging so the Australian backdrop to Bluey was useful.
""Bluey is a wonderful asset because it's centred in Australia and gives children the sense that multilingualism belongs here.""",Gillian Aeria,Sun 16 Jun,0

Hundreds of thousands of people tuned into a livestream of Jin's military discharge.
BTS, an acronym of Bangtan Sonyeondan or ""Beyond the Scene,"" is a Grammy-nominated South Korean pop phenomenon.
Jin, whose full name is Kim Seouk-jin, had carried out 18 months of duty and is the first member of BTS to wrap up the mandatory national service that put the group's music career on hold.
The 31-year-old is the oldest member of the K-pop group and appeared emotional as he hugged his colleagues at a military base in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi province.
He was wearing his army uniform and a black beret.
""But it was so fun for the last year and six months. It's such a relief, I met so many amazing people.""
According to South Korean media, several members of BTS applied for leave to celebrate the occasion, including rapper RM, who played the group's hit single Dynamite on a saxophone.
BTS has been nominated for a Grammy five times. (Hybe Corporation)
Jin was the first member of the group to enlist in the military in December 2022.
Four other members of the ensemble began their military service a year later in December 2023.
The boy band is expected to be reunited after they all complete their duty in 2025.
Jin has plans to kick off his post-army activities with an hour-long performance in Seoul.
K-pop is one of South Korea's largest cultural exports and BTS have been at the forefront of this after debuting as a group in 2013.
The country requires all able-bodied men aged 18-28 to serve in the military or social service for a minimum of 18 months.
In 2020, it changed the law to accommodate globally recognised K-pop stars, allowing them to delay signing up till the age of 30.

Céline Dion on stiff person syndrome battle: 'My voice will be heard'
According to the Columbia University Irving Medical Center, stiff person syndrome is not what you think it is. We rely on our muscles all day, every day, and sometimes those muscles can rebel against us, according to Yale Medicine.
SPS is a progressive autoimmune and neurological disorder. Among the rarest of diseases, it affects fewer than 5,000 people in the United States.
Spasms can be very strong and may cause you to fall if standing. They can sometimes be strong enough to break bones.
The spasms may be worse when you're anxious or upset. Sudden movements, loud noise, or touching can also trigger involuntary spasms.
If you're living with this condition, you're more prone to falls because of a lack of stability and reflexes. This can increase your risk for severe injuries and even permanent disability.
Symptoms can vary depending on the type of SPS you have. But they can include:
The cause is unknown, but researchers suspect it may be the result of an autoimmune reaction where the body attacks nerve cells in the central nervous system that control muscle movement.
Reaching a diagnosis can be difficult. Stiff person syndrome is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, psychosomatic illness, or anxiety and phobia. A definitive diagnosis can be made with a blood test that measures the level of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies.
No. But there are treatments available to manage symptoms.
Symptoms can be kept under control with medication such as:
Additional treatments have been shown to help prevent the disease process including:

This is what he remembers,"It may have been six decades ago, but John Devlin still remembers in vivid detail the moment he was selected to open for The Beatles' only tour of Australia and New Zealand.
The rock'n'roller, known as Johnny Devlin, had already made a name from himself as the Elvis Presley of his homeland of New Zealand, and was representing up-and-coming artists at his Sydney-based talent agency.
""It was a fluke,"" Devlin said.
One of his clients, Paul Wayne, stormed into his office shouting, ""The Beatles are coming! Could you get me on their show?""
The now 86-year-old, who lives in the New South Wales Illawarra region, admits he had no idea who the band was.
But he phoned an industry connection, Don Black, to inquire on behalf of Wayne.
""A couple of days later, [Mr Black] rang me back and said, 'Well how would you like to do the show?'"" Devlin said.
""I got the shock of my life.""
He was apprehensive about the offer at first, given the sheer popularity of The Beatles and the thousands of adoring teenagers who crowded their every movement.

This week is the 60th anniversary of the historic tour which gave rise to the socio-cultural phenomenon of Beatlemania.
The Daily Telegraph reported at the time, ""[The Beatles] were the high priests of pop culture … girls wept, screamed, grimaced, fainted, fell over, threw things, stamped, jumped, and shouted"".
The band touched down in a wet and cold Sydney before performing 32 concerts across eight cities in both Australia and New Zealand.
Fans wait for The Beatles during 1964 world tour.
It was Devlin's job to open each show with his own rock'n'roll flare, and then introduce The Beatles to the roar of thousands of loud and unruly fans.
Devlin said the biggest fan fuss occurred at the first Wellington concert on June 22, 1964, which almost cut the three-week tour short.
""[John Lennon] threw [his guitar] down on the floor … he said, 'We can't hear ourselves sing',"" he said.
Devlin said he later persuaded sound engineers to boost the on-stage speakers by confirming the band would compensate any damage.
""And it just so happens that in the audience were there were three guys from the New Zealand Airforce with a decibel meter. [They] measured the sound in the Town Hall that night as equivalent to a Boeing 737 flying at 60 feet.,"" he said.
When asked what he wanted in return for improving the band's audio quality, Devlin said, ""a photo with The Beatles"", and the group obliged.
""They dressed up … paid a photographer … in Auckland. I actually own the photograph.""

Reflecting from the comfort of his home in Corrimal, Devlin said another fond memory of touring with The Beatles was his choice of outfit.
""It was a black leather suit and white skivvy … I thought, 'Well I'll be the first pop star in Australia to wear a leather suit on stage',"" he said.
""Somebody asked Paul [McCartney], 'I believe leather is all the go overseas!' And he said, 'No, it's out.'
John Devlin said he led a rock'n'roll music career inspired by Elvis Presley. (ABC Illawarra: Brooke Chandler)
""So, I looked a bit stupid there … [Plus] every time I did a show, it didn't breathe so there was a lot of sweat.""
However, Devlin said he formed a strong bond with each band member.
""I've thought about it over the years, and that's my favourite Beatles song.""

The letter and new song are aimed at an industry that has so far failed to accept No Promises, a band led by Garvey and her music partner Eric Collier, who between them have more than 50 years of experience as musicians.
""I've been writing and writing and writing,"" Garvey told ABC News.
""And Eric and I have been putting out some great music.
""And I just feel like we're just constantly ignored, I think because of our age, mostly.

OPEN LETTER
""Dear Australian music industry,
What do I have to do to break through and be heard? Why does commercial radio constantly ignore new Australian talent? Am I … too old? Too Assertive? Not pretty enough? Do I not fit your mould? Did I not pay for plays?
Good music does not have an expiration date and neither should women in this Industry. Just listen. Right now I'm in my prime. I've never sung better or written better. And I'll keep releasing great songs until you have no choice but to listen. Just listen.
Check out my previous releases with my amazing music partner Eric Collier. Then ask yourself why our music isn't all over the radio already.
Song writing and performing is not a choice for me; it's ingrained in my soul. The melody flows within me, deeper than you'd ever believe. Songs hit me in the middle of the night, when I wake up, in the shower, while I'm driving, even in the middle of gigging. I can't ignore them and I won't. I'll keep churning them out whether you listen or not. I'm not going away because I have something to say.
We have so many amazing artists here in Australia but the industry isn't listening. Thank God for community radio, the Aussie Muso's champion. To everyone else, play more NEW Australian content. It's time. It's my time.""
Sincerely yours,
Janine Garvey

Five little words.
When they appear on a television screen, viewers know they're in for a treat.
Limited series and movies based on sporting underdogs, horrific crimes and tales of endurance usually translate to success for streaming giants like Netflix.
But the leap from real life to the screen can be messy and content creators can find themselves in hot water in pursuit of 'real-life' storytelling.
This week, a Scottish woman who says she is the real-life ‘Martha’ filed a $255 million lawsuit against Netflix over her alleged portrayal in the hit limited TV series Baby Reindeer.
But how often does this actually happen? And in what ways?
The case of Fiona Harvey, the woman who says she is the real-life inspiration behind a character in Richard Gadd's Netflix limited series, is complex, says David Rolph, professor at the University of Sydney Law School, because it leans into the legality of both 'self-identification' and the consequences of internet sleuths.

Ms Harvey is seeking $US170 million ($225 million) in damages from Netflix, claiming she has been harassed by people from all over the world because of the portrayal of her as Martha on the show.
Professor Rolph, one of the leading academic experts in Australia on defamation law, says Mr Gadd is in a unique position because he sought to anonymise the character yet Ms Harvey came forward — more than likely due to detective work of the chronically online.
""There is an interesting question of causation there: if you self-identify as the inspiration of the story, can you actually blame the other person for the damage to your reputation?"" Mr Rolph said.
In a statement issued to ABC News, Netflix says it ""intends to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd's right to tell his story"".
Audiences across the world were glued to their screens as they watched the bizarre true story of con artist Anna Delvey, aka Anna Sorokin, unfold in Netflix's limited series Inventing Anna.
One person was not so impressed.
Former Vanity Fair staffer Rachel DeLoache Williams, who was shown on screen abandoning Ms Sorokin before betraying her to authorities, sued Netflix claiming she was falsely depicted as “unethical” and ""greedy"" in 16 different statements on the show.

Ms Williams' attorney Alexander Rufus-Isaacsm said the case stood ground on the basis the show had used Ms Williams' real name.
""If they [creatives] want to make an unpleasant character, they can't use a real person's name unless everything they say is absolutely gospel,"" he said in an interview on the Law&Crime Network Podcast.
Professor Rolph said that in order to produce a limited series or a feature film, there has to be some artistic license.
""But, people might approach the level of truth that they expect from something that is based on 'real life' to vary from person to person, and that of course can create difficulties, for content creators and also for the people who are represented in what they produce,"" he said.
The wrongful conviction of a group of teenage boys over the rape of a jogger was turned into Netflix miniseries When They See Us, which ran into legal trouble over its alleged portrayal of the one of the main characters.
Former Manhattan prosecutor Linda Fairstein sued Netflix and film director Ava DuVernay over her portrayal in the true story of the 'Central Park Five' case, alleging they portrayed her as a “racist, unethical villain.”
However, Ms DuVernay remained firm in her stance in her portrayal of Ms Fairstein, issuing a statement that sparked conversations far and wide.
""I believe that Linda Fairstein was responsible for the investigation and prosecution of the Central Park Jogger case that resulted in the wrongful conviction of five innocent Black and Brown boys,"" Ms DuVernay said in the statement.
The case settled outside of court, with Netflix donating $US1 million to a social justice organisation advocating for those wrongly incarcerated, and Ms Fairstein not receiving any money.

The Queen's Gambit, Netflix's limited series about chess prodigy Beth Harmon, was unique in the way that is was marketed as fictional but still ran into legal trouble — just from one singular line.
In 2022, Georgian chess master Nona Gaprindashvili sued Netflix over a line in the show's finale that incorrectly stated that she ""never faced men"".
According to the suit, Ms Gaprindashvili, the first woman to be named a chess grandmaster, played against and beat ""the best male chess players in the world"", Forbes wrote.
She alleged in the suit the singular line was a ""grossly sexist and belittling"" representation of her and sought US$5 million in damages.
Netflix told Forbes that Ms Gaprindashvili's case ""has no merit"", yet agreed to settle a few months later.
Professor Rolph said that is was very clear that people like to consume stories that are true or based on truth, but will continue to raise a range of ethical questions and legal questions.
Sometimes, it doesn't matter if a creator says their show is based on a true story or not, he said.
""The question will always be, looking at what has been published, broadcasted, or streamed, whether a reasonable person could identify the person suing with what's been depicted"".

The first comic — Superman #1 — sold for 97,890 pounds ($189,089) against a starting price of 20,000 pounds to an Australian buyer.
The comic, by DC, is listed as number 3 on Overstreet's Top 100 Golden Age comics — which is considered the authority on comic book grading and pricing — and is exceptionally rare.

The comic book Golden Age ran from 1938 to 1956 and was when many well-known superheroes were created including Superman, Batman, Captain America and Wonder Woman.
The debut of Superman in 1938 in Action Comics #1 is considered the beginning of the Golden Age as his popularity helped make comic books a major arm of publishing.
Superman #1, released a year later, was the first time a comic book had been created for a single character and set the precedent for many comics to follow.
The issue, written by Jerry Siegel and illustrated by Joe Shuster, retells the origin story of Superman and features a pin-up back cover.
It was also the first time a superhero appeared in more than one comic and the first time DC included a letters column for fans to write in.

A copy of Batman #1 also fetched a massive 31,375 pounds, more than five times its starting price of 5,000 pounds.
Batman #1 is considered the fifth most important Golden Age comic by Overstreet.
The 1939 comic was Batman's first self-titled comic, following his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 in the same year.
The comic, believed to be written by Bill Finger and illustrated by Bob Kane, features four stories — The Joker, The Giants of Dr Hugo Strange, The Cat and The Joker Returns.
It also debuts two of Batman's famous foes, the Joker and Catwoman.
Jonathan Torode from Excalibur Auctions said there was fierce bidding for both comics on the phones, online and in the room.
""Interest came from around the globe, with the Superman comic finally winning out to an Australian buyer,"" he said.
He said, with the exception of one comic sold without a cover, this was the first time the comics had sold in the UK and had set a new record in the UK and in house.

Fiona Harvey has filed papers in the US District Court for the Central District of California suing the streaming service for defamation, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violations of right of publicity and more.

She is seeking $US170 million ($255 million) in damages.
This includes $US50 million each for actual damages, compensatory damages including mental anguish and profits, plus at least $US20 million of punitive damages.
Baby Reindeer is currently the most watched TV title on Netflix but some fans are taking the real life story of a stalker and the man she stalked too far.
Ms Harvey had flagged a possible lawsuit when she appeared on Piers Morgan Uncensored claiming she was falsely depicted as an obsessed stalker in Baby Reindeer and was the real-life inspiration behind the character Martha (played by actor Jessica Gunning).
Ms Harvey claims she has been harassed by people from all over the world because of the portrayal of her as Martha on the show.
She says Netflix included many of the real phrases she used to communicate with Richard Gadd — the writer, actor and comedian who created and starred in the series — and made very little effort to mask her identity including descriptions of her job as a lawyer.
Gadd portrays a fictional version of himself called Donny Dunn in the program, which has been a major hit for the streaming service.
He had reached out to fans on social media asking them to stop trying to track down the real people from the series.

Ms Harvey states in the lawsuit:
""The lies that Defendants told about Harvey to over 50 million people worldwide include that Harvey is a twice convicted stalker who was sentenced to five years in prison, and that Harvey sexually assaulted Gadd.
""Defendants told these lies, and never stopped, because it was a better story than the truth, and better stories made money.
""And Netflix, a multi-national billion dollar entertainment streaming company did literally nothing to confirm the ""true story"" that Gadd told.
""As a result of Defendants' lies, malfeasance and utterly reckless misconduct, Harvey's life had been ruined. Simply, Netflix and Gadd destroyed her reputation, her character and her life.""

Applegate has opened up about the depression she's experiencing caused by her Multiple Sclerosis on the latest episode of her podcast Messy, recorded months ago, but released this week.
""This is being really honest,"" Applegate said to her podcast co-host Jamie-Lynn Sigler, also an actor living with MS.
""I don't enjoy living. I don't enjoy it. I don't enjoy things anymore.
""If someone's like, let's get up and go for a walk and or let's go get a coffee … I don't enjoy that process.""
Applegate was diagnosed with MS almost three years ago, while Sigler has had MS for about 23 years.
Applegate spoke about her Emmys appearance, during which she was led on stage by Emmys host Anthony Anderson.
Referring to it as ""the television thing,"" the actor said it took a lot out of her.
""That was like the hardest day of my life,"" Applegate said.
""It started at 11 o'clock in the morning and I didn't get home till 9:30 (pm).
""I think I slept for two days straight after that. I couldn't function.""
Sigler comforted her co-host, acknowledging that it's ""hard to live in a disabled body"".
""But what makes it harder is when you compare it to how it used to be,"" she said.
Applegate opened up further.
""I'm in a depression right now, which I don't think I've felt that for, like, years.
""Like a real f***-it-all depression, like real depression, where it's kind of scaring me too a little bit, because it feels really fatalistic … I'm trapped in this darkness right now that I haven't felt like that in, I don't even know how long, probably 20-something years.""
Applegate said she called her therapist and would see her the following week.
""I have avoided therapy since I've been diagnosed because I'm so afraid to start crying and that I'm not going to be able to end crying.
""And so my way of doing things is to make fun of myself or, you know, at that stage the first thing that came out of my mouth was literally self-deprecation because I could feel myself going into that space of where I wasn't going to be able to stop or read what I'm supposed to read without, I don't know, making people laugh or making them feel more comfortable about it.
""I mean, I was so disabled that I slurred the word disabled.""
Sigler said what most people thought about Applegate at the Emmys.
""How you reacted in that moment was perfect,"" she said.
""In that moment, you do need to break it up with humour and laughter, because that's how you get through these … big moments.""
Sigler said Applegate also needed to have those moments where she can break down, cry and ""sit with it"" with a professional who can guide her through it.
""And this is also why medication exists,"" Sigler said.
""Thank God there are therapies and modalities, but also medication to help people through this, and there's nothing wrong with that.""

Applegate said she was experiencing tunnel vision at the time the podcast was recorded and was upset about having to put her acting career on pause.
""I'm sad about it,"" Applegate said.
""I wasn't sad about not having to get up early.
""I'm really fine with that and getting in a car and driving some place and people touching my face with the make-ups and the hairs and the things. I'm totally fine with not doing that for a minute, but I do miss creating.""
She chided herself for indulging in her sorrow.
""I can't believe it's going to be three years since diagnosis in June,"" she said.
""And I'm still sitting here like boohoo, woe is me … but … I'm still mad about it.""
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).
In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibres and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body.
Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage or deterioration of the nerve fibres.
Symptoms can differ greatly from person to person and over the course of the disease, but common symptoms include:
The cause of MS is unknown but there are certain factors that may increase your risk of developing it:
There are no specific tests for MS. Instead, a diagnosis often relies on ruling out other conditions that might produce similar signs and symptoms, known as a differential diagnosis.
There is no cure for MS. Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, reducing new radiographic and clinical relapses, slowing the progression of the disease, and managing symptoms.

Here's what you may have missed in entertainment news over the weekend.
Jennifer Lopez is having a nightmare of a year. First, she was forced to spend $US20 million ($30 million) of her own cash to make her quasi-autobiographical film that critics rushed to call ""bonkers"" and a ""bizzaro trainwreck"", then everyone made fun of her suspiciously vague bodega order (ham and cheese on a roll, orange drink — IYKYK — and a small bag of chips), and now she's had to go and cancel her entire US arena tour!
Jennifer Lopez reclaims her wild rollercoaster of a love life from our judgmental gaze  in new musical.
The This Is Me…Live tour was slated for 30 dates, hitting massive arenas all around the US — but now they are no more.
The first signs of struggle appeared in April, when seven dates were quietly cancelled amid reports of struggling ticket sales. The tour was also rebranded from ""This Is Me… Now"" to ""This Is Me… Live | The Greatest Hits"" in an apparent attempt to broaden its appeal.
But despite the reports of lacklustre sales, team J.Lo told fans the cancellation was due to the star wanting to slow down a little.
""Jennifer is taking time off to be with her children, family and close friends,"" representatives told fans in an official newsletter.
The statement also included a short message from Lopez herself.
""I am completely heartsick and devastated about letting you down. Please know that I wouldn't do this if I didn't feel that it was absolutely necessary. I promise I will make it up to you and we will all be together again. I love you all so much. Until next time…"" she said.
But Jenny from the Block isn't the only established artist struggling to fill arenas. Indie stalwarts The Black Keys announced last week that they were cancelling their September US arena tour, promising to reschedule dates for a more ""intimate experience for both fans and the band"".

Donald Trump was already a household name when he ran for US president in 2016, and the reality TV show The Apprentice had a lot to do with that.
The show — which sees people compete for the chance to get a one-year starting contract to promote one of Trump's properties — ran for 15 seasons from 2004, with the man himself hosting 14 of them.
Donald Trump may have been found guilty on all counts for illegally covering up a hush money payment, but the verdict will not prevent the former president from pursuing his campaign to retake the White House.
But a former producer on ""the show that changed everything"" has written a tell-all essay about what really went down behind the scenes of the show, now that his 20-year non-disclosure agreement has expired.
In the essay, Bill Pruitt writes that The Apprentice ""elevated Donald J. Trump from sleazy New York tabloid hustler to respectable household name"". While he was shown to demonstrate ""impeccable business instincts and unparalleled wealth"" on the program, in reality Pruitt says Trump had ""barely survived multiple bankruptcies"", his ramblings were carefully edited and he made comments that were ""misogynistic as well as racist"", most of which were caught on camera but not aired.
""By carefully misleading viewers about Trump — his wealth, his stature, his character, and his intent — the competition reality show set about an American fraud that would balloon beyond its creators' wildest imaginations,"" Pruitt writes.
Pruitt says when deciding between two finalists – Kwame Jackson and Bill Rancic – Trump said in a recorded conversation: ""I mean, would America buy a n***** winning?"" in reference to Jackson. Rancic won that season of the competition.
ABC News has contacted Trump's team for a response and is yet to hear back, but a spokesman for Trump's 2024 campaign issued this statement to Slate, which was published in the essay: ""This is a completely fabricated and bullshit story that was already peddled in 2016.""
In an MSNBC interview with the Reverend Al Sharpton, Jackson says the comments are ""water off a duck's back"" given Trump didn't make them to his face, which he says would have played out very differently.
But Jackson goes on to say the comments would have potentially swung the election had they come out in 2016, and therefore Pruitt is ""a day late and a dollar short"".
He told Rev Sharpton: ""Trump has made it OK to be racist in America.""

A musician who needs little introduction, Thom Yorke is best known as the creative, angel-voiced force out front of Radiohead — one of the most culturally significant and critically acclaimed bands of their generation. But he's never done a solo tour to Australia before, until now.
Yorke has announced a solo Australian tour, playing two dates each at Melbourne's Sidney Myer Music Bowl and the Sydney Opera House Forecourt through October and November. Find dates and ticket details here.
Care for a rare evening with the seminal frontman of Radiohead and The Smile as he re-imagines his back catalogue?
""I will be alone on stage trying a new kind of solo show thing, playing versions of songs from my recent and not so recent past,"" Yorke said in a statement.
It's his first show on our shores of any kind since Radiohead toured back in 2012.
This is welcome, if surprising, news for fans, given they were anticipating a visit from The Smile – Yorke's new band alongside Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, and drummer Tom Skinner.
What's in store? Expect Yorke to re-imagine material from Radiohead and The Smile, as well as his various solo and soundtrack projects — ranging from 2006 album The Eraser through to Confidenza, the score to the 2024 Italian drama of the same name.
Here's a possible taster: Yorke performing Radiohead track Bloom, the opening track from 2011's The King of Limbs, in solo piano mode.

Eminem has a new song out called 'Houdini', and there are a couple of striking things about it.
First, it's an unapologetic throwback to the rapper's big, early hits. It sounds like an updated version of his 2002 smart-arse anthem 'Without Me', and the video – which features guest spots from the likes of Snoop Dogg, Dr Dre, Pete Davidson and Shane Gillis – also directly references that hit.
Eminem — Houdini
Second, its chorus is an interpolation of the Steve Miller Band's 1982 classic rock anthem 'Abracadabra'. And that song's writer couldn't be happier.
In a letter posted to Facebook over the weekend, Steve Miller gushed about Eminem's artistry and respect for those who came before him.
""You are one of those timeless originators building something new on a long musical legacy of original artists,"" Miller wrote.
""There aren't many artists who take the time or make the effort to stand up for themselves and credit and respect their influencers at the same time. Marshall Mathers you are an exception and on my short list of people who respect the art. To be included in your process feels good while I'm still singing and playing the music I love.""

Adele caused a bit of a social media stir over the weekend.
On Saturday night, the first night of Pride Month in the US, an audience member at an Adele show in Las Vegas reportedly decided they needed to tell the singer their feelings about the longstanding celebration of LGBTQIA+ pride. It didn't go well.
In a fan-posted Instagram clip, Adele is seen barking back at an audience member who apparently yelled out ""Pride sucks"" while the singer was addressing the crowd at a show as part of her Las Vegas residency.
Social media has applauded Adele's ferocious rebuke, with countless comments praising her allyship.
However, other videos and accounts from the night suggest the heckler actually yelled out ""Work sucks"", which seems a lot more on brand for an Adele audience and makes sense considering what Adele was talking about.

At least it's good to know she's willing to fight back against homophobia, even if this was a misunderstanding. And seeing Adele swear her head off is always entertaining.
In related news, fellow pop star Katy Perry celebrated the start of Pride Month by posting a doctored version of NFL player Harrison Butker's infamous commencement speech from last month.
""Fixed this for my girls, my graduates, and my gays,"" Perry wrote on Instagram. ""You can do anything, congratulations and happy pride.""
The edit of the video makes Butker's message pretty different to the divisive comments he offered around LGBTQIA+ movements and women in the workforce when addressing the Benedictine College graduating class.
""I would venture to guess the women here today are going to lead successful careers in the world,"" he now says.
""I say all of this to you because I have seen it firsthand: how much happier someone can be supporting women, and not saying that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.""

""My dad was in the chorus of Oklahoma when I was about three,"" Dyer tells ABC News.
""And I just thought that that was normal. And all dads were doing musicals.""
She laughs: ""But it wasn't. It was delightfully different.""
Dyer (Love Child, Wakefield) and her co-star/husband Patrick Brammall (Offspring, Glitch) are celebrating the season two return of their Binge series Colin From Accounts.
Dyer plays Ashley and Brammall Gordon, described as two single (ish) complex humans brought together by a car accident and an injured dog.
That dog is Colin (or Zak in real life), who is just as laid back behind the scenes as he is on camera.
""He's really chilled out,"" Dyer says.
Adds Brammall: ""He's very much his character.""
When season one premiered in December 2022, buses and billboards showed up in capital cities advertising the show.
Binge was clearly keen to push its new delightfully dorky comedy with the unassuming title, a title that at first glance appears so bland it strikes up an element of inquisitiveness.
It worked. The promotion, the curiosity factor and the genuinely funny and heartwarming scenes captivated viewers.
So did the chemistry between the real husband-and-wife duo who star in, wrote and created the series.
People tuned in, with season one becoming the Foxtel Group's most-watched original scripted series of all time.

The series has also travelled to more than 100 countries including the US and UK.
Brammall told ABC News the couple just wrote a show they found funny and thought was good, but had no idea whether it would resonate.
""I remember at the end of season one, we were like 'well, we like it' but you just never know how it's gonna go,"" he says.
Dyer too is grateful people love it so much at home and abroad.
""The response from the Brits was outrageous,"" she says.
""They just got so behind it. It was so great.
""We were flattered because we find them the funniest people in the world, I think.
""We find the Brits so funny.""
Season two, episode one sees Brett (Michael Logo) get a hilariously confronting surprise. (Supplied: Joel Pratley)
Dyer says the show has also found a captive audience in Ireland. As ABC News has previously reported, the Irish take their humour seriously.
""Someone told me last night that they have a lot of family in Ireland and there's a lot of Irish people who love it,"" Dyer says.
""And I'm like 'they're even funnier. That's so cool.'""
The series is also critically acclaimed, winning Best Narrative Comedy Series at the 2024 AACTA Awards and a Logie for Most Outstanding Comedy Program, with Dyer and Brammell both winning the Silver Logie for Most Outstanding Actress and Most Outstanding Actor, respectively.
The first three episodes of season two, made available to media, have just as much heart as season one.
And Dyer is hoping episode four sparks conversations between people in relationships, with Brammell describing that episode this way: ""It's funny, it's also a bit cringe and it's also real.""
That really encapsulates the whole series.
Brammall and Dyer have described the series as ""pretty PG"". (Supplied: Joel Pratley)
Of the intimate scenes between the real-life couple, Dyer and Brammall have kept that to a minimum and even what you do see is ""pretty PG"".
Apart from some of the discussions the pair have, there's very little raunch.
""It's not really in the tone of the show,"" Brammall says.
Dyer says the family show nature of the program was accidental.
""Because we haven't put a lot of sex-sex stuff in, I think it lends itself nicely to a multi-generational view,"" she says.
""We've had so many people message us and say, I watched this with my grandson, or me and my mum watched this.
Colin From Accounts is a real family affair behind the camera too.
Dyer's sister Madeleine directed an episode in season one and has returned to direct an episode in the second season.
""She's a director and I make a TV show, so if I don't help her out, I can't really show up at Christmas, can I?"" Dyer joked.
""But thankfully, she's excellent. And she just gets it.
""This show is so tone-dependent and my sister and I have a very similar sensibility.
""We were fed the same diet of television and film growing up… but she's also just extraordinarily talented with lights and cameras and angles.""

Brammall says the director's cut in episode six is spot on.
""She just nails it.""
Brammall and Dyer also can't wait for the audience to see the final episode in season two of the eight-part series.
""I'm looking forward to how people respond to the finale,"" Dyer says.
""That's a big one.
""I'll be getting on the socials for that one, babe.""

The students began campaigning after they realised Black would be in town touring with his band Tenacious D.
Ringwood Secondary College teacher and director of the production Lauren Rowe told ABC Radio Melbourne that it was not an impossible dream, as Black was known for his spontaneous interactions with fans.
""I hope he'll see … and want to come and see the kids and support them because they're so excited about it,"" she said.
In the video message to the rockstar the students could be heard chanting:
""Oh lord of rock Jack Black, please grace us with your mighty love.""
The Tenacious D frontman responded to the plea overnight, saying that while he wished he could attend the production, he would be busy with touring commitments.
""Ringwood Secondary College, are you kidding me? You're doing School of Rock? I love it — so touched,"" Black said in the response.
""And I wish I could come see it, but unfortunately I'm going to be rocking!"" He said.

Award-winning Australian showrunner, writer and director Tony Ayres (Clickbait, Stateless, Fires) says he wouldn't have necessarily even expected the series to be a hit in the UK, where it originated, let alone the rest of the world.
He says the success of shows like Baby Reindeer, The Bear and Beef demonstrate that the TV industry needs to take risks to appeal to audiences.
""None of those shows on paper look like sure-fire global hits,"" Ayres told ABC News.
""A chef having a nervous breakdown and having to go and make beef sandwiches.
""A road rage incident between two Asians.
""A guy getting stalked and a story of male sexual assault… you do have to be courageous. And that's where the surprise hits come from.""
Tony Ayres says Baby Reindeer, The Bear and Beef don't sound like sure-fire hits on paper, but they have been global success stories. (Supplied: Tony Ayres productions)
Ayres is the the founder and executive producer of Tony Ayres Productions, a founding member of Matchbox Pictures and the co-chair of Future Vision – an inaugural global television summit that will be held in Melbourne in July.
Headline guests include Emmy award-winning creator, writer, executive producer and director of Beef Lee Sung Jin; Co-showrunner, executive producer and director of the Emmy award-winning series The Bear Joanna Calo, who has also written on Hacks and BoJack Horseman and the award-winning co-chair Bruna Papandrea (Big Little Lies, The Undoing, The Dry, Nine Perfect Strangers).

""There are Australian shows that are cutting through and there always have been, and so I think we have to remember that,"" Ayres says, pointing to Colin From Accounts as an example.
""I think that Future Vision is really aimed at sort of trying to fertilise the soil that allows us to make more of those kinds of shows, and to try to encourage the bravery and the passion that allows something like a Baby Reindeer, or a Beef or The Bear to actually happen.
Actor and director Daina Reid (The Handmaid's Tale, Run Rabbit Run) will be a moderator and speaker at Future Vision and says ""it's all about risk"".
""Ironically, being the most unique will connect with more people,"" Reid told ABC News.
""We want to connect. And we also want to understand ourselves by seeing what someone else went through.""
Daina Reid, Elisabeth Moss and Michelle MacLaren on the set of Shining Girls. (Supplied)
The theme of Future Vision is courage, with Reid saying the temptation in a contracted industry is to play it safe and try to appeal to everyone, but successful shows are often unique and particular.
""Anything that breaks through and not just in our business, pretty much in any business, you take a risk and you hit it and you change the way things then follow.""
Baby Reindeer is currently the most watched TV title on Netflix but some fans are taking the real life story of a stalker and the man she stalked too far.
She says while taking a risk can be scary, sticking to a prescribed formula doesn't guarantee results.
""In Australia, we've got a smaller population. So, the way that anything was going to be economically successful in our business, you had to get the most metaphoric bums on seats, the most ratings.
""So, it is that thing of going 'well, how can we reach the most people?' And it ends up being a story that might be a little bit more general.
""We're going into a different world now. The world of streamers, the world of competition.
""And sure, we could continue to do things that appeal to everyone, procedurals this, that, but that's not taking a risk. That's not breaking through.
""That's not The Bear. That's not Beef. That's not Baby Reindeer, [or] The White Lotus.
""It's about taking a risk and banking on it.""

Ayres says it's become important to attract a global audience to Australian content.
The new Heartbreak High is quickly amassing a cult following. It’s also highlighting just how many other reboots are struggling to give audiences meaningful representation.
""I think that in terms of whether it's possible to do an Australian show just for the Australian market, I actually think it's harder and harder because of the cost structure,"" he says.
""It is possible, but you're making a pretty small show.""
With television becoming more expensive to make, Ayres says there's an economic argument to why creatives should try and deliver their content to as broad a global audience as possible, but there's also a cultural argument.
""For instance, Bluey is the biggest show in the world,"" Ayres says.
""And American kids are now speaking with an Australian accent, which I love.
""And I just sort of think, there is something great about having a pride in our culture and being able to sort of say, yes, we can speak to audiences.
""It's our common humanity, which is the connecting point.""

Ayres says shows like Boy Swallows Universe, Heartbreak High, The Slap and Nowhere Boys, which he worked on with Reid, are examples of shows that cut through internationally.
But he says attracting eyeballs at home remains a priority.
""I think the key is that to appeal to an international audience, we actually still have to first appeal to an Australian audience.
""We still have to make work that's very specific to Australia.
""And if we make it well enough, then I think there's a chance of appealing to an international audience.""

The fourth song on the set list is I Try, which went to number one in Australia and landed at number one on the Billboard Top 40 charts.

""I fought with my label, because I thought that it was too wordy,"" Gray told ABC News.
""I thought it was too complicated. Most songs are really repetitive.""
Gray says she's given up trying to predict a hit.

Gray didn't always have plans to be a singer.
""It was a pure accident that I became an artist,"" she said, having stumbled on songwriting first.
Born Natalie McIntyre, the singer was bullied at school because of her voice and even stopped speaking in public for a period of time to avoid rejection and humiliation.
Even now, she says people occasionally mock her voice.

The film beat 21 other finalists, including entries directed by Francis Ford Coppola and David Cronenberg.
As a wrap is called on Cannes Film Festival — with Sean Baker's darkly funny film Anora winning the coveted Palme d'Or — interest has moved away from the blockbuster movies to other drama from the event.
Three women of colour — singer and actor Kelly Rowland, Dominican actor Massiel Taveras and K-pop star Im Yoon-ah — have now all spoken out about how they were treated as they were ushered along the red carpet.
Rowland was attending the premiere of Marcello Mio on Tuesday when she was forcefully led up stairs by a pair of ushers, who formed a barrier with their arms behind her. In video circulating on social media, Rowland can be seen sternly talking to one of ushers, and has since given a statement to the AP alleging she was racially profiled.
Days later, Taveras was also moved along at the premiere of The Count of Monte Cristo, seemingly by the same usher. The actor's dress included a giant train adorned with a painted image of Jesus Christ; while she tried to display the look over the stairs, the female guard put her arm up against Taveras's body, corralling her onwards and ruining the photo. Taveras can be seen pushing the woman away.
Yoon-ah, who performs as Yoona, was also moved along at a screening of Horizon: An American Saga. Combined, the three incidents have stirred social media users to call for the guard involved in all altercations to be fired.
Cannes Film Festival has repeatedly come under fire for its treatment of people of colour, and in recent years has worked towards increased diversity in its jury and film selections.
In 2022, film critic Valerie Complex wrote about the repeat microaggressions she's experienced as a Black woman attending the festival, including ushers and guards repeatedly checking her tickets, ID and bags with added scrutiny.

From Bette Midler to Kanye West, savaging celebrities is a time-honoured South Park tradition. And over the weekend, a new episode of the long-running animated series took aim at Lizzo.
Titled The End of Obesity, the episode parodies the recent popularity of weight loss drugs Ozempic and Mounjaro. A running gag concerns an alternative pharmaceutical called Lizzo that is prescribed in conjunction with listening to the flute-toting pop singer's music.
In one scene, a doctor prescribes the fictional drug to lead character Eric Cartman and notes:
""She's a really good singer who talks about body positivity, and just being happy with the way you look. I want you to listen to Lizzo five times a day, and watch her videos just before bedtime. I'm afraid you'll have to be on Lizzo for the rest of your life.""
So, what does Lizzo herself make of all this?
""That's crazy!"" Lizzo says in a TikTok video where she live-reacts to the South Park roast. ""My worst fear has been actualised. I've been referenced in a South Park episode.""
Ultimately, after watching along, she handles being skewered particularly well: ""I just feel like, damn, I'm really that bitch. I really showed the world how to love yourself and not give a fuck to the point where these men in Colorado know who the fuck I am and put it on their cartoon that's been around for 25 years.""
She concludes: ""I'm gonna keep on showing you how to not give a fuck.""
The South Park parody comes after Lizzo's request to dismiss a lawsuit filed by three of her former dancers, accusing her of sexual harassment and weight shaming, was denied.
Lizzo has described the claims as ""false"" and ""outrageous"", saying in a statement that she was ""not the villain that people and the media have portrayed me to be"".

The fifth entry in George Miller's Mad Max franchise has had a relatively muted opening weekend, despite glowing reviews. With a whopping $US168 million ($253 million) production bill, it's likely many were disappointed that it only nabbed $US58.9 million ($88.8 million) globally.
George Miller's Mad Max series has extracted a surprising amount of mileage from its rusty tank of guzzoline.
Furiosa: A Max Max Saga was projected to make $US40-45 million in the US alone, but instead landed at an estimated $US31 million ($47 million), tying with The Garfield Movie.
Analysts (via Variety) speculate it's a combination of issues, including Furiosa being a prequel to 2015's Fury Road, plus a generally quieter season for films. Recent other would-be blockbusters like The Fall Guy, If and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes have also struggled to break big.
Meanwhile, those on Twitter who did watch it are all making the same joke:
The film, starring Chris Hemsworth and Anya Taylor-Joy, was filmed in Australia and is our country's most expensive film production to date.

Design team A&A – comprised of Australian industrial designer Adam Goodrum and French marquetry artisan Arthur Seigneur – has won the 2024 Melbourne Design Week Award with a work called The Kissing Cabinet.
The pair have collaborated since 2017, combining contemporary furniture design with the centuries-old craft technique of straw marquetry. The painstaking technique — which became popular in Art Deco furniture design — involves applying fine strips of top-shelf French rye straw to an underlying timber layer, to stunning kaleidoscopic effect.
A modern twist on straw marquetry: Arthur Seigneur and Adam Goodrum
The prize-nabbing work pays homage to the kind of mechanical furniture that was popular in the 1800s and often featured concealed chambers: When The Kissing Cabinet opens, it reveals a hidden compartment, and when it closes, the design resembles a pair of kissing lips.
The work sold for $280,000.

The annual award is presented as part of Melbourne Design Week — Australia's largest design festival – and winners are bequeathed with industry cred and a cash prize of $5,000.

Lady Gaga is back in her controversial era.
The slashie star is currently promoting Gaga Chromatica Ball, a new HBO concert film released over the weekend, showcasing her 20-date 2022 world tour.
However, the pop star is facing criticism online after casually revealing she performed a quarter of the Chromatica Ball shows while testing positive for COVID-19.
""I did five shows with COVID,"" Gaga revealed to audible gasps during a Q&A at the Los Angeles premiere of the film.
""I shared it with everyone on my team. And I said, 'I don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable at work, and you don't have to perform and you don't have to work that day, but I'm going to do the show.' Because I just didn't want to let all the fans down.
""And the way that I saw it also is the fans were all putting themselves in harm's way every day coming to the show.""
Lady Gaga's Chromatica Ball concert film is now streaming on Stan. (Supplied: HBO/Warner Bros.)
Gaga's comments sparked backlash on social media, with commenters labelling her actions ""reckless"", ""wildly irresponsible"" and ""hypocritical"".
""This is the same artist who insisted that only vaccinated fans could attend her concerts"" wrote one commenter on X.
""Disgusting … this isn't something to brag about,"" wrote another.
""Careless and absolutely wreckless [sic],"" complained yet another.
While some Little Monsters (that's Gaga fans, fyi) have defended the musician, others have expressed their disappointment and even considered revoking their fandom.
Meanwhile, other Gaga enthusiasts are delighted that Gaga Chromatica Ball concludes with the announcement they've been waiting for: LG7, aka her seventh studio album.
""I am in the studio every single day,"" Gaga said during the LA Q&A. ""It's nothing like anything that I've ever made before. I love to break genre and I love to explore music.""

The Brisbane Writers Festival officially launches on Thursday May 30, but things kicked off a little early for fans of smutty fantasy.
Known for her smash-hit sapphic fantasy series The Roots of Chaos, Samantha Shannon didn't realise she was a lesbian herself until she started writing the books. The British author appeared in an early special event last week, celebrating the 10th anniversary of her debut novel, The Bone Season.
The festival officially begins, though, with the First Word, a keynote speech from an eminent First Nations writer. This year, Miles Franklin-winning Goorie author Melissa Lucashenko (Edenglassie; Too Much Lip; Mullumbimby) will lead the way.
As well as platforming a range of writers and thinkers, the Brisbane Writers Festival features numerous events diving into deeper issues in the literary world — from how gender impacts writing, to the myriad ways queerness can be expressed, to the difficulties and joys of writing about art.
And First Nations curators Melanie Saward and Lenora Thaker have pulled together a wide variety of First Nations offerings — from Anita Heiss pushing for more Blak romance novels, to a look at the healing properties of telling one's story through the Dreaming Inside anthology, which shares the voices of incarcerated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

If you need help immediately call emergency services on triple-0
""Thank you for all the love and support from my family, friends, strangers and those I have yet to meet,"" Cassie writes in an Instagram post.
""The outpouring of love has created a place for my younger self to settle and feel safe now, but this is only the beginning.""
The 2016 surveillance footage depicts Cassie walking down a hotel hallway in obvious distress, before Combs is seen pursuing her.
He then grabs her and throws her to the ground, kicking her twice, before dragging her by the arm along the floor.
The edited footage later shows Combs throwing a glass object.

""Domestic Violence is THE issue,"" Cassie wrote in her post.
""It broke me down to someone I never thought I would become.
""With a lot of hard work, I am better today, but I will always be recovering from my past.
""Thank you to everyone that has taken the time to take this matter seriously.
""My only ask is that EVERYONE open your heart to believing victims for the first time.
""It takes a lot of heart to tell the truth out of a situation that you were powerless in.""
In a civil case filed in November last year that was settled a day later, Cassie sued Combs alleging repeated abuse, including rape and physical assault.
Similar lawsuits have since been filed by others.
The court documents filed by Cassie outline an incident at the InterContinental Century City hotel in which Cassie claims Combs ""became extremely intoxicated"" and punched her in the face, giving her a black eye.
The lawsuit states that after he fell asleep, Cassie tried to leave the hotel room, but as she exited Combs woke up and pursued her, throwing glass vases in the hallway at her.
The court documents state that Combs paid $US50,000 ($75,000) for the hallway security footage.
In a December 2023 social media post, Combs denied the claims in the lawsuit, but earlier this week, after the security footage leaked, he issued an apology, posting a video to Instagram on Sunday night local time with a caption stating he was ""truly sorry"".
""I was f***** up,"" he said on the video.
""I mean I hit rock bottom. But I make no excuses. My behaviour on that video is inexcusable.
""I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.
""I'm disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it, I'm disgusted now.
""I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab.
""I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to being a better man each and every day.""
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
In a statement sent afterwards to ABC News, Cassie's lawyer Meredith Firetog, Partner at Wigdor LLP, said his apology was disingenuous.
""Combs's most recent statement is more about himself than the many people he has hurt,"" she said.
""When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday.
""That he was only compelled to 'apologise' once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no-one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.""

Cassie has appealed to her fans to show support to people in their own communities who are victims of domestic violence.
""I offer my hand to those that are still living in fear,"" she wrote.
""Reach out to your people, don't cut them off. No one should carry this weight alone.
""The healing journey is never ending, but this support means everything to me. Thank you.""
Reactions to her post included prayer hands and heart emojis from singer Kelly Rowland, and actor Taraji P Henson and singer and actor Chloe Bailey posted: ""We love you so much Cassie,"" with a heart emoji.
Combs reportedly won't be charged for the hotel assault with the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office explaining it won't pursue a case because the incident appears to fall outside California's five-year statute of limitations.
Combs has been hit with a new federal lawsuit this week, with model Crystal McKinney accusing him of sexual assault.

But a new study has found the routine to American singer Tina Turner's 1973 song Nutbush City Limits was invented by the New South Wales education department.
The research was a collaboration between the University of South Australia and Edith Cowan University in Western Australia.

University of South Australia sociologist Jon Stratton said instructions for the Nutbush were distributed to teacher training institutions as a teaching aid in 1975.
""Teachers were concerned to get some dance that school kids … would find interesting and want to do,"" Professor Stratton said.
""Dances have been used for years as part of physical education and creative arts and it was in that context that the Nutbush was quite literally invented.
""It was put together and then distributed through a teachers' meeting.""

The study also found the moves for the dance differ between states and territories, and that the original inspiration could have been a line dance that dates back to the 1950s.
""It's possible that the Nutbush was based on the Madison — it's also likely that some schools actually taught the Madison,"" Professor Stratton said.
There have been attempts to create a world record for the number of people dancing the Nutbush at one time, with the benchmark standing at 6,594 at the 2023 Mundi Mundi Bash in remote NSW.
Legendary pop singer Turner, who died in May last year, wrote the lyrics to the song which refer to her childhood hometown, Nutbush in the US state of Tennessee.
The song was released in 1973 but did not make it into Australian music charts until March 1975.
""First of all, what [the dance] did was put Nutbush City Limits back in the charts. This is one of the ways of tracking when the Nutbush became popular as a dance,"" Professor Stratton said.
""It climbs into the top 10, first in New South Wales and then in Victoria and Queensland.
More than 6,500 festival-goers set a world record at the Mundi Mundi Bash. (Australian Story: Erin Semmler)
Despite the dance propelling the song to the top of the Australian charts years after its release, Professor Stratton said there wasn't any evidence Tina Turner knew about the dance at the time.
""Outside of Australia, the Nutbush doesn't exist,"" he said.
Edith Cowan University visual and cultural studies professor Panizza Allmark said they were inspired to research the routine following an episode of Hamish and Andy's Gap Year.
The Australian comedy duo visited Tina Turner's family in the US and asked them to join in on the dance — but that they were puzzled.
Professor Allmark said the ""intergenerational"" dance was still perfect for primary school children.

""There's no hand touching, there's no sweaty hands,"" she said.
""You can dance on your own but you're following in a line and you can learn the steps as you go along.
""It's a bit awkward with the legs kicking but it's pure joy.""
Professor Stratton attributed its longevity to its persistence in classrooms.
""It hasn't stopped being taught in schools,"" he said.
He singled out the song's ""strong rock beat"" that makes it easy to dance to, but said the Nutbush was quintessentially Australian.
""Somebody puts on Nutbush City Limits, a whole pile of Australians get up and dance to it,"" Professor Stratton said.
""This is what happens in London for example: put on Nutbush City Limits at some party, all the English people go, 'Oh yeah, boring, don't dance to that these days'.
""All the Australians get up and do the Nutbush and they're going, 'Ah you're Australian too, I didn't realise that'.",Imogen Hayne,Fri 24 May,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-23/doctor-who-tardis-bus-stop-western-australia-wheatbelt/103867124,Meet the man who built a life-size TARDIS for his Doctor Who-loving family,"Tucked away on a country road in southern Western Australia is a hidden monument to one family's love of their favourite doctor.
Amongst the farmland along the Wandering-Narrogin Road, in Western Australia's Wheatbelt — far away from the streets of London — a distinctive police phonebox sits at the end of a driveway
The replica TARDIS, from the British TV program Doctor Who, was built by Narrogin local Rob Shepherd to be a bus shelter for his daughter, Clancy, but has since become a pilgrimage sight for travelling Whovians.
In the long-running show, the TARDIS — famously bigger on the inside than it is on the outside — serves as the eponymous Doctor's time-travelling spacecraft.
Roadside country TARDIS attracts international visitors
A lifelong fan of Doctor Who, Mr Shepherd passed his passion down the family tree to Clancy
""I grew up watching it. I suppose I was a little bit scared of it,"" he said.
""I remember my mum coming into the room once, and she saw me watching with one hand over my eye.
The TARDIS appeared in the first Doctor Who episode in 1963. (ABC News: Jamie Thannoo)
When Clancy started taking the bus to school, Mr Shepherd decided to turn the opportunity to build a bus shelter into a real passion project.
""My wife said, 'Well, we'll go and get a water tank like everyone else and cut the end out of it',"" he said.
""And I thought, 'I think we can do a bit better than that.'
""Being a Doctor Who fan and growing up with it, I've always wanted to build a TARDIS.
""We found plans for a 1947 London Police box, which is like what the doctor would have had.""
A trove of memorabilia can be found inside the replica. (ABC News: Jamie Thannoo)
With lights, sound effects, gizmos and memorabilia, Mr Shepherd described the replica as a labour of love.
But there is a lot of scrutiny when it comes to a fanbase with an eye for detail like the Whovians — the name for the dedicated followers of the TV series.
""I had one mate call in when I'd finished it, and when he looked down, the first thing he said was 'the locks wrong'.
""He said, 'It has be a Yale Lock, not a Lockwood Lock.'""
It has been six years since Rob completed the replica. (ABC News: Jamie Thannoo)
The TARDIS went up in 2018, and has drawn the attention of drivers passing by ever since.
Amongst bushland and farms, a blue phone box certainly stands out.
A guestbook inside the replica captures the experiences of many who have come to see it, with some travelling from across the world.
""We came all the way from Phoenix, Arizona — Tim + Sherri,"" reads one message.
""Just passing through. Ex-police constable from Thames Valley Police Force, UK. Had a great laugh,"" reads another message.
The TARDIS has attracted Doctor Who fans from across the world. (ABC News: Jamie Thannoo)
""Drove 300km for this sh*t!! Doctor Who sucks!!! Perkele!!"" said a message from one (presumably) Finnish tourist.
Checking out who has stopped by is a regular routine, linking this corner of the Wheatbelt to the world.
""When we come up to catch the bus, we see if anyone uses it,"" Clancy said.
""It connects us to all these different people, people from America and all sorts of places.""
The interior of the TARDIS is not quite as large as the one in the TV show. (ABC News: Jamie Thannoo)
One couple even wrote to let the Shepherds know they had gotten engaged at their bus stop.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-22/angie-mcmahon-reckless-like-a-version-making-it-through-tour/103874416,The song Angie McMahon puts on when she's anxious (which is often),"Angie McMahon might just be the voice of a generation.
Equal parts honest, self-aware, vulnerable and strong, her music is transfixing for its innate ability to make the listener ""feel seen"" in the deepest sense of that overused phrase.
We caught up with the Naarm-based singer-songwriter — who infamously sang about her inability to stop eating pasta despite having suspicions she was allergic, and just released her second album, Light, Dark, Light Again  — for a little Chit Chat ahead of her Making It Through Tour, which heads to Hobart this weekend, before a run of Melbourne dates next week.
Angie McMahon — Pasta
Yes! So I thought I had a gluten intolerance and I went to see a nutritionist and she helped me reset my gut lining, basically. She was basically like, ""Over the years you build up all this stuff in your gut and if we clear some of that away, then you will probably be able to eat pasta again.""
And so I spent a couple of months taking these herbal shots and these probiotics (which was really disgusting) but it ultimately reset my gut bacteria, so now I can eat gluten again.
Like, every single week. And lots of bread, I love bread. I know that life is probably a little bit more energetic without gluten, but it doesn't cause me the problems it used to cause me and it's just, yeah, one of my big joys.
It was actually a piano track by an artist called Gia Margaret, I think she's Scottish… called Hinoki Wood. She has this really beautiful atmospheric piano record and when I'm anxious, which is often, I put it on repeat and it's quite a short record so I just played it over and over when I was needing it.
Gia Margaret — Hinoki Wood
It's been really positive, actually. I was really scared about a wave of people hating it and telling me I'd ruined a classic, but that hasn't been the response. I mean, there are always a few trolls who want to point out the original is better, but people have held space for it.
I didn't know how it would be received but everyone's just been really kind and really encouraging. I'm really grateful for the comments I've seen and any that were negative had swarms of people responding in my defence, which was also really nice.
Angie McMahon covers Australian Crawl's 'Reckless' for Like a Version
Ultimately, I have a fear of getting in trouble, so I was scared I would get in trouble for using my voice or upsetting a certain kind of person. I woke up feeling really anxious the day that we did it, but that wasn't as powerful as the feeling that it was a good thing to do. And I really wanted to do it. I think, more than anything, it was just a feeling of vulnerability. And a feeling of being exposed and being in the line of potential criticism.
But that's so small compared to what so many people are struggling with right now, so [my feelings] ultimately didn't matter too much.
Missy Higgins knows a thing or two about living up to the expectations brought about by a stunning debut album. She invites fellow Melbourne singer Angie McMahon to chat about how she's dealing with the pressure.
With the lines on bloodlines and war crimes … I guess I feel like we are. I feel like that's what is happening in Gaza and that's what's being supported by the Western world, like our governments and the powers that be. And it's devastating.
I wanted to sing about it because I don't feel comfortable ignoring it.
And it doesn't feel like there's enough acknowledgement of it in the world of media and the world of the arts, so I wanted to shine a spotlight on that. But I also just feel like it's our responsibility to talk about it. So that's why, ultimately, I put it in.
I feel so empowered by other people who are also using their voices to talk about it. It's the kind of thing that causes anxiety, but that is also really beautifully balanced out by knowing that we're on the right side of history, and plenty of people are doing it, and this was just another format to do it.
Angie McMahon — Fireball Whiskey
I used to work at a bar and we would do shots of Fireball, probably because it was the cheap one the bar manager wouldn't notice was missing. But it became a trend in my life when we started travelling with the band and doing gigs — we'd do a shot of Fireball before the show. And then it just was, for a while, my drink of choice.
But then there was this awful night (that I sing about in the song) where it just made me so sick and I've never gone back and now I'm like, that stuff is disgusting and sickly sweet. Ah, I hate it. Whenever I smell it now I'm like, ""Get that away from me.""
I bit my older brother on the back when I was maybe five and drew blood… I really aggressively bit one of my siblings.
Angie (right) with the brother she bit ... on the back. (Supplied)
I know! It's actually genius because it's so hard to stop someone from biting you on the back …
The last photo I took was yesterday — my dog was waiting for his dinner and he was resting his head and you know when dogs rest their heads and it's just, ugh!
The most recent photo in Angie McMahon's camera roll? Her partner's dog patiently waiting for dinner. (Supplied)
It was a perfume someone mentioned to try and so I searched for it and then screenshotted.
The perfume McMahon rejected. (Supplied)
Well, then I went into the shops and smelled it and didn't like it. But I want to find a perfume. I haven't had one in a while that I like and when we go on tour, I thought I might get a new perfume to help capture the memories. You know how you have a different scent for each season of your life? But yeah, that was not it.
Gilmore Girls! I just finished season four. I've never watched Gilmore Girls before, so it's my first time. I'm finding it really interesting — it's so easy to get sucked into the world of Gilmore Girls.
Rory and Dean just slept together and Lorelai and Luke just kissed; that just happened last night.
Occasionally there's some really politically incorrect line in the script, so I'm questioning whether it's good for me, but I'm also really enjoying it. It's easy.
It was a dog video!
'Making It Through' is the name of the final song on the record and a big sentiment of my output at the moment, which is centring around self-compassion and just trying to encourage yourself to come out the other side of hard stuff and let that be enough. Gentle expectations, all that kind of thing. And resilience.
I was asking my band, ""What the fuck do we call this tour?"" and one of them was like, ""The Making It Through Tour!"" and I just immediately knew it was perfect.
It's one of my favourite songs on the record. At the end of the song it's got the lyric, ""Light, dark, light again,"" which is the name of the record, so there's the central theme living in that lyric. And the chorus lyric is ""Just making it through is OK"", and that's the whole idea.
On the tour, we're going to play basically the whole new record, some of the old stuff and probably a couple of covers, because we love playing covers and just try and make it as safe and joyful a space for people as we can.
Obviously some of my music is kind of melancholy and sad but ever since we were in lockdown, when I couldn't play gigs, I've tried to think more deeply and be intentional about what makes a show meaningful.
So we'll be dotting little things throughout the set that will hopefully encourage a safe and gentle space. I'll probably force — well, not force, but ask people — to do a tiny little bit of breathing with me.
Angie McMahon's Making It Through Tour continues until June 7.

But more on that later. Here's what else you missed in entertainment over the weekend.
Mining heiress and billionaire Gina Rinehart's reported requests to have The National Gallery of Australia remove Vincent Namatjira's unflattering portrait of her have officially gone global.
There was coverage of the controversy on the BBC and CNN, and comedian Dan Ilic is trying to raise $30,000 for the portrait to be displayed in Times Square.
It even merited a mention on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
Colbert — whose show reaches an average of 2.57 million US viewers — covered the fracas on Saturday night's show. He joked: ""I'm no art expert but in this portrait I believe the artist really captured her expression at the moment she saw this portrait.""
Namatjira was the first Aboriginal Australian to win the Archibald Prize. The painting was first shown in 2021 and is one of 21 of Namatjira's portraits of people who have shaped Australia on display at the NGA.

It's since emerged that there's a second Namatjira portrait at the NGA that Rinehart's supporters are lobbying to remove.
However you feel about an Archibald winner's right to artistic expression versus Australia's richest woman's right to flattering representation, it's safe to say that attempts to remove Rinehart's portrait have ensured it's reached a wider audience than the usual NGA foot traffic.

After three long years, Billie Eilish fans were blessed on Friday with her new album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. And in the short time since its release the pop star has garnered praise for her mature evolution.
The pop star/billionaire leverages her 'close' relationship with fans for immense gain.
All Billie Eilish fans wanted to do on Friday was sit back, relax and enjoy their evening with an album they'd been waiting years to hear, when all of a sudden they heard an aggravating, grating voice. It was pop superstar/billionaire real estate mogul Taylor Swift.
Mere hours before Eilish dropped her album, Swift announced she was releasing three digital download album variants of her recent LP, The Tortured Poets Department.
Swift's most recent digital variants are a must-buy for any fan … because they contain never-before-heard voice memos.
For those playing at home, this will bring the amount of variants Swift has released since the album came out to 22: six vinyl pressings, four cassettes, nine CDs, two original digital downloads and the three new digital variants.
Back in March, when Eilish was still promoting her album, she had a crack at artists who released multiple vinyl album variants, pointing out the negative effect on the environment.
""It's some of the biggest artists in the world making f***king 40 different vinyl packages that have a different unique thing just to get you to keep buying more,"" she told Billboard.
Some interpreted Swift's surprise variant drop as a shady retort.
This is not the first time Swift's antics around other artists' releases have been questioned.
In 2014 the singer took all her music off Spotify to protest artists' royalty payouts, but after three years of the protest not changing all that much, she put all her music back on the platform. The day she decided to return? Katy Perry's Witness album drop day.
To quote Swift herself: ""There's a special place in hell for women who don't help other women.""

The winners of this year's Sydney Comedy Festival awards have been announced today, with Sydney-based comic and composer Lou Wall taking out Best of the Fest for their show The Bisexual's Lament.
In their show, Wall — who is also a presenter on ABC TV's WTFAQ — catalogued the worst year of their life, 2023, through 69 things that made them laugh and helped them get through it. Through a Powerpoint presentation and song, Wall described everything from their friend accidentally eating a Schmacko to a woman she met on Facebook Marketplace stealing their neighbour's bed.
The show was also nominated for best show at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.
If you missed The Bisexual's Lament, you can catch an encore performance at the Comedy Store on June 7.
Other winners at the awards, each taking home $1,500, were Kiwi comedian and self-proclaimed former ""weird kid"" David Correos (Taskmaster NZ), who won Best Newcomer with his show I Can't Stop Vibrating; and Sydney-based comedian and actor Elouise Eftos (Colin from Accounts) who won Director's Choice with her debut show Australia's First Attractive Comedian, proving that women comedians don't have to be self-deprecating to be funny.
""They are all part of a new wave of comedians that are making ground in the Australian scene,"" said Sydney Comedy Festival director Jorge Menidis. ""Their approaches to their respective works were bold and engaged with audiences in a euphoric manner.""

The dresses are flashy, the stars are out and the Cannes Film Festival is in full swing! The prestigious French festival opened with a bang last week, premiering Francis Ford Coppola's 40-year passion project Megalopolis.
Some people loved it, some people hated it, some people simply said WTF?
But multiple films debuted over the weekend that are worth keeping an eye on in the run-up to awards season.
Hot out of the gate is The Substance, a body horror meditation on Hollywood's obsession with youth. Demi Moore stars as an aging star whose plans to get back to the top involve a mysterious medical goo. Helmed by French director Coralie Fargeat, it got a huge 13-minute standing ovation at its midnight premiere. Keep your excitement under wraps though, there's been no release confirmation … yet.
Nicolas Cage's The Surfer already blessed us with these photos from when he was filming in Busselton, WA, last year. But, by all accounts, the film is actually quite good as well! Starring Cage as a man who returns to his beach home town to surf (ding) only to be faced with some surly locals, it also features local faves such as Julian McMahon and Miranda Tapsell. We don't know when the film will be hitting our shores but we do know it'll be on Stan. Oh also, Cage eats a rat in it — do with that information what you want.

Lots of eyes have been on Bird, the British film that bathwater sommelier Barry Keoghan dumped his part in Gladiator 2 for. Keoghan stars as Bug, the heavily tattooed father of a 12-year-old girl who's pushing up against puberty and aching to have the coming-of-age experience in her working-class life. The film, which received an 11-minute standing ovation at Cannes, marks director Andrea Arnold's return to the festival following her 2021 documentary Cow, which made us cry Pixar tears over a bovine named Luma. Streaming service Mubi scooped it up out of Cannes for UK release, but we're still without global details.
And Yorgos Lanthamos fans can rejoice, because their disturbed fave is back in full form with his new thriller anthology Kinds Of Kindness. Returning surprisingly soon after his Oscar-winning effort Poor Things, reports say that KoK sees the Greek auteur lean into the yucky things that made his 2009 film Dogtooth such a gripping watch. You can expect cannibalism, cults and Emma Stone when this one hits cinemas on July 11.

You might have noticed a lot of people on your social media posting various memes captioned: Is somebody gonna match my freak?
It all links back to the track Nasty, by independent R&B singer Tinashe. While she has been steadily releasing music beloved by critics for the past decade, her latest single is having a moment thanks to TikTok.
The song's short length, repetition and provocative lyrics (""I been a nasty girl, nasty"") are perfect for the platform's algorithm, but its virality feels much more organic.
The song — the lead single from upcoming album BB/Ang3l Pt. 2 - Quantum Baby — didn't quite pick up upon release last month, until a Twitter user posted a video of TikTok dancer @nates.vibe going off and getting decidedly nasty. Somehow the original video wasn't set to the track, yet he hits every beat and embodies the song's ethos. Cathedrals everywhere for those with eyes to see.
As more people appreciated the man's dexterity and facial expressions, Tinashe posted her own video dancing in-sync with Nates. Thus, it became the track's unofficial music video.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
Nasty's lyric ""is somebody gonna match my freak?"" has also inspired its own meme on X, with users sharing iconic fictional and famous couples who fit the bill.
These include Rita Ora and Taika Waititi; the teacher and goth band member from School of Rock, and performance artists Marina Abramovic and Ulay. You can find everyone's freak-matched pairings here.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-18/john-cleese-creative-types-play-greatness-product-hard-work/103860846,The magic ingredient of creativity isn't as mysterious as you might think,"The singular comedian John Cleese — before he went down the rabbit hole of his bitter divorce — once described creativity as the essence of play.
Citing the Berkeley psychologist Donald Mackinnon, Cleese said creative people weren't more intelligent than others, they ""simply had an ability to play"". He described his own process as being prepared to stay with the discomfort of not finding the easy solution and ""playing"" with a problem until he found a more original idea.
I've just finished several months spending time with some of Australia's most prolific and distinctive creatives for my ABC program, Creative Types, and this theory of play resonates with what these artists told me — but only as the flipside of a coin that shows another important and connected face.
The often-divisive artist shares why her work is driven by a fascination for the frontiers of science and its potential.
If I was to go back and ask all the guests of this series what they thought of Cleese's theory, I know they would agree. But they would also remind me of the other side: hard work. From my many hours spent with them, I know that inspiration and imagination are the jewels chipped from the rock of hard work. The truly great stuff is never found without the work.
I've had a rare and rich experience spending time with people whose lives are defined by the need to make, and if you've watched the series, I hope you've had that experience, too.
Many of you also see creativity as important in your lives, and you've told me so: through the choirs you join, the painting you do in your spare time, the music you compose in your garage, the films you make. And our children bring their natural creativity into our lives from the moment their chubby fingers can grasp a crayon. The need to express ourselves through creativity is a deeply human one.
The subjects of this series are all so different from each other, but they share common approaches and similar working experiences: there are powerful threads that connect them. There are lessons I've taken away from their virtuosity that stay with me, and I reckon we can usefully steal a few of them and apply them, no matter what our lives look like.
On the CT team, we repeatedly used the go-to phrase of our remarkable researcher, Katey Grusovin, when she talked about our guests' ""10,000 flying hours"". It was her version of Malcolm Gladwell's theory that practice is the essence of genius, and requires 10,000 hours of repetition.

What we saw over and again was that our subjects didn't get their creative wings until those flight hours had been logged. For Warwick Thornton it was years — years — of shooting other people's films and ads and documentaries and coming to understand everything that could be done with a camera, and exactly what he didn't want to see through the lens before he found his true creative voice.
For Rafael Bonachela it was ""seven classical ballet classes a day""; for Marta Dusseldorp, it was speaking ""more scripted lines than my own"".
They also all faced directly into their failures and their missteps: they had no choice. Everything they do is public, everything they do is for you to see, and the choice they confronted in that moment was to shrink from the experience or step through it.
Hearing them speak about bad reviews or lost opportunities or stuff ups was maddening in one respect, because it was clear that any life lived with intent of course involves stumbles. But how about the rest of us?
While your workplace will, I'm sure, be repeatedly telling you how they encourage risk, and that it's ""safe to fail"" — is it really? In all my years of interviewing any number of MDs and CEOs I've never encountered one such place that actually walks that talk. Instead, you're more likely to get your head chopped off — and your program axed — if you take that creative risk and it doesn't land.
Start your weekend with the best of the ABC's journalism, presented by Virginia Trioli. Discover compelling features, big ideas and revealing analysis to understand the stories that matter to Australians.
We tell our children to try and fail, to take chances, to learn from failure. Do their teachers and their schools really believe that? How come we don't believe in it for the rest of us?
The other common thread running through the lives of almost all of these fascinating Australians was the struggle to find the path.
Some of them had disapproving parents; some had a troubled early life and were directionless in a way that was dangerous. Others had to simply knock down doors to get into the rooms that they knew would be theirs (those 10,000 hours). It's that other side of the coin again: the hard work, but also the work of tuning out other people's expectations and listening to that one, authentic voice inside you.
We all have it, not matter what it insists on saying. I wish for you all to find it — and listen to it, too.
This weekend a tiny house, a huge song and all of the fish: our reads are very lively this weekend!
Have a safe and happy weekend, and this is the ecstatic mood I'd love to leave you in until we catch up again.

Wilson writes about observing a slimmed down Monique, who had moved to LA a few years earlier, weighing and measuring all her ""healthy"" foods on a scale.
""She used to be bigger, but I'd noticed she had slimmed down a lot now that she was in America,"" Wilson writes.
""She was so tiny now and she obviously wanted to stay that way.""
Prior to making it in Hollywood herself, Wilson met Whoopi Goldberg after seeing her perform on Broadway in 2003. (Supplied: HarperCollins Australia / Author's family archives)
Wilson later writes that Monique, unable to catch a break in the film industry, quietly left Hollywood after years of trying.
In a city where aspiring actors try their hardest to be the slimmest version of themselves, Monique wasn't too dissimilar to everyone else, is the message here.
Wilson, on the other hand, leaned into the key thing that made her different – being overweight.

When Wilson met with the agency that would wind up representing her William Morris Endeavor (WME), she didn't shrink away from what made her different, she emphasised it.
""I tell the agents Stephanie and Kami about how I'm definitely the new female Jonah Hill (selling myself … obvi). I see the agents looking at me.
""I'm experienced with both stage and TV productions, but I'm a big girl and there aren't many of them in Hollywood. Still, I not only act but also write and produce.""
Wilson writes that the response she gets is: ""'Well, we don't really have anyone else like you on our books,' and with that they agree to represent me. I am unique. And whoa! Being unique has paid off.""

Wilson goes on to land scene-stealing roles in the 2011 film Bridesmaids, during which she reveals her bare torso when showing off a ""free tattoo"", and 2012's Pitch Perfect in which she plays Fat Amy.
In a world where everyone is angling to be the same, Wilson tapped into what made her unique –""being plus-size, Australian and a multi-hyphenate (actress-writer-producer)"" – and found great success doing so.
While promoting her memoir, Wilson joined former talk show host Oprah Winfrey for a WeightWatchers special.

Wilson told Winfrey she was encouraged not to lose weight by an agent who implied it would affect her career.
She fired that agent.
""I used being overweight to my advantage,"" Wilson told Winfrey.
""I leant into comedy.
""I first wanted to become a serious actress and then I realised bigger girls do really well in comedy.
But it was time for a change.
In the opening pages of her memoir, Wilson visits a fertility clinic to freeze her eggs and is faced with the reality that if she wants to have a child, she needs to be a healthier version of herself.
Wilson has since welcomed a daughter via surrogate.
She's candid in her memoir, opening up not only about weight gain and weight loss, but also falling in love with a woman – her partner Ramona Agruma; about her childhood; and about making it in Hollywood.

A chapter of the book was redacted for legal reasons, which delayed the book's release in Australia and New Zealand.
The book is an inspirational look at what led to where Wilson is today.
Wilson is vulnerable in her memoir. And it gives an insight into the life and journey of an established star, told in a frank and charmingly self-deprecating manner.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-16/bridgerton-pop-music-covers-and-classical-highlights-season-3/103855050,"If you like some Taylor Swift alongside your Beethoven, the latest Bridgerton season is for you","Bridgerton is back for its third season and fans have been eager to get their ears on the brand new soundtrack.
The series has made a splash with its music choices, capturing imaginations with a mix of classical covers of iconic pop hits with music from the period, as well as a great original score.
The first drop of season three includes covers ranging from TikTok sensation abcdefu to Pitbull's club hit Give Me Everything. And early fan speculation proved true with the appearance of Taylor Swift and Lana Del Ray's collaboration, Snow On The Beach.
The introduction of the elusive third Bridgerton daughter Francesca has also given classical music an even bigger role in storytelling in season three. Keep an ear out for favourites from Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn between the covers and original score.
Listen out for these pop covers as you watch.
The music tells the story of Bridgerton as much as the dialogue does.
We've broken down each cover and a few classical highlights, and how they connect with the plot.
Spoiler alert: The music reveals some significant plot points, so you might want to stop scrolling now and come back after you've finished bingeing.
Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd) gives a lot away through her choice of music. (Netflix: Liam Daniel)
The first standalone music we hear is Mozart's Little Funeral March, played by the character of Francesca as the rest of the Bridgerton family are franticly searching for her to make her debut for the Queen.
In previous seasons, there is fanfare as the young lady about to make her debut emerges from her room. Instead we find Francesca quietly prepared and spending time doing what she loves – making music.
She is seemingly unfussed by the forthcoming pomp and ceremony of her presentation at court. ""It's just another day!"" she declares.
Francesca says a lot through music. With its exaggerated gestures, Mozart's Funeral March is thought to be a parody of the genre. Francesca's performance here speaks both to the loss of freedom of a woman who is ""out"" in society, and simultaneously comments on her lack of interest in pageantry involved.
Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) reveals a bold new look in her mission to find a husband and gain independance from her family. (Netflix: Laurence Cendrowicz)
But it's all about Penlope Featherington this season. Her future is on the line and so is her secret identity as Lady Whistledown, writer of the weekly gossip column in Bridgerton.
This classical cover of Gayle's viral TikTok song, abcdefu, captures Penelope's confidence as she enters the first ball of the season in a brand new look.
The edgy and seething tone of the song perfectly captures Penelope's new-found boldness. She no longer wants to be the target of derision for her family and peers. She's paving her own way to a life she wants to live.
The BTS ARMY will recognise this music immediately, with Vitamin String Quartet covering the Korean boy band's Dynamite.
The track appears in an energetic, busy ballroom scene involving Benedict Bridgerton dancing with a young, smitten member of the Ton, while the usually sidelined Eloise Bridgerton finds herself being accepted by the popular girls.
As Colin Bridgerton watches Penelope speak to eligible bachelors of the ton, Nick Jonas's RnB-inspired Jealous plays.
Jonas Brothers' fans may notice the similarities between Colin Bridgerton and Nick Jonas, both being the third born son after two very popular older brothers.

Francesca mentions Beethoven's 'Appassionata' piano sonata when talking with a potential music-loving suitor introduced to her by her mother.
When the suitor references hearing the passion in Beethoven's music, Francesca becomes uncomfortable. ""I mostly enjoy the chord progressions,"" she declares.
It's not until later that we hear the music, when Queen Charlotte comes across Francesca happily playing the pianoforte by herself, away from the ball.
She plays the brighter middle movement of the sonata, that doesn't display the tempestuous drama of the outer movements. The choice also sets her apart from the Queen who states her approval, ""Someone who performs not for me, but for themselves. Brava.""
As the ton ton descends on ""The Innovations Ball"" we hear the strains of Cheap Thrills by Australian singer-songwriter Sia.
The performance culminates with the meeting of the Bridgertons' mother with a mysterious stranger, later revealed to be Lady Danbury's brother, Lord Marcus Anderson.
Colin appears ready to declare his feelings to Penelope before he is interrupted by her new suitor, Lord Debling.
Happier Than Ever starts to play as Penelope and Lord Debling, her first serious marriage prospect, begin to dance.
Eilish's plaintive ballad is the perfect analogy for Colin repeatedly taking advantage of Penelope and letting her down throughout their relationship.
Episode 4 culminates in Colin's recognition of his true feelings for Penelope. (Netflix: Liam Daniel)
As Penelope takes to the dance floor with Lord Debling, the quartet plays Haydn's aptly named 'Serenade' string quartet.
While Lord Debling 'serenades' Penelope through dance, the focus switches to Violet Bridgerton who is receiving her own 'serenade' through conversation with Lady Danbury's brother.

Swifties and Lanatics will rejoice as this song from Taylor's Midnights album makes its appearance in episode four.
The conflicted feelings of Snow on the Beach pairs well with Colin's interruption of Penelope dancing with Lord Debling, who is on the cusp of proposing.
Lord Debling realises Colin and Penelope's unexpressed feelings for each other and withdraws his suit.
Will Penelope lose the security of the only suitable match she's had? Will she get the love match she so desperately wants? Will Colin finally declare himself? Or will they both end up unhappy?
Snow on the beach captures that terrifying point of falling in love and being uncertain whether the other person feels the same way.
In this climactic episode of part one, Colin and Penelope find themselves in a private and passionate moment in a carriage.
Throughout the season we are regularly reminded that Colin is well-travelled, so this emotionally open, seductive club banger from Mr Worldwide aka Pitbull, perfectly suits the theme of Colin's newfound self-confidence.","Lucy Zee, Janine Marshman",Thu 16 May,0

From hot favourite the Netherlands' shock disqualification, to Israel's contested participation and Switzerland's historic win, it was a hell of a year for the song contest.
Here's what you may have missed in entertainment news while you were dancing to Eurotrash bangers.
On the same night the A-list descended on New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in their couture last week for the $US75,000-a-head Met Gala, Israeli military forces launched an attack on Rafah, where 1.3 million people are sheltering. And now social media users are mad at the celebrities they perceive to have flaunted their wealth and privilege at fashion's night of nights while maintaining silence on the ongoing crisis in Gaza.
In protest, Instagram and TikTok users are sentencing celebs including Kim Kardashian, Zendaya, Cardi B and Nicki Minaj to the digital guillotine (the ""digitine"", if you will) by blocking them on all platforms and posting about it with hashtags including #blockout2024, #digitine, #letthemeatcake and #celebrityblock.
""We gave them their platforms. It's time to take it back — take our views away, our likes, our comments, our money — by blocking them on all social media and digital platforms,"" TikToker @ladyfromtheoutside urged in a clip that's been liked more than 578,000 times.
Other users have created lists naming and shaming the celebrities they deem to have failed to address the issue of Israel and Palestine adequately, so their followers may block them.

Despite what some people might think, British TV is so much more than Vera and Doctor Who, and the BAFTA TV awards over the weekend proved it.
Top Boy — a Netflix drama set in the housing estates of east London that stars Little Simz (!!) — won two little golden faces for best drama and best supporting actress (Jasmine Jobson).
The Sixth Commandment — which tells the true story of a churchwarden who befriended, manipulated and murdered a retired schoolmaster — took home two awards, for best limited drama and best leading actor (Timothy Spall aka Peter Pettigrew).
And while prestige drama The Crown had a total of eight nominations this year — including Melbourne actor Elizabeth Debicki for her portrayal of Princess Diana — they didn't take home a single one.
The best homage to the royals IMHO came from Joe Lycett. The comedian and talk show host bet his two literal aunties (who appear regularly on his show) that if they could get 100k followers on Instagram he would go to the BAFTAs dressed as Queen Elizabeth I — and they did it.
The Instagram account of Lycett's aunties Margaret and Pauline is now at almost 250k followers. (Getty Images: Joe Maher)
He was rewarded for his efforts by taking home the award for best entertainment performance for his talk show Late Night Lycett.
The other big fashion statement of the night was the red Artists4Ceasefire pin, seen on numerous lapels, including that of Brian Cox (who was nominated for best actor for his turn as Logan Roy on Succession). Khalid Abdalla (who played Princess Diana's boyfriend Dodi Fayed in The Crown) arrived on the red carpet with the words ""Stop arming Israel"" written on his palm and a bag of 14,000 red sequins, which represented children who have been killed in Gaza.
And, finally, Hannah Waddingham (Ted Lasso) took a shot out of her bracelet/tiny flask after losing the best entertainment programme award for her Home for Christmas concert, proving once again that she is a true icon and sending all of us online to try to find our own special bad news bracelet.

Australia's leading performing arts schools — including the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) and the Australian Film Television and Radio School (AFTRS) — will receive a $115.2 million boost in Tuesday's federal budget.
As reported in The Saturday Paper, a number of important arts training organisations will share in the funding over four years, with an extra $36.9 million in ongoing annual funding set to be announced.
ABC Arts has confirmed NIDA will receive the biggest share of funding, at $51.9 million, AFTRS will receive $23.2 million and the National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Development Association Dance College will receive $13 million. Organisations securing funding up to $10 million include: the Flying Fruit Fly Circus ($7.3 million), the Australian Ballet School ($6.5 million), the National Institute of Circus Arts ($6.5 million), the National Academy of Music ($3.7 million) and the Australian Youth Orchestra ($3 million).
A major economic study of Australia's creative workforce shows artists continue to be undervalued, with many struggling to earn enough to meet basic living costs.
The new funding provides a lifeline to the organisations, who say they are at ""real risk of collapse"", with analysis finding that government support has fallen below 2014 levels.
Arts minister Tony Burke told The Saturday Paper: ""Unless we want to be a country where quality content overwhelmingly comes from overseas, we need to properly invest in our emerging talent.
""If we're serious about wanting to make sure that work in the arts isn't only available to people who can afford it, then we need to make sure these institutions are properly funded.""

Nothing can go right for Jerry Seinfeld lately. First his Pop-Tarts movie goes down like orange juice on cornflakes (badly), and now he's being publicly booed!
Seinfeld was the guest speaker at North Carolina's Duke University over the weekend, where he was given an honorary degree. But dozens of students left their own graduation during his commencement speech in protest of the comedian's support of Israel.
Videos from the event show groups of students, some carrying the Palestinian flag, leaving the football field while chanting ""free Palestine"". Audible boos drown out Seinfeld's introduction before quickly being challenged by chants of ""Jerry! Jerry!"" as the actor received his degree.
Seinfeld delivered his speech despite the interruption, vowing to ""defend"" the concept of privilege.
""I say, use your privilege. I grew up a Jewish boy from New York. That is a privilege if you want to be a comedian,"" he added.
Seinfeld has been vocally supportive of Israel since October 7, when militant group Hamas killed more than 1,100 people and took about 240 hostage, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Meanwhile, Israel's military operations have killed almost 35,000 Palestinians, according to local officials.
Duke University has released a statement addressing the interruption, saying the institution ""respect[s] the right of everyone at Duke to express their views peacefully, without preventing graduates and their families from celebrating their achievement"".

A heap of shows and films were teased in the last few days.

Warner Bros. has announced its latest film in the Lord of the Rings franchise, tentatively titled Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum. Slated for release in 2026, it'll focus on the sinister, slimy creature played by Andy Serkis in the films, with the actor returning to his live-motion suit. He'll also direct the film, with original trilogy director Peter Jackson attached as producer. Hopefully it's better than the Gollum-starring video game released last year, ranked by Metacritic as 2023's worst game.
We're also getting a sequel to Red, White & Royal Blue — 2023's gay royal rom-com starring Nicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez, based on the popular queer romance book of the same name by Casey McQuiston. The leads will return, as will writer-director Matthew López, with McQuiston co-writing, given there's no novel sequel for the film to work with. In the meantime, you can see Galitzine play a sexy Harry Styles-esque figure in The Idea of You or a sexy King seducer in Mary & George. What range he has.
And, finally, Heartbreak High has announced a third and final season, via a video where star Thomas Weatherall teases what was in his character Malakai's farewell letter to Amerie.
We don't get that detail – or any info on the cast or release date – but surely this means Malakai is coming back from Switzerland, right?

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-12/eurovision-abba-abba-tars-/103836306,ABBA avatars catch Eurovision viewers by surprise,"This year marks the 50th anniversary of ABBA earning Sweden its very first victory at the Eurovision Song Contest.
Back then, the group performed their smash-hit Waterloo.
With the contest returning to Sweden, home of last year's winner Loreen, half a century on, it makes sense that the organisers of Eurovision would want to mark that occasion.
Enter, the ABBA-tars.
ABBA didn't appear in person in Malmö.
Instead, their digital avatars were beamed to the studio from the ABBA Voyage stage show, allowing the Eurovision audience and everyone at home to see the group as they were at their peak.
This came as a surprise to many and drew some criticism online.
A trio of former Eurovision winners also performed Waterloo in tribute.
A controversial Eurovision has come to a wrap with the winner crowned.
They were Charlotte Perrelli, who won the contest for Sweden 25 years ago in 1999; Carola, who took the contest to Malmö for the very first time in 1992 after winning for Sweden the year before; and Conchita Wurst, who was victorious for Austria in 2014.
This is the seventh time Sweden has hosted the competition.
Ahead of the grand final, streaming giant Spotify released some statistics demonstrating ABBA's enduring popularity with Australians.

Switzerland's Nemo won this year's competition, with their operatic pop-rap song The Code.
Nemo is the first non-binary artist to win Eurovision and expressed pride and gratitude at the press conference afterwards.

""I'm mostly just really grateful for this experience and all the friends I've made along the way,"" Nemo said.
""This was one of the most queer representations we've seen at Eurovision, which was amazing. I want to shout out all the other queer artists this year.""
It was a controversial Eurovision.

Switzerland's last win was in 1988.
The leaderboard is as follows:
Nemo has made history as the first openly non-binary contestant to win Eurovision.
Nemo's music deals with gender identity, mental health and finding one's place in this world.
Born in Biel, a small bilingual town in Switzerland, in 1999, Nemo has been playing the violin, piano and drums since they were a small child.
They became famous overnight after a cypher appearance went viral in 2016. A cypher is known in hip hop circles as an informal gathering of rappers, beatboxers, and/or breakdancers who perform freestyle battles.
Nemo performance
Nemo began releasing songs in English in 2020 and writing for other artists.
Switzerland hosted and won the very first edition of the Eurovision Song Contest in 1956.
Each country entered two songs in that debut year to be sung by the same performers.
Lys Assia sang both Swiss songs that year, winning with the song Refrain, sung in French.
Celine Dion has competed for Switzerland, winning in 1988 with the song Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi.
Switzerland was very popular with the national juries, with many awarding the country its maximum 12 points, leaving some members of the public perplexed, but the voting public has confirmed the result.
Eurovision organisers try to dodge controversy as much as possible, but this year, it could not be avoided.
Joost Klein from the Netherlands was disqualified. (Supplied: Sarah Louise Bennett / EBU)
The contestant from The Netherlands, 26-year-old Joost Klein, was disqualified and removed from the grand final.
The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) released a statement reading: ""The Dutch artist Joost Klein will not be competing in the Grand Final of this year's Eurovision Song Contest.
""Swedish police have investigated a complaint made by a female member of the production crew after an incident following his performance in Thursday night's semi final.
""We would like to make it clear that, contrary to some media reports and social media speculation, this incident did not involve any other performer or delegation member.
""We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards inappropriate behaviour at our event and are committed to providing a safe and secure working environment for all staff at the contest.
""In light of this, Joost Klein's behaviour towards a team member is deemed in breach of contest rules.
""The grand final of the 68th Eurovision Song Contest will now proceed with 25 participating songs.""
At the end of Thursday's semifinal, Klein appeared to object to being placed beside Israeli contestant Eden Golan at a press conference, covering his face with a Dutch flag.

The inclusion of Israel was the other major controversy this year and led to demonstrations by pro-Palestinian protesters.
The annual event is billed as non-political and while organisers resisted calls to exclude Israel, they did request a change to the lyrics of the song Israel was initially due to sing to remove references to the October 7 Hamas attacks, which triggered the war in Gaza.
Russia was excluded in 2022 after the country invaded Ukraine, so why is Israel still participating in 2024?
In the end, Israel's public vote was much higher than that given by judges, with the audience awarding Israel 323 votes to the 52 awarded in-house.
Golan was both booed and applauded during her performance.
Israel was the first non-European country granted permission to participate in Eurovision, making its debut in the competition in 1973.
The EBU allowed Israel to participate because the country's broadcaster was already one of its members.
Golan, who draws inspiration from artists such as Beyoncé, Ariana Grande, Jessie J, RAYE, Whitney Houston and Justin Timberlake, performed Hurricane instead of October Rain as originally slated.
Croatia's Baby Lasagne came in second.

Singer-songwriter Marko Purišić billed himself as Baby Lasagna as a way to compose the kind of songs he wanted to perform.
The musician from Umag in Croatia has a mission — to entertain while drawing attention to society's social issues.
Baby Lasagna's lyrics often contain a deeper message paired with a catchy beat.
Baby Lasagna — Rim Tim Tagi Dim (LIVE) | Croatia | Grand Final | Eurovision 2024.
His Eurovision song Rim Tim Tagi Dim is a good example of that.
It's about a mass exodus of young adults leaving Croatia for better opportunities in foreign countries — something Baby Lasagna has discussed in numerous interviews.
Croatia participated in the Eurovision Song Contest as part of Yugoslavia until its 1993 debut.
She may have been competing for Cyprus, but 17-year-old Silia Kapsis was born and raised in Sydney, Australia, as part of the Greek Cypriot diaspora.

Kapsis says her song Liar is about being your authentic self.
""You can perceive the song however you like,"" Kapsis told RN Breakfast.
""But for me it's not really about a specific person.
""It's kind of about the world we live in now – especially Gen Z – my generation and kids my age who are struggling with social media, for example, or body shaming or sexualism, you know, comparing yourself to other people.
""And I think this song is about breaking free from that.""

Kapsis also joined ABC Radio Sydney with her mother Rebecca after she competed in the first semifinal.
""When I was pregnant, she would consistently move in my belly,"" her mother said, saying she thought at the time it was cause for concern.
""She's always been very energetic and … she always loved the performing arts.""

Klein was kicked out of the competition following a complaint made by a female member of the production crew, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, said in a statement.
The 68th version of the contest, normally a festival of catchy songs and tongue-in-cheek kitsch, is taking place amid protests in host city Malmö over the participation of Israel, due to its war in Gaza.
The EBU had earlier said it was investigating an incident involving Klein, 26, whose quirky song Europapa had originally made him one of the favourites ahead of Saturday's final.
""Swedish police have investigated a complaint made by a female member of the production crew after an incident following his performance in Thursday night's semi final,""  the EBU said in a statement.
Russia was excluded in 2022 after the country invaded Ukraine, so why is Israel still participating in 2024?
""While the legal process takes its course, it would not be appropriate for him to continue in the contest.
""We would like to make it clear that, contrary to some media reports and social media speculation, this incident did not involve any other performer or delegation member.
""We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards inappropriate behaviour at our event and are committed to providing a safe and secure working environment for all staff at the contest.
""In light of this, Joost Klein's behaviour towards a team member is deemed in breach of contest rules.""
The EBU said the final would go ahead with 25 songs instead of the 26 that made it through to the end of the contest.
A representative for Klein did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The EBU said in a later statement that Dutch viewers would still be allowed to vote for other contestants and that the Dutch jury result would still be included in the final.

Klein had been prevented from rehearsing Friday over an unspecified ""incident"", and earlier on Saturday police confirmed they had begun an investigation.
""The police is investigating intimidation. The offence was committed in the Malmo arena on Thursday evening,"" police spokesman Pelle Vamstad told AFP.
Australia's Electric Fields won't be progressing to the next stage of the song content but the duo already made history by stepping on the hallowed stage.
""The suspect, a man, was heard. He is not in detention,"" Vamstad added.
The person who lodged a complaint is involved in Eurovision, police said.
Dutch broadcaster SVT suggested the incident involving Klein had been a confrontation with a photographer.
Dutch broadcaster AVROTROS said in an emailed statement that it was ""shocked"" by the EBU's decision and considered it ""disproportionate"".
During rehearsals, Klein had paraded with other participants ahead of the performances but did not go on stage when it was his turn.
Netherlands – Joost Klein – Europapa
His song Europapa is dedicated to his parents, who died when he was young.
Bookmakers have Croatia's Baby Lasagna, real name Marko Purišić, 28, with Rim Tim Tagi Dim, a song about a young man who leaves home aspiring to become a ""city boy"" with better opportunities, as front-runner to win the contest.
Israeli solo artist Eden Golan, 20, and her song Hurricane also qualified for Saturday's final, with betting odds showing her as one of the leading contenders too.
At the end of Thursday's semi-final, the 26-year-old Klein had appeared to object to being placed beside Israeli contestant Eden Golan at a press conference, at several points covering his face with a Dutch flag.
Klein draped the Dutch flag over his head at a press conference after the semi final.
Eurovision expert Paul Jordan told Reuters it was unprecedented for an artist to be expelled on the eve of the final.
""Obviously we don't know what's happened now. He could be found innocent,"" Jordan said.
The incident has nothing to do with the Israeli delegation, AVROTROS Eurovision commentator Cornald Maas said.
""It is, among other things, hellish for Joost Klein, who is a unifier, and his team,"" Maas wrote on social media platform X.

This year, 37 countries entered the contest but only 26 of them are in the grand final.
By a vote, but it's a bit more complicated than a federal election.
Each participating country gives two sets of points to their top 10 songs:
One set of those points come from the results of the public vote of viewers from that country.
The set is decided by a jury of five music industry professionals from that country.
The act with the most points wins.
To keep things fair, countries can't vote for themselves.
Yes, but it costs 65 cents per vote.
Viewers in Australia will be able to vote through the Eurovision Song Contest app and through an online voting portal.
There's a limit of 20 votes a person.
In short, because Australian broadcaster SBS has been such a big supporter of the event.
It's been covering the contest since 1983 – a whopping four decades – but Australian acts have only been taking the stage for 10 years.
It kicked off in 2014, when iconic Australian singer Jessica Mauboy was invited to be a guest singer during the interval.
The following year, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) invited Australia to compete as a wildcard entry.
This was back during the contest's 60th birthday and was all about ""building bridges"".
That year, we sent Guy Sebastian to compete and he came in fifth place.
After this success, the SBS struck a deal with the EBU for Australia to stay on the bill until 2023.

Despite Eurovision billing itself as a non-political event, Israel's participation in semi-final two was considered political given Israel's military campaign in Gaza, triggered by the October 7 attacks by Hamas.
Pro-Palestinian demonstrators surrounded the competition venue in Malmö, Sweden with police carrying out arrests.
Israel's song Hurricane replaced October Rain due to the political nature of the lyrics in the latter song.

Born and raised in Sydney to a Greek Cypriot father and a mother from Thessaloniki in Greece, Kapsis is representing Cyprus at Eurovision, but Australians are also cheering her on.
The 17-year-old is the youngest contestant in this year's song contest.
Her song is called Liar.
After appearing in the first semi-final, Kapsis told ABC Radio Sydney that she felt an allegiance to both Australia and Cyprus.
""I was born in Australia and I've been raised there and I live there and I can't wait to come back,"" Kapsis said.
""But I definitely feel like I'm representing both countries.
""It's … a great thing. It's a beautiful thing.""
Australia's Electric Fields won't be progressing to the next stage of the song content but the duo already made history by stepping on the hallowed stage.
Australians have competed for other countries in Eurovision before.
Andrew Lambrou, who also made it to the grand final last year for Cyprus, was born and raised in Australia as well.
The late Olivia Newton-John has competed for the UK and Gina G sang the hit Ooh Aah … Just a Little Bit while also representing the UK.
Australia has only failed to qualify once before joining the contest in 2015, with Montaigne in 2021.
The grand final will be broadcast on SBS TV and SBS On Demand from 5am AEST Sunday.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-09/steve-albini-dies-alternative-rock-pioneer-aged-61/103823658,"'Brilliant mind, great artist': Alt rock pioneer Steve Albini dies aged 61","Steve Albini, an alternative rock pioneer and legendary producer who shaped the musical landscape through his work with Nirvana, the Pixies, PJ Harvey and more, has died aged 61.
Brian Fox, an engineer at Albini's studio Electrical Audio Recording, said that Albini died after a heart attack on Tuesday night, local time.
In addition to his work on rock albums such as Nirvana's In Utero, the Pixies' breakthrough Surfer Rosa, and PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, Albini was the frontman of the underground bands Big Black and Shellac.
He dismissed the term ""producer,"" refused to take royalties from the albums he worked on, and requested he be credited with ""Recorded by Steve Albini,"" a fabled label on albums he worked on.
At the time of his death, Albini's band Shellac were preparing to tour their first new album in a decade, To All Trains, which releases next week.
Other acts whose music was shaped by Albini include Joanna Newsom's indie-folk opus, Ys, and releases from bands like the Breeders, the Jesus Lizard, Hum, Superchunk, Low and Mogwai.
Albini was born in California, grew up in Montana, and fell in love with the do-it-yourself punk music scene in Chicago while studying journalism at Northwestern University.
As a teenager, he played in punk bands, and in college, wrote about music for the indie zine Forced Exposure.
While attending Northwestern in the early 80s, he founded the abrasive, noisy post-punk band Big Black, known for its mordant riffs, violent and taboo lyrics, and a drum machine in lieu of a live drummer.
It was a controversial innovation at the time, from a man whose career would be defined by risky choices.
The band's best-known song, the ugly, explosive, six-minute Kerosene from their cult favourite album, 1986's Atomizer, is ideal evidence — and not for the faint of heart.
In the early 90s, he formed Shellac, the ferocious, distorted noise-rock band — an evolution from Big Black, but still punctuated by pummelling guitar tones and aggressive vocals.
In 1997, Albini opened his famed studio, Electrical Audio, in Chicago.
""The recording part is the part that matters to me — that I'm making a document that records a piece of our culture, the life's work of the musicians that are hiring me,"" Albini told The Guardian last year, when asked about some of the well-known and much-loved albums he's recorded.
Albini was a larger-than-life character in the independent rock music scene, known for his forward-thinking productions, unapologetic irreverence, acerbic sense of humour and criticisms of the music industry's exploitative practices — as detailed in his landmark 1993 essay The Problem with Music — as much as his talents.
Later in life, he became a notable poker player and apologetic for his past behaviour.

""Ugh man, a heartbreaking loss of a legend. Love to his family and innumerable colleagues,"" wrote actor Elijah Wood on X.
""Farewell, Steve Albini.""
Author Michael Azerrad, who included a chapter on Big Black in his comprehensive history, Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991, also posted on X.
""I don't know what to say about Steve Albini's passing,"" Azerrad wrote.
""He had a brilliant mind, was a great artist and underwent the most remarkable and inspiring personal transformation.
""I can't believe he's gone.""
Albini is survived by his wife, Heather Whinna, a filmmaker.

Here's what you missed from the Met Gala","There's one major problem with photos of Katy Perry in a floral ball gown, climbing the steps of the 2024 Met Gala — she wasn't actually there.
The singer was just one of many who appeared in AI-generated images making their way around the internet following the annual event.
Between them and a rare glimpse of what goes on inside the event itself, here's some of what you might have missed from the Met Gala.
Katy Perry was not at the Met Gala despite what images posted to her Instagram might show.
Images posted to her Instagram show her sporting a full length dress with 3D butterflies and flowers finished with a mossy grass like trim followed by a secondary image featuring in a brass-look corset with a large key in the centre and a grass skirt with roses.
Both are AI generated. And they fooled her mum.
The post includes a text from Perry's mum complimenting the ""gorgeous gown"" before Perry corrected her telling her to ""BEWARE"".
Katy Perry wasn't the only one who's AI images were floating around.
Dua Lipa who was at the Met Gala certainly was not wearing a regency style corset dress.
Yet images of that exact outfit made their way around social media.
For what it's worth, this is what Dua Lipa was actually wearing.
Regency era fashion probably would not approve of Dua Lipa's real Met Gala outfit.  (Reuters: Andrew Kelly)
Long-time Met Gala highlight Rihanna also fell victim to AI when she missed the 2024 event.
Often one of the last people to show up, Rihanna in the past has been congratulated for her avant-garde approach to the annual event's themes, not shying away from colours and textures while ensuring every small detail was immaculate.
According to People Magazine, the singer's absence was due to her being sick with the flu.

Another Met Gala favourite missing from this year was Gossip Girl star Blake Lively.
Her gilded glamour Versace gown stole the show in 2022 as her ode to the Statue of Liberty transformed from copper to green.
Lively also skipped the 2023 event due to recently giving birth. This year she hasn't revealed the exact reason for not attending.
But there is speculation it could be anything from trying to raise a young family to working on promotion for the upcoming release of It Ends with Us or the recently announced A Simple Favor 2.

And of course her husband fellow actor Ryan Reynolds would not dare attend alone, so he was also absent from the event.
Other notable absences include Jared Leto, who missed the event due to being on tour with his band 30 Seconds to Mars, Taylor Swift similarly was away probably due to her touring obligations in Europe and Billie Eilish skipped the show most likely in preparation for her album release next week.
The Kardashian family are another group known for pushing the limits when it comes to the Met Gala.
But this year Kim's choice of a cardigan, or Kardigan as the Kardashians would call it, seemed to be mismatched.
Paired with a shimmering silver custom Maison Margiela by John Galliano corset and skirt, the grey cardigan draped over her shoulders looked out of place.
Kim Kardashian has explained why she wore a cardigan with her dress.  (AP: Invision/Evan Agostini)
In a video posted by Vogue Kim explains she interpreted the theme as ""imaging having the best night of your entire life with your most magical person.
""You just are in a garden, you've overslept after the best night of your life.
""I'm just like running out, my dress is falling off because it is just one of those nights and I just grabbed my boyfriend's sweater to run off to make it to where I have to be.""
What happens inside the Met Gala remains somewhat secret due to it largely not being recorded.
What is known is after the red carpet guests will view the exhibit before siting down for dinner and watching a musical performance.
This year that performer was Ariana Grande who shared videos on her social media of her performing a medley of her hits including Into You and Yes, And?
Ariana Grande uploaded a video of herself performing at the Met Gala.  (Instagram: Ariana Grande)
Tickets this year cost $US75,000 ($114,000) a head for the fundraiser event, so maintaining that exclusivity is paramount.
Sometimes selfies inside the bathrooms make their way to social media — despite a 2015 no selfie policy — including this image by Kylie Jenner that shattered the internet in 2017.

According to Vogue, the rule is in place to ensure guests are present and engaged, rather than distracted by their phones.
But other than the occasional bathroom pic, it is rare to see what happens after the red carpet.
Although the red carpet is the main attraction, for the after party the stars often continue to shine with their after party outfits.
Some stand-outs include Lana Del Rey who's Alexander McQueen entry featuring branches sprawling out underneath mesh netting already was a fan favourite.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-07/why-is-australia-competing-in-eurovision-song-contest/103801224,Why is Australia in Eurovision?,"The Eurovision Song Contest is back for another year and, once again, an Australian act will be taking to the stage.
It may seem a bit weird Australia is a competitor in a contest that starts with ""Euro"" given we're so far away from the continent.
But we've been competing for years now.
In short, because Australian broadcaster SBS has been such a big supporter of the event.
It's been covering the contest since 1983 – a whopping four decades – but Australian acts have only been taking the stage for 10 years.
It kicked off in 2014, when iconic Australian singer Jessica Mauboy was invited to be a guest singer during the interval.
The following year, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) invited Australia to compete as a wildcard entry.
This was back during the contest's 60th birthday and was all about ""building bridges"".
That year, we sent Guy Sebastian to compete and he came in fifth place.
After this success, the SBS struck a deal with the EBU for Australia to stay on the bill until 2023.
There was a question mark about Australia's future in the contest after Eurovision 2023, but in early December it was confirmed that Australia would take part this year.
But Australia isn't the only country in the contest that's not part of the European Union, with nations like Ukraine and Armenia also competing.
A duo called Electric Fields.
Their song is called One Milkali (One Blood).
Electric Fields will represent Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest.
This year, there are 37 Eurovision Song Contest participating countries:
Here's the full list of countries:
Yes.
Israel agreed to modify the lyrics of its original song, which was called October Rain and is now titled Hurricane.
The EBU said the original lyrics referenced the Hamas attacks on an Israeli music festival on October 7, which triggered Israel's war in Gaza.
This year, Israel will be represented by Eden Golan, who did not write the song.
She was selected to be Israel's contestant after winning a televised singing contest.
Golan didn't attend the opening ceremony on Sunday due to Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel, Swedish broadcaster SVT said.
But she spoke to Reuters in an interview on Monday.
""I come here to show my voice, to share my love, my gift from God and to hopefully make people feel something and leave a mark in their souls and to unite by music,"" she said.
Eden Golan speaking with Reuters on Monday. (Reuters: Leonhard Foeger)
Because its broadcaster is a member of the EBU, so it has a place in the competition like Australia.
Except while Australia is only relatively new to the competition, Israel has been competing in Eurovision for more than 50 years.
""Israel made its debut in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1973 as the first non-European country granted permission to participate in the event,"" the Eurovision website says.
""The EBU allowed Israel to participate since the country's broadcaster was already one of its members.""
As this year's contest approaches, there are growing calls from some critics to ban Israel from the competition, in the same way Russia was banned in 2022.
The EBU told international news syndicate Agence France-Presse it decided late last year that Israel could participate.
""The Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU,"" the union's director-general, Noel Curran, said.
""It is not a contest between governments.""
Mr Curran said in the case of Russia, it was the Russian broadcasters themselves who were suspended from the EBU ""due to their persistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service values"".
However, this hasn't stopped the calls for Israel to be banned, with protests expected at the event.
Golan was asked how she felt about the possibility of demonstrations.
""It's up to the people what to do,"" she said.
""They have the right to speak their voice, but I'm focusing on my part, which is giving the best performance, and on the good, on the good vibes, the good people.""
In Malmö, Sweden.
That's because Sweden won last year's event.
Malmö is bracing for possible unrest during the week, although police have said there have been no concrete threats against the event.
The first semifinal will be held in Sweden on Tuesday night but, because of the time difference, it'll be Wednesday morning in Australia.
That's the one Australia will be in.
The second semifinal will be on Friday morning.
And the grand final will be on Sunday morning.
They'll all start at the following times:
It's being broadcast and streamed by SBS.
So you can watch it on free-to-air television or SBS On Demand.
We'll also be live blogging the finals, so if you're planning an early-morning viewing party, we'll be on hand to keep you company.

Of Lady Whistledown herself.
Nicola Coughlan and Luke Newton, aka Penelope and Colin — are in the spotlight in the latest season of Netflix's Regency-era drama series, Bridgerton.
Season 3 is set to deliver the traditional soirees, scandals, and steamy scenes we have come to expect from the popular series — but it's got another element that former Ton couples did not have.
A true friendship.
Season three of Bridgerton is the ‘friends to lovers’ tale of Penelope (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin (Luke Newton).
""To have a friend by your side that you love, and trust is like the best thing,"" says Nicola Coughlan.
Both the stars credit their off-screen friendship as the reason why their characters' chemistry has fans in awe.
""I think we have such like a love for one another as friends and real respect for one another.
""I don't think either of us really struggled to be disingenuous,"" she adds.
Co-star Luke Newton who plays Nicola's love interest in the show was quick to agree.
""It just felt like a perfect fit that we were friends.""
""It felt so appropriate to their story, because they're friends to lovers,"" shares Luke.
Nicola Coughlan plays Lady Whistledown, the anonymous pamphlet writer in the popular series Bridgerton. (Netflix )
With the series being based on the books by author Julia Quinn, the show eventually turning to Luke and Nicola's characters' was expected. Something the actors even anticipated.
But it came one season too soon.
""We didn't know that we would get there, you know, by season 3 … with the order of the books and everything,"" says Luke.
Did it make filming more overwhelming?
Newton says — absolutely not.
As soon as he read the script for the new season, a 'sense of calm' took over.
""We're really-really lucky,"" Nicola adds with obvious relief.
""It sounds so saccharin. When we say we just really got on — but we actually did.""
Nicola Coughlan and Luke Newton first met on the sets of Bridgerton season 1, nearly five years ago. (Netflix)
In the eight months of intense filming for the show — the cast of Bridgerton also graced the streets of regional Australia.
For a week the high society of Bridgerton took over the News South Wales town of Bowral.
""We had to not tell anyone we were coming here,"" shares Nicola on their trip Down Under.
It was a big secret — smuggling the leads of the series into a town all the way in Australia.
One that involved ""being in hiding"" at the start of their visit.
Bridgerton premiere held in the NSW Southern Highlands.
""It is wild… I'm really glad we pulled it off,"" Nicola laughs.
For Luke Newton, his first time ever in Australia ended up being a 'great time'.
The long flight included.
""It was a long one. But I caught up on some films.
""I haven't had a lot of downtime. It was nice to just take a breath for a moment,"" he adds.
Luke Newton was filled with praise for Australia — calling his time here 'quite special'.
The regency romance swept the town earlier in April, with the stars holding a special meet and greet for fans in Australia before heading back to the States.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-07/netflix-three-body-problem-scifi-tells-unique-china-story/103793804,A young entrepreneur pushed for Netflix's 3 Body Problem adaptation. He was murdered before he could see it,"For Netflix and its global audiences, the 3 Body Problem tells an extraordinary story of humankind preparing for a 400-year war against aliens that are far more sophisticated and technologically advanced.
But for people in China — one of the five countries where Netflix is not available — the television show adapted from the country's bestselling sci-fi series reminded them of a traumatic period of history that Beijing wants its people to forget.
As it opens, viewers see physicist Ye Zhetai being questioned on stage in front of a frenetic crowd.
He is forced to bend down by two young Red Guards — a student-led paramilitary unit endorsed by Chairman Mao Zedong in the 1960s — with a blood stain on his forehead.
On social media, the scene of Cultural Revolution in Netflix's latest sci-fi series 3 Body Problem has sparked divided discussion in China and among Chinese diasporas.  (Supplied: Netflix)
The professor is asked why he taught Albert Einstein's theory of relativity in a physics class at Tsinghua University, whose alumni created China's first nuclear weapons.
Soon, his daughter Ye Wenjie — a key character throughout the series — watches her tormented father take his last breath after being beaten by a young girl with a belt.
What the scene illustrated was China's Cultural Revolution, a decade-long political and ideological campaign launched by Chairman Mao in 1966.
The Communist Party leader feared losing his power and promised to inject new life into socialist causes, but instead brought untold turmoil and bloodshed.
Today, there is still no official number of deaths during this period.
One the 50th anniversary of the political declaration that started Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, a small group of Chinese are pushing for an open discussion about what actually happened.
The scene sparked a furious debate among Chinese viewers — who watched the series either through virtual private networks or piracy — on Netflix's illustration of one of the Chinese Communist Party's darkest chapters.
Some argued Netflix had been faithful to the original books, while others blamed the streaming service for ""defaming China"".
And the debate eventually activated China's censorship system.
Less than a month after the Netflix series was launched, China's most famous film critic website Douban suspended its review and comment functions for the series, while wiping out all previous comments from viewers.
The saga about Netflix's 3 Body Problem — which now has more than 3.2 million views on the streaming platform and is ranked top five in Australia for the fifth week — is just one chapter of the Chinese sci-fi series' challenging journey to the West.
Besides Netflix's $460 million investment, the series seems to be the story of China that Beijing is hesitant to tell to the world — especially when it also involves a murder.
In 2006, writer and engineer Liu Cixin began serialising The Three-Body Problem on Science Fiction World, a 45-year-old sci-fi literary magazine in China that targets a niche group of readers.

With the rise of the internet and social media as well as Liu's creative imagination, the series received praise beyond the sci-fi reader group.
In 2008, the first two books of the trilogy were published, with the final instalment released in 2010.
In 2014, the series was translated into English and one year later, it won the Oscar of sci-fi fiction, the Hugo Award, for best novel.
Aliens, robo-nannies and folding cities: A new wave of Chinese science fiction authors offer insights.
Liu Cixin was the first Asian author to win the prize.
In the same year, a young Chinese businessman was plotting a bigger plan for the trilogy.
Born in 1981 in Wenzhou — a southern city known for rapid growth of private capital since China's market reform — Lin Qi turned his teenage passion for gaming into a $430 million listed game production company, Yoozoo.
In 2014 — the same year that The Three-Body Problem started gaining international buzz — Mr Lin established Yoozoo Pictures, making his own way to Hollywood amid the growth of Chinese investment in the sector.
On the top of his agenda was to acquire the exclusive right to adapt The Three-Body Problem trilogy, as he envisioned turning the literary series into movies, TV dramas, animation and even games.
In 2018, Mr Lin even established a new company, The Three-Body Universe, to manage the copyrights related to the series, while he reached out to Netflix for adaptation.

The two struck a deal in September 2020, one year after Netflix purchased another Chinese sci-fi blockbuster, The Wandering Earth, which was also adapted from Liu's work.
The company recruited some of the best from Hollywood, including David Benioff and DB Weiss from Game of Thrones, Rian Johnson and Ram Bergman from Star Wars, and Alexander Woo from True Blood.
It was also the year when Mr Lin ranked 43 in Hurun Global's list of 40 and under self-made billionaires, with an estimated $1.8 billion in wealth.
Then a murder happened.
The tragedy traces back to 2017, when Mr Lin decided to hire a new executive to support his ambitious dreams for The Three-Body Problem.
He chose Xu Yao, an experienced corporate lawyer with a PhD in law from the University of Michigan, and appointed him as Yoozoo's chief risk officer.
One year later, Xu became the chief executive of The Three-Body Universe. But as time passed, Mr Lin and Xu began to disagree over how to run the business.
Court statements from China detail how on December 14 and 15, 2020, Xu mixed Mr Lin's food with poisons, which led to him being sent to hospital.
Mr Lin died one week later.
The court also found that three months prior to the fatal poisoning, Xu had been adding poison to drinks at the office, which made four other people sick.
In March, just as 3 Body Problem — a slightly altered title from the original — was aired to the world on Netflix, Xu was given a death sentence in Shanghai.
Mr Lin's name was credited as executive producer for the series.
Before Netflix, Mr Lin's company had already made several attempts at adapting The Three-Body Problem trilogy into movies, animation and a TV series.
Yet many fans of the original books have mixed reviews of these adaptations.
Due to its complicated storylines and context of China's political history, The Three-Body Problem novel is often described as ""the most unadaptable"" Chinese science fiction. (Supplied: Netflix)
One common complaint is the adaptations fail to capture the books' compelling multiple storylines, characters and wide range of themes — which touch on ethics, world politics and history — on the big screen.
And the adaptation can get even more complicated when it comes to whether certain Chinese elements should be included or not.
In 2014, Liu Cixin authorised award-winning Chinese-American sci-fi writer Ken Liu to translate the first book of The Three-Body Problem.
But Ken Liu didn't just translate the novel. In his version, he restructured the timeline of the book by moving the questioning of the physicist — which is the beginning scene in the Netflix series — to the first chapter.
In an interview with the New York Times Magazine in 2019, Ken Liu explained the reshuffle was to make it easier for English-speaking readers to follow the history of the Cultural Revolution.
Liu Cixin endorsed the changes and revealed he had always wanted to make the Cultural Revolution scene the novel's opening, since the history was key to understanding the plot.
However, his publisher had rejected the idea, worrying it could cause censorship and political pressure due to the sensitivity of the history in China.
While Netflix followed through on Liu's original vision, the streaming service has drawn criticism from some Chinese viewers for distancing the story from its roots.
They point to how the nationalities of major characters have been rewritten, while the setting of the story has been moved from China to Europe.

Some argue the changes make the series focus on the novel's broader theme of humanity while reducing cultural barriers for English-speaking viewers.
But critics, including staff writing for Chinese state media, say the changes highlighted the West's attempts to defame China, while showcasing ""American cultural hegemony"".
The opinion piece, however, did not mention the Cultural Revolution scenes.
The criticism of Netflix's decision to shift the story focus from China was also reported in Chinese state media Global Times and Xinhua's English website.
But the authors of both pieces acknowledged the negative feedback reflected the challenges of telling China's stories abroad, with quotes stating the adaptation was ""a good first step"".
The ABC has reached out to The Three-Body Universe and Netflix for comment.
In an interview with The Guardian after the launch of the Netflix series, Liu Cixin revealed the question he was often asked when travelling to the US and Europe: ""There's science fiction in China?""
But in recent years, Chinese sci-fi has received growing attention outside the country's borders.
According to the latest industry report, released this week, the number of media reports about Chinese sci-fi abroad last year was 180 times more than in 2018.

The report also states that in 2023, China's sci-fi sector gained $24 billion in revenue, almost a one-third increase compared to 2022.
Dr Mia Chen Ma, a Chinese literature researcher at the University of Strathclyde, says the growing interest in Chinese sci-fi is in line with the broadening recognition of global literature by readers in Western countries.
Many Chinese sci-fi writers actively participate in international events and public talks, which also help promote Chinese science fiction, according to Dr Ma.
""Also, there are many institutions and organisations in the UK and other countries as well that are eager to introduce more emerging Chinese authors to a global audience,"" she said.
It's not only well-known male writers like Liu Cixin who are getting exposed to international readers.
A growing number of new, young female authors such as Gu Shi are making a name for themselves within the international science fiction community.
Dr Ma says for Chinese sci-fi authors, crafting a compelling story is essential to attracting international readers.
""At its heart, the universal appeal of a good story captivates us — when a story resonates, people connect with it in their unique ways,"" she said.
And high-quality storytelling seems to also be a reason why Chinese sci-fi series, such as The Three-Body Problem, attract big investments from Hollywood, according to Dr Yuxing Zhou, a Chinese cinema researcher at the University of Melbourne.
He compared Netflix's 3 Body Problem to Mulan, a Chinese folktale that was adapted into animation by Disney in 1998 and a $200 million live-action remake in 2020.
""A gripping story, the story itself, is the main thing [the Hollywood investors] look for,"" Dr Zhou said.
He said with China being one of the world's top box office markets, many Western film investors and producers may want to seek collaboration with Chinese creators to secure higher profits.
But for audiences, the quality of stories — regardless of where they are from — is the key to attracting audiences.
""It's the kind of values or messages behind the stories that would attract audiences.""
Netflix's 3 Body Problem (pictured) is similar to Mulan, with both having a gripping story, Chinese cinema researcher Dr Yuxing Zhou said. (Supplied: Netflix)
But can science fiction — a genre known for its boundless imagination and creativity — escape from the reality of geopolitics?
Just one month before Netflix's 3 Body Problem was launched, the prestigious Hugo Awards was reported to have deliberately excluded authors they believed would be ""sensitive"" to China.
Those left off the list include Neil Gaiman and RF Kuang, author of the bestseller Yellowface.
""Reality brands each of us with its indelible mark,"" Liu wrote, in the afterword of The Three-Body Problem.",Unknown,Tue 7 May 2024,0

It's arguably one of the biggest fashion events of the year, with designers showing off some of their boldest designs using the biggest pop culture figures as models.
Here's what to expect.
LIVE UPDATES: Follow our blog for all the Met Gala red carpet moments.
On paper, the Met Gala is a fundraising dinner for the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (better known as the MET) in New York City.
It coincides with the opening of a new exhibition in the gallery.
But it's essentially a big fashion event where celebrities dress up in elaborate outfits.
It's run by Vogue, the major international fashion magazine.
The event itself is private, with a strict no-phone and no-social-media policy.
But the guests' journey between being dropped off to entering the building is extremely public, with hordes of photographers capturing the arrivals.
It's not like your usual Hollywood awards night red carpet — the outfits tend to be pretty outlandish.
Celebrities typically team up with fashion houses to create a look that fits into the dress code, which changes every year.
It's almost a competition for who can be the most creative and extra, except there are no awards.
Today.
The Met Gala is held on the first Monday of May each year.
The whole thing kicks off at 6pm in New York.
On our side of the world, that'll be:
You can stream over the internet via Vogue.
The magazine will be broadcasting it on its website, as well as over YouTube and TikTok.
Live at Met Gala 2024 With Vogue
The guest list is always kept a secret up until the night before the Met Gala, Vogue magazine says.
But we already knew for sure that these four big names were coming:
... because they're hosting the event this year alongside Vogue editor Anna Wintour.
We also know that Gwendoline Christie, La La Anthony and Ashley Graham will be there because they're co-hosting the red carpet coverage for Vogue.
About 450 guests go each year, with many of them being key pop culture figures — think actors, musicians, models, fashion designers, athletes and even politicians.
The magazine is being tight-lipped about who is going this year but hints that it'll be a star-studded event.
""Some of the biggest names in the business regularly attend— from Beyoncé and Gigi Hadid to Madonna and Rihanna,"" its website says.
The theme for this year's exhibition is Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.
""The forthcoming show has not to do with the Brothers Grimm or Disney,"" the magazine says.
""But rather the celebration of clothing and fashion so fragile that it can't ever be worn again — and are thus sleeping beauties in the scrupulous archives of the Costume Institute.""
The official dress code for the Met Gala is The Garden of Time.
The magazine says the dress code was inspired by a short story by J G Ballard — which was called The Garden of Time.
It's about a count and countess who live in a grand villa, which is being threatened by an encroaching mob.
Here's how the story was summarised in a BBC article from 2012:
""The garden contains crystalline flowers at the tops of whose stems are goblet-shaped blossoms, which when snapped from the stem, drain the garden of time and motion.
""Each evening the count snaps off one of the time flowers.
""As he carries the crystal blossom onto the terrace, the menacing rabble retreats and he and his wife are safe for another day.
""But the stems no longer bear fruit, the flowers are being used up, and the count realises that time could not be stopped forever.""
The theme is for the exhibition, the dress code is for the event.
However, we're expecting the two to blend.
And, as always, we're expecting obscure interpretations of the dress code to manifest in some fabulously ridiculous outfits.
In the past few years we've seen iconic fashion moments from Zendaya, Cardi B, Blake Lively, Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Lady Gaga ... the list goes on.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-04/china-rap-revolution-sichuan-province-boss-x-hip-hop-music/103803848,A Chinese flavour of rap music is flourishing as emerging musicians find their voices,"In 2018, the censors who oversee Chinese media issued a directive to the nation's entertainment industry: Don't feature artists with tattoos and those who represent hip-hop or any other subculture.
Right after that, well-known rapper GAI missed a gig on a popular singing competition despite a successful first appearance.
Speculation went wild, as fans worried that this was the end for hip-hop in China. Some media labelled it a ban.
Rap had just experienced a banner year in the country, with a hit competition-format TV show minting new stars and introducing them to a population of 1.4 billion people.

Rappers accustomed to operating on little money and performing in small bars became household names.
The announcement from censors came at the peak of that frenzy. A silence descended, and for months no rappers appeared on the dozens of variety shows and singing competitions on Chinese TV.
But by the end of that year, everything was back in full swing.
""Hip-hop was too popular,"" says Nathanel Amar, a Chinese pop culture researcher at the French Centre for Research on Contemporary China.
""They couldn't censor the whole genre.""
What had looked like the end for Chinese hip-hop was just the beginning.
Since that moment, hip-hop's explosive growth in China has only continued.
The genre has survived by carving out a space for itself while staying clear of the government's red lines, balancing genuine creative expression with something palatable in a country with powerful censors.
Today, musicians say they're looking forward to a potential golden age.
Much of the energy can be found in Chengdu, a city in China's south-western Sichuan region.

Some of the biggest acts in China today hail from Sichuan; Wang Yitai, Higher Brothers and Vava are just a few of the names that have made Chinese rap mainstream, performing in a mix of Mandarin and Sichuan dialects.
While hip-hop in Chengdu started out with the very heavy sounds of trap, its mainstreaming has meant artists have broadened out to lighter sounds, from R&B to the trending Afro-beat rhythms popularised by Beyoncé.
Although Chinese rap has been operating underground for decades in cities like Beijing, it is the Sichuan region — known internationally for its spicy cuisine, its panda reserve and its status as the birthplace of the late leader Deng Xiaoping — that has come to dominate.
""There's a lot of rhymes in rap. And from a young age, we were exposed to language with a lot of rhymes. And I feel like we're its origin,"" says Mumu Xiang, who is from Sichuan and attended a rap concert recently held in the city.

The dialect lends itself to rap because it's softer than Mandarin Chinese and there are a lot more rhymes, says 25-year-old rapper Kidway, from a town just outside Chengdu.
""Take the word 'gang' in English. In Sichuanese, there's a lot of rhymes for that word — 'fang, sang, zhuang' — the rhymes are already there,"" he says.
Chengdu is also welcoming to outsiders, says Haysen Cheng, a 24-year-old rapper who moved to the city from Hong Kong in 2021 to work on his music at the invitation of Harikiri, a British producer who has helped shape the scene and worked with Chengdu's biggest acts.
Part of the city's hip-hop lore centres around a collective called Chengdu Rap House or CDC, founded by a rapper called Boss X, whose fans affectionately call him ""Xie laober"" in the Sichuan dialect.

The city has embraced rap, as its originators like Boss X went from making music in run-down apartments to performing in a stadium for thousands.
At Boss X's performance in March, fans sang along and cheered in Sichuanese. Even with a ban on the audience standing up — standard at all stadium performances in China — the energy was infectious.
""When I came to mainland China, they showed me more love in like three or four months than I ever received in Hong Kong,"" Cheng says.
He also got to collaborate with the Higher Brothers, one of the few Chinese rap groups who also have global recognition.
""The people here actually want each other to succeed,"" he says.

The price of going mainstream, though, means the underground scene has evaporated.
Chengdu was once known for its underground rap battles. Those no longer happen, as freestyling usually involves profanity and other content the authorities deem unacceptable.
The last time there was a rap battle in the city, rappers say, authorities quickly showed up and shut it down.
These days it's all digital, with people uploading short clips of their music to Douyin, TikTok's Chinese version, to get noticed.
Kidway says he learned to rap from going to these battles and competing against other rappers his age. He once worked at a renovation company, but ditched it to pursue rap full time.
But even though the rap battles are gone, the field has more rappers than ever — and that's a good thing.
""The more players there are,"" he says, ""the more interesting it is.""
Rarely can a single cultural product be said to have originated a whole genre of music. But the talent competition/reality TV show The Rap of China has played an outsized role in building China's rap industry.
The first season, broadcast on web streaming platform IQiyi, brought rap and hip-hop culture to households across the country. The first season's 12 episodes drew 2.5 billion views online, according to Chinese media reports.
In the first season, the show relied on its judges' star power to draw in an audience — namely Kris Wu, a Chinese-Canadian singer and former member of the hit K-pop group EXO.
Kris Wu and PG One perform at The Rap of China finals.
At that point in time, Wu was at the height of his fame, and his comments as a judge that season even became internet memes.
""Do you have freestyle?"" he asked a contestant, dead serious, on the first episode — a moment that went on to live in internet infamy because people doubted Wu's rap credentials.
Two winners emerged from the first season: GAI and PG One.
Shortly after their win, the internet was awash with rumours about the less-than-perfect doings of PG One's personal life. The Communist Youth League also criticised one of his old songs for content that appeared to be about using cocaine, very much violating one of the censor's red lines.

Then came the 2018 meeting where censors reminded TV channels of who could not appear on their programs, namely anyone who represented hip-hop.
PG One was finding that any attempts to release new music were quickly taken down by platforms, and IQiyi even took down the entire first season of The Rap of China for a while.
But by late summer 2018, fans were excited to hear that they could expect a second season of the show — though there was to be a rebrand.
The name in English stayed the same, but in Chinese it signalled a new direction, changing from ""China Has Hip-Hop"" to ""China Has Shuochang"", a term that also refers to traditional forms of storytelling.

Regulators had given the go-ahead for hip-hop to continue its growth, but they had to follow the lines set by the government censors. Hip-hop was now shuochang, and it had to stay away from mentions of drugs and sex.
Otherwise, though, it could proceed as a symbol of youth culture.
With tight censorship on the entertainment industry and a ban on mentions of drugs and sex in lyrics, artists have reacted in two ways — either wholeheartedly embracing the displays of patriotism and nationalism, or avoiding the topics entirely.
Some, like GAI, have fully taken on the government's mantle in the mainstreaming of hip-hop.
He won The Rap of China with a song called Not Friendly, in which, in classic hip-hop fashion, he dissed other rappers that he didn't name.
""I'm not friendly. I can break your pen at any moment. Tear down your flashy words … My enemies, you better pray for you to have a good end.""
Just a few years later, Gai is singing about China's glorious history on CCTV's Spring Festival New Year's Gala broadcast, a tightly scripted entertainment show with comedy sketches, songs and dance performances watched by families celebrating the Chinese New Year.

""Five thousand years of history flows past like quicksand. I'm proud to be born in Cathay,"" he sings, wearing a Qing dynasty-inspired Tang jacket.
The red lines have also pushed artists to be more creative. For Chinese rap to thrive, artists have to find original voices, they say.
Thirty-two-year-old rapper Fulai describes his own music as chill rap, or ""bedroom music"" — not in the euphemistic sense, but the type of music you listen to as you lay in bed.
His upcoming album, he says, is about ordinary things like fights with his wife and washing dishes.
Still, Fulai says he talks about sex a lot in his lyrics, given Chinese is a language with countless sayings and a strong poetic tradition.

Developing a genuine Chinese brand of rap remains a work in progress.
Hip-hop got its start from New York's boroughs of Brooklyn and the Bronx, where rappers made music out of their tough circumstances, from shootouts to crime to illegal drug dealing.
In China, the challenge is about finding what fits its context. Shootouts are rare in a country where guns are banned, and the penalties for drug use are high.
The rap crews in Chongqing, another mega-city in the Sichuan region, had a taste of gang culture reflected in their music as artists wrote about fights and vows of brotherhood. But most of today's biggest acts don't rap about topics like knifing someone or drug use anymore.

Wang Yitai, who was a member of Chengdu's rap collective CDC, is now one of the most popular rappers in China. His style has infused mainstream pop sounds.
""We're all trying hard to create songs that not only sound good, but also topics that fit for China,"" Wang says.
""I think hip-hop's spirit will always be about original creation and will always be about your own story.""

A joint statement by the two companies says they've reached an agreement that will put music from Universal's artists back on the platform.
TikTok has promised to deliver improved remuneration for Universal's songwriters and artists, while implementing protections to combat generative AI.
Universal and TikTok are now working to return music by artists represented by Universal Music Group and songwriters represented by Universal Music Publishing Group back to TikTok.
Universal announced it was pulling music from the platform in January after accusing TikTok of ""bully"" tactics and ""intimidation"" during negotiations.
Universal said in an open letter at the time that ""TikTok is trying to build a music-based business, without paying fair value for the music"".
TikTok hit back at the time saying: ""It is sad and disappointing that Universal Music Group has put their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters"".
The record label also said TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, had allowed the platform to be flooded with AI-generated recordings.
Songs by Taylor Swift, Drake, Billie Eilish and more could vanish from the platform after one of the world's biggest record labels slammed TikTok over ""bully"" tactics in an open letter.
Universal Music's roster of big-name artists includes Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, Drake, Lady Gaga, Post Malone, Ariana Grande, The Beatles, Sam Smith, Kendrick Lamar and Billie Eilish.
Australian artists include Tame Impala, Hilltop Hoods, Matt Corby, Avalanches, Baker Boy and Barkaa.
Swift's music returned to TikTok as she was promoting her new album and while the two companies were still at loggerheads because unlike many other artists, Swift owns the copyright to her recordings that lets her control where her music is made available.
In a statement, the chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group, Sir Lucian Grainge said the agreement marked a new chapter.
""This new chapter in our relationship with TikTok focuses on the value of music, the primacy of human artistry and the welfare of the creative community,"" he said.
""We look forward to collaborating with the team at TikTok to further the interests of our artists and songwriters and drive innovation in fan engagement while advancing social music monetisation.""
""What do small fish do?"" Homegrown acts are raising questions (and finding loopholes) regarding Universal Music Group pulling their music from the world's biggest social media platform.
The CEO of TikTok Shou Chew acknowledged that music is a fundamental part of TikTok's business model.
""Music is an integral part of the TikTok ecosystem and we are pleased to have found a path forward with Universal Music Group,"" Chew said.
""We are committed to working together to drive value, discovery and promotion for all of UMG's amazing artists and songwriters, and deepen their ability to grow, connect and engage with the TikTok community.""
TikTok's global head of Music Business Development Ole Obermann was thrilled.
""We are delighted to welcome UMG and UMPG back to TikTok.
""We look forward to working together to forge a path that creates deeper connections between artists, creators, and fans.
""In particular, we will work together to make sure that AI tools are developed responsibly to enable a new era of musical creativity and fan engagement while protecting human creativity.""

The  chief digital officer and EVP, Universal Music Group Michael Nash said there's great potential in the collaboration.
""Developing transformational partnerships with important innovators is critical to UMG's commitment to promoting an environment in which artists and songwriters prosper.
""We're gratified to renew our relationship with TikTok predicated on significant advancements in commercial and marketing opportunities as well as protections provided to our industry-leading roster on their platform.
""With the constantly evolving ways that social interaction, fan engagement, music discovery and artistic ingenuity converge on TikTok, we see great potential in our collaboration going forward.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-02/dan-schneider-sues-quiet-on-set-for-defamation/103794456,'It was a hit job': Nickelodeon show creator Dan Schneider sues Quiet on Set producers for defamation,"Former Nickelodeon show creator Dan Schneider has filed a defamation lawsuit against the creators of Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV.
The five-part docuseries, which was released earlier this year, focused on the making of some of Nickelodeon's most iconic children's programs of the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Schneider's legal team said the series' portrayal of him was ""a hit job"" in court papers published by US entertainment magazine Variety:
""Defendants falsely state or imply that Schneider .... sexually abused the children who worked on his television shows.
""These statements are fabrications.""
Quiet on Set was critical of Nickelodeon and Schneider, with some of his former colleagues accusing the showrunner of creating a hostile work environment.
Among the specific claims were allegations from two former female writers on The Amanda Show, who said they were subjected to sexist hazing in the Schneider-led writing room.
Following the release of the docuseries, Schneider released a 19-minute apology video to YouTube.
In response to hostile work environment allegations, Schneider said he ""made practical jokes that went too far"" because he was ""immature"" and ""inexperienced"".
Another key focus of the series was Drake Bell, who spoke for the first time about sexual abuse he endured as a child actor.
The series also established that two convicted child abusers, Brian Peck and Jason Handy, worked on Schneider's show.
Schneider's legal team said he had ""no knowledge of their abuse"" and ""was not a child sexual abuser himself"" in the legal papers published by Variety.
The child stars from Nickelodeon's heyday have grown up, and now they're speaking out against the machine and long-time producer Dan Schneider.
The lawsuit specifically claimed the voiceovers and graphics in Quiet on Set, as well as the series trailer were ""purposefully and intentionally defamatory"".
It's filed against three entertainment companies — Warner Bros Discovery, Maxine Productions and Sony Pictures —  as well as two producers —  Mary Robertson and Emma Schwartz.
The ABC has contacted Warner Bros Discovery, Maxine Productions and Sony Pictures for comment.
Schneider's legal team are seeking financial compensation.

Ramo has written a book called Human? — and there's also an album of the same name that you can access via various QR Codes in the book.
Artwork within the pages of the book designed by Ramo's sister Brydi Fatnowna completes the three-dimensional approach.
Ramo is cognisant that different people learn in different ways, and sometimes an individual can switch it up depending on their mood – he's one of those people.
""For me, depending on the minute of the day, what is going to get my attention and hold my attention is so different,"" the Wik and Solomon Islander rapper told ABC News.
""With this work, I really wanted it to feel like a sprawling kind of pick your own adventure.
""So, whether or not on that given day, art is going to move you visually, or it's sonically or it's the written word, I really kind of wanted to remove any obstacle to engage in this across demographics.""
Ramo isn't trying to tell people how to think or even sway opinions.
The beauty of Human? is it offers a perspective steeped in history and in the lived experience of its author.
""It's not like the handbook in what solves the position we're in,"" Ramo says.
""I think it really is kind of, you know, when you rock up to a [tutorial], or a classroom, and it's like, 'Have you done the prior reading?' and that prior reading kind of sets an even footing to then have opinions about.
""And I think growing up in this country, I've seen the vast majority of people have a lot of opinions about an experience that they haven't, one, either lived, or two, really dug into.
""And so, with this work, I was just trying to capture what it was like to be privileged enough to grow up with a father who's an academic and who has given us access to knowledge and history.""

For Ramo, it's also deeply personal. He says telling his story is ""a matter of survival"" for him.
""When I was younger, and I wasn't open and transparent, it felt like poisoning myself.
""You know, like pretending like I was OK. It felt completely isolating. And it felt completely unsustainable to the point that it put fuel on my suicidal ideation fire.
""And so, for me to kind of grapple back a sense of contentedness, it was just about coming to a place of 'yeah, I'm not OK.' And this is how this intergenerational trauma is manifesting.""
Ramo served as one of the Melbourne Writers Festival's Curators for 2024 and will take to the stage for a live musical performance and a chat about his memoir when the festival kicks off next week.

He deals with some weighty issues in his book, detailing his experience of appearing on the ABC's Q&A, which prevented him from performing his song April 25th.
""I'm not naive to what that song is and what feathers it ruffles,"" Ramo says.
""It was literally designed to do that, because the issue that everyone takes is the disrespect that is thrown onto the Anzacs.
""And as I write in the closing of that chapter, no one has ever taken issue with the disrespect that is thrown to black people in that song.""
Ramo also writes about his time on the set of the Stan series Black Snow, of which he is currently composing the score for season two.
When he catalogues his experiences with disordered eating, it's refreshing to hear a man talk so candidly about the issue.
The book has been a long time coming and was something he wanted to write as far back as 2015 when he penned his debut album Black Thoughts – an album he didn't release till 2020.
Ramo describes as ""haunting"" how relevant the album was five years later in the midst of global protests following the killing of African American man George Floyd at the hands of a police officer.
""In the context of writing Black Thoughts, I was living in Perth at the time and there was the closure of remote communities, kind of spearheaded by Tony Abbott,"" Ramo says.
The death of Kalgoorlie teenager Elijah Doughty also added to what Ramo describes as a ""pressure cooker that kind of felt akin to what 2020 felt, but in our context of our community, in Perth.""
Ramo says writing Black Thoughts felt like a ""necessity of expression"".
""I guess the thing is when you're writing about systemic issues, it's a cyclical nature, in that they'll continue to pop up.
""So, an emotion that I had captured five years earlier, rose to the surface again … it was just like, this is really disheartening that this album five years ago, speaks to exactly what I'm feeling again right now.""
The cover of Black Thoughts has his ""heroes"" on it – his mum and dad.
And Black Thoughts is what led to Human?
""The origin story of it all was that I thought Black Thoughts should be a book,"" he says.
""So, Black Thoughts is just under 7,000 words in the lyrics. And that's a dense album.""
Turning the project into a book means it can enter more spaces – and have different people engage with it, he says.
When Ramo updated Kev Carmody and Paul Kelly's song From Little Things Big Things Grow to Little Things featuring Kelly, he could not have anticipated what would come of it.
""Without Little Things, this project wouldn't be exist, really,"" Ramo said.
""I think, when Uncle Kev Carmody and Paul Kelly allowed me to be a part of their story, it kind of showed me that Australians understand stories in folk music, you know, that's the genre in which we expect stories to be told.
""And we have a great reverence for the storytelling that occurs in that place.
""I mean, even artists like Uncle Archie Roach as well.
""And so, I think, when I made Little Things, very similar messages that I've been talking about for my career, seemed to cut through and seemed to allow people to make sense of them in a different way.""
Ziggy was brought to tears performing the hard-hitting 'Little Things' on The Set. And judging by the online comments, he wasn't alone.
Teachers contacted the songwriters for the lyrics and sent photos of activities they'd carried out in their classrooms off the back of Little Things.
""And then off the back of doing Little Things, and then that literally going into schools and, you know, people teaching it, it just started to kind of crystallise that there was the same idea of an album and a book, but it was about capturing where I was now.
""And so, the writing of the music and the book were completely inter-connected.
""I was kind of going between the studio and writing first the manuscript, and both the first demos and the first manuscript kind of fell out in a matter of weeks, it just flooded out.
""And then it has just been a journey of going back and re-engaging and refining.""

From literary news to the best jokes and worst moments of the White House Correspondents' Dinner, to a breakdown of why Drake's latest track has been wiped from the web, we've got you covered.
Ahhh, the White House correspondents' dinner, a time for all of the journalists that cover the White House to come together and gently rib the most powerful person in the western world while he's in the room.
Many even credit Barack Obama's full-body take-down of then-real-estate mogul Donald Trump at the 2011 dinner as the impetus for Trump's eventual run at presidency (a conspiracy the Don denies but, you know, he denies a lot of things).
Trump was in the firing line again at the 2024 edition, with the former president catching barbs from comedian Colin Jost.
""Can we just acknowledge how refreshing it is to see a president of the United States at an event that doesn't begin with a bailiff saying, 'All rise'?"" Jost said, kicking off his speech with a shot at Trump's myriad of criminal charges and civil lawsuits.
Colin Jost's complete remarks at the 2024 White House correspondents' dinner
Despite being in the midst of several court cases and with dozens of charges against him, Trump is still presumed to be the Republican nominee to face Biden come the November election.
Jost said: ""There's an election six extremely long months from now. So let me see if I can summarise where this race stands at this moment: The Republican candidate for president owes half a billion in fines for bank fraud, and is currently spending his days farting himself awake during a porn star hush money trial, and the race is tied?! The race is tied! Nothing makes sense anymore!
""Now that OJ is dead, who is the new frontrunner for Trump's VP? Is it Diddy? By the way, I bet if Trump did select Diddy as his running mate, I bet this race would still be tied!""
Biden also got some of his own dumps on Trump during his speech: ""Donald has had a few tough days lately. You might call it 'Stormy weather',"" Biden said, referring to the court case currently centred on whether Trump paid porn star Stormy Daniels $US130,000 ($198,000) to cover up their affair.
He also took aim at critics that cast him as too old for a second term (Biden is 81 and Trump is 77).
""The 2024 election is in full swing and yes, age is an issue,"" he said. ""I'm a grown man running against a six-year-old.""

As much fun as it is to see leaders of the free world act like catty high schoolers, to get inside the event, Jost, Biden, celebrities including Chris Pine, Scarlett Johansson, Jon Hamm and the rest of the almost 3,000 other attendees had to walk past hundreds of people protesting the US's response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Protesters lay sprawled motionless on the pavement, next to mock-ups of flak vests with ""press"" insignia.
Last week, more than two dozen journalists in Gaza wrote a letter calling for their colleagues to boycott the dinner.
Biden's speech, which lasted around 10 minutes, made no mention of the ongoing war or the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Australian author Kate Grenville has been shortlisted for the Women's Prize for Fiction, worth 30,000 British pounds ($57,000), for her latest novel Restless Dolly Maunder.
The author drew upon family records to write the book based on the life of her grandmother, who lived itinerantly with her husband, moving from a farm to a series of pubs in Sydney and regional NSW.
Grenville is the author of more than 15 books, most famously the Booker-shortlisted The Secret River, which has been adapted for the stage and the screen.
She previously won the award in 2001, for her novel The Idea of Perfection. She is the only Australian author to have won the Women's Prize (formerly known as the Orange Prize).
On being shortlisted, Grenville said:
""Women's books have so often been overlooked in the big noisy world of literary prizes – the Women's Prize has been a really important part of changing that. I'm hugely grateful for having being awarded it for The Idea of Perfection in 2001 – it gave my writing life a second chance when it seemed to be over. Now, I can only think how astonished and delighted my grandmother would be, to have her story brought to the world in this way.""
The rest of the shortlist for the international literary prize includes Anne Enright, V. V. Ganeshananthan, Isabella Hammad, Claire Kilroy and Aube Rey Lescure.
Grenville becoming a finalist follows another Australian author, Alexis Wright, being shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award, for her book Praiseworthy, at the end of March.
The winner of the Women's Prize for Fiction will be announced on June 14.

There's been an interesting turn in the ongoing feud between two of hip hop's biggest artists.
On April 19, Drake shared Taylor Made Freestyle, a diss track targeting Pulitzer-winning artist Kendrick Lamar in verses employing AI voice filters made to sound like two of Lamar's forebears: Snoop Dogg and the late, great Tupac ""2Pac"" Shakur.
Turns out, the 2Pac estate was not thrilled about it.
Why are rap's biggest names fighting? And why is that good business for everyone involved? Here's your answers.
Drake was stung with a cease-and-desist letter, as Billboard reported, demanding he pull Taylor Made Freestyle from the internet within 24 hours or face legal action.
""Not only is the record a flagrant violation of Tupac's publicity and the estate's legal rights, it is also a blatant abuse of the legacy of one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time"", the letter read.
The post on X containing Taylor Made Freestyle has disappeared from Drake's @champagnepapi account.
The reaction to Taylor Made Freestyle ""split people down the middle"", music journalist Thomas Hobbs told ABC RN's Sunday Extra.
""Some people found it hilarious… just as many people were shocked [at] taking the voice of a dead Black artist who was murdered before his time and puppeteering it.""

Luca Guadagnino's steamy movie Challengers has been out in Australia for a hot minute, and now, thanks to its US release this past week, the internet is awash with memes and reactions to its sweaty love triangle between tennis stars.
Starring Zendaya, Josh O'Connor (The Crown; La Chimera) and Mike Faist (West Side Story), Challengers sees the trio in a 13-year, sexually charged struggle on and off the court: As ABC Entertainment reviewer Michael Sun wrote, it's a ""libidinous spectacle"".
People are, understandably, reacting completely normally to the film's eroticism, thirsting particularly hard for Faist and O'Connor.
There's also a lot of love for Challengers's score, by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, which turns the tennis court into a techno club. If only Faist broke out these moves in the film (yes, that's him in the below video):
If you're confused by the reaction, I'm guessing you haven't seen Challengers. It's in cinemas now.

Get ready for some sex quizzes and fashion spreads, because Cosmo is coming back Down Under.
Cosmopolitan magazine started in the US in 1886 (!!!), but didn't come to Australia until 1973. By then it had been taken over by brilliant feminists who wanted to tackle ""taboo"" topics like sex and women's pleasure, and also introduced the notorious Cosmo centrefold: Burt Reynolds was the very first US model; Australia got Skippy actor Tony Bonner when the magazine launched here.

The Australian arm of the publication was axed in December 2018, with the publisher at the time saying ""the commercial viability of the magazine in Australia is no longer sustainable"".
But the iconic mag will be back, in physical form, from August, led by Sydney publisher Katarina Kroslakova (previously an editor for the Australian Financial Review, and the publisher and editor of T: The New York Times Style Magazine Australia).
There will be six glossy mags a year, as well as a digital and social presence.
With the revival of Elle Australia in March, is this the start of the great magazine comeback? But the real question obviously is, will they be bringing back the centrefold?

There's no easy way to say this: Harry Jowsey has skin cancer.
The 26-year-old Australian influencer and Too Hot to Handle star told his 5 million Tiktok followers over the weekend that a routine skin check had found skin cancer.
He assured followers that he was going to be OK and he's using the scare to urge people to slap on that sunscreen.
""Go get your skin checked, wear your sunscreen and be a little bit more responsible because that's what I've got to do now, and it's very scary,"" Jowsey said.
Australia might be heading into cooler months, but ultraviolet rays don't care what season we're in or if it's cloudy.
So listen to the reality TV star and slip, slop, slap! (Did you know you're supposed to be putting on SEVEN TEASPOONS of sunscreen every full-body application???)

Her new album The Tortured Poets Department has also outsold the rest of the top ten combined, while beating The Beatles' record of fastest artist to rack up 12 UK number one albums.
""No other artist has notched up 12 number one albums in such a short space of time,"" the official charts company said.
""Taylor Swift has done it in 11 years and six months. This surpasses The Beatles, who managed the feat in 14 years and one month.""
Taylor Swift is officially a billionaire, with Forbes confirming the megastar is the first artist to reach the wealthy status solely from songwriting and performing
The first single from the album Fortnight featuring Post Malone topped the UK singles chart.
Not long after the album was released, Spotify and Amazon Music said it was their most streamed album in a day.
Spotify later said it was their most-streamed album in a single week, surpassing 1billion streams.
Swift has also shattered ARIA records.
She now holds the record for the most number one albums in ARIA history for a female artist.
In Australia, Swift moves ahead of Madonna to claim third place on the list of acts with the most chart-topping albums in the country.
Jimmy Barnes leads with 15 as a solo act (he had another five with Cold Chisel), followed by the Beatles with 14.
The Tortured Poets Department is Swift's 13th number one ARIA album.
According to Billboard, Swift's album sales are bolstered by its availability across more than 20 different iterations of the album. (Instagram: @taylorswift)
Fortnight has also climbed the charts in Australia and is Swift's 12th number one ARIA single.
Swift is the first artist to hold the entire top 10 on the singles chart, with Hozier at number 11 with Too Sweet.
ARIA Top 10 singles
She has also set the record for the most singles in the top 50, charting a total of 29 tracks on the current chart.
We unpack the best moments and greatest disappointments of the emotional rollercoaster that is Taylor Swift's new album The Tortured Poets Department.
Swift is still the only artist in ARIA history to replace themselves at number one on the album chart, having done so three times – two of those times with debuting albums.
In 2023, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) replaced Midnights; March 2024 saw Lover replace Midnights; and last week The Tortured Poets Department replaced Lover.
It's the most-sold album on vinyl and most-streamed album in week one in ARIA history.
Swift has also made an historic debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart.
It's her 14th chart-topping album on the Billboard charts.

Swift ties with Jay-Z for the most number ones among soloists in the almost-70-year history of the chart.
Only the Beatles have more number ones, with 19.
With 1.914 million sold, Billboard reports that The Tortured Poets Department is the top-selling album of 2024 to date, with Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter coming in at number two, with 228,000 copies sold.
Billboard published a list of the acts with at least 10 number ones on the Billboard 200, since the list began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in March 1956.
They are as follows:

Wilson's memoir was initially slated for an April release in Australia, but publication was delayed.
It came out in the United States on April 2 under publisher Simon & Schuster, with excerpts quoted in the media.
One of those excerpts — about fellow actor Sacha Baron Cohen — of which Wilson designates a chapter won't see the light of day locally.
Rebel Rising will now be released in Australia May 8. (Supplied: HarperCollins Australia)
A statement from HarperCollins Australia released to ABC News reads:
""For legal reasons we have redacted one chapter in the ANZ edition and included an explanatory note accordingly.
""That chapter is a very small part of a much bigger story and we're excited for readers to know Rebel's story when the book is released, on Wednesday 8 May.""
The UK edition was released Thursday with blacked out text and a note saying the redactions were made ""due to peculiarities of the law in England and Wales"".
Wilson began promoting Rebel Rising earlier this year and in March posted an Instagram story saying she would ""not be bullied or silenced with high priced lawyers or PR crisis managers"" who she said Cohen had hired to stop the book's publication.
Wilson's account of working on the film Grimsby (known as The Brothers Grimsby in the US) with Cohen has been described by the Borat star as ""demonstrably false"" and ""directly contradicted by extensive detailed evidence.""
Wilson says she felt humiliated by the comedian on the set of the 2016 movie, claiming she was asked to perform a lewd act.

In response to this latest news about the redactions, Cohen's spokesperson issued a statement to ABC News saying:
""HarperCollins did not fact check this chapter in the book prior to publication and took the sensible but terribly belated step of deleting Rebel Wilson's defamatory claims once presented with evidence that they were false.
""Printing falsehoods is against the law in the UK and Australia; this is not a 'peculiarity' as Ms. Wilson said, but a legal principle that has existed for many hundreds of years.
""The removal of false material is a clear victory for Sacha Baron Cohen and confirms what we said from the beginning — that this is demonstrably false, asserted in a shameful and failed effort to sell books.""
Wilson, who starred in Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect, writes about losing her virginity at 35 and how she was initially ""terrified"" of physical intimacy.
""I was either so innocent, in my teens, or so busy making myself look grotesquely unattractive for comedic purposes, that no romantic opportunity ever presented itself,"" she's quoted as writing.
Wilson also writes about her sexuality and welcoming the birth of her daughter in November 2022 with fiancé Ramona Agruma via surrogate.

Her struggles with her weight also feature in the book. She writes about appearing in the SBS comedy Fat Pizza, saying she was subject to some ""fatphobic"" jokes, a claim Paul Fenech, who created the show took issue with.
Wilson also alleges she was invited to a drug-fuelled orgy at a US tech billionaire's home by a member of the British Royal family, who she says was ""15th or 20th in the line to the British throne"".
HarperCollins describes Wilson's memoir as ""refreshingly candid, hilarious and inspiring"" but the critics have not been as kind.
iNews in Britain says the book is ""so poorly written it's distracting.""
The Telegraph said it contains a ""potpourri of weak jokes and self-indulgence.""

In an interview with V Magazine, Hathaway (The Devil Wears Prada), who won the best supporting actress Oscar in 2013 for Les Misérables, described the encounters as ""gross"" but said it was normal practice back then.
""Back in the 2000s — and this did happen to me — it was considered normal to ask an actor to make out with other actors to test for chemistry. Which is actually the worst way to do it,"" Hathaway said.
""I was told, 'We have 10 guys coming today and you're cast. Aren't you excited to make out with all of them?' And I thought, 'Is there something wrong with me?' because I wasn't excited.
""I thought it sounded gross.
""And I was so young and terribly aware how easy it was to lose everything by being labelled 'difficult,' so I just pretended I was excited and got on with it.
""It wasn't a power play, no one was trying to be awful or hurt me. It was just a very different time and now we know better.""
The Idea of You is available to stream on Prime Video from May 2. (Supplied: Prime Video)
Hathaway is promoting her new film The Idea of You based on the 2017 novel of the same name by Robinne Lee.
It's about Solène (Hathaway), a 40-year-old single mum who begins an unexpected romance with 24-year-old Hayes Campbell (Nicholas Galitzine), the lead singer of August Moon, ""the hottest boy band on the planet.""
The story goes that when Solène chaperones her teenage daughter's trip to the Coachella Music Festival, she has a chance encounter with Hayes and there is an instant, undeniable spark.
As they begin a whirlwind romance, it isn't long before Hayes' superstar status poses unavoidable challenges to their relationship.

Hathaway is a producer on the film, which took a very different approach to intimacy auditions.
""We asked each of the actors coming in to choose a song that they felt their character would love, that they would put on to get my character to dance, and then we'd do a short little improv,"" Hathaway said.
""I was sitting in a chair like we had come in from dinner or a walk or something, we pressed play, and we just started dancing together.""
Galitzine (Mary & George, Cinderella, Bottoms) who won the part picked the Alabama Shakes.

Hathaway said she had some positive experiences also as a teenager in Hollywood and was invited into the filmmaking process by the late director Garry Marshall (Pretty Woman, Laverne & Shirley), who valued her opinion as a 17-year-old when he directed her in 2001's The Princess Diaries.
""To be honest, it never occurred to me that I didn't have the power of a point of view, at least creatively as it related to my character. I'm really lucky,"" she said.
""My first substantial film role, the second film I ever did, was The Princess Diaries. I was so generously invited into that process by Garry Marshall; he valued my take on being a teenage girl and elevated me to such a valued status on set that it never occurred to me on other sets that I didn't have that same autonomy, or that same ability to collaborate.
""I always wanted to be pleasant. But I also always thought that having strong opinions meant I was doing my job.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-24/skateboarding-history-newcastle-newsouthwales/103754410,"Built in a backyard, this skate ramp would go on to become stuff of legend","Since Newcastle's Poppy Starr-Olsen made history by becoming the first Australian to compete in Olympic skateboarding, the Hunter region has become a hub for up-and-coming skateboarders.
But you might not know that one of the key influences on Australian skateboarding came from a 3-metre-tall wooden ramp built by 20 year olds in a suburban Merewether backyard.
How a homemade halfpipe supercharged skateboarding in Newcastle
In the early 1980s, Sean Mussett, also known as Gravel Burns, was itching to skate ""vert"" — to ride down a skate ramp or some sort of vertical incline to perform skateboarding tricks.
Skaters like Sean 'Gravel Burns' Mussett helped put Newcastle on the skateboarding map in the 1980s.  (ABC Newcastle: Laurise Dickson)
The trouble was that there was nothing like that around Newcastle — just an old, blue, fibreglass ramp down by Bar Beach.
But that wasn't going to stop a ragtag group of skating diehards.
""My mate's dad had a concreting business and we had access to tools, so we started building this monstrous ramp on Ridge Street in late '85, early '86,"" Sean said.
It took Sean Mussett and his mates three months to build the Ridge Street skate ramp. (Supplied: Sean Mussett)
Driven by sheer devotion to skating and with some borrowed plywood and timber, Sean and his mates spent three months constructing a skate ramp that was 3m tall and 6m wide — nearly the size of a singles tennis court, but much taller.
Newcastle skateboarding historian, Jim Turvey, reckons the Ridge Street ramp was a unique DIY approach.

""It was a world-class vert ramp to skate when there wasn't anything like that around here and it was something that wasn't a facility that was provided by any kind of government body,"" he said.
The ramp ended up on Ridge Street in Merewether because one of Sean's friend's parents had bravely said they could build it in their backyard.
They might not have realised how big the finished ramp would be.
""Every single person who walked into that backyard just looked at it and their mouth dropped,"" Sean said.

From the top, skaters could see out over the treetops and above neighbouring houses.
People would come from across Australia and as far away as New Zealand to try it out.
""It was so good that the Sydney crew would drive up the highway back then, you know, two-and-a-half, three hours and skate for the whole weekend ... week in, week out,"" Sean said.
The Ridge Street ramp only lasted 10 months before being dismantled due to planning issues, but it had a lasting impact on skate culture around Newcastle.
Sean, along with Al Tindall, would go on to develop one of Australia's first skateboarding magazines, Skateboard Australia, which featured skate competitions at the Ridge Street ramp.
Local governments in the Hunter region are more skate-friendly than they were in the 1980s.
Lake Macquarie City Council has invested more than $3 million since 2021 into constructing three new skate facilities at Windale, Morisset and Croudace Bay, with plans to contribute to the new Watagans skate park development.

Local skateboarders like 21-year-old Marley Rae are taking notice.
""The councils are being super generous with us skaters, whether they're building brand new skate parks or they're making skate-friendly areas for street skaters,"" he said.
""They love what we do and it's really awesome to see.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-22/bluey-surprise-episode-taylor-swift-album-review-micf-winners/103752456,"Bluey drops secret episode, reviewers hide from Swiftie death threats and Spice Girls reunite","The world is currently suffering a case of Swift-itis after Taylor released her 11th LP on Friday. The Tortured Poets Department turned out to be a surprise double album and it has received a … tepid response (more on that later).
But for those who haven't jumped aboard the Taylor train, here's what you missed over the weekend in entertainment.
Parents (and non-parents) across the globe had one question after the season three finale of Bluey dropped last week: Is this the end?!?!
The 28-minute-long episode The Sign saw our Blue Heeler fam make the big decision to put their beloved Paddington residence up for auction. The episode ends (spoiler alert) with daddy Bandit pulling the ""For Sale"" sign out of the grass, before he pulls his family into a cuddle puddle.
The ambiguous ending left many wondering if pulling a sign out of the ground is a legally binding closure of sale, but (spoiler alert: 2 Fast 2 Spoil) it is!!
While most of us were snoozing soundly on Sunday morning, a surprise episode of Bluey, aptly named Surprise!, dropped on ABC iview. Chock-full of the heartwarming familial lessons that Bluey fans know and love, the episode features (spoiler alert three: The Spoilening) a rare flash-forward to a near future complete with flying drones, robot cleaners, a grown-up Bluey and a Heeler grandchild!!!
Of course, the internet is already set on finding out who is the father of Bluey's babe.
In order to keep Surprise! a surprise, ABC went so far as to falsely list a Bluey re-run in television guides to throw fans off the scent.
""Bluey's hallmark charm is that it is always surprising, and we love to do things differently to keep the fans thinking,"" ABC head of children and family Libbie Doherty said.
""Our intention was for the fans to wake up to their usual ABC Kids Sunday 8am slot and be blown away by a brand-new episode.""
Further confirmation of the series' continuation came from Bluey producer Sam Moor on BBC Radio 4, where Moor assured fans: ""We have more in store and we're thinking about what would be next.""
Is this the start of time-jump Bluey à la Rugrats: All Grown Up? Only time will tell.

Paste Magazine has opted to publish its review of Taylor Swift's latest (double) album, The Tortured Poets Department, without a by-line, in order to avoid its author receiving ""threats of violence"".
The review holds nothing back, calling the 31-track anthology a sign that ""Swift no longer feels challenged to be good"", with extra disappointment reserved for the album's lyricism (""This is your songwriter of the century? Open the schools"").
While reviews so far skew positive, Paste isn't alone. The New Yorker has said it ""suffers from being too long and too familiar"" and that her work with long-term producer Jack Antonoff ""has perhaps run its course"".
Upon publication, Paste released a short editor's note, explaining why the review was anonymised: ""There is no by-line on this review due to how, in 2019 when Paste reviewed [Swift album] 'Lover', the writer was sent threats of violence from readers who disagreed with the work. We care more about the safety of our staff than a name attached to an article.""
Reaction from Swifties has been… mixed.
Paste isn't alone in anonymising by-lines to avoid writers getting doxxed when writing about artists with passionate stans.
In 2020, Australian pop-culture site Junkee announced it would publish potentially incendiary articles about artists with anonymous by-lines, citing multiple incidents of its writers being doxxed and harassed.

The creators of What Jennifer Did, a recent Netflix true-crime documentary, have been accused of manipulating or generating archival images using AI technology.
The documentary focuses on Canadian Jennifer Pan, who in 2010 was convicted for a kill-for-hire attack on her parents, resulting in her mother's death and father's significant injuries.
As reported by Futurism, the documentary features several images of Pan with telltale signs of AI image manipulation. One particular image shows Pan posing for a photo, smiling with her hands in peace signs, but her fingers are ill-defined, especially on her right hand. Her left shoulder is oddly shaped, and background images stuck onto furniture and the wall are confusing.
No use of AI is included in the film's credits.
Note Jennifer's fingers, her shoulder and the images on the black cabinet. (Supplied: Netflix)
People are concerned the film manipulated images, given that it's about a real-life murder.
Executive producer Jeremy Grimaldi denied that Pan's likeness was altered, but said he had good reason for some edits.
""Any filmmaker will use different tools, like Photoshop, in films,"" he said in an interview with Canadian publication the Toronto Star.
""The photos of Jennifer are real photos of her. The foreground is exactly her. The background has been anonymised to protect the source.""
It comes after several other AI controversies, with Aussie horror Late Night with the Devil receiving criticism for its use of image generation for in-film logos and graphics, given that AI generators pull from real works without payment or accreditation.
Additionally, film studio A24 has come under fire for using AI-generation in marketing material for Civil War, its blockbuster starring Kirsten Dunst set in a near-future United States. Images posted to social media last week feature recognisable sites across the US ravaged by war, in scenes that don't feature in the film themselves.
Zooming in reveals several issues, whether that be a soldier with a sphere for a head, a giant swan in place of a paddleboat and repeated buildings and boats. A source ""close to the movie"" confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter they are AI-generated images, inspired by the movie's conceit.
Ironically, Civil War writer-director Alex Garland is probably best known for 2014 sci-fi Ex Machina, which is all about AI.

After The Picture of Dorian Gray won two Olivier Awards last week, Cate Blanchett and her husband Andrew Upton have picked up the film rights to the ""cine-theatre"" epic, through their production company Dirty Films.
The play, adapted from Oscar Wilde's 19th-century novel, sees Sarah Snook (Succession) play 26 characters over the course of two hours, including the ever-youthful Dorian Gray, through the use of live performance and live and prerecorded video.

The play is directed and adapted by Sydney Theatre Company's outgoing artistic director Kip Williams. The original production, starring Eryn Jean Norvill, picked up four awards at both the 2021 Sydney Theatre Awards and the 2023 Green Room Awards for Melbourne theatre, including best actor, best production and best director.
Blanchett and Upton were co-artistic directors of Sydney Theatre Company (STC) from 2008-2012 (Upton continued solo until 2015). Their production company is behind movies and TV shows including AACTA winners The New Boy and ABC TV's Stateless. Upton is now working with Williams on a film treatment for the one-woman show.
The Picture of Dorian Gray from STC and Michael Cassel Group continues at Theatre Royal on London's West End until May. It is expected to transfer to Broadway in 2025.

Rihanna's fans are in mourning after the billionaire singer and beauty mogul changed her Instagram profile picture from the stick figure drawing she debuted in 2014.
FWIW, it's been replaced to match her make-up brand Fenty Beauty's avatar, of a product being held by a hand – but in @badgirlriri's version, the hand is a stick figure, suggesting that our squiggly haired queen is just out of shot.
Fans are taking the change well. Thinking of that one person who has it tattooed on their body.

Two exciting music documentaries will have their Australian premiere as part of Sydney's Vivid festival next month, covering the lives and groundbreaking work of Brian Eno and Devo.
Eno promises a truly unique experience for cinemagoers, as director Gary Hustwit uses new technology to ensure no two viewings are the same.
Netflix's new documentary on George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley, helmed by Tiger King director Chris Smith, is filled with footage and audio previously sealed in the group's vault.
There are ""millions of possible variations of scenes"" thanks to a new software system that takes hundreds of hours of Eno's archival footage, as well as new interviews filmed for the doco, and allows Hustwit to shape them and create a new version of the film live on stage.
Given Eno's adventurous creative spirit, it seems a fitting way to celebrate his life and work.
Devo, directed by Chris Smith (who has earned acclaim for films on Wham and Fyre Festival), is said to be the definitive documentary about the famed, energy dome-wearing Akron, Ohio band. It comes to Vivid after scoring rave reviews at its Sundance premiere earlier this year.
Both films screen at the Sydney Opera House as part of Vivid next month.

It took Swift less than 24 hours to notch a few more records on streaming platforms Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.
Here's what records Swift's TTPD has broken and how the numbers compare to other music icons.
TTPD became Spotify's most streamed album in a single day, the platform announced on X (formerly Twitter).
The album exceeded 300 million streams.
History made! On April 19, 2024, Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department was the first album in Spotify history to have over 300M streams in a single day.
But that wasn't the only record Swift's 11th studio album broke on Spotify in less than 24 hours after its release on Friday.
Her collaboration with Post Malone titled Fortnight became the service's most streamed song on a single day, topping Mariah Carey's popular Christmas hit.
The track gained more than 25 million listens.
The pop sensation also became the most streamed artist in a single day.
Apple Music also revealed TTPD broke the all-time record for biggest pop album by first-day streams.
As for other streaming platforms, TTPD became the most-streamed album in its first day ever on Amazon Music.
The Grammy winner now holds the entire top three biggest album debuts in Spotify history, with Midnights and 1989 (Taylor's Version) rounding out the list.
Midnights held the previous record with 184 million streams in one day.
Drake and Bad Bunny are the only two artists who have come close to Swift's numbers.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-21/rebel-moon-part-two-the-scargiver-review/103742306,Making a Star Wars clone was a huge risk for Zack Snyder. Does it pay off?,"Like him or not, Zack Snyder has undeniably spent his career pushing the boundaries of what a blockbuster film epic can be.
What: Seven Samurai meets Star Wars.
Starring: Sofia Boutella, Michiel Huisman, Ed Skrein, Djimon Hounsou, Anthony Hopkins.
When: Now streaming on Netflix.
Likely to make you feel: Déjà vu.
Few directors since Michael Bay have so eagerly infused hyper-modern pop filmmaking with maximalist zeal and disregard for tonal restraint. The most compelling tension in Snyder's films lies not in their intergalactic stakes, but the age-old battle between reckless visionary artists and the Hollywood executives trying to rein them in.
His trials with Warner Brothers have been extensive and well-documented – none more so than 2017's Justice League debacle, which prompted the director to chart a course for the promised land of online streaming, where filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and Noah Baumbach have enjoyed studio-sized budgets without the interference.
At least that's how the sales pitch goes.
The reality is that Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver is, by the director's own admission, a product of considerable compromise that saw a broader vision scaled down for the viewing habits of Netflix subscribers.
Director Zack Snyder made films like Justice League, Man of Steel and 300. (Supplied: Netflix)
The previous film was a never-ending title crawl of sci-fi world-building, none of which particularly mattered because the set-up is, fundamentally, Seven Samurai meets Star Wars.
There's an interstellar empire called the Motherworld run by space-Nazi unit Imperium, and a humble farming planet called Veldt on its outskirts. When an Imperium admiral, Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein; Deadpool), threatens to enslave its people for their ongoing war effort, an infamous renegade by the name of Kora (Sofia Boutella; Climax) brings together a team of warriors from across the stars to defend the villagers.
Everything you need to know about the latest Netflix blockbuster.
Scargiver (a title surely inspired by Luke Skywalker's original surname) opens with the space squad landing on Veldt, and Atticus Noble reborn from a viscous cocoon following his demise at the last film's end. With only a matter of days until Imperium arrives to collect the planet's latest harvest, Kora and company must prepare the villagers for an impending attack.
On top of aestheticising sculpted bodies, wanton destruction and phallic weaponry, Snyder spends half the film luxuriating in wheat fields amidst toiling bodies.
The languorous stretches spent with the villagers is, to some extent, a welcome respite from a director who rarely spares a thought for the non-demigods of the world. Yet, there's so little reason to care. Despite the combined 4-plus-hour run time of both Rebel Moon films, characterisations are thin on the ground, even for our main group of heroes.

Its reported $170 million budget also feels poorly utilised. For all of the director's visual excesses, his theatrical films have rarely looked cheap; meanwhile, his attempt at weaving introspective visual poetry from the pastoral setting resembles the kind of stock footage typically seen in a 4K TV demo.
After several interminable hours spent dashing across the galaxy and collecting grain, Rebel Moon finally launches into its climactic siege.
Spaceships are sabotaged, neon laser swords clash, torrents of gunfire streak across the village, and slow-mo sacrifices abound. The fireworks are passably entertaining, but none of it feels novel.
The key problem with making a Star Wars clone is that Disney has spent the last decade running Star Wars into the ground across various sequels, spin-offs and miniseries. We have never been more overrun by Star Wars content in the history of humankind, all of which is just as easily streamed.
JC-1435, known more simply as James or Jimmy, was a sentient machine designed centuries ago to defend the royals. (Supplied: Netflix)
Even the attempt at folding Star Wars back into its Akira Kurosawa influence feels more like navel-gazing than innovation. It's not difficult to imagine why this idea was initially rejected by Disney.
Snyder's take is certainly edgier and darker, sporting a visual design that suggests ""nu-metal music video"" more than ""space opera"". It's a shame that this version of the film has been stripped clean of blood and guts, which would at least add some much-needed grit and juvenile charm to this glossy, green-screen fantasy.
Yet it's hard to believe that the director's six-hour unrated cut will be worth watching when it finally arrives – at least at its extraordinary run time.
Milius (Elise Duffy, on left) is a refugee from another farming community, while Tarak (Staz Nair) is a former prince who became an indentured servant.  (Supplied: Netflix)
The potential of watching Snyder indulge in his wildest creative dreams with limited studio oversight once felt exciting, but his transition to streaming has only served to highlight his weaknesses as a director. He excels in transposing comic-book compositions and iconography to the big screen, and dramatically fails as an original storyteller.
Rebel Moon's expansion from a three-hour space opera into a 4-plus-hour, two-part event (in which crucial connective tissue is still glaringly absent) represents a failure for both the director and the streamer that enabled him.
In a final moment of irony, the whole saga ends not with a sense of finality, but with a sudden twist that sets up multiple sequels. You have to at least admire the optimism.

The Tortured Poet's Department (TTPD), Taylor Swift's 11th studio album, is out.
Swift herself dropped a poetic statement on her Instagram when the album was released on Friday 2pm AEST, written in the third person like an autopsy report.
She wrote, ""this period of the author’s life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up"".
And went on to summarise the new album in one line:
So… how are we all feeling?
This album is a melancholy emotional journey that Swift's fans are very happy to join her on… as depressing as it may be.
It's giving heartbreak, it's giving sad, it's giving… psych ward chic?

And recovery time for fans will not be quick, judging by their dramatic reactions so far.

Rumours that this would be a break-up album appear to be true, but it's not just about Joe Alwyn, her ex-boyfriend of six years.
Swift's short-term romance with Matty Healy, lead singer of the 1975, is also seemingly referenced.
The raw emotion in Swift's lyrics is one of the reasons her fans keep coming back for more… and TTPD seems to be delivering some of the deepest cuts.
What we really want to know is, who is the ""tattooed golden retriever"" she sings about in the title track?
We probably already know.
Swift's long-time collaborator, Jack Antonoff, is back on deck as a producer on TTPD and he, and the internet, are happy about it.
There's no doubt where those synth references have come from.
While we already found out in February who would be featuring on TTPD, fans are very excited after actually listening to Swift's collaborations with Post Malone on the lead single Fortnight, and Florence + the Machine on Florida!!!
Surprisingly, pop singer Charlie Puth gets a shout-out in the titular track, and so does ""Lucy"" — who the internet believes to be indie music darling (and boygenius member) Lucy Dacus.
You read that right, there's two.
Fans were wondering why a second countdown had appeared on Swift's Instagram page, and why the reference to the number two had continued to pop up via her signature Easter eggs in the lead up to the album's release.
Of course, in poetic fashion, two hours after TTPD's release Swift announced that it is, in fact, a double album, titled The Tortured Poet's Department: The Anthology.
Fans — still processing the first 16 tracks and undeniably overwhelmed — lost their minds.
The surprise announcement certainly shut down the early leak rumours, pardon the pun, quite swiftly.
If Midnights was a break-up album, the internet's reactions signal that TTPD is the post-mortem — dissecting thoroughly what went wrong and why.
What's next? Well, the Fortnight music video will drop for Australian fans Saturday 10am AEST.
And the music video's preview clip is already giving a very Poor Things/Charles Dickens vibe.

Fun fact: Swift's friend and Poor Things actor, Emma Stone, has been listed as a collaborator on the TTPD credits.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-19/taylor-swift-to-fit-tortured-poets-department-into-eras-tour/103728340,Why The Tortured Poets Department could spell trouble for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour,"Get ready for another Taylor Swift era.
The Tortured Poets Department (TTPD) is the superstar's 11th studio album and is being released around the world today.
It'll be dropping the second the clock hits midnight on the east coast of America, which will be this afternoon in Australia.
So far, we know the album is a whopping 16 songs (not including bonus vinyl tracks) and features multiple collaborations, including with Florence + The Machine.
We also know the first single will be Fortnight featuring Post Malone, with a music video dropping tomorrow morning as well.
Despite no singles being released in its lead up, clues point to TTPD seemingly being inspired by the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.
Plus, many fans have speculated that the album title is a reference to the name of a group chat Swift's ex was part of – The Tortured Man Club.
And while The Tortured Poets Department could very well set new streaming records, it also poses a logistical nightmare for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour: how do you include yet another album into a show that is over three hours long?
Below, two ABC reporters and Swifties weigh up the likelihood of how the megastar might adapt her sell-out tour when it recommences in Europe next month.
Jessica: This seems like the most likely course of action. To put things into perspective, the Eras Tour includes songs from nine albums, but their airtime varies wildly. Lover, Folklore and Midnights have at least six songs, while Speak Now gets just two. So this might be a chance to balance things out?
Georgie: It would make the most sense to me. I can't imagine a tour that doesn't spend at least some time on the freshest music. But, this is a unique scenario. You have an artist who is essentially doing a greatest hits tour at the age of 34 while she is still churning out new music.
If she does cut music to make room for Tortured Poets, it will be very divisive. Every fan has their favourite era. But, I think if she was to I would hope she cuts songs she has already toured. You have to remember she put out four (now five) albums since her last tour and I imagine it would make the most sense for her to give more air time to Lover, Folklore, Evermore, Midnights and TTPD.
Jessica: If you were in charge of Taylor Swift's setlist, which songs would you cull? I'd ditch The Archer from the Lover era so it ends with, well, Lover. I'd be ruthless and cut most of the songs from the Red era as nothing compares to All Too Well (10 Minute Version). But keep the Reputation portion as is! It's perfect.

Jessica: I love chaos so I would not bat an eye if Taylor Swift dropped the entire Speak Now era from her tour. (But Enchanted is such a core memory for a lot of fans.) I know this might be a wild concept but there's not one song from her self-titled debut album in the Eras Tour (justice for Our Song!), so make of that what you will.
Georgie: I think this will cause a major generational divide. The beautiful part about the Eras Tour is you have fans new and old coming together. Taylor has been making music since 2009 and the Eras Tour has been a chance for people in their twenties and thirties to dress up in glitter and be teenagers again while sharing the new music with teenagers today. I'm a folklore girl through and through so I am hoping if any eras get sacrificed it's the older ones. But I can't lie, it's pretty special to belt out Love Story with thousands of other people.
Georgie: Controversial opinion but I would be ok with this. Although, take this as you want because I have experienced the Eras Tour. But the section is a gamble anyway. You never know what she's going to play and someone is always disappointed or their top pick is played another night. If you cut this section, no-one gets hurt. Maybe she subs it out for three best songs from TTPD?
Jessica: I missed out on tickets for the Eras Tour altogether so I was taken aback seeing fans who did score tickets complaining about which night got ""better"" surprise songs. You can't please everyone! I agree, this would level the playing field and take the comparison factor out of the tour… but I wonder if that uniqueness is a marketing factor as some super fans attend multiple concerts in the same city.

Georgie: Don't say it or it might come true!
Jessica: I think this would be the riskiest option. Imagine the disappointment on the first night when the tour recommences in Paris on May 9. But some fans, especially in America, who witnessed the Eras Tour last year before this album was announced feel it's unfair if other countries get a different experience. But that's what happens with the passage of time!
Georgie: I see your point but you have to remember we're in an age where many people have watched the Eras Tour happen through TikTok and the cinema release. So is it really missing out when it's been inescapable for over a year? This could be a chance for the people who have waited so long for the Europe leg – who have basically watched the tour on streaming and all over TikTok – to have something unique and worth the cash.
Jessica: I think this option would please the most fans, but I genuinely don't know how she performs for hours on end each night and then travels through different time zones. Oh, to be a billionaire with a whole team taking care of everything all the time.
For some Taylor Swift fans, securing a coveted ticket to the Australia leg of the superstar's Eras Tour was just the start of their stress — it was time to start curating the perfect concert outfit.
Georgie: I don't see this happening. Costs would skyrocket and many stadiums have a noise curfew. That's new costumes, sets and dance routines.
Jessica: But I would eat up new costumes, sets and dance routines! A four-hour concert is outrageous, which makes me think she might very well pick this option. Time will tell.
Georgie: I'm obviously a Swiftie but when I found out about the new album and what that might mean for the tour I just felt… overwhelmed. I'm still processing the release of four albums and two Taylor's Versions in four years. And now she's putting out new music? It's simply too much! The concert is a marathon but if I did have to go to a four-hour show, I'd do it for Ms Swift.
Jessica: Sacrilegious.
Georgie: The people would riot. Jake Gyllenhaal would be thrilled though.
Jessica: With everything going on in the world, I think this is a fun problem to ponder, and an interesting one for Taylor to tackle. I wish her well in whatever form the Eras Tour takes, because fans are going to have strong opinions either way.
Georgie: I worry that Taylor needs a holiday but, as you said, she's a billionaire now so I think she'll be fine. I hope she tours future albums but I also support her having a rest. Go chill with the cats and Travis. You've danced in high heeled boots for two years.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-18/fallout-game-prime-video-adaptation-review/103736128,There were fears about the Prime Video adaptation of beloved game Fallout. Here's why they nailed it,"Critics and fans seem to agree that, much like a mini nuke launched with a 100 per cent VATS hit chance on a Super Mutant's big head, the television adaptation of Fallout doesn't miss.
For gamers, Fallout is a big deal. They're hugely popular role-playing games set in an alternate retro future where technology and culture locked in on the '50s aesthetic. It's a world where science focused on atoms and nuclear power rather than miniaturised computer electronics. And it's a world that blew itself up in The Great War in the year 2077.
The games are set decades, or even centuries later, in the aftermath of this worldwide nuclear war, where Earth has become an irradiated wasteland. A select ""lucky"" (read: rich) few got to ride out the disaster in highly protected Vaults, where they were promised apple pie, verandahs, and the American Dream. Think Mad-Max meets I Love Lucy and you'll kind of get an idea of the Fallout vibe.
The show now brings all that the games had onto the screen for a whole new audience, and makes for some damn fine TV that fans, and even those who can't tell a Pip-Boy from a Radroach, can enjoy.
Here's why it's S.P.E.C.I.A.L! (that's a Fallout reference in case you didn't know).
When creating characters in the Fallout games, players add in points to one of the SPECIAL categories: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, Luck. (Supplied)
There's nothing worse than an adaptation that doesn't look right (We're looking at you, Sonic design with the creepy teeth). But Fallout doesn't put a foot wrong aesthetically.
Things that could be considered Easter eggs for fans of the game don't even feel like Easter eggs, they're just how they should be. When a stimpak just more or less heals a stab wound, or when the exact hacking mini game from the games shows up while someone is trying to access a terminal, it doesn't read as fan service, it just feels right.
From the Vaults down to the stitching on the inside of the Power Armour, every prop, set, costume and location feels like it's been ripped straight from the games, and it all shines on screen to deliver that iconic retro-futuristic Fallout vibe.
The Fallout games may be set in a bleak, post-apocalyptic wasteland steeped in violence, but they're surprisingly funny.
They're camp, cheeky, and full of dark humour and satire, poking fun at the absurdities of capitalism and greed that managed to get the world blown up in the first place. The show captures this in spades.
Even the violence is funny. Bullets hit like punchlines, while the comic timing on a decapitation scene is masterful stuff.
Top tier comedians deliver some of the show's stand-out moments too: Chris Parnell's turn as a cyclops Overseer is hard to take your eye off; Matt Berry, a man who could read a microwave instruction booklet and make it hilarious, voices a friendly, organ-harvesting Mister Handy robot in a pitch-perfect bit of casting.
Fallout may be set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland but that doesn't mean it isn't funny. (Prime Video)
Credit must be given to the expert hands of all the crew involved.
That said, it feels like Westworld director Jonathan Nolan was absolutely the right person to help bring this show to life. Nolan was executive producer and directed the first three episodes, which are always crucial in setting a show's overall tone and feel. And no doubt his time with Westworld helped set him up for success here. Deserts? Check. Robots? Check. Dystopian sci-fi interpretation of classic Western themes? Check.
It's also clear that the team at Bethesda Game Studios, helmed by famed Game Director Todd Howard, has kept a gulper throat full of fingers in this pie, making sure it all remained game-accurate and fit into the existing lore. Clearly, it's been a successful creative partnership.
Of course, behind-the-scenes talent is wasted if the actors can't pull off their roles. Not a problem for the three leads of Fallout.
Walton Goggins' turn as American hero Cooper Howard-turned-bounty-hunting-Ghoul is electrifying. He fills his scenes with a Clint Eastwood-esque, ""Do you feel lucky, punk?"", energy that puts you on edge for each inevitable quick draw.
Ella Purnell nails the wide-eyed, naive, do-gooder Lucy McLean. Her main story quest to find her Dad, à la Fallout 3, confidently leads us on her descent from her American Dream life in the Vault, out to a world where drinking irradiated water from a toilet is going to be a highlight of your day.
Aaron Moten's Maximus hits all the right notes in his journey to be a hero, a shining Knight in Power Armour, a wannabe stereotypical good guy in a world where being ""good"" usually has to take a back seat to just being alive.
And, of course, there's the real star, Dogmeat. Ok, it's not THAT Dogmeat, she's CX404, but she's still a very good girl. Yes, she is.

If you read that heading and didn't hear the song starting to play in your head, then I feel bad for you, son.
The use of music in the Fallout games has been one of its most defining traits, and it's a trait the show doesn't skimp on.
The crackle of those cheery old-timey tunes as horrible acts of hyper-violence play out across the wasteland is paid due service here, with many of the most iconic songs used in the games making for perfectly timed needle drops.
Even the games' official soundtrack gets used to good effect.
Shows like this ain't cheap, and it's clear this has had the full support of that Amazon coin behind it. From the impressive sets of the Vaults and towns to the effects so good you can barely tell they're effects, it looks as good as any big budget film.
According to Variety the first season cost US$153 million (AU$238 million) to make, which puts it at almost US$20 million (AU$31 million) per episode. For reference, most Game Of Thrones episodes averaged around US$6 Million.
It's an insane amount of money, but it shows.
There's a reason everything in Fallout looks so good, from The Brotherhood of Steel (pictured) to the myriad effects — and it's $$$.  (Prime Video)
The Fallout games were always going to be perfect for adapting. They're classic, sprawling Bethesda-style role playing games which, for those who don't play games, just means they're games where you get spit out into an open world and left to do whatever you want.
This isn't like The Last of Us — where the show quite faithfully retells the story of the games for a new audience, but leaves those of us who've played it seeing every major plot coming from a mile away. (By the way, if you haven't played The Last of Us 2, you ain't ready for Season 2).
Here's what's happening with season 2 and when we can expect it.
It isn't even like Halo, where they felt the need to rewrite much of the universe and timeline to make it translate on screen, much to the chagrin of die-hard fans.
Instead, just like the sandbox the games let us play in, Fallout the series gives the creatives here that same sandbox to tell their own stories in. Sure, it has a well-established universe with timelines, lore and characters that the show faithfully adheres to, but it's not forced into retelling any specific story.
It can create new characters, show off new Vaults, and explore new areas of the Universe, all while respecting the source material and adding to it, leaving us with one of the best game adaptations we've seen to date.
It's definitely just a little bit special.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-16/what-to-watch-april-baby-reindeer-white-fever-streaming/103709108,Why everyone's talking about the new chilling Netflix show Baby Reindeer,"You can stop fretting — you will not spend tonight in a state of indecision as you frantically search for something to stream.
Because there are so many good new shows to watch right now.
Baby Reindeer trailer
This is the true story of how comedian Richard Gadd was stalked for months by a chatty, middle-aged Scottish woman named Martha (Jessica Gunning).
The limited series, based on Gadd's award-winning one-man play of the same name, introduces us to his alter-ego, the sad and lonely Donny Dunn. Donny spends his days working a dead-end hospo job, despite having moved to London to pursue a career in comedy.
One day, Martha comes into the pub where he works and he offers her a cup of tea on the house.
So begins Martha's obsession with Donny, whom she dubs her ""baby reindeer"". Martha returns the following day, and every day Donny is rostered on after that.
Jessica Gunning is faultless as the absolutely terrifying Martha.  (Supplied: Netflix)
Over the course of entire shifts, Martha regales Donny with made-up tales of her day: She insists she is a high-powered lawyer with clients that run the gamut from David Cameron to Nigel Farage. Donny knows she's lying, but the compliments Martha pays him are impossible for the failing comedian to resist.
As Martha's behaviour gets more worrying, Donny becomes determined to find out who she really is and what it is she sees in him. In the search for answers, the stalkee becomes the stalker and Donny is forced to reckon with a deeply buried trauma.
Baby Reindeer is dark, at times bleak and problematic (Donny is by no means a perfect protagonist). It's also frequently hilarious, searingly honest and gripping from beginning to end — which is to say, it's perfect for bingeing in a single sitting.

White Fever trailer
Ra Chapman left Korea at the age of four when she was adopted by an Australian couple. In White Fever, she plays an adoptee grappling with who she is and where she belongs.
Korean Australian adoptee Jane Thomas (Ra Chapman) doesn't think she has white fever.
She just happens to have gone out with a lot of white men… OK, she's only ever gone out with white men.
When her exhausting (white) best friend Edi (Katie Robertson) says she thinks of Jane as ""whiter than most white people"" and could never see her dating an Asian man, Jane tries to reprogram her whitewashed libido.
The first step? Searching ""How to date an Asian guy.""
So begins a reckoning for Jane, as she considers the impact her adoption into a white Australian family has had on her ""very meat and three veg"" sexual preferences, and on her connection to her Korean heritage.
This raunchy original comedy, based on Chapman's personal experiences, will make you laugh and think about whether sexual ""preferences"" are ever OK. And as if that wasn't enough, it also boasts a K-Pop-heavy soundtrack.

Brandy Hellville & the Cult of Fast Fashion trailer
If you've ever walked into a Brandy Melville store, you likely will have noticed that all the clothing in there is one-size-fits-all — and that size is tiny.
The brand — which explicitly markets its products to white, tall and skinny teenage girls across every possible social media platform — has developed a cult following among celebrities and their gen Z followers. The girlies love its cheap, feminine, dainty, form-fitting and often cropped styles that scream incredibly basic, but on trend — in a Taylor Swift Americana kind of way.
This new documentary sees former and current Brandy Melville executives and employees expand on Business Insider's 2021 exposé on the brand.
It's a story about exploitation from the beginning to the end of the supply chain — but it's also a story about identity, anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, predatory behaviour, shady business practices and the impact of fast fashion.
So, a lot.

Música trailer
For as long as Rudy Mancuso (the alter-ego of Rudy Mancuso, who also directed and co-wrote this film) can remember, he's turned everyday background noise into music. Some days it feels like a blessing — but a lot of the time, it's more of a curse.
Six weeks before he's due to graduate with a degree in marketing he couldn't care less about, his ""gringa"" girlfriend Haley breaks up with him because she can't stand the fact his focus is always drifting back to the sounds around them.
All she wants is for him to get serious and find a corporate job in the industry he hates so they can leave New Jersey and move to New York together. All his ""excessive and pushy"" mother/best friend wants is for him to date a Brazilian woman.
All Rudy wants is to take the musical puppet shows he puts on nightly in the depths of the Newark subway to the next level.
Música would have been cringey if it wasn't executed so well. It eschews overdone romance tropes, manages to straddle the line between rom-com and musical comedy without being exhausting, and features a delightful smattering of magical realism.
You'll find yourself enthralled by the way Rudy's experience of synesthesia is brought to life — from the moment his fellow bus passengers break out in percussion to the moment he first sees love interest Isabella (Camila Mendes) in a local Brazilian fishmonger.
This is not the Mendes you know from her roles in Riverdale and Do Revenge. In Música she delivers a laid-back performance, and her chemistry with Mancuso is tender in the best way. (Mancuso and Mendes have been dating since they met on the set of Música, so I guess they both felt it too.)
And, rest assured, Isabella's character doesn't just exist in this story as Rudy's love interest — she is absolutely her own person.
Mancuso makes for the perfect leading man. His unlikely friendship with the hilarious local food truck vendor Anwar (played by the inimitable J.B. Smoove) is the icing on top of this refreshing rom-com.

Stolen trailer
Based on the book of the same name that was itself based on real events, Stolen takes us to a Sámi village just outside of the Arctic circle in Sweden. Here, local people and their traditional way of life as reindeer herders (it's a big month for reindeer content) are under threat.
At the age of just nine, our protagonist Elsa's beloved calf Nástegallu is killed in front of her in a hate crime committed by the embittered Swede, Robert Isaksson (Martin Wallström), who terrifies her into silence.
But as Elsa (played by Elin Oskal) grows, so does her fury with Isaksson. And 10 years later, he's even more spiteful. In the absence of police intervention, he is still brutally slaying reindeer.
Told in the Northern Sámi language, with parts in Swedish, this is the story of one woman's fight to speak up against the brutal injustices levelled not just against her people, but against the animals the Sámi are sworn to protect.
That premise is but an entry point for a considered, broader depiction of the ongoing fight to preserve the Sámi culture in the face of climate change, deforestation, unemployment and systematic cultural prejudice.
Stolen is slow at times, but it's important, wrenching viewing.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-15/coachella-2024-moments-no-doubt/103708604,"'Forgive me!': Grimes apologises after disappointing Coachella set, plus the surprises and flops of weekend one","Even if you spent the weekend couch-locked, live-streaming the first weekend of Coachella on YouTube, there's no way you caught everything that went on at the 2024 edition of the world-famous music festival, headlined by Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator and Doja Cat.
We're here to point towards the funnier, weirder and ""only at Coachella"" moments. Grab your biodegradable glitter, sunglasses and bum bag: It's time to head to Indio, California — with a few bonus ICYMI entertainment stories, too.
The dust has settled on the first weekend of Coachella, the American music festival that always gets news feeds buzzing. And this year was no exception.
Here are the biggest hits and misses from the annual music pilgrimage to the Californian desert.
Grimes had a disastrous DJ set on Saturday night, with technical issues plaguing her performance to thousands of festival-goers and many, many more watching the online stream.
Evidently frustrated, shouting into the mic and attempting to explain the issues to the crowd, Grimes later issued an apology on X (the platform run by the father of her three children, Elon Musk).
Big-name reunions and surprise guests are both Coachella traditions, and No Doubt's highly anticipated comeback set on Saturday night combined both.
Performing together for the first time since 2015, the ska-pop band were joined by 21-year-old hit-maker Olivia Rodrigo, who leapt about on stage with frontwoman Gwen Stefani for a rendition of 2000 single Bathwater.
The rest of No Doubt's career-spanning set list contained all the hits — including Don't Speak, Just a Girl and Hey Baby. Here's hoping their reunion trail makes its way Down Under in future.
Not to be outdone in the special guest department, Tyler, the Creator's headlining set contained several surprises.
The hip hop visionary was joined by A$AP Rocky, American-Colombian sensation Kali Uchis, The Gap Band vocalist Charlie Wilson, and Childish Gambino (aka multi-award-winning multi-hyphenate Donald Glover).

On Friday night, Billie Eilish showed up during Lana Del Rey's headlining set — a meeting of alt-pop minds, with the former often citing the latter as a core influence. They finished by duetting on each other's breakthrough singles: Eilish's Ocean Eyes, then Del Rey's glamorous 2012 viral hit Video Games.
The collaboration was praised as a highlight of Del Rey's divisive set, with her sound issues, focus on syrupy ballads and laconic energy receiving mixed reviews.

Poor old Damon Albarn. The singer is no stranger to Coachella, but returning to the main stage fronting Britpop icons Blur, he struggled with a lack of crowd enthusiasm.
""You're never seeing us again, so you might as well f--king sing this,"" the increasingly irritated Albarn instructed during Blur's 1994 hit Boys & Girls.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
The moment was described as ""embarrassing"" and ""painful"" on social media, but others questioned the booking decision, noting how Blur are less familiar to US audiences and younger festival-goers.
A late addition to Coachella that aligned with the release of their new album Only God Was Above Us, indie-rock mainstays Vampire Weekend had the weekend's most unlikely guest: Paris Hilton.
Sporting a black cowgirl fit, the hotel heiress didn't sing, but instead appeared during an extended band-jam to play cornhole (what Americans call the lawn game where you throw bean bags through a hole in an angled wooden board).
""I haven't played this game since The Simple Life,"" Hilton told the crowd.

Speaking of things nobody had on their Coachella 2024 bingo card: Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce, were spotted with rapper Ice Spice enjoying a set from Australian DJ-producer Dom Dolla.
Closing the Sahara stage on Saturday, Dolla brought out Nelly Furtado to perform their 2023 single Eat Your Man, only for the pop star to take a tumble mid-song.

Saturday Night Live's 49th season has been a rollercoaster so far. For every Timothée Chalamet as Troye Sivan, we've also had Sydney Sweeney trying to make it with a dog.
But Ryan Gosling's return to studio 8H over the weekend delivered something SNL fans haven't witnessed in a very long time: a consistently funny episode.
Gosling, who was there to promote his new film The Fall Guy, devolved back into his Ken schtick to perform a cover of Taylor Swift's All Too Well. His Fall Guy co-star Emily Blunt tried to reign him in with some chair-breaking stunts, but eventually fell under Gosling's spell — resulting in the Barbenheimer reunion we didn't know we needed.
With three hosting spots under his belt, Gosling had a fat stack of beloved sketches to waltz out with during the night, and waltz they did.
First, it was Kate McKinnon returning as a deranged alien abductee that always gets the short end of the stick during the UFO ride. If you've ever wanted to watch a lesbian bat at Ryan Gosling's genitals with her nose like a dog in heat then you are in for a treat.
Then there was the return of Steven, who is tortured by the fact that, despite the Avatar films costing half-a-billion dollars to make, director James Cameron decided to go with bold Papyrus as the title font.
As much of a star as Gosling was on the night, the real highlight was the host and cast corpsing it up with the best of them, we can only assume much to the chagrin of Lorne Michaels. Gosling broke into barely concealed giggles during Alien Abduction, again peeling into panicked guffaws when his walrus moustache detached in another sketch.
Break of the night goes to Heidi Gardner, who didn't even try to hide her joyous laughter after getting a first glimpse of Mikey Day done up like Butt-Head (honourable mention to Gosling as Beavis).

Famed Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama will mount a major retrospective at Melbourne's NGV International in December.
The exhibition — the largest exhibition of her work ever staged in Australia — will feature more than 180 of Kusama's works.
The 95-year-old artist is best known for her dynamic polka dot designs and trippy, immersive artworks. Her work plays with opposing notions of eternity and obliteration and this upcoming retrospective will showcase several of her hallucination-inspired immersive art rooms, designed to invite existential reflection.
""There are few artists working today with the global presence of Yayoi Kusama,"" director of the NGV Tony Ellwood said. ""This world premiere NGV exclusive exhibition allows local audiences and visitors alike the chance to experience Kusama's practice in deeper and more profound ways than ever before.""
Kusama has collaborated with the NGV to curate the retrospective, which will take over the entire ground floor, including the NGV's entrance water wall. It will feature several works that have never been exhibited in Australia, as well as the world premiere of Kusama's latest immersive work: an infinity mirror room.
It will run at NGV International from December 15 to April 21 2025.

Please check in with the big country music fans in your life today.
Tickets for superstar Chris Stapleton's first-ever Australian tour went on sale late last week and — much like we saw for other stars like Taylor Swift, Fred again.. and Luke Combs — they proved difficult to get.
Stapleton was originally scheduled to play three shows along the east coast, and ended up doubling that number before tickets went on sale to the general public on Friday. This wasn't enough to satisfy demand, however.
Stapleton was the musical guest on this past weekend's SNL, hosted by Ryan Gosling.  (Supplied)
When those tickets went on sale, country fans experienced the familiar indignity of sitting in an online queue for hours, with some lucky folk scoring tickets to one of the six shows, and others wondering what they need to do to see the 10-time Grammy winner.
In news that will surprise no one, scalpers have already listed tickets on resale sites, some going for over $1,500 a pop. Here's hoping Stapleton can stick around and add a few more shows.

Hallelujah! Everybody's favourite murder-witness-turned-singing-nun is coming to Australia, with the stage show of Sister Act premiering in Sydney this August.
Made famous by the inimitable Whoopi Goldberg in the 1992 film, the iconic role of Deloris Van Cartier seems to be in good hands, with the announcement of Casey Donovan as lead.
""Growing up, Sister Act was one of the movies that I watched on repeat,"" says the singer and actor.
""I love the film and am truly honoured to be part of such an uplifting, joyful, fun and feel-good production featuring the brilliant original music by multiple Tony Award-winning composer Alan Menken.""
Donovan was not only the youngest winner of Australian Idol at age 16, she has been a star of the ABC's New Year's Eve concerts, won ARIA and Deadly Awards, and starred in numerous musicals, from The Sapphires to &Juliet.
Filling the wimple of Mother Superior (played sternly but with a twinkle in her eye by Maggie Smith in the film) will be the beloved Genevieve Lemon, who has had a 40-plus-year career in Australian theatre, including Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Billy Elliot.
After its Sydney run, the show will travel to Melbourne in November. In the meantime, here are some nuns absolutely rocking out in the film, as a little treat:

It seems like any celebrities too old for Coachella were at the tribute to the late great singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett at the Hollywood Bowl over the weekend.
The line-up for the tribute was immense — Paul McCartney, Eagles, Zac Brown and more were on the bill — but this video of an all-in singalong of Buffett's 1977 smash Margaritaville really illustrates the star power in the house on the night.
As well as legendary musicians like Sheryl Crow, Angelique Kidjo and Jon Bon Jovi, we see film icons Harrison Ford, Judd Apatow, Steven Spielberg and Woody Harrelson paying tribute to the singer, who died last year of cancer, aged 76.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-13/heartbreak-high-season-two-interview/103701004,Heartbreak High takes on our 'crisis of masculinity' — but with 'plenty of piss-takes' in season two,"The culture wars have hit Hartley High.
If the first season of Netflix's Heartbreak High championed sexual, gender, racial and neurodiversity, the newly released second season of the reboot skewers wider pushback to this progress.
The election for school captain becomes a battleground between the so-called 'woke' and the 'cancelled'. And, as lead actor Ayesha Madon says, it's like season one, ""but on crack"".
The new Heartbreak High is quickly amassing a cult following. It’s also highlighting just how many other reboots are struggling to give audiences meaningful representation.
""This season is a lot more heightened — and a lot sillier,"" adds actor Thomas Weatherall, who plays Bundjalung basketballer Malakai. ""But at the same time, it's much darker and intense.""
With most of his classmates exploring their sexuality last season, Spider (Bryn Chapman-Parish) was left the sole straight white male teen in the show's cast. In season two, he's stepping up as a voice for his perceived voiceless, against blue-haired social justice advocate Sasha (Gemma Chua-Tran).
""Do you feel forgotten? Unseen? Left behind?,"" he says in his first campaign speech. ""Or worse, do you feel like you can't even breathe for fear of getting cancelled? People like Sasha So have made me feel like I'm responsible for all the world's problems for far too long now. And I'm sick of it!""
In an attempt to redeem her credibility after leaking the school's hook-ups in season one, Amerie (right) runs for school captain against Gemma and Spider. (Supplied: Netflix)
Spider and his groupies are encouraged to see themselves as the downtrodden by new PE teacher Voss (Angus Sampson, Bump) who calls the school a ""woke snowflake nightmare"".
Hartley High, a progressive institution, is on-board, agreeing there's a ""crisis of masculinity"" leading to disproportionate dropouts of boys from high school. But Voss is more focused on manly activities like spit-roasting pigs, playing football and pushing giant tyres than working through feelings, suggesting he has no real plan beyond a stereotypical ideal of what men once were.
Voss' actions escalate throughout the season, egging on the Cumlords to take back the school. (Supplied: Netflix)
Evoking talking points of Jordan Peterson, Andrew Tate and other proponents of the need to return to a more traditional or hyper masculinity, Spider says he's tired of it: ""All we get taught is that everything that's wrong with the world is caused by our dicks!""
Sexual Literacy teacher JoJo (Chika Ikogwe) is disappointed that students are taking that message from her classes, but can't seem to break beyond the ""all men are trash"" simplification students of all genders seem to be adopting. Hartley High is more divided than ever.
If you're exhausted by the discourse already, don't be.
For an indication on the tone, the school's group of junior men's rights activists are called Cumlords. Show creator Hannah Carol Chapman has said she wanted season two to ""dive headfirst into the murky depths of masculinity"", while still celebrating the ""humour, batshittery, heart and currency"" of the show.
Chapman-Parish says Chapman (no relation) encouraged him to read Clementine Ford's Boys will be Boys to better understand the ""rabbit hole"" Spider goes down.
""It gave context on patriarchy and masculinity, and how those structures are so prevalent in our society and can affect young men,"" he says.
""Honestly, it's a massive privilege to be able to work on something that hopefully has a really positive impact on young men, who can very easily be led astray into very divisive ways of thinking.""
There are moments where Spider is pulled back from antagonism, as a relationship blooms with a classmate.
""It was exciting to have a few more scenes [beyond] just yelling out something obnoxious in a classroom setting,"" he jokes.
""Not that I didn't love it! I loved it very much. But to be able to be a bit more vulnerable and have some nice, intimate scenes with other characters was nice.""
In contrast to his gripes, in reality, the Spiders of the world remain very much seen in film and television.
While Barbie may have dominated last year's box office, men remained the protagonists of 70 per cent of Hollywood's biggest films. And while Australian television is increasingly diverse, it still lags behind population numbers when it comes to representation of non-European, disabled and LGBTIQ+ people, according to Screen Australia.
Heartbreak High is a great example of that shift. Not only are more than half the core roles people of colour, including several First Nations characters, but the series features many queer characters of various identities, echoing how more Gen Z'ers identify as queer than any other generation.
Heartbreak High is filmed on-location in Sydney, where it's set.  (Supplied: Netflix)
And characters like asexual Ca$H (Will McDonald) and autistic teen Quinni, created in collaboration with actor Chloé Hayden, who is autistic, were celebrated by audiences and critics as nuanced depictions of often misunderstood people. It's part of the reason the reboot's first season, released in 2022, connected, spending three weeks in Netflix's global top 10 charts and hitting the national top 10 charts in more than 43 countries.
So, while we may see more of Spider than we did in season one, Heartbreak High keeps things centred on their diverse cast — Amerie and her besties Darren (James Majoos), Quinni (Hayden) and Harper (Asher Yasbincek), now their feud is squashed.
Throughout the season, Amerie is tormented by an anonymous figure she and her friends call ""bird psycho"".  (Supplied: Netflix)
Madon is particularly excited audiences can see the two on better terms, with both Harper and Yasbincek receiving hate from viewers.
""Harper's character was perceived in a way that I didn't expect and probably misunderstood,"" she says.
We also meet two new teens, Dubbo import Rowan (Sam Rechner, The Fablemans), who both Malakai and Amerie have eyes on, plus Zoe (Kartanya Maynard, Deadloch), Missy's (Sherry-Lee Watson) cousin and the leader of the Puriteens, a celibacy group disgusted by their classmates' loose belts.
After his threesome with Dusty, Malakai (Thomas Weatherall) is keen to explore his sexuality, and sparks fly with Rowan (Sam Rechner).  (Supplied: Netflix)
With all these elements, what can you expect? Well, season two starts with Hartley High on fire mid-formal, before flashing back to weeks before. There are mushroom trips, bisexual love triangles, teen pregnancy, erectile disfunction, bricks through windows and plenty of designer clothing.
Things stay distinctly Australian too, from the soundtrack (including Tkay Maidza, Miss Kaninna, 1300, Vv Pete, DJ Plead) to parodies of Rage, dance scenes set to the Nutbush and a dead Ibis subbing in as a Godfather-style horse head.
While much of the season focuses on the Cumlords, Weatherall says the show balances things by depicting teenage boys who are much more sensitive and comfortable with their masculinity, like Ca$H, Malakai and Rowan.
""There's a whole other side of masculinity, of being a lot more in touch with yourself. There's the two extremes displayed,"" he says.
""You don't want to prescribe anything or kind of hope that the audience gets one thing or another from it, but I think that it provides the opportunity to start really, I think, necessary and important discourse.
""And they've figured out how to do it in a fun way that we can still take the piss.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-12/jojo-siwa-admits-she-didnt-invent-gay-pop/103700632,JoJo Siwa admits she isn't the inventor of gay pop as she attempts to rebrand herself,"Children's entertainer JoJo Siwa is rebranding herself and it's not going well.
In recent years, the former child star has grown up, come out and is now attempting to swap her squeaky clean image for something more mature.
The rebranding has become one of the internet's biggest talking points, but it's her recent comments about ""inventing gay pop"" that's caused the biggest stir.
If you're wondering who the heck JoJo Siwa is and why she is all over the internet, sit back and let us explain what is going on.
Siwa has been in the entertainment game for 10 years.
She rose to fame on the hit TV show Dance Moms in 2014 and was known for being extremely extroverted on the show.

After Dance Moms, she went on to make music, with her debut single Boomerang in 2016.
For years, Siwa was known as the girl with the bow in her hair, who made music for young children to sing and dance to.
She was every parent's nightmare as her music was repetitive and catchy, so it was always stuck in your head.
Siwa has been trending online since she released her song Karma, trying to break away from the narrative that she only makes music for children.
In an interview with US entertainment site Billboard earlier this month, the now-20-year-old claimed she invented gay pop.
On Thursday (local time), Siwa clarified her comments and said she didn't invent gay pop and many musicians have made music in that particular genre before her.
""Madonna, Lady Gaga, f***ing Michael Jackson. There's so many people who have made gay pop,"" Siwa said in a TikTok posted by TMZ.
Although the 20-year-old has taken back her comments saying she invented the genre, it wasn't before she was met with a lot of backlash by other queer artists.
They included Tegan and Sara, who stitched the interview clip of Siwa claiming she invented it.
Despite not saying anything in the video, people could pick up what the musicians were putting down, considering they have been making gay pop music for over 20 years.
Many people on X, formerly known as Twitter, were quick to catch Siwa out on her comments by adding images of popular queer musicians.
Someone on X was also quick to point out that Siwa wasn't the only child star to rebrand herself and come out, referencing former Disney Channel star Dove Cameron.
Gay pop is a genre of music made by queer artists, for queer artists.
It is for people who are a part of the LGBTQIA+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex and Asexual/Aromantic) community.
There are many queer artists who have been making music for decades, including Chappell Roan, Hayley Kiyoko, Kehlani, Fletcher and G Flip.
Between '7 Days' at #80, and 'The Worst Person Alive' at #2, the Melbourne multi-instrumentalist clocked in a whopping seven appearances from their 2023 award-winning album, DRUMMER.
As Siwa is trying to move away from her child-friendly image, she is saying some outlandish things, including saying she has invented gay pop.
In her interview with TMZ, Siwa clarified she didn't invent gay pop and would like to be the CEO or the CMO of the music genre.
The internet sensation is attempting to do what singer Miley Cyrus did when she performed at the 2013 Video Music Awards (VMAS).
In 2013, Cyrus came out on stage twerking and sticking her tongue out at the VMAs and had almost everyone wanting to have their say on the child star's remake of her image.
In her interview with Alex Cooper, who hosts the podcast Call Her Daddy, Siwa said: ""When I was eight [years old], Miley had her Bangerz moment and I was like, 'All I want is to have that one day.' I want that'.""
Bangerz was Cyrus's fourth album and featured her famous hit Wrecking Ball.
Unfortunately for Siwa, her latest music video, for her song Karma, went viral for all the wrong reasons.
Jojo Siwa's Karma music video.
Despite it having over 18 million views on YouTube, people on the internet judged her for attempting to make something that was edgy, when it came across as if a child had discovered swear words for the first time.
As almost no stone gets left unturned when something is released on the internet, people also discovered Siwa's latest song was recorded in 2012 and was set to be released by musicians Brit Smith and Timbaland, under the title Karma's a b****.
Siwa has kept tight-lipped about what is next for her music career but she has said she is ready to start a family soon.
In the same interview with Cooper, Siwa says she wants three kids called Freddy, Eddie and Teddy and already has a sperm donor picked out.
She hasn't talked about what her next song will be but if it is similar to Karma, it will have everyone singing along, whether we like it or not.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-12/how-the-oj-simpson-trial-shaped-the-kardashians-/103699960,OJ Simpson was known as 'Uncle OJ' to the Kardashians. But his murder trial would divide the now-famous reality TV family,"OJ Simpson's 1995 trial for the murders of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman would become ""the trial of the century"".
It would also, inadvertently, launch one of the most recognisable names of modern celebrity.
Reality TV family patriarch, Robert Kardashian Sr, played a key role in Simpson's defence team.
Simpson was acquitted in the criminal case but found responsible for the deaths in a civil lawsuit and later imprisoned for armed robbery and kidnapping in a separate matter.
But more than a note in Kardashian's legal career, the trial wound up dividing the now-infamous reality TV family and it continues to haunt them.
Before Kim, there was Robert.
The Kardashian father was well-acquainted with Simpson prior to his legal role in the 1995 trial.
The pair first met more than 25 years earlier, on a tennis court in 1969.
Simpson was then introduced to Brown during Robert's wedding to Kris Houghton (now Jenner), according to the LA Times.
Throughout the media frenzy surrounding Simpson, Kardashian remained steadfast in his support and Simpson even spent the night at Kardashian's house before his infamous white Ford Bronco car chase.

But it was arguably his reading of Simpson's goodbye letter to reporters that first launched the Kardashian name into the Zeitgeist.
Kardashian would go on to play a key role in Simpson's defence team, and took young daughters Kim and Kourtney to witness the trial.
""My dad pulled Kourtney and me out of school,"" Kim told GQ in 2023.

But his legal success didn't come without a personal battle.
His now ex-wife Kris Jenner had become best friends with Brown, and was frustrated by Kardashian's role in Simpson's acquittal.
Khloé Kardashian, who was 10 at the time, expressed how personal the trial became when talking to E! True Hollywood Story in 2009.
""OJ was always our 'Uncle OJ', Nicole was my 'Auntie Nicole',"" she said.
""It's sad to see your parents go through so much pain for trying to be true friends.""

Kim has been candid in how her father's defence of Simpson lay in direct opposition to her mother's support of the Brown family.
""My mum was extremely vocal in her feelings — she believed that her friend was murdered by (Simpson) and that was really traumatising for her,"" she told David Letterman in 2020.
""And then we'd go to my dad's house and it was a whole other situation there.
""We didn't really know what to believe or whose side to take as kids, because we didn't want to hurt one of our parents' feelings.""
David Letterman quizzed Kardashian on her personal recollection of the infamous trial.
Jenner has said her ""entire universe"" changed when she found out about Brown's death.
Her subsequent condemnation of Simpson even led him to call her after the trial's verdict to explain.
""It was very difficult because my ex-husband was on one side, you know, I was kind of on the other, the kids were in the middle and it was trying to explain this to children and then OJ had called,"" she told Ellen DeGeneres in 2016.
""I lost, everybody lost, so much that night.
""You lost everything you knew – I can't even imagine being her family, her parents, her sister.""
Kris Jenner appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres show in 2016, talking about the trial.
Culture analysts posit the televised Simpson trial ""whetted"" society's appetite for reality TV. And almost 30 years on, the Kardashian name still remains at its centre.
But the trial would also go on to shape the future advocacy of the family.
Over the past few years, Kim Kardashian has posed herself as a criminal justice reform advocate.
She successfully lobbied former president Donald Trump, wrote letters in support of clemency petitions and paid legal bills for people trying to get out of prison.

In late 2018, she also made the choice to start studying law.
She says the career shift is, in part, due to her father's ties to the Simpson case.
""I think that by the time I was a teenager and he was working on the OJ case, I was sneaking in his office, looking at all of the evidence and things I shouldn't have been looking at,"" she told journalists in 2020.
While she and her siblings are yet to comment on Simpson's death, their former step-parent Caitlyn Jenner has taken to social media platform X.
The former Olympian was already married to Kris by the time the trial brought further chaos to the family.
Jenner's post was a pithy two-word ""Good Riddance"".
But in doing so, it also capped the long and messy history between the disgraced NFL star and the world's best-known reality stars.",Unknown,Fri 12 Apr 2024,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-12/oj-simpson-popular-culture-made-in-america-american-crime-story/103427584,"Understanding OJ Simpson: The best shows, films and podcasts on the man and his crimes","OJ Simpson has loomed large in modern pop culture ever since the 1994 stabbing death of his wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman.
Whether it's a South Park reference, a car commercial, or online conspiracy theories about the paternity of Khloé Kardashian, his name and the crimes he was accused of are known around the world.
In fact, Simpson's connection with the Kardashians is perhaps the reason Gen Zers know his name. For those who aren't Keeping Up, Robert Kardashian Sr (father of Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Rob Jnr) was an old friend of Simpson's and a member of his legal team during the murder trial. The family was apparently divided over whether they believed his innocence. Kim has even detailed how she looked inside the infamous bag.
But, obviously, the story of OJ, the murders, the car chase, the subsequent trial, the continuing questions of guilt versus innocence, and how the whole case was indelibly caught up in the miasma of race politics that was gripping Los Angeles at the time are much more complex than these fleeting pop culture references would have you believe.
Luckily, there is a swathe of content that dives deep into the trial, the murder, the politics and the man himself. Here is a selection.
""I'm not black. I'm OJ."" It's snappy, but Simpson's infamous quote gestures to so much more about America's celebrity culture and racial divides. And this Academy Award-winning documentary dives deep into unpacking those darker, deeper truths.
Starting with chronicling his rise as national football superstar ""The Juice"", the five-part series does an expert job examining how the cult of Simpson's celebrity and deep divisions between Black and White America played a crucial role in his double murder trial and subsequent acquittal.
The highway chase. The gloves. The media frenzy and legal twists. It's all here, thoroughly explained and given compelling context alongside fresh evidence and interviews.

Emmy-winning director Ezra Edelman even goes into Simpson's post-trial exploits, including an embarrassing hidden-camera TV prank show, a (not quite) confessional book, plus doing jail time for a 2007 armed robbery.
By the conclusion of an enthralling seven-and-a-half hours, OJ: Made In America doesn't just offer an exhaustive look at a defining historic moment but exposes uncomfortable cultural insights.

This episode of podcast Code Switch — the show run by journalists of colour that has ""the fearless conversations about race that you've been waiting for"" — is actually an offshoot of the ESPN documentary.
After seeing the film, Code Switch co-host Gene Demby wanted to dive deeper into the ""strange, fascinating, disturbing story of OJ's relationship to his blackness"".
Code Switch began in 2013 as a blog, and a series of stories contributed to NPR radio programs. It became a standalone podcast in 2016. (NPR)
Through interviews with Ezra Edelman and extensive research, Demby travels back to before the murder that gave Simpson his eternal notoriety, examining why OJ ""didn't want the public to see him as black"", and how he achieved that (kind of).
As chronicled here, OJ grew up in a very poor part of San Francisco – somewhere he was very keen to leave behind when his sporting prowess moved him up in the world.
By the time he was at his most famous, his life was almost entirely white – from his gorgeous blonde second wife Nicole Brown, to country clubs and Hollywood appearances.
""OJ didn't just leave his poverty behind, he seemed to leave his blackness behind, too,"" says Demby.
This episode is a thoughtful deep dive that really explains how this journey started, and how it made the trial and its inevitable impacts on race relations in the US even more stark.
This episode of Code Switch is available now on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.
It's unfathomable now, but OJ Simpson's interview with Ross Becker was so in demand that people paid $US29.95 to buy it from the local video store or by calling 1-800-OJ-TELLS.
Released in January 1996, after he was acquitted in the criminal trial for the murder of Nicole Brown, this interview was a huge moment for OJ.
The HORROR QUARTERS Podcast youtube: O.J. SIMPSON THE INTERVIEW PART ONE
A white-sweatered Simpson submits to Becker's questions for more than two hours (he admits he is doing the interview for the money) and, at every opportunity, he stands by his twisted story, as he did so many times before and after.
As Entertainment Weekly put it at the time, this interview with Becker is all about OJ portraying the ""aggrieved, victimized truculence of a classic abuser"". He minimises the blood at the scene and the witness testimonies – it's a total blow-by-blow by the world's most famous defendant at the time.
Despite all this, it's a compelling watch. OJ's braggadocio, his confidence and his skill for myth-making is on full, raw display here.
OK, we admit this isn't much of a deep-dive so much as a series of off-colour jokes that resurface every time Simpson is in the news.
Throughout much of the 90s, the late Norm Macdonald was the host of Weekend Update on Saturday Night Live. And he used his position to make gag after gag after gag about Simpson being a murderer, both during and after the trial. And by gag we mean that he explicitly and repeatedly said that Simpson killed Nicole Brown Simpson.
Here's one example: ""In his book, OJ Simpson says that he would've taken a bullet or stood in front of a train for Nicole … That is some bad luck when the one guy who would've died for you kills you.""
NBC management apparently weren't happy with Macdonald: In 1998, he was fired from Weekend Update, and Macdonald initially believed he was fired because of his Simpson jokes. NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer, who said the decision was due to declining ratings, was a friend of Simpson. (In fact he was such a good friend that he allegedly threw a party for the jurors who acquitted the disgraced sports star.)
Macdonald later decided he wasn't fired for his Simpson jokes after all — but rather because he didn't ""tak[e] marching orders"".
American Crime Story creator Ryan Murphy might have an iffy track record, but the anthology series' first season is arguably the finest work of his three-decade-long TV career (The key? He produced and directed but didn't write the show).
While Cuba Gooding Jr does a fine job as Simpson, the series is much more focused on ""The People"", following prosecutors Marcia Clark (Sarah Paulson) and Christopher Darden (Sterling K. Brown) who struggle with how the case throws them into the public eye. Clark is ridiculed by the media for her looks; Darden is isolated as a Black man who takes on a community hero like Simpson.
You'll see all the most famous moments re-created (the glove, the freeway chase), but American Crime Story shines where it takes liberties to imagine the private worlds of the people around Simpson.
This ranges from the toll it takes on prosecutors, to the shadowy ways Simpson's lawyers (David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian, joined by Nathan Lane, John Travolta and more) stoked the justified distrust African Americans have for the police, in order to turn their client into a figure of justice.
It examines the complex, sticky histories behind how the trial of the century ended with Simpson's acquittal, against all odds.

The 28-minute episode — The Sign — will be the studio's longest-running Bluey episode to date.
In an ABC Radio Brisbane interview, Bluey executive producer Daley Pearson said the success of the episode would help to decide the future of the franchise.
""We would love to do a Bluey movie,"" he said.
Interview: Will Bluey receive a movie? And will Bluey ever move interstate? (Loretta Ryan & Joel Spreadborough)
Mr Pearson said the trick was keeping kids entertained for half an hour, which is four times the length of a typical Bluey episode.
He said there was ""no guarantee"" of success.
""There was an element of, 'Can an audience watch Bluey for longer?'"" Mr Pearson said.
""I think we'll wait until Sunday to find out and that'll help us figure out our own future.""
Bluey went viral again this week after an episode revealed the Heeler family's classic Queenslander house was for sale on the in-universe market.
""It's a huge thing,"" Mr Pearson said.
Bluey and her family are back and are facing a potentially big life change. This is how you can help prepare little ones in your life when their world shifts.
He said he hoped children would resonate with the ""truthful"" experience of growing up in a time of change.
""The best of Bluey is about those big changes, or those big events, or those huge emotional moments in a family's life,"" Mr Pearson said.
""When your parents are deciding things that you're just not quite in control [of] and you have to go along with, and your world's changing whether you have an agreement in it or not.
""I think kids will definitely, hopefully, get that in this episode.""
He did not confirm whether the house would be sold in the upcoming episode, but did say Bluey was the kind of show that was willing to take ""big risks"".
""I think that's why people aren't quite sure,"" Mr Pearson said.
""In any other show, I think they'd be expected to go, 'Well, they're not really selling' — but maybe so.""
Mr Pearson also revealed Australian actor Joel Edgerton has been cast as a police officer.
A 10-second teaser trailer depicts Bluey's family being followed by a police car with sirens on, which inspired ""true crime"" theories and ""wild"" speculation on TikTok as fans attempted to make sense of the scenario.
""Maybe, maybe,"" Mr Pearson said when asked about the theory.
""It'd be a brave new world for family shows, to have the family arrested and put away,"" he said with a laugh.
Two characters will ""absolutely"" be getting married in the extended episode, and their identities will be revealed when it airs on Sunday.
""For the audience listening who like it, thank you so much for watching it,"" Mr Pearson said.
""It's just a privilege to be let into the homes of your family and your kids, and we hope you like this one as much as we do.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-09/taylor-swift-love-story-proposal-jules-and-kesh-melbourne/103663918,"Marry me, Jules: The Taylor Swift-inspired love story","Countless couples across the globe have gotten engaged during Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, with many choosing her 2007 hit Love Story to pop the big question.
Swift's Love Story is a loose retelling of Romeo and Juliet, about two lovers who must hide their relationship but end up together anyway.
One young couple who got engaged on the first night of Swift's Australian concerts in Naarm/Melbourne have a love story that echoes Shakespeare's most famous romance.
In this love story, Romeo is Kesh and Juliet is, aptly, Jules: Two 18-year-old Filipina Australian women from Garramilla/Darwin.
We're using their first names only for privacy. Here's the story of their engagement.
Jules already had one ticket to the concert and I wanted to get a ticket on the same night because I was going to show up and propose.
Kesh says she thought: ""'If someone like Jules is able to stay with me when I literally have nothing to give her but my love, what am I waiting for?'""  (Supplied: Jules and Kesh)
We'd gone through so much together: my parents' homophobia, running away before finishing high school, so I'd been thinking to myself, 'If someone like Jules is able to stay with me when I literally have nothing to give her but my love, what am I waiting for?'
I decided, 'I'm going to get two jobs and work every day to get these tickets'.
A few weeks out from the concert, I found tickets but … I got scammed.
But on Valentine's Day, we managed to get two obstructed view tickets for $550 to the first night of the Melbourne shows. I knew we definitely got scalped, but I was so happy because I knew my plan was finally in action.
I had memorised Taylor's setlist, so I knew when Love Story was going to come on. I knew that it had to be that song.
When the song came on, I was so nervous, I was shaking, because I only got one shot at this.
Everything that came beforehand rested on getting the timing right: having the box in the right hand, getting on the right knee, saying the right lyrics.
And then I got on my knee and then Jules's face just lit up. She forgot to say yes, but it's OK because it was clear.
Everyone around us was hyping us up and it was a crazy, surreal feeling. A lot of the Taylor Swift proposals that we'd seen were straight couples, but it felt like everyone at the stadium had our backs.
It just felt like I didn't have to ask for anyone else's approval anymore.
I couldn't put my finger on why this concert would have been so important for Kesh because she's not a Swiftie. Kesh was really, really upset when we got scammed out of those first tickets.
""When Love Story started, I was just in my own world, singing, and then I looked to my left and I saw Kesh on her knee and I'm like, 'what is going on?'"" (Supplied: Jules and Kesh)
I had a solo ticket but I was feeling a bit unwell. And although I was upset about the idea of missing my favourite artist, I decided to sell it because I really needed to put my whole faith into Kesh [and getting tickets with her].
When we got the tickets, we didn't celebrate until we saw them actually pop up in our Ticketek account and we were like, 'oh my gosh, we're going to Taylor Swift'.
We'd heard of people getting scammed at the last minute so we were just holding our breath until the actual concert day and until we walked through those gates. We held our breath for so long, and it felt like we could finally breathe when we got into the MCG.
Days Like These is about the days that go spectacularly wrong or go brilliantly right… It's about the risks we take, the decisions we make.
When Taylor took to the stage, I was so excited, jumping up and down, singing all the songs.
When Love Story started, I was just in my own world, singing, and then I looked to my left and I saw Kesh on her knee and I'm like, 'what is going on?'
And then she pulls this ring out from behind her and she says 'marry me, Jules' — because the lyrics are Juliet, but she changed them to Jules — and then she sings the entire lyrics word for word.
I fall over and I just look at her and I hear screaming from around me, and of course I say 'yes'.
She put the ring on my finger and that was just so monumental because Taylor's music took care of me when I didn't have a lot of people around me and then here's Kesh, who's been with me through the high times and the low times and is asking me to marry her.
That moment for us, being a queer couple at a Taylor Swift concert, able to just hold hands and sing cute lyrics at each other and be able to do a public proposal, that was so special for us
I never really saw queer, multicultural people like myself in my community, so I know that there's probably a queer Swiftie looking at our video going that could be me one day.
The little Jules, who's closeted, I think about her sometimes and I'm like: 'You don't need to be scared anymore because you're out, you're proud and you have people who love and support you. And it was all worth it.'

Kristen Wiig is already among the most famous of recent Saturday Night Live cast alumni, but this weekend she joined the coveted five-timers club too, returning as host while on the publicity trail for Apple TV+ series Palm Royale.
In her opening monologue Wiig talked about her excitement to get her ceremonial five-timer jacket, before being interrupted by a string of cameos. First came fellow five-timer Paul Rudd — and then, a fair few people wearing the ceremonial jackets despite not reaching the milestone, including Fred Armisen, John Hamm, Will Forte, Martin Short, Matt Damon and Ryan Gosling (who is hosting next week).
""Lorne said the first time I hosted was so good it counted for three,"" said Damon, ""And the second time, not quite as good, that only counted for two. But by my maths, that's five, baby!""
Other highlights? A game night where Wiig's character is terrified of being Jumanji'd (i.e. being sucked into a board game), plus a scene where Wiig and cast member Heidi Gardner play wacky secretaries, with Hamm sticking around to add a dash of Don Draper to the scene.
Unlike many returning cast members, Wiig didn't rely on old characters or fan favourites — but if you're desperate to revisit Target Lady, she recently graduated to featuring in actual Target ads.

We're in a new era of country music (just ask any member of the Beyhive), but over the weekend we got a reminder that country has always been a bit gay, thanks to Orville Peck, Willie Nelson and their cover of Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other.
Orville Peck & Willie Nelson — Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly Fond of Each Other
Nelson first covered Ned Sublette's queer country anthem all the way back in 2006, spurred on by the release of Ang Lee's gay cowboy masterpiece Brokeback Mountain.
Speaking to Rolling Stone, Peck, who is openly gay but performs under mask and pseudonym, said that Nelson felt the time was right to revive the tongue-in-cheek tune.
""Willie kept talking about how the subject matter in this song was more important than ever,"" Peck said.
""With all the rhetoric surrounding the LGBTQIA+ community these days, it is so encouraging to have real allies like Willie that aren't afraid to stand proudly next to us.""
Nelson, 90 (!!!), also appears alongside Peck in the romantic music video where they appear to be having a competition for who has the sickest suit embroidery.
The single is the first taste of Peck's forthcoming duets album Stampede, the cover art of which feels like a magic eye that gets gayer the more you look at it.
Enjoy!

After diving into the nostalgia mines for 2019's photo-realistic remake of The Lion King, Disney is now producing a prequel. Mufasa: The Lion King winds back to focus on the young cub adventures of Simba's James Earl Jones-voiced daddy.
The news came as a surprise to film buffs, especially since Mufasa will be directed by Barry Jenkins, the Oscar-winning writer-filmmaker behind complex dramas Moonlight and If Beale Street Could Talk.
The bigger surprise? Fans of a certain speedy blue hedgehog are ready for a Barbenheimer face-off with the House of Mouse.
Sonic the Hedgehog 3, the latest entry in the successful adaptations of the Sega video game series, is hitting screens on December 20, 2024 — the same day as Mufasa: The Lion King.
The dual box office premiere is already stoking online chatter about which CGI animal will outperform the other, including some spicy memes and fighting words from Team Sonic.
It might seem foolish to take Disney head-on. But, remember, this is the same fanbase that successfully campaigned for a drastic re-design of the video game mascot's silver-screen portrayal for the first Sonic movie. And the 2022 follow-up performed even better critically and commercially, raking in more than $608 million ($US400 million) and becoming the ninth highest-grossing film of the year. Anything could happen…

Irish actress Nicola Coughlan — who plays Penelope Featherington in the steamy Netflix period hit Bridgerton — has revealed the impressive lengths she went to to ensure her parents don't see any of her sexy scenes.
In an interview with SiriusXM Hits 1, Coughlan said the streamer is contractually obliged to provide her parents with a PG version of the show's upcoming third season, which will focus on Penelope and her love story with Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton).
""It's literally written into my contract. People think I'm saying it as a joke,"" the Derry Girls star said.
""I just don't want to. We grew up Irish Catholic. That's just not how we vibe.""
Coughlan added that when her mother first saw Bridgerton, ""she didn't know it was going to be saucy"".
""And then you get a bottom, Jonathan Bailey's lovely bottom, about two minutes into the first episode ever.
""And she was like, 'What is this?' But then, now she thinks it's fantastic and really funny, and she keeps talking about bottoms.""
Part one of Bridgerton season three will drop on Netflix on May 16, with part two arriving a month later (sigh) on June 13.

Y'all knew this was coming right?
After breaking worldwide streaming records (and the internet), Cowboy Carter has now yee-hawed Beyoncé to the top of the Billboard Country Albums chart, where she makes history as the first Black female artist to be the #1 queen of the rodeo.
The guest list for Beyoncé's new album is a mixture of country heroes, emerging hip hop stars, and some of her closest and most famous regular collaborators.
It comes after lead single Texas Hold 'Em made her the first Black woman to top Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, despite some backlash from country radio programmers and genre purists.
If that wasn't enough, Cowboy Carter is Beyoncé's eighth consecutive number-one solo album debut on the US charts. She's now surpassed Janet Jackson with the fourth-most #1 albums among women, catching up to Madonna (nine), Barbra Streisand (11) and, at the top, Taylor Swift (13).
Oh, and you bet there's going to be more history made come awards season, too…

It's hard to fathom how one singer-songwriter and his little rock band could have such a profound impact on music, but perhaps the best way to explain it can be found by examining the musical landscape from the year he died.
April 5 marked the 30th anniversary of Kurt Cobain's death and, while the wider music world offered reflections on the influential Nirvana frontman's cultural impact, the most touching honour of them all came from his daughter.
Frances Bean Cobain, the child of Cobain and Courtney Love, was just 18 months old when her 27-year-old father died by suicide. ""I wish I could've known my Dad,"" wrote the now-31-year-old in a heartfelt Instagram post accompanied by a carousel of family photos.
""In the last 30 years my ideas around loss have been in a continuous state of metamorphosing,"" she wrote.
""The biggest lesson learned through grieving for almost as long as I've been conscious, is that it serves a purpose. The duality of life & death, pain & joy, yin & yang, need to exist along side [sic] each other or none of this would have any meaning. It is the impermanent nature of human existence which throws us into the depths of our most authentic lives. As it turns out, there is no greater motivation for leaning into loving awareness than knowing everything ends.""
The full post, which quotes a letter Cobain wrote for his daughter before she was born in August 1992, is well worth your time. Just be sure to have some tissues nearby.
Several pop culture figures have commented on the post, including the daughters of Nirvana drummer/Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, Violet and Harper, as well as pro skater Tony Hawk and his son, Riley Hawk, who recently married Frances in a ceremony officiated by her godfather, R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe.
""Oh Frances, you possess a grace and glorious wisdom that stops me in my tracks from time to time, and today is most certainly one of those times,"" Stipe wrote.

The central Queensland pop culture store owner says there has been a resurgence in demand for the cards after rapper and singer Post Malone bought a Magic: The Gathering card for a whopping $US2.3 million ($3.5 million) last year.
""There's a lot of value in cards.""

Mr Williams owns Queensland's largest pop culture store, Millennium Comics in Rockhampton.
He said up to 30 per cent of his business was in trading cards, equating to up to $15,000 in sales on any given week.
Competitors play these card games by strategically building their decks, with specific cards allowing players to make moves.
They can be based around genres like fantasy, science fiction and sports.
Mr Williams said while the most popular trading cards, like Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh! and Magic: The Gathering, became popular in the 1990s, there were a host of other cards now coveted by collectors.
He said there had also been rising interest since Disney released its Lorcana series in August last year.

He started playing about a decade ago and his most valuable card is worth about $15,000 — its original price tag was $120.
""I own a time twister; it's an old power nine card in Magic: The Gathering, so it's in nine of the most powerful cards,"" Mr Lodder said.
Christopher Lodder says cards can also be sentimental. (ABC Capricornia: Jeremy Jones)
Mr Williams said anyone reminiscing with their old collection and wondering if they had valuable cards should check the condition first.
""It's never going to be worth the same amount as something that's been taken out and put immediately in a sleeve,"" he said.
Mr Williams's journey of pop culture mania began at age 16 with a love of comic books.
Mr Williams says comic books are graded on their quality. (ABC News: Jasmine Hines)
His collection became so huge that he started trading them.
Later, he opened the store adding board games, figurines and trading cards.
""If they play a card game with somebody else, it doesn't matter what colour hair you've got, what your physique is ... it's not about sporting prowess.
""It's about, 'Hey what cards have you got in your deck?'
""It's a very different type of muscle flex ... because people will spend hours upon hours developing their decks, characters and strategy.""
Condition of the cards is key to their value. (ABC News: Jasmine Hines)
Mr Lodder said the games brought the community together.
""Some people playing cards are lawyers, some people work for government, some are tradies ... everybody's different.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-06/kung-fu-panda-4-jack-black-awkwafina/103614902,'We're the odd couple of the kung fu world': Jack Black and Awkwafina on the joy of teaming up in Kung Fu Panda 4,"What is it about an often-hungry and kind of lazy panda who is obsessed with kung fu that has resonated with audiences worldwide?
The Kung Fu Panda franchise — now 16 years old and four films in — centers on Po (Jack Black) who, along with his friends (voiced by a star-studded cast including Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogan and Jackie Chan), goes on adventures spanning the mystical and spiritual.
""I think people love pandas and people love kung fu, and we've got a combination,"" Black tells ABC News.
For those who haven't seen the films, Po is the designated ""Dragon Warrior"", a kind of legendary Chosen One who can wield limitless power.
The first film focused on him figuring out who he wanted to be; he discovered more about his parents in the sequel, Kung Fu Panda 2; while Kung Fu Panda 3 saw him begin to pass on his skills to a new generation of panda cubs.
In the latest film, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) wants Po to become the new Spiritual Leader of the Valley of the Peace, so Po must choose and anoint someone else as the new Dragon Warrior.

While Jolie, Chan and Liu don't return for this film, Bryan Cranston and James Hong reprise their roles as Po's dads. And rapper and actor Awkwafina joins the cast as Zhen, a fox burglar who crosses paths with Po during one of her thieving sprees.
When a shape-shifting sorcerer known as the Chameleon (Viola Davis) and her criminal network make themselves known, Po and Zhen team up to prevent her from getting her hands on the panda's staff of wisdom (which the Chameleon plans to use to summon Po's enemies back from the spirit realm).
""Zhen and Po are like the odd couple of the kung fu world, and it was exciting to explore their differences and watch them grow together,"" says Awkwafina.
""Zhen brings this scrappy, streetwise energy to the story, challenging Po in unexpected ways.""
The first three films of the Kung Fu Panda franchise, which started in 2008, have made over US$1.8billion collectively at the box office. (Supplied: Universal Pictures)
The humour and story of Kung Fu Panda is a part of why the films have charmed audiences globally.
The film series has also proven to be a massive hit in China, a highly lucrative but notoriously difficult market for Hollywood films to succeed in, because of limits the country places on foreign and Western films.
Plot threads often blend aspects of South-East Asian culture, like filial piety and duty to family, with more universal themes of working with others and having the confidence to forge your own path.
Awkwafina says it has meant a lot to her to see the franchise pay homage to Chinese culture.
""I think when [Kung Fu Panda] first came out, there wasn't a lot of movies that really took place [there], exemplifying those cultural traditions in that world,"" she says.
""So I'm really proud that it existed and to be a part of it now.""
Black adds: ""You know, any community that feels under-represented, one of the greatest ways to open up the stories to the world is to get creative.
""The ones that you've never heard before are often the most amazing ones.""

The latest Kung Fu Panda also comes off the back of other successful animated films like Turning Red and Elemental, which explored similar themes of responsibility and loyalty, and growing up as part of an immigrant family.
""Those I really enjoyed, and I love Kung Fu Panda because they explore what it means to be a kid, have anxiety and what it means to be human I think in a way that's really unique,"" says Awkwafina.
""And I [want to] just continue watching stories that do that.""
Both actors say they related to the simple central message — to believe in yourself — that plays out across all the films.
""I definitely can think about certain times in my life, in my career, where I didn't believe in myself,"" Black says.
""Someone else gave me confidence and believed in me, and then I was able to push through my insecurities, and those moments and those people who gave me that strength mean so much to me, so I relate to it in that way.""
Awkwafina says she's proud to be part of Kung Fu Panda, which pays homage to Chinese culture. (Supplied: Universal Pictures)
Awkwafina adds, ""I think it's hard to know when you're doing something right. It's hard to believe in yourself and Jack is right. It does take people to have to help you sometimes.""
In terms of their characters' futures, Awkwafina says she wants Po and Zhen to ""live, laugh, love"".
""I'd like to see Po get even more spiritual,"" says Black.
""To somehow master the art of meditation and be able to create some inner peace.""
Awkwafina jokingly adds: ""I want to stop stealing, and we enter a program.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-05/kiss-catalogue-acquired-sweden-pophouse/103673070,Swedish entertainment firm acquires KISS music catalogue for an estimated $456 million,"Swedish entertainment and music investment company Pophouse says it has acquired the music catalogue, brand name and likeness of US rock band KISS.
Financial terms of the transaction are not being disclosed but the Associated Press estimated the deal is worth more than $US300 million ($456 million).
Pophouse Entertainment Group, established by ABBA's Bjorn Ulvaeus, is also the founding investor in the ABBA Voyage show in London.
Pophouse previously partnered with KISS during the final night of their farewell tour in New York in December 2023, when the band unveiled digital avatars of themselves.
ABBA has been creating the holographic live show using motion capture. (Twitter: @ABBAVoyage)
""Our mission is to fulfil the band's vision to become immortal, and to let new generations discover and be part of the KISS journey and carry it forward,"" Pophouse head of investment Johan Lagerlof said in a statement on the company's website.
""With the help of the fans' energy, the band, our expertise, and creativity – we will make that vision happen.""
Bassist and lead singer Gene Simmons said the band had ""always been breaking new ground in popular culture"".
""This partnership will ensure that we continue to do so for years to come,"" he said.
Pophouse said it would create digital versions of KISS, with an Avatar show planned to launch in 2027.
KISS are Pophouse's second investment outside of Sweden, following the acquisition of Cyndi Lauper's music catalogue in February 2023.
They're the latest to participate in an ongoing trend of blockbuster acts and their rights holders inking deals to sell their back catalogues, often for impressive sums.
It's big business — especially considering two-thirds of all music streamed is made up of catalogue music, and streaming accounts for 84 per cent of all music industry revenue.
Not every artist disclosed the amounts involved but some deals have been estimated at as much as half a billion dollars.

Artists such as Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Justin Bieber, Stevie Nicks and Shakira have all sold or had their catalogues sold.
In 2020 Bob Dylan sold publishing rights to his catalogue of more than 600 songs to the Universal Music Publishing Group.
The singer's collection includes modern standards like Blowin' in the Wind and Like a Rolling Stone. Industry experts estimated the deal was in the range of $US300 million to $US500 million.
In 2021, Warner Music Group reached a deal with David Bowie's estate for worldwide rights to the prolific singer's recorded music catalogue from 1968, including Space Oddity and Let's Dance.
Terms were not disclosed.
Not all artists consent to or have had control over the sale of their catalogues.
In June 2019, music manager Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings announced that it had acquired Big Machine Label Group, which was led by Scott Borchetta and home to Taylor Swift's first six albums, for an estimated $US300 million to $US350 million, the New York Times reported.
In response, Swift started to re-record and release new versions of those albums, labelled Taylor's Version, in an attempt to reclaim her masters.

Variations of this question about the Nirvana frontman/grunge icon pop up regularly on the popular social forum Reddit.
Why did Kurt have such a cult following? What made Kurt Cobain stand out? Explain to me like I'm five the cultural significance of Kurt Cobain. What made Nirvana so special? Can someone explain Nirvana's influence and importance?
Typically the questions are asked by people who weren't alive when Cobain, who was 27 and at the height of his fame, died by suicide 30 years ago this week.
Nirvana — (from left) Krist Novaselic, Kurt Cobain, Dave Grohl — helped up-end the music industry. (Supplied)
The questions are worthwhile — in the time of Spotify, TikTok and Taylor Swift, it's hard to fathom how one singer-songwriter and his little rock band could have such a profound impact on music.
There are many ways to answer this question, but perhaps the best one can be found by examining the musical landscape from 1994, the year Cobain died.
But first, let's rewind back to the '80s.
Back then the American music world was divided.
On the shiny, glittery surface, MTV-approved pop stars and poodle-haired rockers dominated the Billboard charts and radio playlists.
Beneath that, in the so-called underground of sweaty clubs and college radio, bands toiled away under the loose umbrella of ""alternative music"" — punk, metal, grunge, indie rock, shoegaze — rarely worrying the charts or appealing to the tastemakers at record labels and the mainstream music media.
The wall between the two worlds was rarely breached, but as the '80s went on, a handful of bands began to scale that wall.

Alt-rock band REM reached the Billboard top 10 in 1987 with their album Document, thrash metallers Metallica did the same the following year with …And Justice For All, underground acts such as Jane's Addiction and Soundgarden signed with major labels, and a previously unknown band named Faith No More combined rap, funk and metal to score an unlikely top 10 hit with the track Epic in 1990.
MTV began to pay attention, more so-called alternative bands caught the ears of the major labels, and suddenly the underground was creeping into the sunlight.
In 1991, the paradigm shifted even further.
REM, now signed to major label Warner Bros, went to #1 with their album Out Of Time, and in the months that followed gangsta rappers NWA and Metallica also topped the US album charts.
Then, on January 11, 1992, a scruffy Seattle trio named Nirvana scored a symbolic win for the burgeoning grunge movement when its album Nevermind deposed the King of Pop himself, Michael Jackson, from the top of the Billboard album charts.
Nirvana — Smells Like Teen Spirit.
""A record by a band no-one had ever heard of, which had hardly been promoted at all, had knocked Michael Jackson off the top of the chart,"" Craig Schuftan summarised in his book Entertain Us!: The Rise and Fall of Alternative Rock in the Nineties.
What followed was indeed a musical revolution — the alternative music scene that had been bubbling away beneath the mainstream suddenly came to a boil, sweeping like a tsunami across the US and the world, up-ending decades of traditional music industry thinking.
Bands that had previously only dreamed of getting their music on MTV or pay-to-play radio playlists or in prime positions in record stores were suddenly doing all that and more, finding new legions of fans and selling millions of records in the process.
Over the two years that followed Nirvana's symbolic regicide, major labels scrambled and ambitious indies rose, all searching for ""the new Nirvana"", the next unexpected success.
By 1994, these searches had made the music scene unrecognisable compared to a decade earlier.
The Seattle grunge scene had spurred the diversification and growing democratisation of the music industry, but Cobain's death in April 1994 was a sad signpost that the end of a short-lived grunge era was nigh.

Despite this, 1994 was still technically a banner year for the rock sub-genre.
Of the so-called big four of grunge — Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains and Soundgarden — the latter was the first to sign to a major label but the last to score a blockbuster record.
Success finally arrived for Soundgarden in '94 with Superunknown, which sold nine million copies worldwide thanks to its rampaging riffs (Spoonman), brooding grooves (Fell On Black Days), haunting epics (Black Hole Sun), and Chris Cornell's incredible vocal range which seemingly spanned from heaven to hell.
Soundgarden — Black Hole Sun.
Not to be outdone, Pearl Jam's third album Vitalogy became the second-fastest-selling album in US history (behind only Pearl Jam's previous record Vs), and pushed the band forward sonically — it's a punkier, less grungy, more diverse album that also features Better Man, one of the band's biggest singles.
Meanwhile Alice In Chains followed up their massive 1992 record Dirt With Jar Of Flies, a largely acoustic mini-album that became the first EP to top the Billboard album charts.
For Nirvana, their Icarus-like career was over following Cobain's death, meaning the release in November 1994 of their MTV Unplugged concert recorded 12 months earlier served as a quiet epitaph for the band that had instigated a musical revolution.
Nirvana's 1993 MTV Unplugged performance.
The acoustic live album went #1 globally, has sold more than 12 million copies, and in Australia was among the top 50 best-selling albums for three years running.
Beyond the big four, enthusiasm for grunge continued — L7's Hungry For Stink, 7 Year Bitch's Viva Zapata, and Melvins' Stoner Witch all sold well, while Stone Temple Pilots' Purple is another highlight of the genre from 1994.
But one of the best grunge albums of all time landed just days after Cobain's death, and it came from Hole — the band starring Cobain's wife Courtney Love.
Live Through This is part ferocious feminist roar, part fragile confession, set to a barrage of barnstorming riffs and burning melodies that was long overshadowed by the widowing of Love, but has come to be re-appraised as one of the great rock records of the '90s.
Hole's lead vocalist Courtney Love performs Violet.
The term ""post-grunge"" began as a put-down — a sneering label hinting at a perceived lack of authenticity in the sound and attitude of the bands who rose in grunge's wake.
But for every terrible band that was tarred with the post-grunge brush, there were some great ones, and in 1994 they released some great albums.
Some, like Veruca Salt's American Thighs and Weezer's debut self-titled record (AKA The Blue Album) were rightly revered upon release, melding the abrasive edges of grunge with the sweetness of power-pop.
Weezer — Buddy Holly.
Meanwhile albums such as Live's Throwing Copper and Bush's Sixteen Stone won devotees and detractors in equal measure.
The haters dissed both bands as corporate cynical cash-ins riding the coat-tails of Nirvana and co, but the fans couldn't get enough.
Live's big break scored three songs in the 1995 triple j Hottest 100 (I Alone amazingly appeared in both the 1994 and 1995 countdown) and Throwing Copper stayed at the pointy end of the ARIA album charts for four years.
Bush's Sixteen Stone had four songs in the Hottest 100 across the '95 and '96 countdowns, and slowly won over a huge following — released in December 1994, it took 16 months to crack the ARIA top 50, where it stayed for almost a year.
Bush — Comedown.
Punk rock's influence on grunge was evident, but as a standalone genre it had been languishing in the underground since its late '70s heyday, much of its potency as a movement seemingly long forgotten.
But two albums from the Californian punk scene brought spiky-haired power chords and snotty attitude back to the fore, selling about 30 million copies in the process — The Offspring's Smash and Green Day's Dookie.
Both records are fast, sweary, fun, honest and as catchy as a cold.
Green Day — Basket Case.
They also helped open the door for older punks such as Bad Religion and NOFX to enjoy more success and are two of the biggest albums of 1994.
The Offspring's Smash remains the best-selling indie album of all time — its big singles Self Esteem and Come Out And Play spent six months each on the Billboard charts and were voted in at #3 and #4 respectively in the triple j Hottest 100.
Meanwhile Dookie, the bigger of the two albums, tapped into the angst and anxieties of teenagers the world over, and its popularity lingers — singles Basket Case and When I Come Around have just passed one billion and half a billion plays respectively on Spotify.
Few albums exemplify how far Nirvana had pushed the boundaries in 1994 than Nine Inch Nails' second record The Downward Spiral — a noisy, violent slice of industrial rock that peaked at #2 in the US and #12 in Australia, and sold about 4.5 million copies worldwide.
Recorded in the Los Angeles home where members of the Manson family murdered Sharon Tate, the concept album follows a man on his path to suicide, and tackles themes such as religion, addiction, violence, depression, nihilism and more.
Nine Inch Nails — Closer.
A grim yet immaculately produced record, The Downward Spiral spawned the songs Hurt, later a surprise hit for Johnny Cash, and depraved funk banger Closer, which incredibly reached #3 on the ARIA charts and #2 in triple j's Hottest 100.
This mainstream acceptance of the heavier and darker undersides of the alternative scene proved highly influential for generations of metal musos who followed.
Mind you, 1994 also spawned the first album of Marilyn Manson, so it wasn't without its downsides.
The broad scope of what ""alternative rock"" was meant that you could walk into a record store in 1994 and find some pretty disparate albums sitting in the same section.
For example, you couldn't get musically further from Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral than Jeff Buckley's Grace, both of which are considered alt-rock masterpieces.
The only studio album released by Buckley during his lifetime, Grace is a spellbinding showcase for his remarkable voice, versatile guitar work, passionate songwriting and talent as an interpreter of other people's songs — while his originals Last Goodbye and Grace were the songs that made it into the '95 Hottest 100, it's Buckley's version of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah that has become his legacy.
Jeff Buckley — Grace.
Grace's esteem has grown over the past 30 years, but the album was largely ignored upon release except in Australia, where the album climbed into the top 10 in September 1995 and has sold more than half a million copies.
Alternative music wasn't just about guitars — Tori Amos took her heart-on-her-sleeve piano-driven rock songs to new heights on her second record, which remains her most successful.
Driven by the wonderfully cryptic lead single Cornflake Girl (#35 in the Hottest 100, #19 on the ARIA charts) and debuting at the top of the UK charts, the album sold about 2.5 million copies worldwide and cemented the American singer-songwriter as one of the most vital voices of the '90s.
Tori Amos — Cornflake Girl.
The opening of the alt-rock floodgates meant that albums that sounded unlike anything that had come before suddenly had the potential to sell millions.
In 1994, Ween dropped Chocolate & Cheese, a cherished collection of genre-hopping absurdity that includes the singles Freedom Of '76 and Voodoo Lady and made it to #80 on the ARIA album charts.
Ween — Voodoo Lady.
So broad was the term alternative rock that it also included Hootie & The Blowfish, who were passed over by most major labels because they weren't grunge enough but who were lumped under the alt umbrella as a marketing ploy by their eventual signers Atlantic Records.
Their debut album Cracked Rear View, released July 1994, was the biggest-selling album in the US in 1995 and is estimated to have sold 21 million copies in the US alone.
Nirvana's success dramatically changed the American music industry, as well as Australia's, which was structured with a similar divide between the mainstream and the underground.
The first ripples of the alt-rock uprising reached Down Under in 1991 and bands such as Ratcat, The Clouds, You Am I and Cosmic Psychos began to make waves.
But as former triple j presenter Richard Kingsmill put it, Australia needed its own Smells Like Teen Spirit moment to ""really stamp how great all this Aussie music really was"".
Cheekily dubbed ""Nirvana In Pyjamas"" by some, the Newcastle teens' debut single, released in September 1994, was a rare worldwide hit for an Australian band and helped drag our own alt-rock movement out of the shadows.
Silverchair — Tomorrow.
The grunge band's influence on the UK was less profound — the British music scene was already open to harder-edged sounds.
For example, American alt-rockers Pixies, who had a profound influence on Nirvana, had three top-10 albums in the UK before they even cracked the Billboard top 60.
But the rise of Nirvana and grunge ended up having an oddly inverse effect in England by 1994.
While American guitar music was embracing its abrasiveness, the British equivalent leaned into its Englishness almost as a direct response to the grimness of grunge.

As Blur frontman Damon Albarn told Melody Maker in 1993 upon the release of their album Modern Life Is Rubbish: ""Our last album killed baggy — this one will kill grunge.""
And so rose Britpop, a burgeoning alt-rock sub-genre that would go on to dominate the mid-'90s much like grunge had dominated the first part of the decade.
The Seattle sound was out and Cool Britannia — led by Blur, Oasis, Pulp, Suede, Elastica, Manic Street Preachers and Radiohead — was in.
Nirvana's legacy extends beyond 1994, of course.
The number of kids who picked up a guitar because of Cobain, or drumsticks to emulate Dave Grohl, or a bass to play the loping lines of Krist Novoselic is innumerable, and continues to this day.
You could argue that if it hadn't been Nirvana, it would have been another band that stood on the shoulders of giants such as REM and Pixies and The Replacements and Sonic Youth, and dived over the wall that kept the underground away from the mainstream.
But in the end, it was Nirvana.
Their influence wasn't just created by their sound or their industry impact though.
The underdog status of Nirvana — the band no-one had heard of who dethroned the King of Pop — made them the band that other up-and-coming bands looked at and went ""maybe we could do that"".
But 30 years on from Cobain's passing, the music industry is such a different place that it's hard to understand how profound an impact he and his band had.
But listening to the music from the year he died isn't a bad place to start.",MBy Matt Neal,Fri 5 Apr 2024,0

Here's how to watch,"In the docuseries, Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV, audiences get a behind-the-scenes look into the unsavoury and sometimes illegal practices of Nickelodeon.
And from today, the tell-all documentary will be available to stream in Australia.
Here's what we know about the series and where you can watch it.
Because it shows the dark reality behind some of the most iconic Nickelodeon children's programs of the late 1990s and early 2000s.
""There's a dark underbelly to child stardom,"" said Bryan Hearne, an All That alum, in the documentary.
The blockbuster series has also sparked a movement among former child actors to bring change to the industry.
Investigation Discovery (who put the project together) reported that the first four episodes were watched by more than 16 million viewers.
The child stars from Nickelodeon's heyday have grown up, and now they're speaking out against the machine and long-time producer Dan Schneider.
Quiet on Set is a docuseries featuring Nickelodeon cast and crew who share their personal stories about on-set experiences working alongside Dan Schneider.
Schneider was the creator behind beloved series like the Amanda Show, Zoey 101, Drake & Josh, iCarly and Victorious.
It explores allegations of abuse, sexism, racism, and inappropriate behaviour involving underage stars and crew members on Nickelodeon TV show sets — with Schneider at the helm.
The series features several people who worked alongside Schneider across the Nickelodeon network, including Drake & Josh's Drake Bell.
In the documentary, Bell reveals for the first time to be the John Doe victim in Brian Peck's child abuse case.
Peck worked with Schneider as an acting and dialogue coach on All That and The Amanda Show.
In 2004, Peck pled no contest to two charges of child sexual abuse. He received a sentence of 16 months in jail and had to register as a sex offender.
Two days after the series premiered, Schneider broke his silence by posting a 19-minute video to YouTube.
Schneider, who has kept a low profile since going on ""hiatus"" in 2021, apologised for the behaviours exposed in the documentary.
Multiple former Nickelodeon child stars have responded to former kids TV mogul Dan Schneider's apology for the allegations levelled against him in Quiet on Set.
""Watching over the past few nights was very difficult,"" he said.
""It was wrong I ever put anyone in that position.""
In response to allegations of creating a hostile work environment, Schneider said he made ""practical jokes that went too far"".
""No writer should ever feel uncomfortable in any writers' room ever, period, the end, no excuses.""
The Nickelodeon Network also released a statement after the documentary was released.
The network said it would ""investigate all formal complaints"" and had ""adopted numerous safeguards over the years"", but added that it ""cannot corroborate or negate allegations of behaviours from productions decades ago.""
Drake Bell's co-star Josh Peck (no relation to Brian Peck), released a statement via Instagram saying he had reached out to Bell privately. He also commended others in the documentary for speaking out.
Other former cast members who've spoken out include Alexa Nikolas and Jack Salvatore Jr (both from Zoey 101).

""I've always been interested in the idea of different versions of your life that you might have ended up living if you'd done something just a little bit differently,"" Gramazio told ABC News.
""A lot of my work in games as a game designer traces back to a book that I found in a second-hand bookshop in Adelaide in around the year 2000, looking for a poetry book, but this book on games had been put in the wrong section.
""And I thought, 'oh, that sounds interesting'. And then I bought it.""
Gramazio then discovered online communities and mailing lists of people playing games, before ending up working in games herself.
The Husbands started off as a concept she came up with for a video game, before she pivoted into writing a novel years later.
It was Gramazio's interest in games that led to her meeting her husband – at a games conference.
""So, it all goes back to this one book that was put on the wrong shelf.""
When Gramazio moved to London from Adelaide in South Australia where she grew up, the idea of an attic crystallised for her.
""People have these attics [in London] and say things like 'I'm not really sure what's up there. I've not looked up there in a year,'"" she said.
Gramazio dedicates the book to her ""favourite"" husband Terry Cavanagh, also a games developer, who she says really likes her book.
""We don't have an attic, so he's not too worried,"" she joked.

""When I was pulling it together, there were a couple of months where every night or almost every night, I would read him a chapter.
""And he's really bad at hiding his feelings. Every thought he has just passes across his face, almost like the scrolling text that you get at a train station or something.
""So, when something was a bit boring or not working, or a joke didn't quite function, or when he got to the end of a chapter and it was clear that he was glad to be at the end rather than wanting to know what happened next, he could not conceal that at all.
""So, he's an absolute ideal first listener.""
While none of the husbands in the novel are based on him, we meet a ""chill, cheerful"" husband in the book who he resembles, Gramazio says.
Lauren changes with each new husband and Gramazio too says she's adapted to a better version of herself with Cavanagh on board.
""I'm a little bit more easygoing than I used to be.
""I sleep in a bit later, because he's a late riser.
""I have cats, because he loves cats,"" she said pointing to her cat, Gelato.
""He's often up for just trying a thing … 'shall we go to the bakery around the corner, or shall we paint this wall a really bright orange that might turn out to be a bad idea. But also, if it's not, it would be a real delight'.
""And he doesn't get too caught up in optimising and making spreadsheets and that kind of thing.
""And because I am myself, quite bad at making decisions, sometimes having someone who is quite up for things and for doing things that might not work out, but if they do, then great is, I think, a very good match for me.""
Gramzio's novel explores the illusion of choice. (Supplied: Penguin Random House Australia)
But had Gramazio seen his online dating profile – she would never have spoken to him.
""After we'd been dating for a month or six weeks, one evening he sat up and was like, 'Oh, I forgot to delete my dating profile!' And I said 'Oh, well you've got to show me'.
""And he showed me and I read through it. And it was fine. There was nothing wrong with it. But I would definitely not have messaged him.
""It was very cheery … almost every sentence had an exclamation mark, and half of it was about a video game that he was working on at the time.""
Gramazio says she was drawn to men who had ""slightly clever jokes"" on their profiles or possessed a ""slight cynicism"".
""And he's great. I like him so much. And it was really fascinating to see that if I had come across him in the apps in an online dating context, then I would never have got in touch with him.
It's the message she hopes people take away from The Husbands – that in an online dating world of apparent choice, people are often in the type of mood where they try to find something wrong with someone, whereas if they met them in real life, it might have worked.
""People get stuck in the sort of online dating well of 'oh, here's a spelling mistake, couldn't possibly date someone who would make a spelling mistake in their online profile' or 'I don't like that T-shirt, couldn't possibly do that,' like finding things to be deal breakers or red flags in a way that I think we mostly wouldn't if you met the people in a less weird and intensive next, next, next, next next-focused context.""

How Taylor Swift's financial status collides with fans,"For Swifties, it was never a matter of if Taylor Swift would become a billionaire, but when.
In its latest rich list, Forbes estimates Swift has a $1.1 billion fortune and says the megastar is the first artist to achieve billionaire status solely from songwriting and performing.
Other artists who have hit the milestone – including Rihanna and Jay-Z – earned their massive wealth in part thanks to fashion and cosmetics brands, alcohol companies or entertainment holdings.
In mere weeks Swift will treat her fans to yet another album – The Tortured Poets Department – which will fuel another merchandising spectacle.
But by building an empire on her vulnerable lyrics and ""big sister"" persona, will Swift's new billionaire status impact how Swifties relate to their idol?
Georgia Carroll says Taylor Swift has always presented herself as ""an aspirational big sister or cool friend"". (Ashok Kumar/TAS24/Getty Images)
""Taylor has an amazing relationship with her fans, or at least an amazing illusion of a relationship with her fans,"" says Georgia Carroll, who holds a PhD in Sociology from the University of Sydney where she specialised in fandom.
""It's something she's cultivated since the earliest days of her career, where she's really presented herself as not quite a girl next door, but kind of as the aspirational big sister or cool friend who is going through the same things as you are.""
What are parasocial relationships and why is Taylor Swift the best at them?
Swift's sprawling discography captures the plethora of emotions and experiences, from the giddiness of first love (Fearless, Speak Now) to the rollercoaster that is your 20s (Red, 1989) to darker, more adult themes (Reputation, Midnights).
""She's taken her fans on this lifelong journey where it does feel as though you're kind of getting this peek into her life and her diary, which really builds a connection with her fans,"" Dr Carroll says.
This all feeds back into the concept of parasocial relationships, which is, as Dr Carroll explains, ""anytime a fan feels as though they know a celebrity because of messages through the media, from social media and, in Taylor's instance, through her music.""
Since 2019, Swift has released eight albums – four being re-releases – and her next album is due out this month.
In 2023 her Eras Tour hit the $1 billion mark after selling a staggering 4.35 million tickets across 60 tour dates, according to the Associated Press.

To add to its success, the concert film grossed a further $261 million worldwide and secured the highest opening weekend for a concert film.
For Dr Carroll, ""nobody is surprised"" about Swift's new billionaire status.
1989 (Taylor's Version) is here, revisiting Taylor Swift's incredibly successful turn at pop music.
""It's been something that has been on the cards for quite a while especially with the Eras Tour and the Eras Tour film making her so much money and all of the stories around the records that they've broken and her economic impact,"" she says.
""In the last five years she's released this crazy amount of content which obviously has multiple album versions, multiple vinyl versions, merchandise alongside it.
Swift's strategy of releasing limited edition versions of vinyl albums – each with a different cover, colour or bonus track – has drawn criticism over the years.
The debate fired up again this week when Billie Eilish expressed her frustration at overconsumption in the music industry.
""It's some of the biggest artists in the world making f**king 40 different vinyl packages that have a different unique thing just to get you to keep buying more. It's so wasteful,"" she told Billboard.
Eilish later clarified her comments and said she wasn't singling anyone out.
Dr Carroll says while Swifties have a strong connection to their idol, it's the current economic environment that may have them pausing for thought rather than Swift's billionaire status.

""We have The Tortured Poets Department coming out in three weeks so that's going to come with a new wave of merchandise and then the Eras Tour is starting up again in Europe,"" she said.
""I think we are reaching the point where fans are kind of like, 'The cost of living is going up, my rent is increasing, my mortgage is increasing, do I need to give a billionaire more of my money?'""
""The argument I make is that the way her marketing is structured, they are in a way manipulating the fans, but it is the fans' choice at the end of the day and the fans can say, 'You know what, I can't afford this.'
""The argument the fans make is that it makes them happy and they like supporting her.""
While Taylor Swift's fans pride themselves on keeping up with her clues, even they were caught off guard by her Grammys announcement.
Dr Carroll adds the biggest impact Swift's billionaire status will have is by giving critics ""more of a provable backbone.""
""I think it's going to just give legs to any critiques and arguments that exist and the discussions that are had by people who aren't necessarily in the fandom.""
But Dr Carroll says when it comes to fans spending money, ""not so much [do] they see it as supporting A Billionaire with a capital A-B"".
""They see it as supporting Taylor Swift, somebody who has been there for them over the years and who has brought them joy and brought their life meaning and they want to kind of continue that relationship.""",JBy Jessica Riga,Wed 3 Apr 2024,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-03/hannah-conda-rupauls-drag-race-uk-vs-the-world/103657492,From the priesthood to the heights of international Drag Race: Hannah Conda's rapid rise to the top,"RuPaul's Drag Race is often referred to as the Olympics of drag, but spin-off series UK vs the World takes things to another level: Queens from the reality competition's international franchises, representing their home countries, compete to be crowned ""Queen of the mother-tucking world"".
As the first Australian to compete, Sydney's Hannah Conda felt the weight of going up against the finest drag queens from the US, UK, Philippines, Holland, Spain and France.
That was partially — as she explained in the season two finale, which aired on Easter Saturday — due to the ""hard rap"" of Australia and New Zealand's joint franchise, Drag Race Down Under, on which she came runner-up in 2022.
""I don't take myself seriously, but I take what I do seriously, and representing my country on a global level [seriously],"" she says.
First airing in 2021, Down Under is routinely low on Drag Race's fan rankings of the franchise's more than 20 global editions. The reason why needs a whole other article, but, in essence, a combination of controversies around race and representation and a comparatively low budget haven't won over international audiences.

Given Drag Race's cultural ubiquity (Vanity Fair says the show ""introduced — and, in turn, redefined — an entire art form to the global general public""), Down Under colours the world's conception of antipodean drag.
But a shake-up for season four, slated to air this year, could revitalise the series. With RuPaul stepping away from the franchise, her right-hand woman Michelle Visage will take over as host. Former Down Under contestants will rotate as mentors and judges, offering an additional local opinion, alongside regular judge comedian Rhys Nicholson.
And with Hannah making it to the UK vs the World finale (ultimately coming second to UK queen Tia Kofi) she hopes people start seeing that Down Under drag is world-class.
""It's not one of those TV shows the whole world tunes into, but it's our [queer] community that tunes in,"" she says.
""I just wanted to do Australia proud and represent the beautiful things I don't think people understand about [us]. And show what it's like to be like a drag queen and a queer person in Australia. I'm very proud of myself. I think I did that.""
Meet the queens of RuPaul's Drag Race UK vs the World S2
Hannah Conda, real name Chris Collins, entered UK vs the World with more than a decade of drag under her corset.
""Some days it feels that long,"" she says, breaking into her trademark cackle. ""Other times it blows my mind that, 14 years later, I'm still doing drag for a living.""
At around 170 centimetres tall, Hannah (middle right) is a pint-sized powerhouse.  (Supplied: Stan)
Raised in Perth, she first started drag in 2010, when at 18 years old she won a local drag competition. But the host wouldn't award her the $50 bar tab prize. In retaliation, she competed again, and again, and again, continually winning — and eventually taking the host's gig, too. It was far from the career she imagined.
""I wanted to be a priest for a really long time,"" she says. ""I went to a Catholic high school, I was a Eucharistic minister, I went to a nunnery to talk about what I needed to do to start my journey into the priesthood.
""A lot of it was born out of the fact that I was so scared of going to hell, because of being different. I knew I was different. I didn't have a word really for it, but I knew I was different … It wasn't until year 11 or 12 when I was like, 'Well, this is never gonna happen. I'm full homo. Sorry about it!'""
In 2015 Hannah moved to Sydney, soon becoming a known performer in Oxford Street's gay bars. She paid tribute to the transformation on UK vs the World in a runway, throwing off a robe to reveal a sparkly showgirl costume — a nod to Kylie Minogue.

""I suppose [drag] is not too dissimilar to being a priest, really,"" she laughs.
""I get to wear fancy robes and I go and preach to the congregation in the form of Kylie songs. We're not far off, babes!""

The outfit was one of several looks on UK vs the World that nodded to Australian queer culture. Done with a distinctly Australian blend of camp, blue humour and glamour, everything from the Dykes on Bikes to Priscilla: Queen of the Desert to First Nations culture was honoured.
Noting that Down Under's two First Nations alumni Jojo Zaho and Pomara Fifth represented their culture on Drag Race, Hannah wanted to help showcase it on a world stage, too. Her proudest moment is her ""queen and country"" runway, an ode to Priscilla's frilled-neck lizard costumes, that was also decorated with artwork by Marrithiyel designer Paul McCann and featured the word ""treaty"" on the back.
""We have the longest living culture in the world, and I wanted to make sure I included something to pay my respects and my love to the First Nations people of Australia,"" she says.
""Combining that with Priscilla felt very natural. As a gay man and a drag queen, Priscilla is my bible.""

Hannah also wanted to showcase a side of herself not seen on Down Under's second season. While she proved fierce competition as the runner-up to New Zealand's Spankie Jackzon, Hannah found the season difficult to watch.
""I didn't resonate with the character I saw on Down Under,"" she says. ""I was incredibly shut-off and cold. And that's not me, at all…""
Hannah was originally heartbroken she missed out on Down Under's first season, but says ""everything is meant to happen when it's meant to happen"". (Supplied: Stan/World of Wonder)
On UK vs the World, Hannah shared that the fan's perception of her as a polished but personality-less queen impacted her mental health, describing ""hurtful"" moments where she was ignored completely at meet and greets.
Moments like these, alongside trolling and death threats, are common experiences, she says: Since the finale, Tia Kofi has received a barrage of hate for winning the season, despite Hannah and other cast mates asking fans to stop.
Dykes on Bikes is a motorcycle club with chapters all over the world. These days in Sydney it's about having a good time with friends.
""Fundamentally, drag is born of a place where we were the freaks or the outcasts … Drag was a safe space for those who didn't feel like they had anywhere to go.
""Its difficult when I see the safe space of so many others feel compromised because people are sitting at home and didn't like a dress someone wore.""
Now that the world is paying attention, Hannah hopes Australia will too, noting that while the UK and France book their Drag Race alumni for prime-time television shows, our media hasn't embraced Down Under queens.
""We underestimate the culture that we have in Australia, until you're talking to someone from another country,"" she says.
""[Australia's] media landscape is less willing to take a chance on having a drag entertainer on their panel show or on their reality show. They'd rather celebrate someone from MAFS more, which I think is a little bit disappointing. They've got such incredible talent, right in the palm of their hands.
""I want to be making people laugh,"" she adds. ""I want to bring people joy. That's what I do!""

To help you catch up, here's everything you missed in entertainment over the Easter long weekend.
Australian comedian and actor Rebel Wilson has been teasing the release of her new memoir Rebel Rising by airing some of her showbiz dirty laundry.
First, she took aim at Sacha Baron Cohen, who starred alongside Wilson in 2016's Grimsby. Wilson claimed via social media Baron Cohen was a ""massive asshole"" to her on the set of the spy flop, saying he repeatedly attempted to coerce her into filming a nude scene that she ultimately turned down.
Baron Cohen denied her claims through a spokesperson: ""While we appreciate the importance of speaking out, these demonstrably false claims are directly contradicted by extensive detailed evidence, including contemporaneous documents, film footage, and eyewitness accounts from those present before, during and after the production of The Brothers Grimsby.""
In an advanced excerpt of the memoir published over the weekend in Stellar, Wilson also shared her negative feelings about working on Australian shows including Fat Pizza and The Wedge, which launched her into stardom.
""I was in a boys' show, so I had to take their fatphobic jokes right on my double chin. All people cared about was that I was fat and funny. And I was doing both of those things very well,"" Wilson said of her time starring as drug dealer Toula on SBS's Fat Pizza.
In response, Fat Pizza creator Pauly Fenech defended the show on Instagram claiming that Wilson was an ""ungrateful person"" who without Fat Pizza ""would have not had the success she enjoys"".
Finally, in an excerpt shared with US Weekly, Wilson claimed that singer Adele ""hates her"" for how the media compared the two women.
""There was a moment when she was bigger, and some people would confuse us for one another … I am assuming, because to be fair I've never asked her,"" Wilson wrote in her book.
Rebel Rising is out April 2 in the US. Australian publisher HarperCollins could not confirm a local release date when contacted by ABC Entertainment.

Back to Black's distributor, StudioCanal, turned comments off on the video. But that hasn't stopped furious Winehouse fans from sharing their criticisms of Abela's attempt at imitating the iconic singer's voice and performance style — and the film's overall production value.
On Instagram, angry fans have even flocked to the comments sections of Abela's recent posts.
It comes as Abela shared in a recent appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show she underwent vocal training for ""two hours a day for four months"" to prepare for the role.

Investigation Discovery's four-part series that delves into the dark side of Nickelodeon in the 90s and early 00s has thrown the industry into disarray.
In Quiet on Set, Drake & Josh star Drake Bell confessed that he was sexually abused by Nickelodeon dialogue coach Brian Peck, which resulted in a 16-month jail sentence for Peck.
The child stars from Nickelodeon's heyday have grown up, and now they're speaking out against the machine and long-time producer Dan Schneider.
The series also featured multiple interviews with former employees of Dan Schneider, who backed claims that the kids TV producer created uncomfortable and unsafe working environments. Schneider's 19-minute apology video has been rejected by multiple former castmates.
A fifth episode, entitled Breaking the Silence, is slated to premiere in the US on April 7. The episode will feature new interviews with Bell, All That's Giovonnie Samuels and Bryan Christopher Hearne, and Hearne's mother Tracey Brown, all of whom appeared in the original docuseries. Plus, All That cast member, Shane Lyons, will appear for the first time.
Quiet on Set: Breaking the Silence will also feature a roundtable conversation facilitated by journalist Soledad O'Brien, where the former cast members will speak about their reactions to the series and how to protect children in the industry going forward.
Quiet on Set premieres in Australia on ID, Binge and Fetch from April 5. Breaking the Silence will premiere on April 19.

Poor Things star Ramy Youssef isn't backwards about coming forwards with his opinions about the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict.
Comedian Ramy Youssef's star has been slowly rising over the last five years, both blessed and burdened by his unwavering commitment to speak out about the issues that matter to him.
When he walked the Oscars red carpet he proudly sported an Artists4Ceasefire pin. He donated all funds from the last 12 shows of his 2023 US tour to Gaza through American Near East Refugee Aid. His new special More Feelings pokes fun at the responsibility he has to address the issue as a Muslim person with a platform.
So all eyes were on Youssef this weekend as he hosted Saturday Night Live. The veteran variety show has been cagey about mentioning the conflict — unless you count that one tepid Please Don't Destroy/Timotheé Chalamet sketch.
But Youssef didn't sugar-coat it when he broached the topic in his opening SNL monologue, recounting that he had two friends call him, asking to pray for them. One was asking for help in a custody dispute over his dog, while the other sought prayers for his family was missing in Gaza.
""So that night, I go to pray, and my prayers are… complicated. I've got a lot to fit in. I'm like, 'God, please, please, help Ahmed's family. Please stop the suffering, stop the violence, please free the people of Palestine, please. And please free the hostages, all the hostages, please,'"" the comedian said.
""And while you're at it… you know, free Mr Bojangles, he's a beautiful dog. I'm praying for that dog.""

The 11th annual iHeartRadio Awards were held in Los Angeles on Tuesday and, although the company/platform has a name that makes me cringe every time I read it or, even worse, have to say it out loud, they put on a pretty great celebration of music.
Hosted by none other than number one Meryl Streep fan Ludacris, the ceremony had performances from TLC (!), Green Day (who celebrate the 30th anniversary of Dookie this year wtaf), Lainey Wilson, Tate McRae and Jelly Roll. Oh, and also JT *sigh*.
Some of the night's highlights were:
JoJo Siwa giving KISS on the red carpet for some reason (it would seem the reason is to tease her ""bad girl"" rebrand, coming April 5):
Latto absolutely nailing Left Eye's verse in TLC's performance of Waterfalls.
And, of course, the remarkable Cher, performing alongside real-life angel Jennifer Hudson, while wearing 40-year-old pants, in honour of receiving the Icon Award.
But the real reason most people kicked their awards-season fatigue to rally behind the event was simple: Beyoncé.
Queen Bey has been honoured with the Innovator Award, presented by none other than Stevie Wonder!
This is a particularly pertinent accolade, following the Good Friday drop of the mind-blowing, 27-track record, Cowboy Carter.
After a lot of wild speculation that she would be announcing a tour, and lots of nerves that she would only appear on screen (like Taylor Swift did when accepting Artist of the Year), Beyoncé strutted onto the stage, wearing immaculate vintage Versace, in her trademark calm-but-powerful way.
In a gracious but unperturbed nod to the backlash, gatekeeping and racism she has received from some in the country music scene, she said: ""My hope is that we're more open to the joy and liberation that comes from enjoying art, with no preconceived notions.""
She then went on to thank the likes of 40s music goddess Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the inimitable Tracy Chapman and the first Black female artist to play the Grand Ole Oprey, Linda Martell: ""Thank you for executing your dream, so we all could follow,"" Bey said.
Now, back to listening to YA YA on repeat.

Peep the third single from Everyone's Getting Involved: A Tribute to Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense, from the inimitable Lorde.
Lorde — Take Me to the River
The 27-year-old New Zealand singer-songwriter shared a letter alongside the single, in which she told the story of the first time she heard Talking Heads, describing her cover of Take Me to the River as her ""interpretation of that pixelated spiritual experience"".
""I didn't let myself tidy it up too much, it had to feel young and imperfect, the peeling posters, the jaw of acne. It's beyond a great honour to be part of this compilation,"" Lorde wrote.
""In doing so, I am reaching back through time and pinning something to that kid's wall. Hope you like it.""
Lorde's take on the 1978 Talking Heads cover of the original 1974 track from Al Green follows covers from Paramore and Teezo Touchdown for the forthcoming tribute album, which will also feature songs from Miley Cyrus, girl in red and The National.
I'm sorry to report we still don't have a release date. Please accept this compilation video of Lorde shushing various crowds for 1 minute, 22 seconds, as my apology.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-30/how-religion-crept-into-popular-music-and-still-lurks-there/103649300,How religion crept into popular music — and still lurks there,"It's Easter weekend, which means many of us will be kicking back with the greatest hits on repeat.
But whether you're a boomer, or an ‘80s or '90s kid, you might be surprised to find many of your favourite tunes are more concerned about Jesus and God than you'd realised.
A few years ago, Tabitha Carvan became obsessed with Benedict Cumberbatch. It taught her the importance of female joy.
Many chart-topping songs in Western music delve into themes of faith (especially Christianity), spirituality and divinity. But unlike Christmas music, most of these come from a rock tradition.
Hits by some of rock's greatest guitarists, such as George Harrison, Lenny Kravitz and Prince, feature strong guitar riffs that create a sense of aural transcendence. These riffs, which involve a repeated note sequence or chord progression, help to define their songs.
This intertwining of guitar and Christian spirituality dates back to the emergence of rock music in the 1940s. American rock pioneer Sister Rosetta Tharpe (1915–73), from the Pentecostal church, used powerful guitar riffs that surged with soulfulness.
Tharpe's 1944 gospel song Strange Things Happening Every Day — covered by Yola for the 2022 film Elvis — is a great example.
Using electric guitar, and the theological message ""Jesus is the holy light"", Tharpe's was the first song to cross over from gospel into a mainstream ""race"" chart in the US. ""Race music"", which eventually became R&B, was the term used to describe African American music (but generally just referred to secular music).
This 1957 photo shows Sister Rosetta Tharpe, dubbed the 'Godmother Of Rock 'N' Roll', giving an impromptu performance in a lounge at London Airport. (AP)
Christian rock also has roots in the 1960s US counterculture ""hippie"" movement. The Jesus People brought a Christian vibe to this movement, leading to works such as Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1971 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar, which is still being performed more than 50 years later.
Throughout the 1960s and '70s, plenty of songs exploring themes of God, faith and spirituality climbed their way into the Top 20. For example, Norman Greenbaum's 1970 track Spirit in the Sky became popular during the Christian rock movement.
It was joined in the same year by Harrison's hit My Sweet Lord, which is particularly interesting because of its mix of spiritual undertones, which reflect the West's growing interest in Eastern spirituality at the time.
Along with the repetition of ""lord"" (which is said around 40 times) and the use of the Christian/Hebrew word ""Hallelujah"", the song also includes chants of ""Hare Krishna"" and ""Hare Rama"", praising the Hindu gods.
My Sweet Lord became the highest-selling single in the United Kingdom in 1971, as well as the first solo number-one hit by a member of the Beatles. It wasn't all smooth sailing, though. The song sparked controversy, and a lawsuit that claimed it was too similar to The Chiffons's 1963 hit He's So Fine.
The Chiffons – He's So Fine
For some, My Sweet Lord is considered a Christian song — at least the until the Hindu chants begin. But the mixing of religious elements was seen by some conservative Christians as satanic, or pagan (even though Hinduism isn't a pagan religion).
Music throughout the 1960s and '70s, while it still touched on religious themes, grew much more rebellious and edgy with bands like The Rolling Stones and Black Sabbath.
Topics such as sex, drugs and hedonism became common — as did protesting against traditional values. From this cocktail emerged the view that rock was the devil's music.
The 1980s and '90s continued the trend of intertwining spirituality and popular music. Many of these tracks stirred deep discussions on faith, cementing music's power as a medium for expressing complex themes.
Lenny Kravitz's Are You Gonna Go My Way (1993) was written to sound like the lyrics came from Jesus himself:
I was born long ago, I am the chosen. I'm the one. I have come to save the day, and I won't leave until I'm done … But what I really want to know is, are you gonna go my way?
Prince's Lets Go Crazy (1984) was a metaphor for God and Satan, hinted at in the line ""are we gonna let the elevator bring us down? Oh no let's go!""
Meanwhile, Madonna's 1989 smash Like a Prayer made more than one wave when it topped the charts 35 years ago. The music video stirred up quite a controversy by mixing the sacred with the profane. Among other things, Madonna is shown dancing among burning crosses, and kissing a black Christ who comes to life from being a statue.
The video conveys messages about prejudice, racism, violence and sexuality. Some networks refused to show it, deeming it inappropriate for children. Others aired it with a warning it might offend viewers. The Catholic Church was outraged and the Vatican condemned it.

Nonetheless, the video achieved huge commercial success, winning MTV's 1989 Video Music Award for Viewer's Choice. Even now, it remains a pinnacle of music video art.
Today, most of us won't bat an eyelid when we see Lil Nas X giving Satan a lapdance, and that's probably because of the work of artists like Madonna.

It's interesting that, despite a rise in secularism, the intersection of the sacred and secular in music has persisted. Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, with its intermingling spiritual and sexual themes, is still one of the most popular songs of all time.
Today, many of the world's most famous contemporary artists continue the tradition of engaging with spiritual and religious themes. Take Drake's 2018 hit God's Plan, or The Weeknd's highly acclaimed 2022 album Dawn FM, replete with spiritual undertones and religious symbolism.

Perhaps it's just in the nature of religion to evoke feeling and inspire, even for those who aren't ""religious"" themselves. Or perhaps we've collectively realised musicians can experiment with themes and take risks, and it won't bring about the end of the world.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-30/eartha-kitt-activism-tasmania/103620902,"Blacklisted for speaking out at home, Eartha Kitt campaigned on Australian causes","When iconic performer Eartha Kitt died in 2008 at the age of 81, a tribute came from an island at the bottom of the world.
From Tasmania, the Australian Greens thanked Kitt for her contribution to a national campaign to save the Franklin River in the south-west of the state from damming for hyrdroelectricity.
An American musician and movie star, known for her role as Catwoman in Batman and later as Yzma in kids animation The Emperor's New Groove, Kitt lent her voice to the campaign after a flight over the proposed site.
Pilot and environmentalist parliamentarian Norman Sanders remembers the day he drove Kitt to a working sheep farm in Bothwell for a flight over south-west Tasmania.
In the early 1950s, a young man working as an usher in the Biltmore theatre in downtown Los Angeles saw a captivating, popular singer take to the stage.
Decades before any climate blockades, young people put their bodies on the line to save a wild river. Here's what we can learn from them today.
About 25 years later their paths crossed again in Tasmania, where he ignited her desire to speak publicly against the Gordon-below-Franklin dam project.
Dr Sanders was that young man and Kitt the performer.
Both American-born, Dr Sanders had moved to Tasmania, where he became a leader in the national campaign against damming the Franklin River.
His stance led to him to become Australia's first parliamentarian elected on an environmental platform as a representative of the Australian Democrats.
He clearly remembers the performance he saw when he was 19 years old.
""She just had so much presence,"" Dr Sanders recalls.
""Even as a kid, I was only young, I could see what an impact she had on her audience.""
Decades later, they crossed paths again when a mutual friend introduced the two in Hobart.
Kitt was in Tasmania to perform but sought opportunities to sight-see and meet locals during her two-week stay. Over lunch at Tasmania's parliament house, she expressed curiosity about kunanyi/Mt Wellington, the mountain Hobart sits beneath.
""She said, 'Are there any hiking trails up Mt Wellington? Would you show me?'',"" Dr Sanders says.
They met next day at 7am.
""At the appointed hour, out comes Eartha Kitt, who Orson Welles called the most exciting woman in the world,"" Dr Sanders says.
""We went out on a track, which happened to be overlooking Hobart. It was a beautiful day, she just fell in love with the place.
""And so I said, ""If you really want to see the place, I'll take you flying.'""

Flying over Tasmania, Dr Sanders said Kitt became alarmed when she saw the environmental impact of the human-made reservoir Lake Gordon and learned of plans for the Gordon-below-Franklin dam.
The performer offered to create a commercial supporting the national campaign against damming. The offer was not taken up, but Kitt spoke with passion against the project to media.
""She was just overtaken by the beauty,"" Dr Sanders says.
""She really loved Tasmania.""
Kitt actively involved herself in a range of issues when touring Australia but a particular passion of hers was Aboriginal rights.

Born in poverty on a cotton plantation, Kitt saw the life she came out of as a child reflected in Australia and lent her voice to raising awareness of inequality.
Following a three-day tour of Perth and Fremantle in 1974, where she observed housing conditions for Aboriginal people, Kitt said she saw ""absolute"" poverty.
""You're given enough feeling that we're taking care of you and everything is going to be alright,"" Kitt says.
On tour in 1992, Kitt took to the stage when spotted in the crowd at a rally marking the 25th anniversary of Aboriginal legal rights.
In a later interview, she said the experience of Aboriginal people in Australia was a universal issue for First Nations people, referencing her own experience as a Cherokee woman.

In a postcard to Dr Sanders, Kitt spoke of meeting senator for Tasmania Peter Rae, who she said asked her to return to Australia to focus on Tasmanian problems.
Kitt and Mr Rae met while filming a television program and, at his invitation, she later joined him at the Speakers Suite in Old Parliament House in Canberra for dinner.
In a postcard to Dr Sanders, Kitt mentions a meeting with then Shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Peter Rae. (Supplied: Norm Sanders)
Mr Rae recalls a ""vivacious"" character, who spoke at length about Aboriginal rights.
""My impression of her concern was that it was one of wishing to use her racial experiences in the United States to help overcome some problems in Australia,"" Mr Rae says.
During her visit to Parliament House in Canberra, Kitt crawled into the Aboriginal Tent Embassy to speak with the occupants about why they were protesting. She continued meeting with people until 3am, then caught an early flight to the Philippines for a performance.
""She was an extraordinarily strong character, but also vital in her own way,"" Mr Rae says.
""She left a strong impression on me.""
Kitt did not shy away from the impact of using her platform to speak out or engage with social and environmental issues, but it came at a cost.
The performer lost several contracts when she spoke out against the Vietnam War when visiting the White House in 1968.
""She gave me some rather dreadful examples, including that she had a Las Vegas contract that was suddenly cancelled,"" Mr Rae said.
""And then she found that all of her contracts were cancelled.
""She was wiped.""
Kitt navigated the change by touring more extensively abroad and continued to speak out on issues close to her heart.
""She wouldn't care, I'm sure, about her career,"" Dr Sanders says.

Of her contribution to the national campaign against damming the Franklin, Dr Sanders says her small contribution helped build toward the finale.
""Every little bit helped,"" Dr Sanders says.
""If any one action saved the Franklin, it's [Kevin Kiernan] finding [Kutikina] cave, which became the basis for the World Heritage listing and the ultimate salvation of the Franklin.
""Any other single action, they're just a part of the mix but they're an important part of the mix.""
Kitt did not return to Tasmania, but Dr Sanders says she maintained a deep love of the island state and the people she met.
""It was such a change from the showbiz world she normally travelled in,"" he says.
""Hobart was quite a change for her because she became part of the community for a short period of time.""

Federal authorities in the United States were seen outside Combs's mansion in Holmby Hills on the Westside of Los Angeles, California on Monday local time with guns drawn in dramatic footage broadcast live.
The Miami home of the rapper was also searched.
Associated Press reports the searches are part of an ongoing sex trafficking investigation by federal authorities in New York.

In a statement, Combs's lawyer Aaron Dyer called the raids an ""unprecedented ambush"".
""Yesterday, there was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr Combs's residences,"" the statement read.
Properties in Los Angeles and Miami belonging to hip hop giant Sean ""Diddy"" Combs have been searched by US Homeland Security Investigations agents as part of an ongoing-sex trafficking investigation, according to anonymous law enforcement officials.
Combs's sons, Justin and Christian ""King"" Combs, were seen handcuffed during the raid at their father's residence in Los Angeles.
Mr Dyer said Combs spoke to authorities but was not detained.
He said neither he nor any family members were arrested and their travel has not been restricted.
Mr Dyer said the ""premature rush to judgement"" of Combs was ""nothing more than a witch hunt based on meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits"".
""There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations,"" he said.
""Mr Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.""
In recent months, Combs has been the defendant in several sexual abuse lawsuits and has attracted a great deal of scrutiny.
His former protege and ex-girlfriend R&B singer Cassie alleged years of sexual abuse, including rape, in a lawsuit that was settled one day after it was filed in November 2023.

In February, music producer Rodney ""Lil Rod"" Jones also filed a lawsuit alleging Combs coerced him to solicit prostitutes and pressured him to have sex with them.
Another accuser said Combs raped her two decades ago when she was 17.
Sean ""Diddy"" Combs settles a lawsuit with his ex-partner Cassandra Ventura, just one day after she publicly accused him of sexual slavery and rape.
Combs defended his innocence in an Instagram post in December 2023 headlined ""Enough is Enough"".
""For the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy,"" he wrote in all caps.
""Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday.
""Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.""
Combs, who was formerly known as Puff Daddy and P Diddy, is one of the most influential hip-hop producers and executives in the business.
He is the founder of Bad Boy Records and played a significant role in the careers of artists including the late Notorious BIG, Mary J Blige, Usher, Lil Kim, Faith Evans and 112.
In a career spanning over three decades, Combs has built an empire that includes a liquor brand and the clothing label Sean John.
He also launched a TV Network – Revolt, that he has reportedly sold his stake in.

Combs has won three Grammys including for the 1997 single I'll Be Missing You, which samples Every Breath You Take by The Police and is dedicated to the Notorious BIG who was killed earlier that year.
He's also dabbled in acting – appearing as Walter Lee Younger in the Broadway revival of A Raisin in the Sun and in films including Get Him to the Greek and Monster's Ball.
Combs famously dated Jennifer Lopez from 1991 to 2001. In 1999, both were reportedly arrested on weapons and bribery charges.
Lopez was absolved. It was reported she was detained for 14 hours. Combs was indicted and later acquitted.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-26/quiet-on-set-dan-schneider-drake-bell-josh-peck-nickelodeon/103633038,'Apology not accepted': Fallout from allegations against kids TV producer Dan Schneider continues,"Warning: This article discusses sexual abuse.
The American kids TV industry was thrown into a tailspin in March upon the US release of Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids Television.
The four-part documentary featured interviews with multiple former Nickelodeon child stars and employees who shared the unsavoury and sometimes illegal practices that were rife on the set of Dan Schneider productions such as iCarly, Zoey 101, All That and Drake & Josh.
Among the heart-wrenching testimony was Drake & Josh star Drake Bell sharing, for the first time, that he was sexually abused by Brian Peck (no relation to co-star Josh Peck), a dialogue coach who worked on multiple Schneider productions.
Two days after the series premiered, Schneider broke his silence by posting a 19-minute interview to YouTube.
His interviewer, iCarly cast member BooG!e, claimed in the video he reached out to Schneider to ask if he wanted to address the allegations.
Schneider, who has kept a low-profile since going on ""hiatus"" in 2021, apologised for the behaviours exposed in the documentary, starting with allegations that he would pressure employees for massages.
The child stars from Nickelodeon's heyday have grown up, and now they're speaking out against the machine and long-time producer Dan Schneider.
""It was wrong I ever put anyone in that position,"" Schneider said, adding that he would ""never"" do it today.
In response to allegations of creating a hostile work environment, particularly for women writers on his shows, Schneider said he ""made practical jokes that went too far"" because he was ""immature"" and ""inexperienced"".
""Wouldn't happen today, but I'm just really sorry it happened,"" he said.
Multiple former cast members who were interviewed for Quiet on Set expressed their disgust at the amount of perceived sexual innuendos in Schneider's shows.
In the apology video, Schneider maintained that the jokes were intended for a young audience and that no higher-ups or executives expressed any concern at the time.
""If anybody had said anything [like], 'Hey, we don't like that, that's not appropriate,' it would have been cut out,"" he said.

At multiple times throughout Quiet on Set, Nickelodeon responds to the allegations on screen with text responses.

The network also released a statement after the documentary was released.
""Though we cannot corroborate or negate allegations of behaviours from productions decades ago, Nickelodeon as a matter of policy investigates all formal complaints as part of our commitment to fostering a safe and professional workplace environment free of harassment or other kinds of inappropriate conduct, "" the statement read.
""Our highest priorities are the well-being and best interests not just of our employees, casts and crew, but of all children, and we have adopted numerous safeguards over the years to help ensure we are living up to our own high standards and the expectations of our audience.""
The company also responded directly to Bell's revelations that he had been abused by Brian Peck while he was a Nickelodeon employee.
""Now that Drake Bell has disclosed his identity as the plaintiff in the 2004 case, we are dismayed and saddened to learn of the trauma he has endured, and we commend and support the strength required to come forward,"" the statement read.
Bell has now conducted his first interview post-Quiet on Set, where he admonished Nickelodeon's response.
""There's a very well-tailored response saying, 'learning about his trauma', because they couldn't say that they didn't know about this or what had happened, or anything,"" Bell said on The Sarah Fraser Show.
""I find it pretty empty, their responses, because, I mean, they still show our shows, they still put our shows on. And I have to pay for my own therapy.
""If there was any truth behind them actually caring, there would be something more than quotes on a page by obviously a legal representative telling them exactly how to tailor a response.""

Former Nickelodeon stars, including Bell's on-screen mother Nancy Sullivan, have made public statements in support of Bell.
After Quiet on Set's premiere, all eyes were on Josh Peck (no relation to Brian Peck), Bell's Drake & Josh co-star of four seasons.
On March 21, Josh Peck released a statement via Instagram saying he had reached out to Bell privately and commending others in the documentary for speaking out.
""Revealing this publicly is incredibly difficult, but I hope it can bring healing for the victims and their families as well as necessary change to the industry,"" he said.
Social media users jumped on one of Peck's recent posts as proof that he didn't support Bell, prompting Bell to address the situation via TikTok.

""I've noticed a lot of comments on some of Josh's TikToks and some of his posts,"" Bell said in the video. ""I just want to let you guys know that … processing this and going through this is a really emotional time. A lot of it's very, very difficult, so not everything is put out to the public.
""But I just wanted to let you guys know that [Josh] has reached out to me and it's been very sensitive … He has reached out to talk with me and help me work through this and he's been really, really great.""
Former Zoey 101 cast member Alexa Nikolas, who featured prominently in Quiet on Set and is a frequent campaigner for better conditions for child actors, released a YouTube video reacting to Schneider's apology.
""I'm sorry, him centring what he feels is bizarre to me,"" Nikolas said in the 49-minute video.
""I'm going to cut to the chase here: you don't feel anything, Dan. You have no idea what accountability is. You're searching for it, maybe, but you haven't landed on it. That's for sure. This is not the way.""

Salvatore Jr was a child actor on Zoey 101 and later worked in the writers' room on Schneider shows like Sam & Cat and Victorious.
After Quiet on Set was broadcast, he took to Instagram to share his experience in the Schneider-verse.
""We could talk about the fact that [Dan Schneider] would literally count his gold coin collection in front of his crew who was living pay cheque to pay cheque. We could talk about how sometimes he would bring out his shotgun to scare one of the writers when they were working at his house,"" Salvatore Jr said.
""But what I do want to talk about is never letting this stuff happen again. This is an entire industry built on hope and dreams and adrenaline and wish fulfilment, and that can be a very dangerous thing for megalomaniacs to wield.""
In the video, Salvatore acknowledged that sharing could harm his career, but it was more important for him to help speak out about the industry.
He also did not accept Schneider's apology video.
""Until [Schneider] goes on 60 Minutes to answer some questions from some real journalists and not a cast member of his that he's paying to be there…apology not accepted.""

The ABC Entertainment team has you covered — from the controversy surrounding Australian horror Late Night with the Devil to more (Princess) Peach-y news.
While preliminary reviews had horror enthusiasts hyped for Late Night with the Devil — a new film written and directed by Australian brothers Cameron and Colin Cairnes — the film's use of AI-generated imagery has led some to boycott the film.
Released this weekend in the US (out April 11 in Australia), the film centres on a Halloween-themed episode of Night Owls, a fictional 70s late-night show featuring a set of eclectic guests, including a possessed child. No surprises for guessing that things go terribly wrong.
But things spiralled in a different way when viewers noticed a graphic in Night Owls' in-film interstitials and found across its set. Several warped elements – an outline of a winged creature with several extra limbs, a skeleton's curved fingers, a jack-o'-lantern that resembles a pumpkin only in gesture – aligned with some common tells of AI-generated imagery.
Many film enthusiasts expressed disappointment across social media, and there were calls for boycott, with a slew of ½ star user reviews on Letterboxd citing the image.
This graphic pops up repeatedly in Late Night with the Devil, including on props.  (Umbrella Entertainment)
The use of AI in film and television was a major topic of last year's SAG-AFTRA strike, with particular focus on its use in writing, and re-creating an actor's likeness without consent or compensation.
In a statement to Variety, the Cairnes brothers have confirmed the image was AI-generated, saying they ""experimented with AI for three still images which we edited further and ultimately appear as very brief interstitials in the film"".
Despite the controversy, the film made $4.3 million ($US2.8 million) in its opening weekend in the US.

The who's who of Naarm's fashion, drag and general-queer-icon scene were out in full flight over the weekend, at the National Gallery of Victoria's Bowery Ball.
The gallery's centrepiece Triennial exhibition may already have a flaming water fountain at its entrance, but the NGV was set aflame again by the outrageously amazing fits of the city's queer/art scene.
This was not only expected, but demanded, given that the ball is named in honour of Melbourne-born iconoclast Leigh Bowery.
Bowery grew up in Sunshine, in Melbourne's western suburbs, but moved to London at the age of 19 and quickly became a huge name in the underground club scene with his unconventional and unabashed explorations of gender, identity and sexuality.

He was particularly renowned for his larger-than-life designs, including for Jesus Loves You's 1990 music video, Generations of Love. He died in 1994 at the age of 33 from AIDS-related complications.
The throngs of incredibly dressed people not only celebrated this LGBTQIA+ icon, but also got to revel in performances from the likes of drag diva Art Simone, burlesque ""supervillain"" Ruby Slippers and outrageously funny drag kings Dazza and Keif.
Somehow people also got to squeeze in appreciating the art of the Triennial — on until April 7.

The upcoming sequel to Joker — the controversial 2019 origin film about the Batman villain that particular people love to base their personality on — is going to be ""mostly a jukebox musical"".
There'd already been reports Joker: Folie à Deux was going to have a musical twist, after it was revealed Lady Gaga had been cast as Harley Quinn, alongside Joaquin Phoenix returning to his Oscar-winning role as the Joker.
But now insiders ""privy to filming and early versions"" of director Todd Phillips's anticipated sequel, have told Variety it features reinterpretations of at least 15 ""very well-known"" songs, including That's Entertainment, a Judy Garland standard from 1953 musical The Band Wagon. The movie is expected for release on October 3.
Hildur Guðnadóttir, the Icelandic musician who won an Oscar for scoring the first Joker, will reportedly ""infuse her distinctive, haunting [music] cues"" into the reinterpretations.
Variety also mentions one or two original songs that could be added ""to the final version"", presumably to make the most of Lady Gaga and to submit something come Academy Awards season.
One thing's for certain, it's going to be interesting to see how sinister takes on show tunes are going to fit with the ""We live in a society"" meme-making crowd.

And Just Like That… (sorry, it had to be done) the Sex and the City reboot has lost another one of its new core members.
Karen Pittman — who played Miranda Hobbes's (Cynthia Nixon) extremely unbelievable bestie, Columbia Law School professor Nya Wallace — has left the show due to scheduling conflicts, according to HBO Max.
""It has been a joy to have Karen Pittman play the smart and stunning Professor Nya Wallace on the first two seasons of And Just Like That,"" HBO Max said in a statement.
""As we have thoroughly enjoyed working with this dynamic actress, so too have others. Due to her commitments to two other streamer series, it has become apparent that filming three shows at once isn't possible.""
The news comes weeks after it was reported the queer, non-binary, Mexican Irish diva/former podcast host the internet loved to hate, Che Diaz (played by Sara Ramirez), wouldn't be returning for the third series either — albeit for very different reasons.
What is happening at AJLT? Is the writing on the wall for the remaining two new core cast members, Seema Patel and Lisa Todd Wexley?
We'll likely be waiting a while to find out — filming has yet to commence for season three, with a tentative 2025 release date.

She's usually relegated to damsel in distress, but Princess Peach got to take centrestage this weekend with the release of Princess Peach: Showtime!
It's only the second time in the history of the Mario Bros that Peach has gotten her own game. The first time was Super Princess Peach back in 2005, and that game was based around Peach's ""emotional meter"" (she only had four emotions: gloom, joy, rage and calm, i.e. the full female experience).
Conversely, Showtime is built around the concept that women contain multitudes, with Peach stepping into roles like Swordfighter Peach, Detective Peach, Patissier Peach and Cowgirl Peach to save the day.

The game has been praised for its variety and creativity, although a few reviewers noted it might be a little easy for more experienced gamers.
Nintendo has also gone all out with the merch, partnering with luxury Japanese fashion brand Samantha Thavasa to release a Princess Peach-inspired collection.
Proving once and for all that it doesn't matter if a girl is literally saving the day, marketing executives will find a way to imply that women be shopping.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-24/harry-houdini-birthday/103607122,'It completely fooled him': How a 27-year-old portrait artist left Harry Houdini stumped,"Harry Houdini had issued a challenge to every magician, illusionist and escapologist in the world — perform any trick for him three times, he said, and he could tell you how it was done.
But it was a simple card trick by a then-unknown 27-year-old amateur performer that finally stumped him.
By 1922 Houdini had made an elephant disappear, been thrown off bridges and been buried alive.
Almost a century after his death Harry Houdini has been the subject of movies, TV series, musicals, radio plays and songs. (Supplied: National Portrait Gallery )
It was a career that had made the then-48-year-old one of the highest-paid vaudeville performers on the circuit for many years.
Dai Vernon, in comparison, was a nobody in the public eye.
The young Canadian had been learning sleight-of-hand and card tricks since childhood, but his main source of income was cutting silhouettes on Coney Island.
A few cents a portrait was enough for him to support his family and pursue his passion for magic in the off-season.
But his skill was quickly earning him a reputation among fellow magicians.
President of the Australian Society of Magicians, Mark Mayer, tells the ABC that Vernon would later be credited ""as the father of close-up magic and modern magic"", dubbed The Professor.
""His was just the naturalistic style [when] you handle cards or coins or ribbons or silks or cigarettes or whatever they were using those days,"" he says.
""[It was] a very understood style by people watching it, it didn't look so showy.""
Houdini ""wasn't a card man by any stretch of the imagination"", by Vernon's account.
The illusionist was attending an event at Chicago's Great Northern Hotel as president of the Society of American Magicians.
""I had him initial one card on the face and then turned it face down and very slowly placed it under the top card … making it now the second card down,"" Vernon wrote.
""And then I very slowly turned over the top card and it was his initialled card, back on top.""
Vernon did the trick again, and then again — three times.
""I remember Houdini kept saying, 'You must be using two cards.' But I kept pointing out the fact that he initialled the card and I would have had no way of duplicating it on a similar card.
""I remember so well how Harry kept asking me to 'do it again'.""
Vernon later claimed to have a letter from the great magician's wife, Bess – who would later become the godmother to his eldest son – ""in which she stated that he had been fooled"".
Dai Vernon, the man who fooled Harry Houdini.
""It completely fooled him,"" says Mr Mayer, who cheerfully refuses to explain the trick to the ABC.
""So much so, that some years later other magicians were going to describe to him how it was done, and he got very angry that young magicians were going to teach the great Houdini how to do a trick.
""He was quite egotistical in that way.""
The incident proved only a lesser-known footnote in Houdini's legacy.
Born as Erik Weisz on March 24, 1874 — 150 years ago this week — the Hungarian-American performer built himself up as a ""king of the cards"".
""Then he found that [cards] have got a limited appeal,"" says Mr Mayer.
He became famous for escaping from handcuffs, cells and straitjackets – sometimes in front of thousands – but copycats sparked a transition to escapes from locked milk cans, mail bags and crates nailed shut.
Archival footage of Harry Houdini.
Tim Ellis, founder of the Melbourne Magic Festival and the Australian Institute of Magic, says Houdini learned to copyright his tricks ""as a one-act play"".
""So that way if anyone did copy it, he could sue them successfully because the play was copyrighted,"" he says.
""And since then that's been the only way magicians can protect any of their secrets … I'm just really delighted that Houdini was the very first one to come up with that idea.""
A trip to Australia in 1910 saw him become the first person to ""achieve a controlled powered flight"" on Australian soil, flying 9.6 kilometres in a biplane he had brought with him, according to Museums Victoria.
On the same tour, he jumped from Queen's Bridge into Melbourne's Yarra River.
That same bridge stunt sparked a popular story – that the dive had dislodged a human corpse, which then floated to the surface alongside the escape artist.

""I would want to ask him, 'How did you get the nerve to tell some of the stories that you told?' says Mr Ellis.
""Because some of the stories that he told never happened at all … it didn't take away from his legacy, it just built it tremendously.
""There'd be stories about him falling through the ice and hearing his mother's voice, following it … out of the ice just in time.
""And you trace it back and it actually never happened. But it was a good story.""

Later in life, he turned to debunking the supernatural, offering a cash prize to anyone who could prove they had genuine psychic abilities.
He died on October 31, 1926, at 52 years old, of peritonitis or swelling of the abdomen.
It's unclear whether his illness was caused by appendicitis or by several punches to the stomach he had received a week earlier.
""He waited until Halloween to die,"" says Mr Ellis.
Almost a century after his death Houdini has been the subject of movies, TV series, musicals, radio plays and songs.
Among the most recent is pop singer Dua Lipa's single Houdini, ranked by multiple outlets as among the top songs of 2023.
The word Houdini is listed as its own noun in the Oxford Dictionary, meaning ""an ingenious escape, or a person who embodies the characteristics of Houdini"".
""His name is an eponym,"" says Mr Ellis.
""There were others who were so famous back in the day but we've forgotten about them, they don't have that legacy.
""He published a magic magazine, he owned the magic shop, he was president of the Society of American Magicians and built that into an international organisation.
For Mr Mayer, who worked as a pilot before taking up magic full-time professionally, the future of the craft is ""wonderfully exciting"".
""It's such an interesting, odd, strange, wonderful art,"" he says.
""It's part acting, it's part physical performance, it's psychology. It's also direction, misdirection, it's scripting. There's so much in it.
""To understand Houdini's influence right now ... one of the biggest magic shops online right now is called Penguin Magic. There are over 40 tricks on Penguin Magic right now with the name Houdini on it.
""His name is still used every day. It's just quite incredible.""",Unknown,Sun 24 Mar 2024,0

In the vein of its predecessors Big Little Lies and Nine Perfect Strangers, it's a story of long-held secrets suddenly and dramatically coming to light; of envy and jealousy, and dysfunctional personal relationships.
The formula has worked before for Moriarty, who, with Big Little Lies, was the first Australian author to debut at number one on the New York Times bestseller list.
After the smash success of the TV adaptation of Big Little Lies, starring Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon and Shailene Woodley, it was only a matter of time before Moriarty's latest novel made it onto TV.
Apples Never Fall trailer
Apples Never Fall plays out over seven episodes after Delaney family matriarch Joy (played by Annette Bening; Nyad) suddenly goes missing.
Here's what you need to know about the TV adaptation of Apples Never Fall:
Apples Never Fall, the TV series, is about the Delaneys, a family who live in Miami.
Alongside Joy, there is her husband, retired tennis coach Stan (an Australian character, played by Kiwi actor Sam Neill; The Twelve). He still resents that one of his former students went on to become a world champion — with a new coach. When Joy goes missing, the curmudgeonly Stan is suspected of her murder.
""A good ending … shouldn't be predictable. I think it'll take a lot of people by surprise,"" Neill told IndieWire. (Supplied: Binge)
Joy and Stan have four adult children: Amy (Alison Brie; Community), an aspiring life coach; Troy (Jake Lacy; The White Lotus), a venture capitalist; Logan (Conor Merrigan-Turner; Thai Cave Rescue), who works at a marina; and Brooke (Essie Randles; Speedway), a physical therapist.
While some of Joy and Stan's children believe their father is behind their mother's disappearance, others point the finger at ""Savannah"" (Georgia Flood; Tangle), a mysterious stranger who, months earlier, turned up on the Delaneys' doorstep looking for help.
The episodes jump in time between the present, marked by the number of days Joy has been missing, and the recent past. In each episode, we get more of an insight into the characters, one by one — from their relationship with Joy to their own messy personal lives (they all have messy personal lives).
It's part murder mystery, part family drama — and believe me, there's a lot of drama.
Yes! Apples Never Fall was shot on the Gold Coast (despite being set in Florida). That means there's a bunch of Aussie actors on the show: there's two Sydneysiders taking on their breakthrough roles, WAAPA graduate Conor Merrigan-Turner; and Essie Randles, who trained at the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA). Then there's Melbourne actor and musician Georgia Flood, who studied in Paris at the prestigious theatre school Lecoq.

A number of local actors also featured in minor roles, including Robert Taylor (The Newsreader), Madeleine Jones (Population 11) and Ana Marie Belo (It's Fine, I'm Fine).
It sure was. Apples Never Fall began shooting in March 2023 and was scheduled to run until the end of August, but halted in July due to the American actors' and writers' strikes.
The writers' strike kicked in first, in May, leading showrunner Melanie Marnich to step back from the project, with the directors and actors continuing the shoot but staying true to the original scripts.

Crew were stood down without pay for a month, and then formally terminated with no pay and a week's notice. Following this, impacted crew and entertainment union members signed an open letter demanding a week's severance, but the production companies didn't budge.
Production resumed on the Gold Coast in December, after the actors' strike ended. The time away led to some ""changes in direction"", according to Sam Neill: ""When we came back to work, what I thought would be the ending was more or less it, but it was kind of refined,"" he told IndieWire. Marnich has said when she came back to the series, she could look at the finale ""with clear eyes"" and rewrote 60 per cent of it.
While the Gold Coast plays a pretty convincing Miami, we suspect that generous tax incentives for film and TV productions were a factor in the choice to shoot the show in Australia.
Apples Never Fall — which had an estimated $79 million budget — received the Australian Government Location Incentive program grant (now defunct) and the federal government's ongoing Location Offset rebate (which recently rose from 16.5 per cent to 30 per cent). It also received funding from Screen Queensland, as part of its Production Attraction Strategy Incentive. The two incentives were credited as supporting 260 jobs for Australian cast and crew.

Apples Never Fall, along with American sci-fi series La Brea and Singaporean action-drama Shero, reportedly generated a total of $198 million in expenditure in Australia. Before filming started, the federal and Queensland state government boasted that the series would inject more than $79 million into the Australian economy — $29.5 million of which would go to Queensland.
Visual effects for the show were completed in Sydney, with support from Screen NSW, while digital and visual effects were done in South Australia, with support from the South Australian Film Corporation. City of Gold Coast is also credited as supporting the production.
Apples Never Fall is Sydney author Moriarty's ninth book for adults (she's also written for kids), and was released in September 2021.
Moriarty told ABC RN's The Book Show in 2022 that she wrote Apples Never Fall when she was meant to be taking a year off writing, following the publication of Nine Perfect Strangers and the TV adaptation of Big Little Lies. Her sister, Jaclyn, had sent her a short story prompt about apples lying next to a bike, and before long Moriarty had the first chapter of the book.
But she didn't know how the story would end. ""I did not know where Joy was, and I did not know if Stan was innocent or guilty,"" she said.
She didn't know exactly how Savannah fit into the picture either. ""It was an interesting device to have someone who turns up and knocks on the door, [but] I had no idea who she was or how she would be involved with Joy's disappearance,"" she said.
Brie (pictured) loves Liane Moriarty's books, but hadn't read Apples Never Fall before she joined the show. (Supplied: Binge)
It's par for the course for the writer, who said that she tends to work out how a book will end about two-thirds of the way through.
When it came to the TV adaptation, Moriarty was an executive producer and has been sharing her excitement about casting announcements and the trailer on her Facebook.
And while she doesn't have an issue with her book being transplanted from Sydney to Miami for this series (showrunner Melanie Marnich made the change because Florida is the home of professional tennis training in the States), she'd love to see a later adaptation of one of her books retain its Australian setting. ""I would love to see [more] Australians play my characters,"" she said.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-21/where-is-kate-middleton-photoshop-royals-social-media/103609066,Do the Royals think they're 'above' the internet?,"It should have been an easy PR win for The Prince and Princess of Wales.
On Sunday March 10, UK Mother's Day or ""Mothering Sunday"", the photo went up on their official social media accounts — a casually dressed Catherine, Princess of Wales, George, Louis and Charlotte gathered round, the children's beaming faces framing their mother's like flower petals.
Major news and photography agencies recalled the photograph of the Princess of Wales and family over concerns the image has been ""manipulated"". (Instagram: The Prince and Princess of Wales)
The casually composed photo was laden with messaging: aspirational motherhood, childhood wholesomeness, vitality, ease and happiness. It was easy to imagine Prince William in dad mode behind the camera, shouting silly jokes to make the children laugh.
It fairly screamed: ""Royals! They're just like us!""
But the biggest message it was trying to send was to the terminally online, who were already awash in speculation and conspiracy theories over #WhereIsKate.
We dive deep into the seemingly inescapable #WhereIsKate conspiracy theory content so you don't have to.
Despite Kensington Palace stating the princess would be out of action until after Easter due to planned abdominal surgery, the internet was suss.
By this point Kensington Palace had already broken its own red line of providing updates only when there was ""significant new information to share"", issuing a second statement saying, essentially, that they would still be saying nothing.
A statement about nothing gives a very strong Seinfeld vibe but, in the world of royal correspondents, it was considered significant.
""Social media has been the driving force behind this entire saga,"" said Ellie Hall, Buzzfeed's former longtime royal correspondent, in an interview with Nieman Journalism Lab.
Anyway, we all know what happened next: The story went away.
JK! It snowballed from a messy online situation into a legitimate global news event over some clunky photoshop edits, apparently done by the future Queen of the United Kingdom.
The internet was emboldened. More memes were born.
Jean Burgess is a distinguished professor of digital media at QUT, whose research focuses on the social implications of digital media technologies, platforms and cultures.
She says Kate's ""photo-editing experiment"" landed straight in the crosshairs of a social media ecosystem primed for mistrust and conspiracy theories (think COVID and Donald Trump), and rising fears over generative AI (think creepy Midjourney AI hands).
""You've got these kind of ready-made architectures of conspiracy that are ready to jump on a key media moment like this,"" Burgess says.
""That's surrounded by uncertainty, and that connects also to a huge amount of mainstream media industry interest.
""So it's kind of a perfect storm of attention and conspiracy theory and sleuthing on the part of internet citizens.
""It also comes along at a time where we're having a broader conversation, a public conversation about AI, and about manipulated media and about deep fakes.""
From a broader view, the Princess of Wales' ""fake"" photo captures something important about the deepening trust recession of the 2020s, which now seems bottomless, thanks to AI, writes Ange Lavoipierre.
No surprises then, when The Sun and TMZ reported sightings and apparent footage of a dressed-down William and Kate taking a ""happy and relaxed"" stroll in Windsor earlier this week.
The #WhereisKate truthers were unconvinced.
A candid athleisure capture — while a classic of the celebrity paparazzi genre — can't contain this situation.
""The codes and conventions and norms of social media platforms just rub against that mainstream PR kind of mentality in ways that, as we've just seen, are very, very tricky to navigate,"" says Burgess.
On top of that, Prince Harry's memoir spilling the tea on royal family media backstabbing , six seasons of The Crown, Meghan and Harry's Oprah interview, and their six-part Netflix documentary have all reset public expectations and perceptions of The Firm.
""Over the past few years, people have started to really distrust not just the royal family (as an institution/bureaucracy, not necessarily the individual members) but the reporters and outlets that cover the royal family,"" said former royal correspondent Hall.
It's also hard to square the logic behind the social media strategy being used by the Prince and Princess of Wales to quiet online speculation.
How do you leverage the power of the internet at the same time that you want to be above the internet?
""Even with the younger generation of Royals … there is a kind of script in terms of how they expect their … official media releases to be treated by the press,"" says Burgess.
""[Putting] an obviously heavily photoshopped photograph out onto Twitter … as a high-profile person … I think it would inevitably attract … every conspiracy theory, every debate, every bit of polarisation.""
For an alternate case study, take a look at how the Duchess of Sussex recently soft-launched her new lifestyle brand, the triple-barrelled American Riviera Orchard: a 3x3 Instagram grid revealing the name and logo, comments off, and let the internet and media do the rest. A master class in brand teasing, no notes.
""[Harry and Meghan] are both clearly far better at engaging in what we call the platform vernaculars of Instagram,"" says Burgess.
""[Meghan's] focusing on 'what's the most Instagrammy way to do it?', rather than, 'how can I somehow use the audience of social media to do what the royal family's media people [want]?""
Can the Prince and Princess of Wales keep living in their internet castle in the sky, posting photogenic missives from above without fully contending — and engaging with — the dynamics of how the internet internets?
The narrative has escaped their grasp, and trust has been broken.
We're already seeing that another official photo taken by Catherine has been flagged for digital manipulation.
For an institution keenly aware that its relevance is reliant on public sentiment and media coverage, it's an existential question.",Unknown,Thu 21 Mar 2024,0

This is a Beyoncé album': Singer opens up about not feeling welcomed,"Beyoncé Knowles-Carter has taken to social media to unveil the cover art for her upcoming album Cowboy Carter, penning an accompanying caption that takes aim at her critics.
When in February, the recording artist released the country-inspired singles Texas Hold 'Em and 16 Carriages, while announcing there would be a new album on the way, the reaction was feverish, but mixed.
An Oklahoma radio station wouldn't play her singles 'til her fans revolted. And loyal listeners to other country-specific stations in the United States complained when her music was played.

The pop star announced her album via social media during this year's Super Bowl after featuring in an advertisement in which she tries to break the internet in various ways, including running for president, performing in space and remaking the Barbie movie as Barbey.
""OK, they ready. Drop the new music,"" is the ad's final line.
It's not the first time Beyoncé has experimented with genres – including country. Her album Act I: Renaissance has dance, disco and house tracks on it and 2016's Lemonade features a mash of genres including the country-inspired Daddy Lessons.
Move over Usher and Taylor Swift, Beyoncé's attempt to 'break the internet' was the big musical talking point of the Super Bowl.
Daddy Lessons was reportedly rejected by the Recording Academy's music committee when it was submitted for a Grammy in the country category.
The Country Music Association Awards also did not nominate the song.
""Today marks the 10-day countdown until the release of act ii,"" the entertainer wrote on Tuesday US time.
""Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all of the supporters of TEXAS HOLD 'EM and 16 CARRIAGES.
""I feel honored to be the first Black woman with the number one single on the Hot Country Songs chart.
""That would not have happened without the outpouring of support from each and every one of you.
Beyoncé, who hails from Houston, Texas, became the first black woman to top Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart after Texas Hold 'Em debuted at number one.
Beyoncé has held the number one spot on multiple Billboard charts including R&B, R&B/Hip Hop, Gospel, Latin, Dance/Electronic, Country and the Hot 100.
She's also won more Grammys than any other artist – at 32.

Journalists have pondered on country music's black roots and about how black artists often fail to be recognised in the genre.
It took three decades and a cover by a white man for Tracy Chapman to make history as the first black woman with a sole songwriting credit on a number 1 country hit. Luke Combs covered Fast Car 30 years after Chapman released it as the first single on her self-titled debut album.
""This album has been over five years in the making,"" Beyoncé wrote.
""It was born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed … and it was very clear that I wasn't.
""But, because of that experience, I did a deeper dive into the history of Country music and studied our rich musical archive.
""It feels good to see how music can unite so many people around the world, while also amplifying the voices of some of the people who have dedicated so much of their lives educating on our musical history.
""The criticisms I faced when I first entered this genre forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me. Act ii is a result of challenging myself, and taking my time to bend and blend genres together to create this body of work.""
Beyoncé has promised some exciting collaborations on the new album.

What: A 12-part series centred around an American trying to find their father in the Aussie outback.
Starring: Ben Feldman (Superstore), Stephen Curry (The Castle), Perry Mooney (Gold Diggers).
When: Population 11 is streaming now.
Where: Stan.
Likely to make you feel: Like you don't even know what disturbing mysteries might lie in your own backyard.
Seven years and one HBO documentary later, and Moriarty is still missing — with a 2022 coroner's report claiming he had been ""killed in the context of … the ongoing feud he had with his nearest neighbours"".
That outback mystery is the loose inspiration for Population 11, a new 12-part series on Stan that kicks off with US bank teller Andy (Ben Feldman) travelling to the tiny outback town of Bidgeegud.
He's there to find his estranged father (played by Darren Gilshenan), who was last seen giving dodgy UFO tours.
Filmed in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, Population 11 showcases the beauty of a part of the country only locals normally get to see.
Much of the tension in the show comes from the clash between Yank Andy and the eclectic collection of small-town locals. The first person Andy encounters in Bidgeegud is Sergeant Geraldine Walters (a delightfully crude Katrina Milosevic) who seems more interested in a date than doing any actual police work.
From there Andy runs afoul of almost all 11 of the town's inhabitants. From Audrey (Emily Taheny) — who runs the Chinese restaurant/bakery, slinging out Mongolian Roo and Sweet and Sour Dingo pies — to Leon (a hilarious Rick Donald) who… well it's not really clear what he provides the town, but he is certainly threatened by Andy's arrival.
The Bidgeegud locals are sometimes a little too friendly with Andy. (Supplied: Stan)
From episode one, Population 11 makes it clear that everyone in this town has a secret. It's up to Andy to figure out which secrets will lead him to his father and a suspiciously missing wad of cash.
But, aside from the potential murders and missing money, Population 11 follows in the time-honoured tradition of Australians messing with clueless Americans. And it didn't stop off camera.
""Ben came out and basically from day dot we wound him up,"" says Stephen Curry, who plays closed-off shopkeeper Noel.
""How else were we supposed to welcome him?"" says Perry Mooney (Gold Diggers). Her character Cassie blows into town and seems to be the only one that wants to help Andy.
""The first thing we tried? Drop bears. He hadn't heard about it, so he thought he was ahead of the game and we got to teach him he was way behind,"" Curry says with a laugh.

Ultimately, Curry says, Feldman did very well in the unfamiliar conditions of the Kimberley.
""It's an unknown quantity when you have someone come out from the States and you put them in this situation. It's not just bringing them to Sydney; it's bringing them into the outback.
While the series boasts some hefty comedy chops thanks to creator Phil Lloyd (The Moodys; At Home with Julia) and directors like Trent O'Donnell (Colin from Accounts; Hacks), Population 11 hides a disturbing mystery behind its eclectic characters.
For Feldman, who spent six years starring as Jonah in sitcom Superstore, the prospect of a dark drama masquerading as a wacky comedy was a dream come true.
""I've been on a silly comedy. I've been in a horror movie. I wanted something that was kind of all of those elements,"" he says.
Cassie (Perry Mooney) is determined to help Andy (Ben Feldman) but she's also hunting down a story of her own. (Supplied: Stan)
""When you read the script, it could be silly if directed and acted in the wrong hands. In the right hands it could be what I think it is: dark and uncomfortable and strange. You're not entirely sure if you're watching a comedy or a horror movie or drama.""
Darting from fish-out-of-water laughs in one moment to deadly threats the next, Population 11 walks a difficult and uniquely Australian tonal tightrope.
""I think Australia tonally is a little ahead of America in some departments,"" Feldman says.
""So, I think I got lucky and got ahead of the ball and ran over here to get it done before America figured out that that's a great way to make a TV show.""
To shoot the series' sun-baked outdoor scenes, the cast and crew relocated to Derby and the wider Kimberley region of Western Australia for four months.
""I had no reference for the outback of north-western Australia, and I came to find that no one else did either,"" Feldman says.
""I'm sitting here taking pictures and wondering why the cast and crew were all behind me taking pictures too. Like, isn't this normal for you?""

It was Mooney and Curry's first time in the region as well.
""It was stunning. I've never been out there before, genuinely,"" says Mooney. ""The sunsets over there are ridiculous. Like, anyone will tell you WA is wonderful, but you have to actually go and see it for yourself.""
Curry agrees: ""It's unbelievable. The glancing light of the West Australian sun is something that is effectively a character in this show.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-19/quiet-on-set-nickelodeon-dan-schneider-amanda-bynes-josh-peck/103586416,Disturbing rumours have followed Dan Schneider for years. Now people are speaking out,"If you were a kid or a tween in the late 90s and early 00s, chances are high that you watched a Nickelodeon production.
For more than 15 years, shows including The Amanda Show, Drake & Josh and iCarly dominated children's TV and significantly raised the star profile of their creator, Dan Schneider.
But, as shown in new documentary Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV, the upbeat shows hid a much more uncomfortable, and sometimes abusive, environment behind the scenes.
Originally entering the industry as an actor in network sitcoms including Head of the Class, Schneider moved into the world of children's television as a writer for Nickelodeon sketch show All That (kind of like Saturday Night Live for kids).

He then created a number of ratings juggernauts for Nickelodeon, including The Amanda Show in 1999, Drake & Josh in 2004, iCarly in 2007 and Victorious in 2010.
Schneider's shows launched the careers of then-baby Amanda Bynes, Ariana Grande and Kenan Thompson. In 2007, The New York Times called him the ""Norman Lear of children's television"".
But in 2018, Nickelodeon announced it was parting ways with Schneider and his production company following an internal investigation. Schneider then went on ""hiatus"" for three years.
While he was gone, and in the wake of #MeToo, the rumours of Schneider creating ""hostile work environments"" gained strength. Former stars of his shows publicly shared their experiences, and video compilations of inappropriate jokes written by Schneider for his young cast went viral on social media.
In 2021, The New York Times ran a profile on Schneider where he defended his practices and rejected claims he sexualised his young cast.
Much of the conflict detailed in Quiet on Set revolves around testimonies from former employees of Schneider.
In episode one, the documentary introduces two women writers: Christy Stratton and Jenny Kilgen.
The two women were both hired to write for The Amanda Show, but were told they would have to split a single salary. Kilgen said she was then threatened by Schneider when she reported the conditions to the writers guild.
Kilgen and Stratton say working on the show could be exciting, but then Schneider would show workers pornography, ask for massages or verbally belittle staff.
Kilgen also shares a story involving Stratton and ""the wrongest thing I've ever seen happen to a woman in a professional environment ever"".
They were in the writers' room working on scenes for a young girl, and Stratton was sharing a story about her own high school experience.
""Dan just said, 'Do you know what would be funny? If you leaned over the table and acted like you were getting sodomised and told that story,'"" Kilgen details.
Stratton originally refused to, but eventually did it after repeated pushing from Schneider.

""I just think about that poor girl and what she had to go through,"" says Stratton, reflecting on her younger self.
At the end of the first season Stratton was fired, but Kilgen returned. Four days into the second season Kilgen quit the show after Schneider accused her of being a sex worker while she was trying to pitch a sketch.
""It was so devastating, it was so hard … there was no way I was going to be the only woman in that world with him,"" Kilgen says.
She went on to sue the show's production company in 2000 for gender discrimination, a hostile work environment, and harassment, with a letter of support from Stratton. In response, Nickelodeon did an internal investigation.
""They settled, but it had a lasting impact on my career,"" Kilgen says.
""I knew this would be the end of my career so this had better be worth it; it better stop.""
Scheinder continued to work with Nickelodeon for another 18 years.
The series scrutinises more than just Schneider, but also the men who worked for him.
First we meet MJ, the mother of Brandi, who was a child extra on The Amanda Show. MJ says the production assistant Jason Handy emailed a sexual photo of himself to her 11-year-old daughter.
In 2003, Handy was arrested for ""lewd acts with children"", with the arrest press release asserting that he met some of those children on set. He was sentenced to six years in prison.
The documentary then introduces Brian Peck, a dialogue coach on multiple Nickelodeon shows, who had previously featured as ""Pickleboy"" in All That.
Multiple former child stars from All That recall the day they were told by network executives that Peck had been arrested on 11 charges of child sexual abuse, related to a child actor.
Until the release of Quiet on Set, the identity of the child actor involved in the case has remained a secret.
Then Drake & Josh's Drake Bell walks into the room.
Bell recounts the evolution of his and Peck's relationship — from going to his house after hours for tutoring, to being allowed to spend the night at Peck's in order to attend LA auditions. (Brian Peck has no relationship to Bell's co-star Josh Peck).
It was at one of these sleepovers, Bell says, that he woke up to Peck sexually assaulting him. He was 15 at the time.
""I froze. I was in shock. I didn't know what to do,"" Bell says.
Peck had already isolated Bell from his father and convinced his mother he was a safe person in Bell's life.
""Any time I had an audition, any time I needed to work on dialogue, I somehow always ended up at Brian's house. It just got worse and worse and worse. I was just trapped and I had no way out,"" Bell says.
Bell looks physically uncomfortable as he tries to find the words to describe his ordeal with Peck.
It was the mother of Bell's then-girlfriend who eventually became wary of Peck after she witnessed repeated phone calls from the adult to the child. This led to Bell sharing his secret, and then a police sting where Peck confessed.
Bell recounts that, on the day of Peck's sentencing, Peck's entire side of the courtroom was full of supporters.
Bell addressed his sentencing statement in the courtroom not to Peck but to those supporters.
""I said, 'You will forever have the memory of sitting in this courtroom and defending this person, and I will forever have the memory of the person you're defending violating me,'"" Bell details.
Business Insider uncovered 41 letters of support for Peck, including from actors such as James Marsden and Taran Killam. It's unclear if the people writing the letters knew the full extent of Peck's crimes.
In 2004, Peck pled no contest to two charges of child sexual abuse. He received a sentence of 16 months in jail and had to register as a sex offender.

By 2006, Peck was back working in children's TV, this time on Disney's The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.
There is a cloud that hangs over Bell's heart-wrenching confession.
In 2021, Bell pled guilty to charges of attempted child endangerment in relation to text messages he sent to a minor. He was sentenced to two years probation and 200 hours of community service.
""I took responsibility for that, did what was asked of me, but the media grabbed onto so much misinformation and it absolutely destroyed me and I started to spin out of control,"" Bell says.
""I was at rock bottom, so I checked in for treatment. I got to go through a lot of trauma therapy, a lot of grief therapy, and be surrounded by a lot of people who, for the first time in a long time, wanted to see me get better.""
There's numerous other instances in Quiet on Set of Schneider's former stars calling out what they saw while working for Nickelodeon.
But as adults, they are all calling for one thing: for it to never happen again.
""Most people financially reward these shows without knowing what happens behind the scenes,"" says former Zoey 101 star Alexa Nikolas, who dubbed Schneider ""the creator of childhood trauma"".
""It unfortunately takes the people who witnessed these things and experienced these things to speak up to really change it.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-19/comedy-festival-recommendations-mel-buttle-tom-gleeson/103582624,Here's who you should see at comedy festivals across Australia,"Mel Buttle was working as a high school teacher in Brisbane when she made it to the Raw Comedy national final in 2008.
She was 26, and representing Queensland in the annual competition for up-and-coming comedians held by the Melbourne International Comedy Festival (MICF).
Past Raw Comedy winners have gone on to become some of Australia's most lauded and beloved comedians, including Josh Thomas, Hannah Gadsby and Cassie Workman. In 2008, Buttle was up against acts including Luke McGregor and Laura Davis.
While Buttle did not win the competition, she did get to immerse herself in the comedy festival, seeing at least three comedy shows a night.
""It felt like Christmas. I had my first flat white and ate at Pellegrini's. I was completely swept up in the magic of the comedy festival,"" she says.
""I couldn't believe my eyes. It blew me away that little old me, a mere mortal, was in the same sushi shop as David O'Doherty.""
Now Buttle herself is one of Australia's most-loved and acclaimed comedians: She won the festival's directors' choice award in 2013, hosted The Great Australian Bake Off, is a regular on The Project and Question Everything, and has racked up millions of likes for her TikToks in character as suburban mum Lyn.
But she's still thrilled to be back among the vibe in Melbourne when she returns later this month with her new show Not Here to Put Socks on Centipedes (which will also head to Sydney Comedy Festival, Brisbane Comedy Festival, and more).
As we head further into comedy festival season across the country, we asked Buttle and some of Australia's other favourite comedians to tell us which emerging artists they have on their must-watch list this year.
""I really love Bronwyn Kuss. Whenever she's available I ask her to open for me. She is dry as a bone with a deadpan delivery that really allows her brilliant joke-writing to shine through. She has a joke about Tina Arena that makes me chuckle to myself on a weekly basis,"" Buttle says.

Mel Buttle: Not Here to Put Socks on Centipedes is at GC Laughs Festival, then will tour Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane comedy festivals, as well as Wagga Wagga, Sunshine Coast, Wollongong, Newcastle and Wyong.
Bronwyn Kuss: Pillows xxxx is at GC Laughs Festival, then will tour to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane comedy festivals.
""In terms of a lovely smorgasbord of new babies I feel professionally threatened by, MICF's Comedy Zone is always a sure thing,"" says Nicholson.
""I wouldn't reeeeeeeeally call him up-and-coming anymore, but Luka Muller always needs more attention. His show this year has a wonderfully bonkers conceit. He's a good boy.
""I'm very excited to see what the horrible women from Granny Bingo have come up with for their new full show.""

""I love being asked for recommendations because there are so many great up-and-coming comedians who deserve your attention and money!"" Oyama says.
""It's an incredible feeling to witness a new comedian's rise to fame, and an even better feeling when you get to smugly say, 'I saw them back in TEASER2024 when they performed in a venue that is used as a carpet storeroom for the other 11 months of the year.' (This is more common than you think and, to their credit, carpet rooms do make surprisingly good settings for comedy).
""Anyway, take a punt on any of these shows, they are well worth your while and many are in actual proper venues. I've put them into categories so you can choose your own adventure.""

""I've got one recommendation and that is Jenny Tian. I saw her at the Adelaide Fringe. I saw a lot of shows there, maybe 20 shows, and maybe another five shows at the Perth Fringe. It was my favourite out of all of them,"" Gleeson says.
""Jenny's fresh, she's young, so she was talking about stuff that I don't think about, which I like. She's very funny, obviously. She's got a good story to tell.
""She had just gotten into stand-up when the pandemic started, so she had to put her plans on hold for a couple of years and to pass the time she did TikTok and accidentally — or on purpose — became famous. So she's got this huge TikTok following.
""It was fascinating: When I saw her in Adelaide, the crowd was on board right from the top and everyone seemed to know her from TikTok; they already liked her personality. But the thing that I think makes her a cut above is that she's also a really good stand-up. She obviously really wants to be a good live performer, so she's put in the hours on stage.
""I'm not on TikTok and I understood the whole show. I really enjoyed it. So she's really good at including people. It's a show anyone can enjoy, even though it's kind of about her TikTok fame. I was really impressed.""

Jenny Tian: Chinese Australian: A Tale of Internet Fame is at Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney comedy festivals.
""I could write a thesis on this question, but I'll try to keep it brief! The comedy scene in Australia is so much bigger than what you see on TV. In reality, these comics are actually probably gigging so much more than us telly cucks because they're fully in the scene,"" Bracewell says.
""I'm a little biased, but there are some excellent acts coming from New Zealand; some are making their Melbourne festival debut.
""Lana Walters is hilarious, a new mum who is so relatable and has a knack for storytelling that I admire. Any new parents will be obsessed with her. David Correos (you may have seen him on Taskmaster NZ) is a master of chaos. If you want a show that you will be talking about for days afterwards, he's one to check out. Two Hearts are excellent if you like musical comedy; they have struck the balance between making actual pop bangers and being equally hilarious. Eli Matthewson won best show at the NZ International Comedy Festival. If you love slick, cleverly crafted stand-up from a seasoned pro, look no further than Eli.
""In terms of some locals I've been loving, Josh Jack is one of my best friends and I'm not friends with people who aren't funny. He's one of my favourite people to collaborate with, so if you like my jokes you will probably like him too! Dan Rath is one to watch. He's got the kind of jokes that you quote to your friends later. Such a strong writer. Hot Department will blow your mind. I won't elaborate more on that. I can't wait to see Ray Badran, he's been too busy in London so try to catch him while he's in town! His show title is If This Show Sells Out, I'll Perform the Last 10 Minutes Doing a Handstand, so there's an added bonus for ya.
""But, honestly, just go see anyone you've never heard of. It will, at best, be an amazing show, and, at worst, be cheap and bad and a fun anecdote to share with your friends.""

""I'm a huge fan of Sydney comic Harry Jun, who does a great job of bringing elements of Korean culture to his jokes and storytelling. His show is called Watermelon Licking — such a vivid title! — and refers to the Korean way of saying that you have only just scratched the surface,"" Wong says.
""One show I've heard good things about at Adelaide Fringe is Brown Women Comedy, and I'm looking forward to seeing this showcase at Trades Hall.

Selena Gomez opens up about her health battles and self-love journey,"American actor and singer Selena Gomez says she was initially ""terrified"" at the prospect of opening up about her mental health struggles.
""I went back and forth on whether I'd do it or not,"" Gomez said.
""And I think the moment I did that (open up) I felt this insane amount of release because there wasn't any hiding anymore.
""There wasn't just this image that people can see … I would say it's helped release a lot of anxiety.""
Speaking on stage at the SXSW (South by Southwest) festival in the US city of Austin, Texas, Gomez came to realise opening up was the right move for her because of the way in which it had helped others.
Gomez was on a panel exploring mindfulness over perfection and getting real about mental health in which panel members spoke about navigating negative self-talk and making the journey towards authenticity.

Referencing her 2022 documentary Selena Gomez: My Mind and Me in which she discusses her mental health and struggles with fame, Gomez said it made her ""sick"" to reflect on her negative self-talk back then.
""It bums me out,"" she said.
""But I think everybody can relate to that feeling.
""It's important to speak to yourself with kindness, but I don't think I really understood that.
""It's funny because all of the things I was bitching about then I'm grateful for now.""

She said self-acceptance was not something that could be forced and she had to find her own way when she was ready.
""I had to hit my rock bottom. I had to do it in my time. It took a couple of tries, but I'd like to think and hope that I'm in a much better place now,"" she said.

Gomez suffers from bipolar disorder and the autoimmune disease lupus.
In 2015, she took a break from her career to deal with anxiety and depression stemming from her lupus diagnosis.
Gomez also underwent a kidney transplant in 2017 – also a result of lupus.

Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that is unpredictable and commonly misunderstood. It is a complicated illness that affects different people in different ways. For some, it can be mild — for others, it can be life threatening.
A lupus patient's immune system attacks their body's normal cells, causing pain and inflammation in any part of the body, but mostly skin and joints.
Lupus overwhelmingly affects women. Nine in 10 patients are female. The majority develop the condition between the ages of 15 and 45.
There are several different types of lupus, the most common being:
The cause is unknown. Scientists believe there are several things that can trigger the formation of antibodies, including genetic, hormonal and environmental factors.
Symptoms can also be triggered by stress, exposure to sunlight, infections and some medicines.
Lupus can be hard to diagnose because its signs and symptoms often mimic those of other ailments.
There is no cure. But symptoms can be managed with medicine and a healthy lifestyle.
Common symptoms include:
Sixty per cent of people diagnosed with lupus will eventually develop lupus kidney disease, known as lupus nephritis.
Lupus nephritis is a serious and life-threatening complication that can affect as many as 60 per cent of all people with lupus and two-thirds of children with the disease.
Thirty per cent of patients fail to respond to lupus nephritis treatment.
Inflammation caused by lupus can also affect the brain and central nervous system, blood and blood vessels, lungs and the heart.
Lupus also puts you at greater risk of developing infections, cancer, bone-tissue collapse and pregnancy complications.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-17/damsel-millie-bobby-brown-the-gentlemen-what-to-watch-march/103592506,There's a glut of fresh content to stream right now. Here are the shows that are actually worth watching,"It's a very good month for the period-drama girlies, with two new offerings to voraciously consume.
Don't worry if ruffles, dragons and swordplay aren't your thing — there's something for everyone among our picks of the best new-to-streaming content this March.
Damsel | Official Trailer | Netflix
We meet Elodie Bayford (played by Netflix darling Millie Bobby Brown) in some nondescript medieval land as she is told she must marry a prince she's never met, to pull her titled but destitute family out of poverty.
The royal family Elodie is to marry into may appear perfect from the outside, but the increasingly discordant score — from none other than Hans Zimmer — suggests something is amiss in this kingdom guarded by stone dragons.
""There are many stories of chivalry where the heroic knight saves the damsel in distress. This is not one of them,"" Elodie declares in the film's opening scenes.
If that declaration feels a bit YA feminism to you, same. But rest assured, Damsel leans more towards the adult end of the period genre than, say, Enola Holmes — the last period piece helmed by Brown.
And Brown's somewhat grating theatre-kid energy dissipates after the first 30 minutes of this film, at which point this film stops trying to pretend it isn't dark fantasy and Elodie sheds any pretence of being a damsel-in-distress (shocker!), coming into her own as a young woman determined to save herself from the horrors of Aurea.
Prince Henry (right) isn't the hero in this story. (Netflix/John Wilson)
Brown makes perfect sense for the heroine in this subversion of the romantasy genre: To embody Elodie, she must snap in a manner reminiscent of the complete loss of control and inhibitions that was also required of her as Eleven in Stranger Things.
Brown's supporting cast comprises a shocking number of big names: Ray Winstone plays Elodie's father, Lord Bayford, while the one and only Angela Bassett is her stepmother, Lady Bayford. And Robin Wright commands attention as the cold Isabelle, queen regnant of Aurea.
That said, there's still a lot that's questionable about Damsel. There's barely a scene in which Brown isn't very clearly wearing a full face of Instagram-ready makeup, full lashes included. Many of the sets and CGI-heavy backdrops leave much to be desired. There is a nonsensical mix of British and American accents.
But that's because this is ultimately a hallmark feminist fantasy mockbuster. Suspend your disbelief and you'll enjoy it, YA vibes and all.
For fans of: The Princess Bride, Stardust, Kate and Leopold.
Mary & George | Official Trailer | Sky
This period piece bears little in common with Damsel beyond the fact they're both set hundreds of years in the past.
The irreverent Mary & George is perfect television. Not one ounce of the enjoyment you will feel watching it will be ironic.
This miniseries tells the story of Mary Beaumont (Julianne Moore), who is desperate to free herself of her provincial life in drab early 1600s England. Mary knows she has too much sharp wit and ambition to continue to suffer being locked inside the desolate house she shares with her physically abusive husband, Sir George Villiers.
Julianne Moore and Nicholas Galitzine star as a scheming mother and son duo who conquer Britain's royal court and seduce its king in this saucy historical psychodrama.
So, mere weeks after his untimely death, she remarries to maintain her status in society — but mostly to secure funds to send her beloved, gorgeous (and extremely mentally ill) second son George (Red, White & Royal Blue's Nicholas Galitzine), to France.
There, she expects him to come into his power by learning the rules of the aristocracy. This so happens to involve embracing the fluidity of his sexuality — this is a very sexy show.
Mary & George is a historical period drama, so there is some truth to it. Though we can't know the true extent of how much the real-life Mary's scheming had to do with it, we do know that the real-life George swiftly became one of the actual King James I's ""favourites"" shortly after returning from his sexy jaunt in France.
With this title came endless influence for the Villiers family.
Every single performance in Mary & George is impeccable, from Academy Award-winner Moore's to those of the unknown background character actors. The costume design is exquisite. The writing is fresh, and the liberties the plot takes with this historical story are moreishly salacious. 10/10.
For fans of: The Favourite, The Great, The Empress, Marie Antoinette.
The Gentlemen | A Guy Ritchie Series Official Trailer | Netflix
No, it isn't 2019. Yes, Guy Ritchie is really reusing the title of his five-year-old action comedy for this new spinoff.
Where the original movie followed Matthew McConaughey as an American expat to London who had amassed a fortune growing marijuana under the estates of the cash-poor British upper class, this limited series is told from a different perspective.
Edward Horniman (Theo James), the newly-named Duke of Halstead, is the protagonist of this adaptation. He hadn't expected to inherit his father's estate or title, having grown up believing he would be the spare to his hopeless elder brother Freddy's (Daniel Ings) heir.
It isn't a happy surprise.
We asked two experts to dish on the reasons it can sometimes take days, weeks or months until international films make it to our cinemas.
""The title has no practical value. The business is broken, there are holes in the roof, the government is greedy, the payroll is ugly, the staff are revolting and my brother is a coke-sniffing c**t,"" Edward laments — before realising things are about to get much, much worse.
Freddy owes a Scouse crime family eight million pounds. Edward's father was hiding the fact their estate is being used as one of the locations for the aforementioned weed empire.
Selling the property that's been in his family since the 1500s seems like the only way out to Edward. But Susie Glass (Kaya Scodelario), the de facto head of said empire, doesn't want that to happen.
Whatever is he to do?
James's performance of the sensible younger brother is smoothly delivered, while Ings is perfectly chaotic as the elder brother/posh tosser character (a role he has stepped into many times over the years). The beloved Scodelario, of Skins fame, doesn't quite manage to pull off the accent she's going for, but the quiet power her performances always thrum with makes up for this.
The Gentlemen isn't groundbreaking and it isn't trying to make any statements about the world beyond the idea that class inequality and the uneven distribution of wealth suck. Like the film of the same name, this is an action comedy, so expect blood and violence. And expect to laugh about it.
For fans of: Knives Out, You, Kingsman: The Secret Service.
The Regime | Official Trailer | Max
Somewhere in a deeply blue-green colour graded ""middle Europe"", Kate Winslet is the stuff of nightmares.
The Regime sees the Academy Award-winning actress transform into the chilling and immaculately coiffed corrupt leader of a crumbling authoritarian regime, with an accent reminiscent of Margaret Thatcher's.
She stalks through her stark palace, draped in superfluous red party banners, endless wood panelling and … white sheets.
Chancellor Elena Vernham hasn't left the decadent building for some time and during this period she's developed a fixation on black mould, which her staff scramble to mitigate instead of tackling the issue of their shrinking GDP and their dwindling grasp on power.
Our story starts when soldier Herbert Zuback (Matthias Schoenaerts) is brought to the palace to measure humidity levels a few strides ahead of his Chancellor and ensure no one touches her. Vernham specifically asked for one of ""The Butchers"" from Zuback's former unit, now infamous for shooting people protesting poor conditions at a cobalt mine, to carry out the job.
It isn't long before Zuback realises the opportunity for influence his new ludicrous position affords him over the increasingly unhinged Vernham.
The Regime starts off slow — there's a fair bit of world-building before the plot truly kicks in — but it's worth it. Winslet's considered embodiment of Vernham is deeply and darky funny. Schoenaerts is perfect as the dead-eyed, frankly terrifying soldier who becomes her unlikely source of Rasputin-reminiscent emotional support. With a jaunty score from movie music master Alexandre Desplat, complementary dark Accidentally Wes Anderson set and a smattering of Hugh Grant, The Regime isn't to be missed.
For fans of: Stasiland, 1984, Kleo, Veep, The Office.
Being in its 40th season, Dateline obviously isn't anything new but each episode is standalone so it may as well be.
This one takes us to Deir al Balah, in the central Gaza strip, and does exactly what its title promises, telling us the story of nine-year-old Elaf and her family. We are introduced to them at their makeshift home, surrounded by rubble and partially destroyed buildings as far as the eye can see.
The horrors of Gaza are almost unspeakable. As difficult as all this is to read and to watch, it's important the world does not look away.
Elaf is a fourth grader who was ""one of the best students"" at school when school was still running, and before her family was displaced from their nearby home in the Bureij refugee camp. She adores the two cats her family somehow manages to continue looking after despite everything they're going through.
This 27-minute documentary from Mohammed Sawwaf, Salah Al-Haw, Ibrahim Al-Otla, Ahmed Al-Shayah and Marwan Al-Sawwaf was filmed during a four-day truce amid the ongoing siege by Israel on Gaza following the attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, 2023. Which is to say, it's an especially hard watch.
When the four-day truce ends, the Israeli bombardment of Gaza resumes and they find themselves displaced once more.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-15/allegations-raised-against-queer-eye-jonathan-van-ness-fab-five/103580728,'How do I process this information?': What happens when a beloved celebrity falls from grace,"All is not well in the sparkly land of the popular Netflix program Queer Eye.
In case you missed it, a bombshell report from Rolling Stone magazine recently detailed allegations that the ensemble cast — known affectionately as the Fab Five — do not get along.
Perhaps most shocking were the strong allegations against the show's breakout star, Jonathan Van Ness.
You may be wondering what is so shocking about a group of minor celebrities paid to be friends having some disagreements. But it is shocking because it seems so at odds with their public personas.

Van Ness — the extroverted hairdresser known on the show for their joyful affirmations and mood-boosting catchphrases — was detailed in the exclusive story as anything but a joy to work with.
Several production sources told Rolling Stone that Van Ness was ""putting on a charade"" with their bubbly television persona. Words used to describe what they are like to work with included ""monster"", ""demeaning"" and ""a nightmare"".
It comes following last year's shock news that cast member Bobby Berk was leaving the show.
Beverley Wang, ABC's National Culture Correspondent and host of Stop Everything! pop culture podcast, said the allegations were disappointing to read as a fan of the show.
""That show is so many people's 'warm hug' show, and Jonathan in particular has been the breakout star,"" she says.
""They've come out as non-binary, and shared their HIV status as well ... As someone who is a fan of the show, we have so much affection for the Fab Five because of their authenticity and ability to share their personal stories.""
Which is what makes the allegations even harder for fans to process.
""I think there is this strong disappointment amongst fans … I was reading the article thinking 'How do I process this information and how does it make me feel about the show now?'"" Wang says.
The Rolling Stone exposé also touched on Berk's departure, alleging that he was reluctant to film with Van Ness and the cast's fashion consultant, Tan France.
Since the article was published Van Ness hasn't spoken publicly, with France the only one to address the story.
In response to an allegation in the story that France and the show's food and cooking expert, Antoni Porowski, campaigned for Berk to be replaced by their mutual friend, interior designer Jeremiah Brent, France posted a video on his Instagram stating;
Berk fired? Ouch.
This was the first time the public had heard the accusation that Berk didn't leave the show willingly, with Berk recently telling Vanity Fair that he decided not to sign a new contract for four more seasons due to new work commitments.
The current drama, especially that surrounding Van Ness, reflects a cautionary tale in popular culture we've learned in recent years. And that's just how hard the fall can be when joy and positivity are such a big part of someone's brand.
""Be kind to one another.""
This was the regular sign-off from Ellen DeGeneres to her audience at the end of every episode of her hit talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, for 19 seasons.
Although Ellen found huge success in a post-Oprah television landscape, her catchphrase referenced the fact that things had not always been easy for the comedian.

The show was cancelled a year later, and she has often spoken about the dark years following that time, adding to the narrative of her comeback story.
Because alongside her talk show's success, DeGeneres had also been heralded as a trailblazer for the LGBTQIA+ community: someone who has endured a tough time in the spotlight and had come out on top.
She had also often been associated with helping viewers in need, surprising them with large cheques and making sure joy and kindness were always at the forefront of what she and the show stood for.
That was until a Buzzfeed article came out in July 2020 that detailed a toxic workplace at the talk show, with allegations of racism, sexual harassment and intimidation.
Soon, many more stories of Ellen allegedly being difficult to work with came to the surface. One thread on Twitter (now X) requested ""the most insane stories you've heard about Ellen being mean"" and received more than 2,000 responses.
DeGeneres apologised in her opening monologue for the show's 18th season, but the talk show never fully recovered from the allegations and DeGeneres announced in May 2021 that it would be ending.
In the end, the contrast between her public and private persona seemed to be too stark for the audience to ignore.
Public figures like Ellen Degeneres and Jonathan Van Ness are examples of celebrities who have made kindness and authenticity the cornerstone of their public personas.
But, in recent years, the story about the nice celebrity being unveiled as quite the opposite behind the scenes has become a repeated tale.

Pop singer Lizzo — who has long advocated for body positivity and sung hits designed to empower her fans — was last year accused of creating a hostile work environment, weight-shaming and sexually denigrating behaviour in a lawsuit filed by three former dancers.
The allegations shocked many.
Lizzo denied the former dancers' claims, and late last year she asked the court to dismiss the case. That was rejected, but she has appealed the ruling — which has stalled proceedings for now.
But the allegations have potentially already soured Lizzo's glittery and positive public persona, with some fans saying they felt betrayed by the allegations.
Wang explains that it could be seen as a cautionary tale for other celebrities like her.
While we wait to hear from Van Ness themselves, the damage to the brand and persona they created via Queer Eye — one that was previously enthusiastically embraced by fans — may already be done.
As Wang says: ""When you set yourself up to be an altruistic figure in the world and that's your image, that's a really hard line to walk.
""No one can be that person all the time.""",Megan Macdonald,Fri 15 Mar 2024,0

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-10/oscars-lily-gladstone-killers-of-the-flower-moon-awards/103565726,An Oscars win for Lily Gladstone could be seen as an act of atonement,"At the Oscars in 1973, Best Actor winner Marlon Brando sent Sacheen Littlefeather to decline his award for The Godfather.
Littlefeather — who said her father was of White Mountain Apache and Yaqui descent, but her sisters disputed her claim of Native American ancestry after the actress died — said on stage that Brando would not accept the award because of ""the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry"".
The speech was met with derision and Littlefeather with scorn, both in the moment and subsequently, so much so that 49 years later, in 2022, a formal letter of apology was sent to Littlefeather by the Academy Awards.
""The abuse you endured because of this statement was unwarranted and unjustified,"" it read.
Detractors were said to have included actor John Wayne, who reportedly caused a commotion backstage in response to the speech.
Marlon Brando's Best Actor Oscar win for The Godfather | Sacheen Littlefeather
Hollywood has had a troubled history with Native American representation including casting non-Indigenous actors in Indigenous roles from Johnny Depp in Lone Ranger to Burt Lancaster in Apache.
When Lily Gladstone made history as the first Indigenous woman to win the award for Best Actress in a motion picture drama at the 2024 Golden Globes, she began her acceptance speech by introducing herself in Blackfeet language.
The actor's father is of Piegan Blackfeet and Nez Perce heritage and Gladstone spent her early childhood living on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana. Her mother is of European descent.
Hollywood royalty Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro team up with Lily Gladstone to bring to the big screen the true events that rocked the Osage Nation in 1920s Oklahoma.
Gladstone went on to say in English.
""I'm here with my mum, who, even though she's not Blackfeet, worked tirelessly to get our language into our classroom, so I had a Blackfeet language teacher growing up.""
The historic nature of the win wasn't lost on Gladstone.
""Thank you to all of you, and this is for every little res [reservation] kid, every little urban kid, every little Native kid out there who has a dream, who is seeing themselves represented and our stories told by ourselves in our own words, with tremendous allies and tremendous trust with and from each other.""
Gladstone won for her role as Osage woman Mollie Burkhart in the Martin Scorsese film Killers of the Flower Moon in which she stars opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons.

The story is centred on a series of mysterious deaths in Oklahoma in the 1920s when the Osage Nation was flush with oil money.
And while Killers of the Flower Moon has been nominated for 10 Oscars, it's mainly one that people are talking about – Gladstone's Best Actress nomination, the first for a Native American woman.
While Gladstone is the first from the US, there have been other Indigenous performers nominated for Best Actress – Keisha Castle-Hughes (Whale Rider) and Yalitza Aparicio (Roma).
Gladstone has already won Best Actress at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, making history as the first Indigenous performer to take out that gong.
Martin Scorsese returns with a devastating yet beautifully rendered film exposing America's shameful history of genocidal violence.
She's won numerous other awards, and while all eyes are on Gladstone for an Oscar, Emma Stone (Poor Things) could cause an upset.
Stone won at the BAFTAs and Critics Choice Awards, and also took out a Golden Globe (Best Female Actor – Motion Picture Musical/Comedy).
While weighing up close contenders for coveted awards at the Oscars, Flinders University film and screen specialist Nick Prescott believes the award belongs to Gladstone.
""Gladstone gave a luminous, powerful, mesmerising performance in Scorsese's film, which – despite its flaws of over-length and oddly unbalanced writing – managed to address some of the sins of Hollywood's past,"" Dr Prescott said.
""This should be the moment where the Academy tries not just to reward an extraordinary piece of acting, but to atone for one of its members' notoriously horrifying treatment of a Native American (yes, John Wayne, I'm talking about you, you despicable human).""
Killers of the Flower Moon has 10 Academy Award nominations. (Supplied: Apple TV+)
Associate lecturer in Creative Arts at Flinders Claire Whitley also has her money on Gladstone, but wonders if history will repeat itself.
""This is the tightest race,"" Dr Whitley said.
""Gladstone has won 35 of the precursor awards during this awards season, and Stone has won 25, which is an unusually tight margin.
""Ultimately, I hope the Academy gives it to Gladstone as hers was one of the best performances of last year, and it would be an historically significant win.
""However, the Academy is notoriously conservative, so Stone winning is a real option.""
Gladstone is starring in the upcoming Fancy Dance which will be available to stream on Apple TV+, along with Killers of the Flower Moon.
Fancy Dance is a Sundance Film Festival selection and marks the feature directorial debut for Erica Tremblay, who also co-wrote and produced the film.

The movie is about a Native American hustler who kidnaps her niece from the child's white grandparents, after her sister goes missing, in hopes of keeping what is left of their family intact.
""As a Native American filmmaker, seeing my community included in the rich tapestry of cinema is a dream come true,"" Tremblay said.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-09/role-models-in-the-media-needed-for-neurodiverse-teens/103535978,Teen with autism explains the difficulty of growing up without neurodiverse role models in the media,"Despite the ever-growing presence of pop culture in our daily routines, some young people say they have yet to see themselves in the media they consume.
In the close-knit community of Mount Barker in Western Australia's Great Southern, Macklyn Woollard has no shortage of people who care about him.
The 15-year-old animal lover and talented artist also lives with autism, which is a condition that can affect how a person thinks, feels, experiences their environment and interacts and communicates with people.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics found there were more than 200,000 people living with autism in Australia as of 2018, up 25 per cent from 2015.
But Macklyn said the country's large neurodiverse community was not being represented in the media.
""If there was better representation, then it would be better for the autistic community because they wouldn't be discriminated against by as many people,"" he said.
Michelle Woollard said seeing someone with autism on television would help her son understand he was not alone.

""If you haven't got somebody or something to look to, then it's harder in life,"" she said.
""Whereas if you've got somebody to look up to, and you know that they've gone through similar things as you, it helps.""
Despite his success as a musician, singer-songwriter Sheldon Riley faced many challenges as a young person with autism struggling with his sexuality.
Growing up in a religious mixed-race family, Mr Riley said he just wanted to fit in with everyone else.
""I wanted to be anyone else but myself,"" he said.
He has since become a role model for the neurodiverse community, representing Australia at Eurovision in 2022.
He also appeared on the popular America's Got Talent: Fantasy League reality TV show this year.
Sheldon Riley says he didn't have any role models like him to look up to when he was young.  (Supplied)
Mr Riley said having more neurodiverse people to look up to in his youth would have saved him a lot of heartache.
""I probably would have had a lot less to work on mentally, I would have probably had a lot less to worry about,"" he said.
""I would have loved to have had more representation … But I'm kind of glad that I get to be a part of this last generation of people that really get to see the beauty of how the world's changing now.""
Murdoch University associate lecturer in psychology Tundi Loftus works to support young people diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum.
Ms Loftus said neurodiverse teenagers aren't always looking for a mentor with autism, but rather someone who shares their interests.
""The people that they're idolising, or that they're looking up to as role models might be people that are interested in their particular sort of narrow interest,"" she said.

""For example, I've worked with kids who love Minecraft, and therefore, they're idolising someone who does Minecraft or works in that space.""
Ms Loftus said role models can be critical to inspiring young people to set and achieve their goals.
For more local stories and videos visit ABC Perth on Instagram.
""Being able to set goalposts and give yourself a parameter of something that you're aiming for can be really helpful, because seeing the other people who've done it before you is encouraging,"" she said.
In 2023, Screen Australia published research that analysed the prevalence of diverse characters in more than 350 scripted Australian TV dramas.
It found there was a higher disability representation in those shows compared to a 2016 survey — but the figure only sits at 6.6 per cent, which the organisation said was still critically low.
For Mr Riley, seeing families who are proud of their children's difference is very positive as his own family loved him but wanted him to change so he could be happy.
""I feel there is a very big difference between having a family that really understands and cares, and having a family that will do everything they can to change the situation, which also includes changing you,"" he said.
""It's really heart-warming to see families and parents who have these kids that they don't want to change, they want to celebrate every facet of them and just be so grateful for people out there that are representing for people who are not quite the same.""
Mr Riley says he wants to be a role model for young people.  (Supplied)
Sheldon knows he is helping other young people feel represented in way he didn't as a child.
""I get these messages and these emails from parents, and family members, and people that are just so proud of the of their kids, and they get to look up to someone like me,"" Sheldon said.
""And they're just so proud that they have someone that their kids can look up to.""

""Imagine this pain,"" she posted on Twitter in 2021, now X.
""I have been signed to a major label since 2014…and I have had albums on albums of music sat in folders collecting dust, songs I am now giving away to A list artists because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough to release an album.""
The British singer-songwriter appeared desperate when she posted a video message on Instagram Live alongside the tweets.
""I've absolutely reached my limit,"" she said, begging for her record label Polydor to either release her from her contract, or allow her to put out music.
Raye, whose real name is Rachel Agatha Keen, said she had been signed to a four-album deal, and despite ""working seven days a week"" and doing ""everything"" she said the label asked her to do, including switching from R&B to dance music, Polydor failed to greenlight a debut album from her.
Raye would part ways with the record company that year.

This week, she made history at Britain's biggest night in music when she won six Brit Awards – the most wins in a single year by any artist, beating the previous record of four, held by Harry Styles (2023), Adele (2016) and Blur (1995).
The Independent artist was also the first female to win the Songwriter of the Year award, an award that must have been validating given she has written songs for some big-name artists such as Beyoncé (Bigger from the album The Lion King: The Gift), John Legend (A Good Night), and David Guetta (Bed), which she featured on.
She said she was ""so honoured and blown away"" when the first trophy she won was for Songwriter of the Year.
""I will treasure this trophy very much,"" she said.
Raye has one double-platinum, five platinum, three gold and five silver singles to her name as a songwriter.
She's one of the most listened-to artists in the world, having amassed billions of streams of her music online.
She recently toured Australia, telling radio hosts while she was here that her biggest fanbase outside the UK was Down Under.
Raye's other Brit Award wins were for Artist of the Year,  Album of the Year (My 21st Century Blues),  Song of the Year (Escapism), Best New Artist,  and  Best R&B Act.
Raye's debut album, My 21st Century Blues is one of those rare releases that is both pop and deep.
Released in February last year, the album is largely co-written and produced by Raye, and explores topics such as addiction, sexual assault and body dysmorphia.
It's heavy.
And yet, so listenable.

With songs such as Oscar Winning Tears, Hard Out Here, Mary Jane and Flip A Switch, Raye announces herself as an artist with an edge and one with substance.
On Ice Cream Man, Raye sings about a catalogue of abuse including the sexual assault she's experienced at the hands of a music producer. She told the BBC that her drug addiction helped numb the trauma.
The song Escapism explores the moment she hit rock bottom. It was a smash hit globally and became the largest-selling single by a female British artist in 2023, earning Raye her first UK number one and landing on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in the US, where it's been certified Platinum.
In an industry that loves to put people in boxes, Raye has been compared to Amy Winehouse and Adele.
But embracing her own identity has been complex.
Born in South London to a Ghanaian-Swiss mother and English father, Raye spoke in the 2021 documentary Leigh-Anne: Race, Pop & Power about the pressures she felt to mask her identity.
Raye felt she had to ""suppress"" her black roots.  (Supplied: Callum Walker Hutchinson)
""And I've been hiding it subconsciously.
""When people look me up now and look up my songs now, I make dance music.
""But when I signed my record deal, I was an R&B artist, I used to make beats, I used to sing four-part harmonies, I grew up in church.
""I was so, so connected to my black culture and my heritage, and I was so excited to put music out and I was told 'no, this isn't going to work. There's no place for it. It won't work. You can't do that. You have to embrace the white in you. Suppress the black in you.' That's how I felt.""
Raye has stepped into a new era in which she's in charge of the direction she wants to take her career. (Supplied: Callum Walker Hutchinson)
With the success of My 21st Century Blues and industry recognition, Raye has proven authenticity speaks volumes. And it also pays to respect your audience enough to know that they can tell when you're not being yourself anyway.

""We are deeply saddened to inform you that manga creator Akira Toriyama passed away on March 1st due to acute subdural hematoma,"" said a statement posted on the official X account of the Dragon Ball franchise.
""It's our deep regret that he still had several works in the middle of creation with great enthusiasm,"" the statement attributed to Toriyama's Bird Studio said.
""He would have many more things to achieve. However, he has left many manga titles and works of art to this world.
""We hope that Akira Toriyama's unique world of creation continues to be loved by everyone for a long time to come.""
The statement said they were yet to decide if there would be a commemorative gathering for the creator.
Dragon Ball is one of the best-selling and most influential manga titles of all time.
The Dragon Ball franchise began in 1984.
It was first serialised in 1984 and has spawned countless anime series, films and video games.
It features a boy named Son Goku who fights increasingly powerful enemies and collects magical balls that can summon a dragon to help protect the Earth.
Publishing house Shueisha said in a statement that it was ""greatly saddened by the sudden news of his death"".
Eiichiro Oda, creator of Japan's major One Piece manga franchise, said in a statement that Toriyama's death was ""too soon"" and left ""too big shoes to fill"".
""To think I'll never see him again… I'm overwhelmed by sadness,"" Oda said.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-07/rebecca-f-kuang-on-the-success-of-yellowface/103543268,Yellowface has been flying off shelves and its author has a theory on why,"Growing up in Dallas, Texas, Rebecca F Kuang ""wrote and read voraciously"".
""I was reaching for anything in sight that had written words on it,"" Kuang told ABC News.
When she was younger, Kuang would beg her mother to take her to the public library.
""We would fight over how many fiction books I was allowed to bring home because she only wanted me to be reading science textbooks,"" she said.
""And I was reading classics as early as I could comprehend them. And I was writing fan fiction, or versions of a diary or short stories.
""I was just always doing it and my parents really encouraged that.""
The author of Yellowface, one of the biggest novels of 2023, discusses impostor syndrome and her thoughts on reading reviews.
Kuang never thought writing could become a full-time profession though.
""I think in a lot of immigrant households, you're really encouraged to pursue careers with financial security and my parents very responsibly wanted me to become a doctor or lawyer or a diplomat or something stable.
Kuang says her first novel happened almost by accident when she was living in Beijing on a gap year.
""In my spare time, I started writing The Poppy War, which is my debut novel.
""And then I finished it, and I thought, 'Oh, my goodness, what should I do with this? Maybe I'll try sending it to a literary agent and see what happens.'
""And one thing led to another, I found an agent, and she found an editor and the book came out and people liked it.
""And I think at that point, my parents said, 'OK, fine, you can give this writing thing a try, it seems like it's working out for you.' And things have just kind of snowballed from there.""
Kuang was included in a list of rising leaders by Time Magazine. (Supplied: John Packman)
Fast forward to 2023 and Kuang was named on the TIME100 Next list, which recognises rising leaders in a variety of fields including business and the arts.
""It was just such a huge honour I wasn't expecting at all,"" Kuang said.
Kuang's fifth novel, Yellowface, has an enticing set-up that takes you on quite the ride: ""Athena Liu is a literary darling and June Hayward is literally nobody. When Athena dies in a freak accident, June steals her unpublished manuscript and publishes it as her own… What happens next is entirely everyone else's fault.""
Yellowface is a hit with readers. (Supplied: HarperCollins Publishers Australia)
Kuang wrote the bestseller during the pandemic. She says part of why she thinks Yellowface is so successful is that people love to get a glimpse into a world that fascinates them that they might not necessarily have access to.
""I think we all love behind-the-scenes stories,"" Kuang said.
""Certainly, I do. And any novel or film that gives you a closer look into an industry that most of us don't have personal experience with — [I'm] thinking of shows like The Bear and Succession, even that ridiculous publishing drama Younger that I was watching while I was in the pandemic — you think anything that shows how the sausage is made is just already very cool.
""And I think there's a lot of curiosity about how the publishing industry operates because so much of how it works runs contrary to what readers expect.
But Kuang says people are mistaken when they refer to Yellowface as a satirical novel.
""Well, aside from the opening incident, which has never happened to me, I don't know any authors who [have] actually stolen a manuscript while a body was still warm.
""Most of the other encounters in Yellowface are pulled either directly from personal experience or from stories I've been told about other people's personal experiences.
""It's always kind of funny to me when people call the story absurdist or satirical, because to be satire, you really have to dramatise or exaggerate the traits that you're poking fun of.
""But Yellowface is quite realistic, actually, in a lot of the depictions of how executives speak to authors, how authors speak to each other.
""I think that kind of nasty and embittered and paranoid energy in the room that you sense during so many of June's encounters with other people in the industry, that's something that's very real and to me did not have to be exaggerated at all.""

Kuang will visit Australia for the first time for the All About Women festival.
""It's such a tremendous honour that the first time I step foot in Sydney, I'll be there to speak at the Sydney Opera House,"" she said.
""Something that I think gets overlooked a lot in conversations about Yellowface, since it is so very explicitly about the publishing industry … but something we don't talk about as much is the gender dynamic and the aspect of female friendship between June and Athena.
""And it's something I've been fascinated in for a long time … it's a theme that I've always loved reading about and have written now, quite explicitly about.
""So, I hope I get to talk about that.""

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the ad in January after receiving two complaints that claimed the image objectified women and was ""offensive and irresponsible"".
The ad showed FKA twigs, whose real name is Tahliah Barnett, wearing a shirt halfway around her body.
The watchdog agreed with the complaints and said the ad ""used nudity and centred on FKA twigs's physical features rather than the clothing"" to present her as a ""stereotypical sexual object"".
Barnett accused the ASA of ""double standards"" given ""other campaigns past and current of this nature"".
She said she did not see herself as a ""stereotypical sexual object"" as the ASA described, but rather ""a beautiful strong woman of colour whose incredible body has overcome more pain than you can imagine"".
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
The two complaints about the ad also took issue with a Calvin Klein ad featuring model Kendall Jenner, but the ASA rejected the claim that the Jenner ad was offensive.
In a statement, the ASA said it had reversed its decision on the ad featuring Barnett, but it would remain banned from places where it might be seen by children.
The watchdog said public criticism was important, but it was not the reason it revisited its ruling.
""That reason was our unease about the wording in the ruling explaining our rationale for our decision that FKA twigs had been objectified. We thought it was inconsistent in its treatment of the three posters and was therefore flawed,"" it said.
The ASA said it was prepared to challenge its own decisions ""if we think we've got it wrong"".
It maintained that the FKA twigs ad was ""overtly sexual"", describing it as ""materially different to the mildly sexual and sexually suggestive, but not overtly sexual, images of Kendall Jenner"".
The UK's Advertising Standards Authority rules that the 2023 ad campaign presented musician FKA Twigs as a ""stereotypical sexual object"".
The ASA also denied accusations that the race or identity of the two women informed its rulings on their ads.
The authority also defended accusations of double standards around Calvin Klein advertisements featuring Jeremy Allen White, which showed the actor in his underwear and pulling down his pants.
""The challenge was that if FKA twigs was objectified then surely Jeremy Allen White was too? We didn't receive any complaints about the Jeremy Allen White ads that we could pursue, because the complaints appeared to be based on media coverage or ads appearing outside the UK. So we haven't formally investigated the ads,"" the ASA said.
In her initial statement about the banning of her ad, Barnett thanked her collaborators and said she had been given ""space to express myself exactly how I wanted to — I will not have my narrative changed"".
She is yet to publicly comment on the ASA partially overturning its ban.",Tom Williams,Wed 6 Mar 2024,0

The Princess of Wales appears to have been photographed for the first time in two months — but people on the internet are still convinced Kate Middleton is ""missing"".
Before this latest unconfirmed sighting, the princess was last seen in public on December 25, 2023.
It is no matter, to the extremely online, that Kensington Palace said Kate was ""doing well"" after undergoing a planned abdominal surgery (for a reportedly non-cancerous condition) on January 16, 2024, and recovering at home.
""Based on the current medical advice, she is unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter,"" Kensington Palace said in a statement at the time.
""The Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate. She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible; and her wish that her personal medical information remains private.
""Kensington Palace will, therefore, only provide updates on Her Royal Highness' progress when there is significant new information to share.""
Jokes about Princess Kate's whereabouts are everywhere online, running the absurd gamut from ""Kate has been missing because she's recovering from a Brazilian butt lift (BBL)"" to ""Kate has been missing because she's growing out bangs.""
Then there are the more sinister conspiracy theories. Is Kate is missing because she and Prince William are living separately or divorcing? (""Quite the reach."") Is Kate in a coma, or dead? (""Wild speculation."")
Yaz: Bear with me while we take you deep.
Hours after Kensington Palace's statement on Kate was released, Buckingham Palace released a statement of its own, announcing King Charles III would be taking a few days off his public duties to have a minor operation to fix an enlarged prostate.
In the weeks since, Charles has been doing anything but laying low at home like his daughter-in-law Kate. He's gone up to Norfolk to spend time at Sandringham House. He's met with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. And he's been very open about the public response to his cancer diagnosis, revealing the cards and messages he has received have ""reduced [him] to tears most of the time"".
Abbir: This is happening because everyone just expects to know what the royals are doing all the time.
Yaz: Exact. And people have been paying attention to the fact that Charles's wife, Queen Camilla, has spoken of his recovery too.
Plus Dance Monkey is back to break more records, Australia goes crazy over surprise Fred Again and is Margot Robbie investing in faerie smut?
While William was pictured leaving the hospital after a visit to see his wife there in January, he didn't speak to media.
And while we had this joint statement from the Prince and Princess of Wales thanking Kate's medical team on January 29, it wasn't until February 8 that Prince William himself commented on his wife's surgery.
And while William postponed several public engagements in January — presumably in anticipation of supporting Kate through her recovery — he did not withdraw from a February 27 memorial service for his godfather, King Constantine of Greece, until an hour before the event was due to start.
The reason? A ""personal matter.""
Abbir: Everyone was already going nuts about what Kate's absence could potentially mean about her health, and this added fuel to the depths of Reddit conspiracy theories. So last minute! So unlike him! Something felt awry. Also, what is a ""personal matter""? The palace didn't explicitly say it was because of Kate's health.
Yaz: Anyway, two days after THAT (told you we were going to have to take you deep), a Kensington Palace spokesperson reportedly reiterated: ""We were very clear from the outset that the Princess of Wales was out until after Easter and Kensington Palace would only be providing updates when something was significant."" But the internet DGAF about that (frankly spicy) statement.
The internet also DGAF about the fact that Kate was reportedly pictured for the first time since December with her mother Carole in a vehicle driving near Windsor Castle on March 4 (local time).
And that is because the internet is absurd and loves making and disseminating nonsensical jokes more than anything else.
Except, perhaps, making and disseminating nonsensical jokes about people in immense positions of power such as, hmmm IDK, a future queen like Kate. How else could we possibly spend our time on this earth?
Our societal fascination with the royals is also long and well-documented, and the #WhereIsKate stuff seems like just another manifestation of that fascination. (Whether or not the royals' publicly funded lives entitle us to know everything about them is another issue, and one on which my opinion has no bearing).
Abbir: The grainy photo allegedly of her in the car from March 4 only spurs the rest of the internet on.
Then, the day after she was allegedly papped the British army jumped the gun and announced Kate would attend a ceremony in June to ""inspect the troops"". Only the UK government didn't ask the palace for confirmation, apparently just assuming she would do it as she is the Honorary Colonel of the Irish Guards. Perhaps someone saw the car photo and thought Kate would be cool with it? Brave assumption. Awkward results.
I'm also deep into reading long-winded conspiracy theories from randoms online about Kate's absence signalling marital problems. Which leads us to my favourite meme to come out of this, where Pete Davidson steps up his already impressive dating history:
Yaz: My favourite absurd, clearly joke theory is the ""Kate Middleton has been spotted at the Willy Wonka experience"" in Glasgow one:
Or the ""Kate is heading into Celebrity Big Brother"". I just feel like that's something we need, as a people:

Or…
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
OK, yeah, I can't pick a favourite.
Abbir: So, where to from here?
This story has entered ""give me updates every hour"" territory. I've joined all the subreddits, I've turned on X notifications from Pop Crave and I'm ready to hear from the woman herself. I'm also ready to see a less suspicious blurry photo of her. Or maybe we all need to touch some grass.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-05/yours-queerly-courtney-act-shane-jenek-alex-leon/103541494,How Celebrity Big Brother UK landed Courtney Act a reputation — and a lifelong friendship,"In February 2018, Australia's biggest drag export Courtney Act (aka Shane Jenek) was everywhere, making headlines in the wake of her Celebrity Big Brother UK win.
Shane's desire and ability to use his voice on the reality TV show for social good earned him an invitation to speak at an event at Australia House in London.
The man who booked him to appear that night was Alex Leon, an LGBTQIA+ advocate and fellow expat who'd also left home at a young age in search of community.
That chance meeting has turned into a years-long friendship that knows no bounds — certainly not geography or time zones, now that Shane has moved back to Australia and Alex has made a home for himself in Portugal.
The pair are the latest to share the story of their relationship on Fran Kelly's podcast, Yours Queerly, in which two prominent guests are interviewed alongside each other on their connection to the LGBTQIA+ community, and to each other.
Alex: You'd just won Celebrity Big Brother. You were hot off the press, on the lips of everyone. And we got you into the room, and I was kind of your… what do they call it when you're looking after someone?
Shane: Animal minder!
Hear the full conversation in Fran Kelly's Yours Queerly podcast on ABC listen.
Alex: That wasn't what I was thinking of! But anyway, I was moving you through the room. It's funny looking back on that night and thinking, ""When was the point that I thought we were going to be friends?"" I do think it was an instant connection. What about you?
Shane: Yeah, I think so. I'd just been dropped off and was looking for the person who was going to be looking after me, which was you. And I remember seeing your face and being like, ""Ahhh, there's the person that I'm meant to find."" And then I heard your Australian accent and we just had an instant connection, it was a really lovely interaction. Then we ended up at a restaurant later that night with a group of people.
Alex: I remember us talking about a lot of Australian things and feeling like everyone else in the room had absolutely no understanding of what we were talking about. At that point, I'd been in London for a few years. I was really missing home.
And meeting a queer Australian person on the other side of the world and hitting it off like that doesn't happen very often. It felt really precious.
After that night I was like, yeah, I'm gonna slide in the DMs, I'm gonna see what happens. And look where we are now! Doing a podcast about our friendship. So it all worked out. Slide into the DMs, folks. Slide into the DMs, even if it's platonic.
Shane and Alex quickly realised they clicked on every conceivable friendship level. (Supplied)
Shane: Alex and I probably were getting a similar thing from the early days of our friendship where we were like, ""Oh, here's someone who is from the same place as me.""
When we met I instantly knew we loved to get deep together, and I wondered whether we would also like to get wild and loose in the same ways. Then one New Year's Eve a few years ago we went out together for the first time … I remember locking ourselves in a toilet cubicle and just being, like, ""I love you"", ""No I love you!""
That was when I realised we click on all levels, whether we're spending a week together in Lisbon like we did last summer, going to a Sam Smith concert together, going on a hike to a beautiful place, or going to some dark, dingy club somewhere in the world.
Thomas Parer knows he probably could have found his queer chosen family much faster and easier if he'd moved to a bigger city.
Shane: Alex is very smart and switched on and has always been someone whose judgement and understanding of the world I've really valued and trusted.
I love to message Alex and be like, ""Hey, what are your thoughts on this?"" Because I know he'll always have a thoughtful and considered approach to deep topics. There's something really helpful about having someone who has a different lived experience and also works in an activist space to bring a different point of view.
But it can be anything. I've recently started dating again, and it's fun having that friend that you share those details with and keep abreast of, and be like, ""Oh, I went on another date with this person, and this was weird.""
I've got some really juicy dating updates for Alex at the moment, actually…
Alex: It's actually really good. A few years ago I broke up with an ex-boyfriend and I went round to Shane's after I had mass-deleted every single photo and video of this person from my life.
And you very gently steered the conversation towards getting me to consider whether actually, in a few years time, I might want to look back on these memories and contemplate what I learned during that period.
One of the reasons I'm so grateful for that is because me and this ex-boyfriend are really close friends now. Had it not been for Shane, I think I would have approached the [rekindling of] that relationship completely differently. I'm not sure that I would have that friend.
I come to you when I'm going through really challenging things. You are top of my list because you often have quite a lot to say, and often you come from a perspective I'm not necessarily considering, so I have a lot of gratitude for that.
What happens when journalist Narelda Jacobs and drag performer Kween Kong meet? They discuss sexuality, gender, religious upbringings and the art of swagger.
Shane: I have this app on my phone and Alex is the only person I use it for. We send each other extremely long voice notes that are more akin to podcasts. And I love that because when something's going on, we'll record a voice note that might go for 12 minutes and it's a life update. And I know that if I send something to Alex, he might not reply right away. But sometime that week when he's got time in his schedule, he'll reply.
Although, just recently we got into this moment where there were so many things we were talking about at once that every time we were communicating back and forth it required an hour to sit down, to listen, to process and reply.
Alex: I loved every moment!
Shane: I loved every moment, too. But it's one of those things of living in different time zones that you have to work out how to communicate.
Alex: I think it's just about being intentional. And I think Shane and I do a really good job of being really intentional in our communications, of making sure that we make the time to update each other on what's going on in our life, and also to share in the good and the bad.
I will text Shane after a successful night out where I've kissed a ton of boys and I'm really feeling good and I'm loving myself. And then I will voice note Shane when I'm feeling crap, I need some advice or a listening ear. I think we're really good at making sure we carve out the time to water the seed of the friendship.
Shane has returned home to Australia and Alex is living in Portugal, but they still make their friendship work. (Supplied)
Alex: I really distinctly remember the first time that I met Shane as Courtney, because it was quite far into our friendship, and I don't know why that was. I guess I just hadn't been to a performance … Anyway, I was flabbergasted by it. Even though I knew that Courtney existed and I'd seen Courtney on TV and all that kind of stuff, I had not yet married the kind of idea of Shane with Courtney.
And I remember feeling, I wouldn't say I was starstruck, but quite taken aback. I was with some other friends of mine, and when I saw Courtney from afar I was like, ""That's Courtney Act!""
And as I walked towards you, I was like, ""Hey"", and you were like, ""Hey!"" And you were just you.
One of the things about having a friend who's famous is that when I talk about you, people want to know: ""What's Courtney like?""
And I always find that to be such a strange question because Courtney at her core is just you. She's just an even more attractive, even more beautiful, even more glamorous version of you.
Full episode Australian Story's Caught in the Act
It's not every day you hear of a romance involving jorts.
Alex: Do I have a preference? [Laughs] … I think Shane to me feels like the more accessible version of you. Courtney is like a good time gal, you know what I mean? Shane is a good time gal too, but also I think I might find it more challenging to have a sensitive conversation with Courtney. Although I feel like we have done that?
Shane: I guess it's because if I'm Courtney, I'm usually going to work, and if I'm going to work, then there's going to be an element of social interaction. I'm not just sitting at home and Alex comes over and I happen to be Courtney.
But we could have the same conversations regardless of how I'm dressed. If someone was going to the gym, they'd be in activewear. If they're going to work, they might be in a suit, but they're still the same person.

The 21-year-old three-time Grammy award winner said she has set up a new charity called Fund 4 Good, aimed at supporting reproductive rights.
""The Fund 4 Good works to support all women, girls and people seeking reproductive health freedom,"" Rodrigo said, in a video posted to TikTok.
""The fund will directly support community-based non-profits such as things like girls' education, support reproductive rights and prevent gender-based violence.
""A portion of all of the proceeds from ticket sales from the Guts World Tour will go to the Fund 4 Good, which I'm very excited about.
""And for the North American leg of the Guts World Tour, I'll be partnering with the National Network of Abortion Funds [NNAF] to help those impacted by health care barriers and getting the reproductive care they deserve.""
Rodrigo wrapped up the video by saying thanks to her fans — referred to as Livies.
""Thank you so much for supporting this cause that I care so deeply about,"" she said.
""I can't wait to see you all on tour.""
It isn't the first time Rodrigo has spoken up on abortion. (Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)
Rodrigo is currently in Texas — a central battleground when it comes to abortion rights in the United States.
The pop star, whose hits include Drivers License, Vampire and Can't Catch Me Now from The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, has previously spoken out about reproductive rights.
Rodrigo notably took a stand against the US Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe versus Wade when in 2022 she dedicated a duet of Lily Allen's F*** You to the US Supreme Court justices behind the decision when she performed alongside Allen in Glastonbury.
""I'm devastated and terrified that so many women and so many girls are going to die because of this,"" she said at the time.
When a hospital patient wandered into a US fertility clinic in 2020, they caused a chain of events that led to a major court ruling this week. It's left the IVF sector reeling, and patients in limbo.
More recently, an Alabama Supreme Court ruling over frozen embryos has prompted questions about whether IVF could become the next battleground in America over reproductive rights.
NNAF executive director Oriaku Njoku said the funds would provide direct assistance to people seeking abortions across America.
NNAF had 100 member organisations who would share in the funding, with local groups on the ground at the Guts tour ""sharing information about legislation currently affecting local communities, how abortion funds work, how to get support for accessing abortions, and how to support abortion access for all"", she said.
The right to an abortion in the United States comes from a landmark court decision made in the 1970s, known as the Roe v Wade case.
The NNAF said abortion was now banned or restricted in more than 21 states across America, meaning people had to travel longer distances to access procedures ""causing physical, psychological, and financial harm"".
Rodrigo is not the only star to support the cause.
Singer Demi Lovato announced a new single Swine in June last year and with it said she would be making a $US5,000 donation to NNAF, plus a proceed of sales.
Lizzo pledged $US500,000 from her 2022 tour to abortion access when Roe v Wade was overturned, a figure she said was matched by Live Nation.",MBy Mawunyo Gbogbo,Thu 29 Feb 2024,0

By episode two, Tola's innocence, charm and wry sense of humour leaves its mark.
""I know you're talking about me,"" she says in that episode.
""I'm 10. I get subtext now.""
Iwájú is both uniquely African, and yet universal in its appeal.
""I think that all good stories have some kind of universal theme,"" director Olufikayo ""Ziki"" Adeola told the ABC.
""Because at the end of the day, they speak to the deeper humanity that unites every human being on this earth.
The issue of class is explored through characters such as Tola, who lives on an island with her wealthy father, but is itching to explore the more modest mainland.
Tola carries with her a sense of joy and wonder. (Supplied: Disney+)
""One of the things that intrigued me the most are the social cultural and social political dynamics in Lagos, where you have these two land masses, the mainland, where most of the working class and less wealthy people live. And then you have the island in Lagos today, where most of the wealthier people live,"" Adeola said.
""I always felt that, given this particular dynamic and context, it was going to lead to a very interesting future where there was a story to be told.""
The word Iwájú is part of a phrase in the Yoruba language which essentially means future, and this imagined future involves flying luxury cars that can get ahead of the traffic.
Every intricate detail has been thought of – from the sandals that adorn the feet of Tola's best friend Kole to the woven baskets filled with colourful fruit at the market – Iwájú is beautiful to look at and the story draws you in.
""It was very important to me that anyone who has been to Lagos or has lived in Lagos, even though this is a futuristic sci-fi story, anyone who knows Lagos would be able to watch this and recognise their Lagos in the story,"" Adeola said.
""And so that's why we really pushed for that authenticity, but then also to the combine that with a sense of escapism, because at the end of the day, this isn't a documentary. We want people to watch this and have fun.""
Behind the scenes is also a captivating story.
In 2019, it came to Disney's attention that a young and innovative Pan-African collective called Kugali Media was determined to ""kick Disney's arse in Africa"" by sharing African stories with the world.
Iwájú's creators were determined to present an authentic Nigeria with futuristic elements. (Supplied: Disney+)
Those words and sentiment came from production designer Hamid Ibrahim.
""The reason I said that quote – kick Disney's arse – a lot of people think I was joking when I said that, but I meant it,"" Ibrahim told the ABC.
""And that's because Africa has a vast array of stories. Like, one of the most diverse cultures in the world, right? Because of the different countries in Africa.
""I picked Disney because Disney was a big boy in the space. If they were not going to tap into those stories, inevitably, at some point, we're going to kick their you know what.""
Disney got in touch and an unprecedented partnership was formed.
""Disney Animation has never collaborated in this way with an outside company in its one hundred years of filmmaking,"" said Clark Spencer, president of Walt Disney Animation Studios.
""And so this was absolutely groundbreaking.""
Ibrahim points out there are still many stories to be told from the vast continent.
""Disney took that bold, first step that showed people it can be done,"" he said.
""Because a lot of people had doubts. Oh, maybe the internet… are they going to get smuggled… but Disney has shown people that Africa can do these stories, all we need is some backing and trust from the rest of the world to receive us, and we can give them these amazing stories.""
Iwájú is part of a phrase in the Yoruba language. Ojó iwájú means ""the day ahead"" or basically the future. (Supplied: Disney+)
When it came to Iwájú, authenticity was key and find that right balance fell to cultural consultant Toluwalakin ""Tolu"" Olowofoyeku.
""We had a fashion designer from Lagos to design the clothes,"" Olowofoyeku said.
""A lot of the artists that designed the characters and their costumes are African, some are Nigerian.
""We had a Nigerian artist design the vehicles, so we just put a lot of effort into making, even when it's futuristic, making it feel like you could actually see this in Lagos.""
Having a fresh eye looking over the project was also critical.
""So I come from Uganda [where] things a little bit more calmer,"" Ibrahim said.
""So, when Tolu would describe some things in Lagos, I would think he's exaggerating it a little bit.
""But when I got to see them there by myself, it gives you a three-point perspective, because I've lived in London for a bit, so I can see the difference between Lagos and the West, let's say.
""And then I can see the difference between Lagos specifically and Uganda, which are two different African places.
""And that's what allows me to drill into the actual things that make Lagos very unique. Whereas if I lived there, some of the things seem normal or you'll think maybe this is all of Africa. But there's some things which are very uniquely Lagos.""
He cited for example seeing a tall, beautiful building right next to a goat farm.
""One of the biggest things is there is an audacity inside Lagos itself,"" Ibrahim said.
""And that spirit of audacity, we had to capture in every single aspect.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-28/avatar-the-last-airbender-review-netflix-adaptation/103513380,This is what happens when you shove Avatar: The Last Airbender into the Netflix machine,"In Hollywood's long history of ill-conceived adaptations, few are as reviled as M. Night Shyamalan's 2010 live-action remake of Avatar: The Last Airbender.
What: A young boy sets out to master the four classical elements and defeat the war-mongering Fire Nation.
Starring: Gordon Cormier, Kiawentiio, Ian Ousley, Dallas James Liu and Daniel Dae Kim.
When: Now streaming on Netflix.
Likely to make you feel: Disappointed, apathetic.
The film itself is, in fact, still terrible, but let's be real: its indefensible ""whitewashing"" is a problem inherent to its source material (in which Asian characters were predominantly voiced by white actors including Mark Hamill), while its threadbare script, wonky acting and confused direction is on par with our recent slate of superhero misfires.
Its notorious, overblown reputation indicates the problem with adapting the original Nickelodeon series, which debuted nearly two decades ago: No matter how good a retelling is, it will always be compared to one of the most beloved TV shows of all time.
Fourteen years after that first attempt, the Avatar has returned. But, true to its main character, this latest incarnation struggles to honour its roots within this turbulent era of streaming television.
Showrunner and writer Albert Kim first started watching the original Avatar animated series with his daughter. (Supplied: Netflix/Robert Falconer)
The premise remains largely intact, the show taking place in an Asiatic pre-industrial world where select few ""benders"" have the power to manipulate one of the four classical elements: water, earth, fire and air. Only one person, the spiritually super-charged Avatar, can master all forms of bending – and throughout history, each of their reincarnations have been tasked with keeping the peace.
However, as the iconic 2005 intro tells, the Avatar mysteriously disappeared just as the Fire Nation launched a bloodthirsty war against each region in a bid for world domination.
One hundred years later, orphaned water-tribe teens Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley) rediscover the Avatar in the form of Aang (Gordon Cormier), a 12-year-old airbender, and together they set out to end the Fire Nation's oppressive reign.
Kiawentiio is a Mohawk actor and singer-songwriter, known for starring in Anne with an E and Beans. (Supplied: Netflix)
Separate from comparisons to the original show, Avatar: The Last Airbender manages to stumble on its own terms.
Like other ill-fated streaming gambles, the show bears the grim triumph of expensive effects over visual style, laboured plotting over narrative cohesion, and brand recognition over talent.
The quality of acting and dialogue is enough to derail the series alone. Our main trio's interactions feel slickly artificial, as if ripped from the Disney Channel – a potentially valid approach for a story that was initially pitched towards primary school kids, but a glaring tonal inconsistency in a show that begins with an explicit, immolating genocide involving that very demographic.
Conversations predominantly exist to deliver world-building notes and over-explain plots, which even seasoned actors like Paul Sun-Hyung Lee (Kim's Convenience) struggle to convincingly realise. At least Dallas James Liu fares well as Prince Zuko, the banished, eternally incensed son of dictator Fire Lord Ozai (Daniel Dae Kim, Hawaii Five-0), who spends the series hot on the Avatar's trail. (Just as Star Wars informed the 2005 Avatar series, Zuko feels like the progenitor for Adam Driver's smouldering Kylo Ren.)
In a blog post, Kim said he was excited to see VFX technology ""bring a rich new visual dimension to a fantastic world"". (Supplied: Netflix)
The show's action scenes are a welcome diversion, but it's impossible not to notice that, counter to the show's kung fu inspirations, you don't often see two actors physically sparring in the same shot. Elemental bending combat largely resembles close-ups of particles colliding with other particles, all rendered with cutting-edge fidelity and reduced to grit under Netflix's video compression.
Its most effective setpiece — a frenzied, colourful market brawl between Aang and Zuko — conspicuously involves minimal bending, relying more on clever choreography and bruising hits. Even then, it's all shot so tightly that it obscures the physicality on display.
""This was a chance to showcase Asian and Indigenous characters as living, breathing people,"" Kim wrote in a blog post. (Supplied: Netflix/Robert Falconer)
Compared to the free-flowing, effortlessly astounding spectacle of its animated counterpart, it can't help but feel compromised.
The shift from 20-minute episodes to 45-to-60-minute chapters also undercuts the whip-smart storytelling of the original, in which a large-scale fantasy epic with nuanced ideas and characters was organically pieced together from propulsive, episodic instalments.
Using longer, fleshed-out episodes to privilege character depth over scope is an admirable goal in theory, but the main trio have inexplicably been stripped of interesting wrinkles. Sokka is scrubbed of his misogyny and robbed of subsequent growth; Katara is a clean-cut feminist hero without any of the messy, adolescent rage; Aang is no longer a recognisably irresponsible child.
The episodes are interminably padded, but without any discernible purpose; by the end of the season, you barely get a sense of how their relationships have grown.
Adaptations are not inherently a bad idea; cross-pollination between live-action and animated art forms has always pushed each medium forward. But Netflix's Avatar is more concerned with flattening its source material's ideas and characters into the streamer's own, infinitely replicable formula.
Each episode of Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender reportedly cost $23 million ($US15 million) to make. (Supplied: Netflix/Robert Falconer)
While Death Note and Cowboy Bebop were regarded as previous live-action failures, last year's One Piece found a warmer reception, with many attributing its comparative success to the involvement of original creator Eiichiro Oda.
Avatar, too, started out with original showrunners Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko on board. But, oddly enough, both dropped out after two years, with DiMartino explaining that ""whatever version ends up on-screen, it will not be what Bryan and I had envisioned or intended to make"".
The absence of both creators appears to account for the void of new ideas and distinctive characters in the final product. Netflix's Avatar is barely an adaptation; it's autofill.

""You stand for such big, powerful things and you say them big and powerfully,"" she tells the RuPaul's Drag Race Down Under star.
""I just love that you can incorporate performance into a message.""
Narelda, a proud Whadjuk Noongar woman and journalist, is a self-confessed Drag Race fan, who took her partner Karina to a Kween Kong show on their very first date.
Before this interview, Narelda and Kween Kong had only seen each other out and about at queer clubs. (Supplied)
And Kween, if you don't already know, is a Pasifika New Zealander drag icon, otherwise known as Thomas Charles Fonua.
The pair are the first to share their stories in Fran Kelly's latest podcast Yours Queerly.
In each episode, two prominent guests are interviewed alongside each other on their connection to the rainbow community, and to each other.
Narelda chose Kween as the person she'd like to sit down with, saying she wanted to get to know Kween more.
And while the two aren't actually friends — yet — both confess to admiring each other from afar.
""Narelda is a trailblazer,"" says Kween Kong.
""You've never wavered, you've never changed your approach. And I feel like our approach to activism and advocating is very similar.""
""I grew up on a big block of land and we had a big shed, and there were all these beds for all these missionaries in training that came from around the world,"" says Narelda, whose father, Indigenous rights campaigner Cedric Jacobs, was a Christian pastor.
""When I was little, I knew [Dad] was doing important work that took him away so often I dreamed of being a taxi driver, so I could see more of him,"" says Narelda. (Supplied)
""We were told we have to save souls, we have to save people. And so I would be paired with some of them … to save souls by knocking on doors. I was only about 12.""
While Narelda says she was scared of going to hell, her greatest fear was letting others go to hell.
""The pastor was doing this skit [in church] and saying, 'I'm at the crossroads where people either go to hell or they go to heaven, and I'm passing people that I know who are going to hell, and I'm on the way to heaven. And they're like, why didn't you tell me?!' she says.
""So then I didn't want to miss an opportunity to save someone from going to hell.""
Kween Kong, who was raised a Jehovah's Witness, says she could relate.
""We were those annoying people that would come to you on at nine in the morning on Saturday when you're hungover, and getting you to talk about Jesus Christ,"" she says.
""We were at church like four times a week … And I just remember going, I hate this…
""I felt like I was living in hell … because I was so aware of my queerness at such a young age, I always knew that I was I was wrong … and I never felt safe. But I didn't have a choice. We were there from [when I was] zero to 16.""
The family left the church after Kween's parents broke up, leaving her with the feeling that it had all been a ""waste of time"".
Narelda fell pregnant to her high school boyfriend when she was 18 years old and, as soon as she told her parents, they started planning the wedding. She separated from her husband six months after her daughter Jade was born.
She says it was having her daughter that motivated her to examine her sexuality and try to undo some of the religious ideas she had been brought up with.
""I was raised in that very strict, you know, God fearing, narrow-minded mindset and I just didn't want to raise her like that,"" she says.
""That was my biggest motivation in parenting, to make sure that she was open-minded and to see the world for all the beautiful shapes and colours that it is.""
And when it comes to other parts of her life, she channels her reporting experience.
""You know, you walk into a newsroom or where you're presenting or working, and that gives you a purpose. And the swagger comes with purpose, I think,"" she says.
""But it's also the confidence to say, I belong in this space. I'm now going to own this space, and I'm going to prove to you why I should be here.""
Similarly, Kween says her drag alter ego became her ""superhero"".
""When I think of my strength, especially being a person of colour, being from the Pacific, you know, when it comes to femininity, when you're a male, all those things are really discouraged,"" says Kween.
""Especially in my years growing up, I really struggled with the idea of feeling weak.
""In my adult life, the more that I was away from all of the conditioning, especially from the Bible, and away from my father and all the men in the family, I was able to really investigate what it was about myself that made me special.""
""I literally created my own pathway with drag because I was never welcome in queer spaces, like, no one ever wanted me to perform for them,"" Kween Kong says. (Supplied)
Kween says her family knew she was gay from the get-go.
""I came out in a death drop like, oh my God, literally I came out, 'Ta-da!' I've always been flamboyant. So yeah, they were very aware that I was fruity,"" she says.
""My grandmother made it a thing. Rather than saying I was different, she'd say I was 'more'. And when someone would say that I was different, she'd be like, 'No, he's not. He's more.'""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-27/american-fiction-uses-comedy-to-deliver-the-truth/103514586,It's up for five Oscars and has attracted a wave of publicity in the United States. Now American Fiction arrives in Australia,"American Fiction didn't make it to cinemas in Australia, and while that needn't lessen the experience of people watching it locally when it debuts on Prime Video on Tuesday, it's likely to be a vastly different affair.
When Jonathan W. Gray saw the movie for a second time, he was at a cinema in Brooklyn, New York.
The associate professor of English at John Jay College-CUNY and the CUNY Graduate Center told ABC News that having people of different hues in the room resulted in quite the scene.
""It's a pity that you can't get the experience of having Aboriginal people and [other] black people and white people in Sydney all watching this film together,"" Dr Gray said.
""Because I think there are moments when you watch it with an audience, there's some uncomfortable laughter coming from some of the white people.
""And there are moments where they don't laugh at all, and we are laughing. We're cracking up.
""It was just interesting to hear the waves of laughter based on the people in the room.""
Dr Gray says American Fiction cleverly uses humour as a vehicle, without resorting to slapstick. (Supplied)
American Fiction tells the story of Thelonious ""Monk"" Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a frustrated novelist and professor, who is sick of the tired and offensive tropes in black literature and the industry that profits from them.
He writes the type of stereotypical black book he disdains to mock the establishment, but this book propels him to a level of success he could only previously have dreamt of.
The film has been nominated for five Oscars including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and a Best Actor nomination for Wright.
Dr Gray took to social media to crown American Fiction ""the best film of the year"" when he shared his review, published by The New Republic.
Based on the 2001 novel Erasure by Percival Everett, American Fiction was adapted for the screen by director and screenwriter Cord Jefferson (The Good Place, Watchmen).
""The book comes out in, I believe, February of 2001,"" Dr Gray says.
""It comes out before 9/11. It comes out before Oprah's book club becomes this cultural juggernaut.
""It comes out before the rise of Barack Obama. It comes out before Jay-Z and Beyonce, all of the things that would wind up shaping the 20-something years since its publication.
""I think that Cord is sensitive to the frustrations in the book and the frustrations are real.
""But those frustrations only make sense if you cast your mind back. This is 2001. This is the stolen election – that's really, in terms of history, that's the tangible thing in this cultural moment is the Bush versus Gore election.
""And there wasn't a lot of black representations. And there wasn't necessarily a lot of black empowerment when [Everett is] writing Erasure, so you see that sense of frustration there.""
Dr Gray says despite the rise of black Twitter and far more visibility, black people are still vulnerable to the same kinds of misapprehensions they faced in the past.
""Cord's coming at it from a different point of view, because it's like, 'Oh, we actually have way more than we did when this book came out 20-something years ago, but how are we still dealing with the same shit?'
""And as soon as you ask that question, that's the question that allows him to then say let's update it because we are in some really important ways still dealing with the same foolishness, just calibrated differently.""
Dr Gray says the humour comes from the absurdity in some of the scenarios presented in the film.
""There's a certain stratum of educated white people who do not understand that middle-class black people exist,"" he said.
He says in the film, both Monk and author of the hit novel We's Lives in Da Ghetto Sintara Golden (Issa Rae), are tapping into a set of expectations they themselves don't represent, and that tension is where the humour and pathos comes from.
""There are always talented people who are going to identify what the market wants and give them what they want.""

But Dr Gray says it works the other way too.
""Australia's favourite daughter, Margot Robbie, could make a career playing beautiful, vapid, blonde creatures. That's kind of how she got her start in The Wolf of Wall Street.
""But she's like, 'No, no, no, no, no, I'm not interested in that,' which is laudable for her not to be interested in continuing to play that stereotype. But that stereotype exists and is lucrative. And you could just keep doing that for the rest of your career and make money off it, right? And that's kind of what Sintara Golden is doing.""
Dr Gray says one of the most telling parts of the movie is when Monk is writing his novel My Pafology and there is a father in conflict with his son acting out the scene in front of him.
The actor who plays the son is Okieriete Onaodowan, who played the Shakespearean dual roles of Hercules Mulligan and founding father James Madison in the musical Hamilton.
""That for me was a really brilliant and subtle, like, look at what we're asking these incredibly talented people [to do], right? We're asking them to play these stock stereotypes.
""How many other actors find themselves in the same situation where they could play this incredible thing, but you're asking them to play [a part] so diminished from that?""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-27/trump-allies-holy-war-taylor-swift-power-sway-us-election/103504058,Inside the 'holy war' against Taylor Swift and the men driving it,"It's a reach even demagogues would dream of. More than 50 per cent of Americans are fans of Taylor Swift. Almost one in 20 are ""avid"" fans. She has 281 million followers on Instagram. Time appointed her ""Person of the Year"".
The Pennsylvania-born singer has broken records for albums, downloads, awards, concert tickets, morphing from pop icon to phenomenon, buoying entire economies.
Surely you've heard all this in recent days, as adoration has been running thick like treacle over social media, teenaged arms circled with colourful beads, sequins trailing our capital city streets as thousands of Australians flock to see the long sold-out Eras Tour.
For thousands of unlucky Swifties who couldn’t land tickets to the Eras tour, just being near their idol was — nearly — enough.
So, when Swift spins on her boots on a stage in Melbourne or Sydney, thanking her record-breaking audience for making her feel ""so … powerful"", you have to wonder what this power actually means. And if the power might actually have the capacity to influence the American presidential election in the way the hard right fears it might.
And yes, I'm quite serious. A recent Guardian headline read: ""A decade ago, Taylor Swift liked to publicly mock a Jonas brother for dumping her over the phone. Today, her words may determine the future of US democracy"".
Well, that's a bit dramatic, but there's some logic behind it. Especially since it has been reported that Joe Biden's campaign is burning to secure an endorsement from her, prompting Trump allies to declare a ""holy war"" and the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump, to make the dubious claim that he is ""more popular"" than the singer anyway.

First, some history, for those unfamiliar with the story of Taylor Alison Swift and her clout.
For a long time, Swift shied from weighing into politics, for a host of reasons, including her age, and desire to centre her music. During that time the alt-right exploited her silence, trying to claim her as one of their own, touting her as an ""Aryan Goddess"", lauding her modest dress, her whiteness, and her blondness, claiming she was a secret white supremacist.
They were wrong.
Whether you rate her or not — and as Swifties know, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate — it's impossible to deny that it is Taylor Swift's moment and the best way to share the joy is not to stand back and judge it, but to step in and feel it.
By 2018, Swift had enough. She posted on Instagram about the Tennessee mid-term elections, where a Republican called Marsha Blackburn was running for the Senate.
""In the past I've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions,"" she said, ""but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country.""
She then turned to Blackburn: ""Her voting record in Congress appals and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Re-authorisation of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.""
Swift declared: ""I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin colour, gender or who they love.""
Voter registrations shot up, though it is uncertain what impact this had. Blackburn won.
Trump grumbled that he liked Swift's music ""25 per cent less now"".
Swift has continued to criticise the presumptive Republican nominee. As the US roiled with riots after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a white police officer, she tweeted: ""After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? 'When the looting starts the shooting starts'??? We will vote you out in November.""
Little wonder Fox News host Jeanine Pirro cautioned her recently: ""Don't get involved in politics! We don't wanna see you there.""
The ""holy war"" against Swift has now included deep fakes purporting to show her nude — how else to discredit and belittle a woman by stripping her? — and conspiracy theories which fester in a petri dish of disbelief and disinformation.
Should the Trump campaign be worried about Taylor Swift's power? Maybe. (AP Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta)
In short, these theories hold that Swift is part of the ""psychological operations"" unit of the Pentagon, deployed as a government agent to stir up support for Joe Biden. Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is known to be fond of debunked conspiracy theories, even suggested Swift's boyfriend Travis Kelce might be involved, indicating the Super Bowl he played for the Kansas City Chiefs might be rigged to pave the way for ""a major presidential endorsement coming from an artificially culturally propped-up couple"".
It should be noted that three-quarters of those who have swallowed the Swift conspiracy — denied by the Pentagon — also think the 2020 election was stolen. Curiously, 42 per cent of those who told pollsters they thought there was truth to the ""psy-ops"" theory had not heard of it before being asked.
Taylor Swift is not a cute teenager anymore. She is a 34-year-old billionaire who is in full control of her life, currently crowd surfing global adulation, who has decried the expectation that women simply tolerate what is done to them. (The sharpness of her analysis of gaslighting, for example, is clear when she says things like: ""For centuries we've just been expected to absorb male behaviour silently. Oftentimes when we, in our enlightened state … now respond to bad male behaviour or someone just doing something that was absolutely out of line and we respond, that response is treated like the offence itself."")
So should the Trump campaign be worried? Maybe.
Abuse and attack of her could backfire badly, leaving usual attack dogs leashed and drooling.
Taylor Swift is at the centre of a far-right conspiracy theory that claims the singer is part of an elaborate plot to rig football games and deliver Joe Biden the presidency. Here's how it unfolded.
And turnout is likely to be crucial in this election campaign. Swift's supporters have been shown to turn out to vote when she tells them to. Even millennials, who have previously been loath to vote — only 23 per cent of those aged 18-29 voted in 2022. Yes, research on celebrity influence on elections is mixed. But there is also a sense there may be something unprecedented, or untested, about this particular group.
In September last year, she wrote on Instagram: ""I've been so lucky to see so many of you guys at my US shows recently. I've heard you raise your voices, and I know how powerful they are. Make sure you're ready to use them in our elections this year!""
She included a link to Vote.org, which reported an immediate 1,226 per cent jump in traffic, with 13,000 users coming on every 30 minutes.
Remember that number — it's 2,000 more than the number of votes Trump was pushing Georgia's secretary of state to ""find"" in order to help him win there in 2020. This is what it comes down to, sometimes.
There is one crucial caveat: Swift's supporters skew Democrat anyway. Her detractors skew Republican. The fact that most of her supporters share her views may temper her impact somewhat.

But her greatest influence could be what political scientists call soft power — an ability to co-opt and influence rather than coerce, usually through cultural or economic power. Swift's soft power centres on the liberal values she espouses: diversity, kindness, inclusivity, autonomy, rights for women and LGBTI people.
In the past few days we have all witnessed how her arenas have become cathedrals of rare joy, awe, connection, beauty, song, and collective effervescence.
She is not a politician, she is a poet, a lyricist and story teller, an avatar of the bittersweet joys and pains of being a woman today. Politicians stoke fear and division; she uplifts and unites.

There is one wild card, though, that could galvanise her army of Swifties in unpredictable ways. This is the reproductive rights of women, an issue that a significant number of Democrats believe could hold ground for Joe Biden.
The pro-choice Swift declared that she was ""absolutely terrified"" about the over-turning of Roe v Wade, and she doubtless has watched with horror as states have moved to outlaw abortions — even in the case of rape and incest. There is a reason Kamala Harris has been on a national abortion rights tour: it has been identified as a key election issue.
With the number of eyes fixed on Swift's glittering apotheosis-like ascension, any political figure who would demean her as a pretty pop star, or dismiss her as a woman unaware of her own power or unprepared to wield it, would be a fool.",JBy Julia Baird,Tue 27 Feb 2024,0

You probably saw that Emily Blunt, Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway reunited on stage in a Devil Wears Prada bit (not only was Streep wearing Prada, but Hathaway's blue dress felt like a nod to the cerulean top monologue).
But that was far from all. The casts of both Modern Family and Breaking Bad also reunited, to present ensemble cast awards. Better yet, between the Modern Family cast pondering whether it was too early to cash in with a reboot, and Bob Odenkirk refusing to do an acrostic poem about the word ""ensemble"", the bits were genuinely funny.
And in other entertainment and culture news? ICYMI:
The Indie Spirit Awards, in contrast to more well-funded award season ceremonies, is infamously held in a tent on the beach.
Which means it's not only ""freezing cold"" but it's a lot more accessible than your average event — as they found out today.
Streamed live via YouTube, the ISAs were all but drowned out by pro-Palestinian protesters — seemingly one guy with a very loud megaphone.
Although muffled, the protesters' chants were heard clearly as winners attempted to accept their awards. Host Aidy Bryant touched on the disruption, opening a bit about beach parties by saying, ""Look we're at the beach and people are practising their freedom of speech.""
Director Babak Jalali also acknowledged the outside protest while accepting the John Cassavetes Award for his film Fremont.
""There are people speaking outside, whatever they're saying is far more important than what I'm about to say,"" he said.
The loud protest has been operating throughout the whole ceremony, with many questioning the sounds on the ceremony's live stream. This is what Film Independent has to say about that:

Protests over the war in Palestine have been a semi-constant presence at film and TV events this awards season. Earlier in February the Grammys red carpet was stalled due to a protest, and protesters shut down a street at this year's Sundance Film Festival.

Shock eliminations on Survivor are one thing, but nobody expected Titans V Rebels contestant Scott to voluntarily leave during last night's episode.
Scott, a self-professed Survivor super fan and art director at MONA in Hobart, asked to leave during an already intense tribal council.
""I don't want to take this chance to play the game from someone else when I might not mentally be in the game right now,"" he said, adding, ""You have no idea how bad my head's been these last 24 hours and the war that's going on up there. So I don't think I'd feel right sitting here in potentially someone else's stool after tonight.""
Scott's decision was praised by cast mate Eden: ""He's such an amazing person with such a kind energy and he knows what he needs. And mental health is such a huge hurdle that we all face. And for someone like yourself to know what you need right now — hat's off to you.""
It was a teary farewell, with several other contestants commending Scott's decision both in the moment and on social media.
""I 100% support Scott,"" wrote fellow competitor Aileen on Twitter. ""Kudos to him for being so brave, vulnerable and knowing when to prioritise his health. Survivor is an extremely tough game. You can prepare and dream to play the game all you want, but the mental battle can be the toughest challenge out there.""

It started as a counter-culture magazine (that was unfortunately co-founded by a Proud Boy), but now online outlet Vice could cease to exist completely.
Vice CEO Bruce Dixon signalled several hundred lay-offs and the shuttering of Vice.com in a memo to staff last week.
""I know that saying goodbye to our valued colleagues is difficult and feels overwhelming, but this is the best path forward for Vice as we position the company for long-term creative and financial success,"" Dixon said.
He said it was no longer cost-effective to distribute digital news via the website and they will be focusing more on their social offerings. Dixon also said they were looking to sell off its Refinery29 publishing business.
Vice filed for bankruptcy in the US in May, before being sold for $533 million ($US350 million) to a consortium led by the Fortress Investment Group.
In Australia, Vice and Refinery29 have an exclusive publishing deal with the Nine-owned Pedestrian Group. At the time of the bankruptcy announcement, former Vice staff members confirmed the Asia-Pacific newsroom had been closed, however Nine told Mediaweek at the time the change would not affect the deal they have with Vice.
ABC Entertainment has reached out to Pedestrian Group to confirm what the US changes mean for Vice and Refinery29 in Australia.

Newcastle must be feeling a bit smug right now, as the new film starring locally raised comedian Geraldine Viswanathan was released globally.
Drive-Away Dolls is in cinemas now. It's directed by Ethan Coen, who split off from brother Joel to helm a goofy, queer road movie.
It's Viswanathan's first lead role in a major Hollywood flick, though you probably recognise her from movies including Blockers and Bad Education, or from TV shows including ABC drama Janet King and Miracle Workers (alongside Daniel Radcliffe).
Margaret Qualley and Geraldine Viswanathan star in Drive-Away Dolls as two queer women on a road trip who find themselves caught up in criminal activity.
Viswanathan plays uptight Marian, who agrees to a spur-of-the-moment road trip when BFF Jamie (Margaret Qualley of Maid) is dumped by her girlfriend (Beanie Feldstein, Booksmart). But their borrowed car's boot contains a severed head and some stolen items criminals want back.
Add in Miley Cyrus, Pedro Pascal, 2024 Oscar nominee Colman Domingo and Matt Damon, and you've got a star-packed, 84-minute comedy. ABC Entertainment reviewer Jamie Tram praised the film, calling it a ""disarmingly sweet, lowkey jaunt"" with ""a potential record number of sex toy gags"".

An endorsement from the legendary Dolly Parton is the stuff dreams are made of for any country music singer.
So, when the country music legend posted a message in support of Beyoncé after her debut on top of the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart last week, it felt like a significant moment in the Texas Hold Em singer's recently announced country turn.
""I'm a big fan of Beyoncé and very excited she's done a country album,"" Dolly wrote in a note on social media over the weekend.
""So congratulations on your Billboard Hot Country number one single. Can't wait to hear the full album.""
You might imagine that such a legendary artist loudly professing their support of another singer would warm the hearts of music fans of all persuasions.
Thankfully, Parton's post did receive plenty of support, with a string of comments demanding a Dolly and Beyoncé collaboration, and others praising Parton's support of a fellow woman in music.
But, this is the internet in 2024, so there were also comments like this:
Each to their own, but if you ever find yourself trying to tell the woman who wrote Jolene what is and isn't country music, it's probably time to take a look in the mirror.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-26/taylor-swift-eras-tour-and-the-culture-of-concert-fashion/103494372,'A celebration of girlhood': Why the act of dressing up for Taylor Swift is so layered,"For some Taylor Swift fans, securing a coveted ticket to the Australia leg of the superstar's Eras Tour was just the start of their stress — it was time to start curating the perfect concert outfit.
Swifties who knew their way around a sewing machine and a hot glue gun got to work.
For others, fast fashion retailers were quick to offer up enough cowboy boots and sequin mini-skirts for every era.
Dressing up for concerts has been happening for decades, and Taylor Swift isn't the only performer who inspires fans to follow a dress code.
Feather boas were the must-have accessory for Harry Styles's world tour last year, though concert goers from London to Sydney were criticised for leaving a massacre of feathers in their wake post-show.

Beyonce went a step further and for her birthday asked fans attending her Renaissance tour during Virgo season to don their ""most fabulous silver fashions.""
And who is going to say no to Beyonce? And on her birthday?
But what separates Taylor Swift's Eras Tour from her peers is how it spotlights just how elaborate concert outfit culture has become.
For some fans, the desire to get involved can quickly tip into pressure to look the part, or risk feeling left out among hundreds of thousands of fans.
Writer, editor and podcaster Jasmine Wallis has been a Swiftie for years but had never seen the singer live until she touched down for three shows in Melbourne earlier this month.
""I'd seen all the Eras Tour outfits from the US so I knew it was a big occasion and people dress up and it's very much a celebration of girlhood,"" she told ABC News.
""I suddenly felt all this pressure to dress up sparkly and sequined.""
Jasmine Wallis, left, values sustainability but even she got swept up in buying something new for the Eras Tour. (Supplied: Jasmine Wallis)
While her friends started making their own outfits months ahead of the February tour, Wallis knew she'd buy something closer to the date, then suddenly found herself cutting it close.
""I probably spent about two hours on my computer on Sunday night going through all these websites that I've never even looked at before,"" she said.
""From a value perspective, I try not to not buy fast fashion in general but especially not ultra-fast fashion.""
After realising nothing would be delivered in time, Wallis went in-store and found herself considering a $70 sequin mini-skirt ""that was falling apart in the dressing room.""
""I was still like 'no, I should buy this because I don't want to be left out'. It was really weird, the FOMO culture of it all.
""Even as a 27-year-old with critical thinking skills, who talks about fast fashion all the the time, I was still just like 'I have to be part of this club.'""
Wallis ended up wearing a silver sequin skirt borrowed from a friend, who bought it specially for the Eras Tour but had decided on wearing something else.
""I probably saw 100 girls in the same skirt, but it was really fun to wear something I wouldn't normally wear and feel sparkly and glittery and paired with things I already own.""
Fans both overseas and in Australia dressed up for the Eras Tour.
According to the Australian Fashion Council (AFC), Australians buy on average 56 items of clothing annually, with 200,000 tonnes of clothing going into landfill every year.
""While fashion can bring people such joy, uplift experiences and allow us to creatively express ourselves, we know that it also has a large impact on the planet,"" an AFC spokesperson said.
Whether you rate her or not, it's impossible to deny that it is Taylor Swift's moment and the best way to share the joy is not to stand back and judge it, but to step in and feel it, writes Leigh Sales.
""Sustainability and circularity are increasingly important to customers, and it's essential to a resilient and thriving industry — businesses that don't adapt and evolve will be left behind.""
Taylor Swift has toured Australia multiple times before, but fans have noticed a distinct shift in the look of the crowd for the Eras Tour.
""Friends who had seen her before were like, 'this is a new phenomenon, when I saw the Reputation tour people weren't dressing up like this,'"" Wallis said.
While Wallis suspects social media might be fuelling fans' desire to dress up more, her personal want to dress up ""came from this being one of the biggest pop culture entertainment moments in the last decade in Australia, I'd say maybe even more, and wanting to capture the moment and really get involved.""
Scores of Swifties were inspired to DIY their own Eras Tour outfits, including 25-year-old Izzie Peachey who started working on her look before international tour dates were even announced.
""While Taylor was touring through the US I loved seeing other people make their own outfits and knew this was something I wanted to do myself,"" she told ABC News.
""When I first laid eyes on the original pink and blue Lover bodysuit, I was absolutely obsessed.""

For Ms Peachey, the process of recreating the bodysuit Swift wears to open her blockbuster show took five months.
""[I] can safely say I spent over 100 hours working on it,"" she said, adding the look involved 12,000 rhinestones and upwards of 7,000 sequins, all individually hand glued and sewn.
""Gluing rhinestones is easy, the most time consuming part was definitely sewing sequins. I also unpicked and re-sewed a lot of them because the colours weren't right.
""I really wanted to make the bodysuit as close to the original as I could.""

Ms Peachey says she's had offers to purchase the bodysuit, but ""I worked too hard on it and it means too much to me to give away.""
""I've joked with my family and friends that I'll be buried in it!""
It was a similar story for Jacquie Addison, with the 24-year-old deciding to make her own outfit after securing a ticket.
""I was shocked my friends and I were actually able to get tickets so I decided it was probably a once in a lifetime event and I wanted to go all out,"" she told ABC News, adding she had seen others' homemade Eras Tour outfits on TikTok.

Despite Ms Addison's only previous sewing experience being ""Year 9 home economics where we made pencil cases,"" she recreated Swift's intricate Midnights bodysuit and tinsel jacket she wears for the show's big finale.
""I spent seven months overall making the whole outfit. I did the jacket as a break from rhinestoning the bodysuit at times,"" she said.
While Ms Addison created her own look, she understands why others turned to fast fashion.
""I think for us younger generation at the moment it's hard buying slow fashion or being able to afford the more environmentally friendly options.
""[We're] already spending so much money on tickets and accommodation alone, so I can understand people looking to fast fashion options.

Ms Peachey says she never considered buying an outfit, but respected those who purchased something brand new for the occasion.
""There is no doubt that the fashion industry needs to change,"" she said.
""In saying that, Taylor's Eras Tour is a cultural phenomenon and a once in a lifetime experience that most people will remember for the rest of their lives.
It's a sentiment echoed by Sam Todd, the owner and fashion designer behind the brand The Volt.
Like fast fashion brands, Ms Todd tapped into the phenomenon of the Eras Tour and designed a clothing range of prints featuring subtle nods to Swift's discography.
But unlike fast fashion brands, every garment from The Volt is handmade by Ms Todd.
""[Sustainability] has been at the forefront of the brand from the start. It's always been made in really small batches here in Brisbane,"" she told ABC News.

""And we love to do these exclusive limited collections just like the Taylor Swift one and the Harry Styles one before where we only get a limited amount of fabric so we're not left with all of this waste afterwards.""
And it's been a hit, with the Eras Tour-inspired collection being The Volt's most popular collection of all time, ""especially the Reputation print,"" Ms Todd adds.
The collection was designed to be worn multiple times long after Taylor Swift has jetted off, so the garments feature versatile patterns that work with an existing wardrobe — with not a sequin in sight.
""You just know there is going to be an insurmountable amount of sequins in the op shops over the coming months.""
Ms Todd has been running her own business for five years and says she's noticed a shift in consumer behaviour post-COVID.
As the megastar prepares to grace Australian stages later this week, Swift's name is everywhere — from the schoolyard to scholarly symposiums.
""People, and myself included, don't really want to buy a piece just to wear it once and then never again.
""We're all a bit more savvy with our money now, especially when you're buying slow fashion and it's a little bit more expensive. You want to know that you're gonna get so much more out of it than just being able to wear it once.""
When designing her latest collection, Ms Todd wanted to appeal to ""all levels of Taylor Swift fans, because there's some people who are all in and want to do crazy costumes, and then there's also people who are just a bit more casual and want to wear a skirt with a nice top.""
Despite being a business owner and lover of fun fashion, Ms Todd says ""you absolutely don't have to go over the top and dress up if you don't want to.""
""I hate to say this as someone who owns a brand who makes concert clothes, but we're going to be sitting in the grandstands in the dark. If it's not for you, you don't have to do it.
""But if you love fashion and dressing up, this is the perfect occasion.
""I think the pressure is only created from social media,"" she adds.
""Once you're there and you're at the concert you'll see so many people who aren't dressed up, who aren't there to take photos and you'll be totally okay.
""Which is so it's such an oxymoron for me to say as someone who is getting up and taking photos, but it's the truth.",JBy Jessica Riga,Mon 26 Feb 2024,0

The pair queued for hours in sweltering Perth summer heat for a chance to meet their WWE idols and buy exclusive merchandise from a pop-up shop in the city's main shopping mall.

WWE superstars including Australia's Rhea Ripley, Logan Paul, Seth 'Freakin' Rollins, Randy Orton, Becky Lynch, and WWE chief content officer Paul 'Triple H' Levesque will make an appearance at Perth Stadium on Saturday evening.
The event is the WWE's first live show in Australia since 2018, and the last major event on the wrestling calendar before the massive Wrestlemania 40 in Philadelphia in April.
""I've travelled for 26 hours from Ireland to be here,"" Mr Guerreiro said.
""WWE is everything to me. It's just one of my biggest passions, if not my biggest passion.""
Mr Lowder said the 31-hour trip from Florida in the United States was worth every penny.
""TV doesn't do it justice. Being here live makes all the difference,"" he said.
""[There is] a line wrapped around this area to buy clothes, for the wrestlers, and for the event itself,"" he said.
""Obviously the WWE knows what they're doing for the fans. They make us feel part of the event.""

The amount the Western Australian government paid to secure the event has not been made public, despite questions from reporters.
But Tourism Minister Rita Saffioti said there would be a significant economic boost for Perth.
""We know WWE has an extensive global audience of more than one billion homes and I am excited to see WA showcased on the world stage,"" she said.
ABC sport reporter Mitchell Turner said the loyal WWE fanbase was part of the reason the industry was worth billions.
""This is a company and industry that is worth nearly $10 billion dollars,"" he said.
""This isn't just your typical international exhibition or showcase event for the WWE, this is one of their premier events on the calendar.
""It'll be broadcast live to millions of people around the world and features the biggest names in the industry"".

He said Australian competitor Rhea Ripley, born in Adelaide as Demi Bennett, would be a fan favourite.
""It's the first time she's wrestled in Australia for seven years, and the first time she will do it under the sport's biggest banner,"" he said.
Mr Lowder said a shared passion for wrestling and the WWE brought people from all corners of the globe together.
""It's just a great community to be around, besides the entertainment value, the fans are very accepting of each other,"" he said.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-22/smac-mccreanor-hydraulic-press-girl-ngv-triennial/103483930,Meet Hydraulic Press Girl — the Aussie artist who gets 'squished' in viral videos,"If you've spent any time online recently, there's a good chance you've seen a Smac McCreanor video.
You might know her, though, as the Hydraulic Press Girl.
Sarah ""Smac"" McCreanor is an Australian performance artist who relocated to LA in 2013. She's made her name getting ""squished"" in viral videos, re-creating objects being crushed in a hydraulic press through performance.
""Hydraulic press videos are a pretty well-known and well-received phenomenon on the internet. They're an oddly satisfying content category … I've been hooked for a while,"" she tells ABC RN's The Art Show.
Tune in for visual arts stories from Australia and beyond.
She has amassed a huge audience: more than 2.6 million followers on TikTok, 580,000 followers on Instagram and 1.6 million YouTube subscribers, and her videos have accumulated more than 1 billion views.
Now, for the first time, McCreanor's work has made the leap from the smartphone screen to the gallery wall, with two of the artist's video series — Hydraulic Press Girl and EMOJI — currently on show at the NGV Triennial in Melbourne.
McCreanor has made an art form of the side-by-side video, a format designed to encourage viewers to watch a video on a loop.
In her Hydraulic Press Girl videos, one half of the screen shows footage of the machine squashing an object — a soft drink can, say — alongside McCreanor's performance on the other.
She uses the same format in other videos, such as the absurdist Chicken Club series, which show her mimicking dancing hens with her friends.
Clever styling — pairing a yellow T-shirt with a green boilersuit to evoke a corn emoji, for example — adds an extra layer to McCreanor's performances, so it's no surprise she often begins a video with an outfit in mind.
The self-described ""thrifty"" artist tries to create costumes from what she has in her wardrobe before buying new pieces.
""I already know I have a green outfit — cool, I can be an avocado,"" she says.
TikTok's self-consciously lo-fi aesthetic gives McCreanor leeway to be creative.
""I don't have to have the perfect representation of my avocado costume for people to understand that I'm being that avocado,"" she says. ""I just grab the green sweatpants, and I'm like, 'Cool, that will do'.""
McCreanor crushes objects in a hydraulic press she bought around a year into making the videos.
""You never know what an object is going to do,"" she says. The results are often ""pretty surprising and hilarious"".
The most popular of the 180 episodes she's made so far feature food, such as avocado and Vegemite.
""The squishiness of it is so satisfying,"" she says.
McCreanor generally speeds up the hydraulic press footage, which is ""incredibly slow"" in real time.
McCreanor attended dance and drama classes throughout her childhood. As a teenager, however, she switched her focus from dance to comedy, which she calls her ""passion"".
""I've always loved slapstick,"" she says.
The careful choreography of physical comedy appealed to McCreanor as a dancer. ""It's so heavily based on movement,"" she says.
Comedy still informs her work. She says Hydraulic Press Girl possesses ""an underlying tone of humour"" and she wants the audience to laugh at it.
McCreanor's ""absolute idol"" is, perhaps surprisingly, Frank Woodley, best known as one-half of the Australian comedic duo Lano and Woodley.
As well as a comedian, Woodley is a multidisciplinary artist whose talents span acting, directing and songwriting.
""He's [also] a fantastic illustrator … he's a stunt person — he can do everything,"" says McCreanor, who takes a similarly multidisciplinary approach to her artistic life.
She studied visual art at university and has ""always loved video editing, photography [and] filming"".
""It's hard for me to only choose one avenue,"" she says.
""Hydraulic Press Girl is a great representation of all my merged passions.""
McCreanor says she made 10 to 20 videos a day during the COVID-19 lockdown. (Supplied: NGV/Smac McCreanor)
When McCreanor was 19, she landed a role in the ""arena-sized"" stage production of How to Train a Dragon, playing warrior princess Astrid.
""It was a really ambitious show,"" recalls McCreanor, who performed her own stunts, including flying in a harness over the audience.
The international tour included LA, where she decided to stay despite having no connections in the city.
""I realised really quickly that people love Australians,"" she says.
""We have a really good work ethic, and we're well-rounded when it comes to the arts and training.""
McCreanor auditioned for anything and everything, landing roles in TV commercials and music videos, and spent the next 10 years working nonstop.
As a teenager growing up in Brisbane, McCreanor was constantly creating, whether writing, producing and staging comedy theatre shows, or filming YouTube videos.
Her life in LA was different. ""When I went to Hollywood, I didn't have time for that because it was all about progressing through other people's work,"" she says.
That all changed when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020.
Overnight, ""Hollywood closed,"" McCreanor says.
With plenty of time on her hands and nothing to do, she threw herself into producing video content. ""I was in the studio filming and creating 24/7,"" she says.
Of the multitude of videos she created during this period, it was Hydraulic Press Girl that took off.
""It just spread like wildfire,"" she says.
""It's very interactive. People request things; people want to see different versions of the same thing. It became a call and response with the audience and kept growing.""
McCreanor says exhibiting her work at the NGV is a ""full-circle moment"".
""My favourite thing about seeing it translated to a physical space is seeing people's reactions because I've never seen them before. I've only ever possibly read them as a comment.""
She has especially delighted in seeing families congregate in front of the screens showing her work.
""You see the kids, they start sitting on the floor because they don't want to leave, and they're giggling … and pointing at the different outfits, they're running up to the screens,"" she says.
""It seems so interactive, and I don't think I expected it to be like that.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-21/trial-over-handwritten-lyrics-to-hotel-california/103492766,Trial over handwritten lyrics to Hotel California set to begin,"In the mid-1970s, the Eagles were working on a spooky, cryptic new song.
Don Henley, with input from band co-founder Glenn Frey, jotted thoughts about ""a dark desert highway"" and ""a lovely place"" on a notepad.
The song Hotel California became one of rock's most indelible singles. And nearly a half-century later, those handwritten pages of lyrics-in-the-making have become the centre of an unusual criminal trial.
Rare book dealer Glenn Horowitz, former Rock & Roll Hall of Fame curator Craig Inciardi and memorabilia seller Edward Kosinski are charged with conspiring to own and try to sell manuscripts of Hotel California and other Eagles hits without the right to do so.
The three have pleaded not guilty, and their lawyers have said the men committed no crime with the papers, which they acquired via a writer who'd worked with the Eagles. But the Manhattan district attorney's office says the defendants connived to obscure the documents' disputed ownership, despite knowing that Mr Henley said the pages were stolen.
More than 80 pages of draft lyrics from the blockbuster 1976 Hotel California album, including words to the chart-topping, Grammy-winning title cut are at issue in the case.

Mr Henley is expected to testify between tour stops and the non-jury trial could offer a peek into the band's creative process and life in the fast lane of '70s stardom.
The pages also include lyrics from songs including Life in the Fast Lane and New Kid in Town.
Eagles manager Irving Azoff has called the documents ""irreplaceable pieces of musical history.""
Mr Horowitz, Mr Inciardi and Mr Kosinki are charged with conspiracy to possess stolen property and various other offences.
They're not charged with actually stealing documents. Nor is anyone else, but prosecutors will still have to establish that the documents were stolen. The defence maintains that's not true.
Much turns on the Eagles' interactions with Ed Sanders, a writer who also co-founded the 1960s counterculture rock band the Fugs.
He worked in the late '70s and early '80s on an authorised Eagles biography that was never published.
Mr Sanders isn't charged in the case. The Associated Press news agency has sought comment from him.
He sold the pages to Mr Horowitz, who then sold them to Mr Inciardi and Mr Kosinski.
Mr Henley told a grand jury he never gave the biographer the lyrics, according to court filings from Mr Kosinski's lawyers. But defence lawyers have signalled that they plan to probe Mr Henley's memory of the time.
""We believe that Mr Henley voluntarily provided the lyrics to Mr Sanders,"" attorney Scott Edelman said in court last week.
Mr Sanders told Mr Horowitz in 2005 that while working on the Eagles book, he was sent whatever papers he wanted from Mr Henley's home in Malibu, California, according to the indictment.
Then Mr Kosinski's business offered some pages at auction in 2012 and Mr Henley's attorneys came knocking.
Mr Horowitz, Mr Inciardi and Mr Sanders, in varying combinations, began batting around alternate versions of the manuscripts' provenance, the indictment says.
In one story, Mr Sanders found the pages discarded in a backstage dressing room.
In others, he got them from a stage assistant or while amassing ""a lot of material related to the Eagles from different people.""
In yet another, he obtained them from Glenn Frey — an account that ""would make this go away once and for all,"" Horowitz suggested in 2017.
Mr Frey had died the year before.

Sotheby's listed the Hotel California song lyrics in a 2016 auction but withdrew them after learning the ownership was in question.
Sotheby's isn't charged in the case and declined to comment.
Mr Henley bought some draft lyrics privately from Gotta Have It! for $8,500 in 2012, when he also began filing police reports, according to court filings.
Defence lawyers claim Mr Henley found starstruck prosecutors to take up his cause instead of pursuing a civil suit himself.
Mr Horowitz has been entangled in some ownership spats before.
One involved papers linked to Gone With the Wind author Margaret Mitchell. It was settled.
Mr Kosinski has been a principal in Gotta Have It! Collectibles, known for auctioning celebrities' possessions — so personal that Madonna unsuccessfully sued to try to stop a sale that included her latex briefs.

JK, this is a T-Swift-free space. For Eras tour content, we've got you covered here.
Zendaya has come a long way since Shake It Up's fedoras, pumped-up kicks and bangles. At the worldwide premiere of Dune: Part Two in London, the actor wore sci-fi couture perfection — a robotic suit of armour with daring see-through panels.
Sourced by stylist Law Roach, the suit is the original runway piece from designer Thierry Mugler's fall 1995 collection. (FYI, this is a pretty major coup. Few would be allowed to wear a vintage piece like this.)
The Queen's Gambit actor Anya Taylor-Joy also confirmed rumours she cameos in the film, popping up at the premiere in a white Dior cape featuring a hood, with a pleated gown. Some saw it as a nod to the character, but others have criticised Taylor-Joy for appropriating Muslim dress, pointing out the futuristic ensemble resembles a chador or khimar.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
For those (somehow??) more interested in the film than the fashion, critics are sharing their very positive reactions on socials. Top praise went to leads Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya alongside Part Two newcomer Austin Butler — as well as Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser and director Denis Villeneuve.
""[Denis] has delivered his magnum opus directing one of the best sci-fi films for generations to come,"" wrote Variety's senior artisans editor Jazz Tangcay.
Others are predicting a heap of nominations next awards season, including best picture.
You'll be able to see whether Dune: Part Two is worth the hype when it hits Australian cinemas on March 14.

The theme for fashion's biggest night out in 2024 is The Garden of Time, inspired by JG Ballard's 1962 short story.
Chris Hemsworth, who has never attended the ball, appears to be taking his co-chair duties super seriously.
""Anyone got a Garden of Time outfit I can borrow?"" he wrote in an Instagram post/text chain shared across Vogue's social channels.
Thankfully, the Australian actor — who has a penchant for cycling through samey black/navy/maroon/grey suits on the red carpet — will share his co-chair duties with the uber-fashionable Zendaya, Bad Bunny and J.Lo, who have each attended the fundraising benefit in the past and are experts at taking red carpet risks.
This year's event coincides with the opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's new exhibition, Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.

U2 vocalist Bono made an impassioned tribute to recently deceased Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny during the band's tenure at the billion dollar Las Vegas Sphere.
Navalny, who was fiercely critical of President Vladimir Putin, was reported dead on Friday while serving a 30-year jail sentence for charges he said were politically motivated. He was 47.
Bono, along with U2, has been vocally supportive of Ukraine as they battle for freedom against Russian forces. The singer took a break before their cover of Crowded House's Don't Dream It's Over to address the situation.
""Apparently Putin would never, ever say [Navalny's] name. So I thought tonight, the people who believe in freedom must say his name. Not just remember it, but say it,"" the singer said before leading the stadium in a chant of the fallen dissident's name.

Twenty-one years after her first cover shoot for the Black women's lifestyle magazine, the queen is back. With a new hair product line to shill, yes.
But also with some insights into her experiences growing up in her mother's salon at the back of the Knowles family home, a smattering of musings on the connection between Black women's sense of self and our hair, and an achingly pure intergenerational photo shoot.
When she wasn't running what would become Destiny's Child routines in Ms Tina's shop, Beyoncé was watching her mother shampoo and trim women's hair, ""transforming"" them in the process.
""Looking back, it was more than just a hair appointment — it was therapy … It was a sacred space for these women,"" she says in the upcoming issue, which will drop on February 27.
Today, she sees Black hair salons as ""a place to feel beautiful and vent, laugh, share secrets and pass down wisdom. It's the most consistent community gathering we have. It's so important that it's a sanctuary."" And we couldn't agree more (multimillionaires — they're just like us?!)
""From spending my childhood in my mother's salon to my father applying oil on my scalp to treat my psoriasis — these moments have been sacred to me,"" Beyonce continues.
Yes, Beyonce is only telling us these things because she wants us to buy her new product. Yes, we're still in our feelings about it.

The family of the 81-year-old founder, producer and songwriter of the deeply revered Beach Boys, Brian Wilson, are seeking to place him under conservatorship.
This comes after the death last month of his wife, manager, and carer, Melinda Ledbetter.
""This decision was made to ensure that there will be no extreme changes to the household,"" the Wilson family said in a statement.
The Beach Boys — Good Vibrations
According to documents filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court, Wilson is ""unable to properly provide for his own personal needs for physical health, food, clothing, or shelter"" due to a neurocognitive disorder similar to dementia.
A hearing is scheduled for April 26 to determine whether the conservatorship can go ahead.
The news feels especially significant after the public's recent acquaintance with the problems of conservatorships, with Britney Spears successfully removing herself from an ""abusive"" conservatorship run by her father and legal team, who controlled her finances and career for 13 years.

Just call Geroge Santos a bad smell, 'cause this guy will not go away. Last year, the serial liar went from being voted out of congress (for being a serial liar) to hocking minute-long shout-outs on Cameo for $US500 ($764).
Late night host Jimmy Kimmel decided to take advantage of this opportunity with the segment Will Santos Say it?
Basically, Kimmel's staff paid for a bunch of Santos's Cameos to see if he would happily repeat the increasingly unhinged prompts requested by Kimmel (which included things like shouting out an uncle for eating ""six pounds of loose ground beef"", and congratulating a mum for the successful cloning of her schnauzer, Adolf).
Jimmy Kimmel pranks George Santos on Cameo, Trump wants ""loyalists"" only and the Chanucorn returns!
Enraged by the attention (or delighted, it's hard to tell with Santos), the former Republican congressman/drag queen has filed a lawsuit against Kimmel for ""copyright infringement"".
Santos is seeking statutory damages totalling $US750,000 ($1.1 million) for the five videos he created, which were played on the show and various social media platforms. He also asks for other damages, to be determined at trial.
It's an important reminder of the dangers of Cameo, just ask Flavor Flav…

Not content with coining the term ""Stan"", Eminem is co-producing a documentary on the parasocial super-fan phenomenon.
Since Eminem's 2000 track Stan, where the rapper corresponds with an unhinged fan, the word has become synonymous with self-professed super-fans and those who identify as part of an artist's standom — such as Swifties, Barbz, Beehive, and the BTS Army and Rihanna's Navy.
The doco, tentatively titled Stans, will feature Eminem's biggest fans, and dive into the complex relationship between artist and audience.

Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy's new film Small Things Like These has opened the 2024 Berlinale to rave reviews, prompting Oscar rumblings already.
After taking home the BAFTA and Golden Globe for Oppenheimer, it's looking like he'll win the Oscar in a few weeks too — unless Paul Giamatti sneaks in for The Holdovers. So if the rumblings are true and Murphy won the best actor award back-to-back, he'd join a hallowed group of just four actors to do so, including Tom Hanks and Katharine Hepburn.
When asked post-screening whether he'd prefer to nab an Oscar for Oppenheimer or Berlinale's Golden Bear, Murphy said ""Can I have both?""
As for the film itself? Small Things Like These is adapted from the celebrated 2021 novel of the same name by Irish writer Claire Keegan, and is directed by Belgian Tim Mielants, who worked on Murphy's show Peaky Blinders. It focuses on the Magdalene Laundries, cruel asylums across Ireland that housed ""fallen women"" who lived outside the boundaries of conservative beliefs.
The film is set in 1985, with Murphy playing a man who uncovers the truth of what occurs at a local convent. There's no cinema release date just yet, but expect to hear more soon.

""You, the audience, the people, you made Barbie a global cultural phenomenon, thank you,"" Ferrera said.
Here are the nominees for the People's Choice Awards, where Barbie leads the film nods and Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are both nominated.
Ferrera thanked the ""incomparable"" Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie who she said deserved ""all the flowers"".

Before Taylor Swift begins her run of shows at Sydney Olympic Park, news of the global superstar's arrival has seen fans brave stormy weather.
Following a three-show run in Melbourne over the weekend, where Swift performed to a personal record crowd of 96,000 people, the singer boarded her private jet and made her way north in preparation for four shows in Sydney this coming weekend.
Eight-year-old ""Swifite"" Viviene Garrett held onto her pink guitar in the hopes of telling the superstar of their mutual love of music.
""I'm a big fan and I love playing guitar and my favourite song is called Cruel Summer,"" Vivienne said.

The Italian national has made her way to The Crown hotel in Barangaroo where the star is rumoured to be staying.
""I'm a Taylor Swift fan and I heard she was coming to the Crown,"" Ms Scaglia.
""I tried with the pre-sale and the official sale and I spent about six hours over two days, and it's pretty hard to get a ticket resale without a scam.""

As the megastar prepares to grace Australian stages later this week, Swift's name is everywhere — from the schoolyard to scholarly symposiums.
Fans across the country have gone online to try and get their hands on a coveted Sydney ticket.
The four shows in Sydney sold out in hours, while many are still on the hunt for a ticket.
Fan culture expert from the University of Sydney Georgia Carroll said the fans are pushing the singer but a clever marketing team is capitalising on the hysteria.
""In most cases, fandom is fan-driven rather than industry-driven,"" Dr Carroll said.
""I think Taylor Swift is interesting because it is passion and her marketing is very clever and draws on this kind of cross-engagement.
Dr Carroll said the star ""transcends age and gender"", opening up more sales options.

Venue NSW Chief Executive Kerrie Mather told ABC Radio the total economic boost from Swift's shows will be about $135.8 million and will ""be a very significant economic contributor to New South Wales"".
While she arrived in Sydney with an entourage, one person was notably absent — her partner and Superbowl winner Travis Kelce.
In a podcast with his brother Jason Kelce, the Kansas Chiefs player said he will likely head down south.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-18/why-are-so-many-taylor-swift-fans-middle-aged/103457252,'It hit me exactly where I needed to be': How middle-aged fans fell for Taylor Swift,"It's finally here! Taylor Swift's much anticipated Eras tour arrived in Australia this week, and so, after months of waiting, young fans are frantically tying friendship bracelets together and brushing up on their fan chants.
But take a closer look at those taking their (expensive) stadium seats in Melbourne and Sydney. There will be plenty of 40-, 50-, 60-somethings singing along too — and they aren't all there with their kids.

While 45 per cent of Swift's US fans are millennials — like the 34-year-old herself — 21 per cent are Gen X and 25 per cent are Boomers, according to a 2023 survey. That means nearly half of her millions of fans are likely over 45.
Middle-aged Swifties aren't shy about their adoration. In the US, Attorney-General Merrick Garland, 72, works Swift's song lyrics into conversations and legal arguments, and reportedly has almost all of her albums on display in his office.
Oscar-winning actor Julia Roberts, 56, loves her so much that the first concert she took her kids to was Swift's 1989 tour in 2015. And recently the self-dubbed Silver Swifties were photographed shaking it off in their retirement homes.
In Australia, AMP chief economist Shane Oliver, actor Toni Collette, former foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop and academic Larissa Behrendt have all declared themselves to be Swift fans.
Even 60-year-old Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is reportedly angling for tickets to the upcoming shows.
So what is it about Swift's lovelorn ballads, kitchen bops and revenge anthems, spread across 14 albums, that appeal so intensely to middle-aged people?
Amy DeSalvo Umanoff, one of the almost 20,000 members of the GenX Swifties Facebook group, says her love of Swift's music comes down to the relatability of her lyrics.
Fellow member Courtney Thomas Joyce agrees.
""I feel like her lyrics are ageless and timeless. I can transport myself to that moment where I felt the same thing that she felt. She takes small moments and makes them normal, human, and helps us feel not so alone.""
Almost half of Taylor Swift's fans are middle-aged, often paying up big for tickets to her Eras tour.  (Getty Images)
Writing universally relatable lyrics is something Swift has always been good at.
In a 2008 New Yorker article entitled Prodigy, published when Swift was only 19 and just before her second album Fearless was released, music critic Sasha Frere-Jones compared her ""precocious wisdom"" to that of Prince, Elvis Costello and Hank Williams.
""You could also give a Swift composition like 'Our Song' to someone 20 years older and it could work just fine,"" he wrote. ""The concerns of kids aren't necessarily juvenile — just their reactions.
Bridging this gap is the trick of pop music; when people sing 'Love Me Do' to themselves on their way to a date 10 years on the other side of their second divorce, it's a sign that a young songwriter has got to a universal truth. …
People who aren't old enough to have lived the songs they've written nevertheless know how the song embodying that life should go.""
The album that grabbed many middle-aged fans' attention was the melancholic Folklore, released in July 2020 when much of the world was in lockdown.
That's when Australia Institute economist Greg Jericho, 52, got hooked.
""It hit me exactly where I needed to be,"" he says.
Taylor Swift - exile (folklore)
He said prior to that album, he'd mistakenly believed everything Swift wrote was ""autobiographical and … always about her break-ups"". But Folklore ""wasn't that kind of an album"".
Indeed, the critically acclaimed album, and its sister album Evermore, saw Swift explore a more indie sound, expand on the subjects of her lyrics and collaborate with alternative music stars like Bon Iver and The National.

Academic Jennifer Beckett, one of the convenors of Melbourne's recent Swiftposium, describes Swift as a ""life writer"", comparing her to Dolly Parton, another country music star who became more mainstream and is adept at telling stories in song.
""Storytelling is the way that we understand the world. So [it's good] to have an artist like Taylor Swift, who's so good at storytelling, help fans to understand the world that they're in, and to make sense of the changes that they've gone through and how they've grown up or to re-understand something about themselves,"" Dr Beckett says.
Swift's melodies themselves are sometimes reminiscent of an earlier time.
""She does have quite an 80s aesthetic in her work, even though it's got the pop aesthetic of now in her lyrics,"" says composer Caerwen Martin, pointing to songs like Wildest Dreams and Style from Swift's album 1989.
Taylor Swift is a prolific singer-songwriter, reportedly writing more than 100 songs solo since her first album.  (Getty Images)
Similarly, more mature fans appreciate her as an old-school singer-songwriter, Jericho says.
As the megastar prepares to grace Australian stages later this week, Swift's name is everywhere — from the schoolyard to scholarly symposiums.
""I think actually playing music live, playing guitar, is something that older people like me …. can see something … that they saw in musicians that they'd liked growing up.""
And for many, it's all about singing along to her catchy tunes.
""Her music is just so uplifting,"" says 50-something Leigh McCluskie.
""I'm a huge fan of dancing in the kitchen, I think that's what keeps you young, so I credit Taylor with keeping me young at the moment.""
Much has been said about the sense of community that younger Swifties feel, but there's something in that for older fans too.

""What I think appeals to older women about Taylor, [about] being part of her fandom or saying you like Taylor Swift songs, is it comes with less judgement than it does with other younger demographics,"" McCluskie says.
""You're not looked down on, they don't go, 'You old woman, what are you doing?'
Canadian Carol Hansson, who runs that GenX Swifties Facebook group, agrees.
""[I enjoy] the fandom itself and how kind and generous and just funny everyone is,"" she says.
Some of the GenX Swifties say they bond with their kids or even their grandkids via her music. For example, Kathey Reilly Hunt says she first learned about Swift from her young niece in 2006 and it grew from there.
""[Now] for my grandkids, I am the one leading the way. I love talking about the songs. Now we look forward to singing them together,"" she says.
McCluskie agrees. She and her teenage daughter regularly dissect the intricacies of Swift's songs, and she can see how other mums use Swift's music to connect with their kids.
""If you can find common ground in that and it gives you a language to talk, or just have fun together … it's a bonus for a lot of women,"" she says.
Enjoying Taylor Swift's music is not just a female pleasure.  (Getty Images)
It's not just a maternal bond.
Federal MP Andrew Wallace, 55, is such a big Swiftie, he petitioned her to make a stop in Queensland on the Eras tour — to no avail.
He nominates All Too Well (yes, the 10-minute version) as his favourite song because he loves the music, the lyrics and the break-up tale behind the song.
""Just as the father of four daughters, it hit a chord with me. You know, just that really vulnerable age of young women.""
He can see parallels between Swift and his daughters' lives, and the challenges they face.
""I respect her as someone who has grown through and lived through an eating disorder. My family has been through a similar situation,"" he says.
For many middle-aged fans, watching Swift overcome challenges they've faced in their own lives is inspiring and heartening.

More than one GenX Swifties describes her as a ""badass"" for the way she stands up for herself in a traditionally male-dominated music industry, whether that be counter-suing the DJ who groped her in 2016, taking back control of her work after her back catalogue was sold against her wishes, or pushing back against misogynistic criticism.
""She gives voice to GENERATIONS of women who are tired of 'that 1950's shit they want from us!'"" says Christina Cook [paraphrasing Swift's song Lavender Haze].
""We've watched her handle herself with grace while being attacked for simply existing. She's also a strong advocate for disenfranchised communities.""
Hansson agrees: ""She's doing it her way and she's not apologetic about it. And it's amazing, being able to see a strong woman persevere, and not take any flack for it.""

Indeed, Swift's success is breathtaking. She's reportedly worth more than $US1billion thanks to income from her Eras tour, music and streaming deals.
At the end of 2023, she was named Time's Person of the Year. And in February she made history at the Grammys as the first person to take home a fourth Album of the Year award, overtaking Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon and Frank Sinatra.
As someone who knows how challenging the music industry can be, Caerwen Martin admires what Swift has accomplished.
""So many of us are cheering that she's managed to do so well as a businesswoman in the arts,"" she says.
That she's retained control of her artistic vision is also impressive, Martin says, given a male producer often has so much sway in a recording session that female artists can walk out feeling as if the end result is no longer their work.
Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is the first tour to cross the billion-dollar mark, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end charts.
""I definitely cheered when I was hearing the stats about how much she'd made and how she'd done it and how she had released things. I'm just like, 'Oh, man, you've done it. You're very clever'.""
Martin has another theory as to why Swift appeals, particularly to women over 45.
She says for those who grew up in the 1980s, many of the musical icons of that time were highly sexualised. However Swift has what Martin describes as a ""very boundaried, almost anti-overtly sexual"" persona.
""When we were young … there was so much pressure towards the feminine sexuality overtness that perhaps we weren't really wanting.""
""[Swift's] allowed to be herself without having to adhere to either a man or a male gaze and be professional and be successful.
""And she's allowed to have all of those things that we kind of dreamed of being and couldn't access, but can now … now we're older.""
Finally those who are parents see Swift as a powerful role model for their children.
""[Swift] knows that when she stands up for herself that the message is going to her fans — because she's very fan-focused —  [is that] she wants them to emulate what she's doing, she wants them to know that it's OK to stand up for what's right. … It's a really positive thing for the next generation … it gives them power,"" McCluskie says.
You Need to Calm Down video
Martin agrees, remembering how pleased she was hearing her kids singing along to Swift's boppy LGBTQI+ rights anthem, You Need to Calm Down.
""That point of view was so beautiful and gratifying as a mum to hear my kids so validated. So there's also that very, very strong appeal for women my age.
""Not everyone has children. But those of us who do really find it really gratifying, that there is an artist that our children can love that is safe.... [and who is] a strong advocate as well for things that we really care about.""

It's Taylor Swift Day. There has been a hum in the air from the start, a feeling that everyone in the city is tilting their bodies slightly towards the MCG, just waiting for the moment when she will finally take the stage.
Well, that's the folklore, anyway.
And it's certainly true for the young fans who huddled in blankets to see her private jet touching down just before 1am on Thursday. It's why people spent thousands of dollars to come to the show — a young Perth woman of no more than 20 details the long list of expenses that she copped to get here: ""I'd go anywhere to see Taylor,"" she says.
We'll find out later there are 96,000 people here — the largest turnout to the Eras global tour so far, Taylor tells us — and almost every single person is decked out.
Excited Taylor Swift fans outside the MCG.
Bulging pink clusters of people are gathered on every corner, practically jumping up and down with excitement. Fans with friendship bracelets from wrist to elbow adjust their shiny skirts and tops and animatedly speculate about what the two secret songs will be (more on that later).
Friendship bracelets have become a staple at Swift's concerts — in honour of a line from the song You’re on Your Own, Kid from her album Midnights: “So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it.” (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)
I love a lot of Taylor's music, but the breathless furore in the build-up to her arrival had me feeling a bit sceptical. How could one woman, albeit a very rich and talented one, possibly live up to all the hype?
But within five minutes of her explosive arrival on the stage, I thought to myself: She's going to do it.
Friday's MCG crowd in Melbourne was the biggest of her career so far. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)
Thanks to the wall-to-wall coverage of her shows around the world so far — and the release of the Eras concert film in October — most of us know the premise of this tour.
It covers 10 albums the star has released, from 2008's Fearless, to 2022's Midnights.
It's out of the woods and into the big city for a group of outback Swifties from Western Australia.
We also knew that she would start with the Lover era — the one awash in candy pink, featuring such bangers as You Need to Calm Down. And it doesn't disappoint, particularly her acoustic version of title track Lover, featuring a pale pink guitar and pastel-clad dancers whirling around her in ecstatic pairs.
But it's when she transitions into her second era — Fearless — that she really hits her stride. The key change in classic teen track Love Story has the crowd screaming and jumping like they're in a mosh pit.
The songs keep coming, the giant screens behind the stage offering videos and voice-overs while Taylor does a lightning-fast costume change. The breaks are negligible, and before you know it Taylor is back, her red lipstick perfect.

There's something a bit like musical theatre in the way this show runs, particularly the props and stage design.
The folklore era — one of two woodsy albums Taylor released during the pandemic — opens with her lying dreamily on the roof of an actual cabin, smoke puffing from the chimney.
In Midnights, the dancers each have small individual ladders with a fluffy white cloud at the top. During the track Vigilante Shit, the troupe and Taylor writhe and dance on chairs in powerful unison (another musical theatre staple, and perhaps a welcome moment where she actually gets to sit down for a second).
During the track The Man, the stage is set up to look like an office, and Taylor dons a sparkling blazer. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)
For the Evermore era she appears in a long yellow dress and green velvet cape, the dancers carrying glowing orange balls.
It's a strong witchy mood, and Taylor leans into it, swirling her cape theatrically.
The show is cheesier than I expected it to be, in a way that's endearing. Taylor doesn't act like the most famous woman on the planet; she sticks out her tongue and does over-the-top mimes that match her lyrics, hamming it up the whole time.
And making it clear that she doesn't take herself too seriously allows her to get away with her more earnest moments — and things like having a moss-covered grand piano and a wooden microphone.
""I want to hear 96,000 people sing Champagne Problems with me,"" she says in front of said piano during the evermore era, where the crowd heartily joins in, and then spends about three whole minutes afterwards cheering and chanting her name.
One fan was overwhelmed at seeing her idol. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)
Covering 10 albums in one show is no small feat, and it requires almost three-and-a-half hours to do it.
At times, the continuous gear shifts feel a bit jarring, whipping away from an era just when it feels like it's hitting its stride. But then she plays the opening notes of the next hit, and you're pulled right back in.

The folklore era drags a little, perhaps because it's a slower album and comes in the latter half of the show, when everyone's feet are starting to get tired (almost every single audience member leapt up at the start of the show and didn't sit back down).
Taylor Swift fans descended on the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the first Australian show of Swift's Eras Tour on Friday night.
But ensuring each album gets a nod is smart. It captures so many different fans, handing each of them their breathless moment.
""I wanted everyone to feel like we made the show for you,"" she tells the crowd. ""Whether you're new here or you've been hanging out with me for 15 years.""
The acoustic set — where she plays her two ""surprise"" songs each night — is not just a highlight because it's the only part of the show we can't predict. First, she plays hit song Red on guitar, beautifully and simply.
She then strides over to the piano (now moss-free) and, after quite a confusing will she/won't she play a track from her imminent new album (she instead shows us an alternate cover?), Taylor breaks into a stunning rendition of You're Losing Me, the ballad initially released as a bonus track on the extended version of Midnights.
It's the first time she's played the song live, she tells us, and a woman behind me actually sobs, her hand over her mouth.
There are 15 backup dancers in the Eras concert ensemble, bringing movement and vibrancy to the show. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)
Marking each era also serves as a handy reminder to everyone, particularly the haters, of how successful her career has already been.
The energy doesn't stop for the entire show, right up until the moment that Taylor does a deep bow, mouths ""I love you"" and disappears, the crowd beside themselves with adulation.
Taylor Swift may sing that she is sick of running as fast as she can in her song The Man, but this epic show demonstrates that she and her juggernaut of success won't be slowing down any time soon.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-17/feud-capote-v-the-swans-taylor-swift-in-common/103475708,Why Taylor Swift can't shake the haters,"When the legendary New York society star Slim Keith met the man who would become her third and final husband, she couldn't understand a word he said but married him anyway.
Slim had already divorced film director Howard Hawks, who cheated terribly on her. She had married producer Leland Heyward, who cheated terribly on her. Her final capitulation was to a pompous British banker who, she said, sounded ""as if he had marbles, mush, and a lot of steak-and-kidney pudding in his mouth … I might as well have been talking to the Ayatollah"". By the time their car pulled away to take them on their honeymoon she knew she'd made a mistake.
By all accounts Slim, one of author Truman Capote's fabled girlfriends, was one of the wittiest, most charming and most privileged women of her age. Along with the rest of her coterie — now portrayed in Ryan Murphy's delicious streaming series Feud: Capote V The Swans — she was very stylish, and she was very smart. And she made repeatedly stupid decisions.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
So did some of the other brilliantly plumaged Swans, a circle of well-married society women that included CZ Guest, Gloria Guinness and Babe Paley, who tolerated her husband's infidelity to the point of despair, while denying herself food and living on whiskey and cigarettes.
There's a reason you never see Babe, played brilliantly by Naomi Watts, ever take a bite at those endless lunches. There's a reason the novelist Tom Wolfe called these women Social X-rays.
The women's helpless reliance on men who mistreat and mislead them is both familiar and confounding: set this show in the 1860s (The Gilded Age) or the 1960s (Mad Men) and it's all the same. In many women's lives it's still the same now.
Absorbing as the series is, it's impossible to watch these wealthy, stylish and smart women spin themselves into ever-diminishing pools of booze and chiffon without thinking of another bird of a feather who has just landed here and draws all attention to her: one just as smart, stylish and accomplished as them but who refuses to be caged.
And what do these brilliant swans and the enormously talented Taylor Swift have in common? Absolutely nothing.

It's a remarkable contrast to draw. The life realities that stir sympathy towards the manipulated Swans are exactly what enrage those who resent Swift: a pretty singer who owns all the decisions of her life and lives it as she pleases.
The dependence that makes the Swans so irresistible to so many men is precisely what's missing for the countless Americans enraged by Swift's dominance of music, popular culture and just about everything else. She seizes control of her life, her music, the means of production and the narrative of her love life – good or bad.
And there is little more maddening to some people than that.
While the Swans, when wronged, sing sad songs to their untrustworthy writer friend who goes on to record them in his own reedy voice, Taylor writes them, records them and releases them herself – and then recovers with a big girls' night out.
As the megastar prepares to grace Australian stages later this week, Swift's name is everywhere — from the schoolyard to scholarly symposiums.
I have enjoyed watching the fury her popularity and notoriety stir up. It's pretty hard to argue with millions more in football club revenue just because she likes a tight end. (Who doesn't?)
The unfortunate choices the Swans make are for the main part decisions of their times: they were all capable, professional women who would drift in their social circles without the anchor of a mate. But perhaps their most foolish decision of all was to trust a grifting flatterer with a wickedly brilliant pen who was prepared to use it on the one they once loved.
Looking at the love stories of Taylor's life, I guess that's the one thing a Swift has in common with a Swan.
This weekend, it's Swifts all the way. Get on board.

Sitting in her studio, bopping along to some of Swift's greatest hits as she found a blank space on her client, Ms Moore said it was one of the reasons why she loved the pop sensation.
""Starting my own business, it's been inspiring seeing how well she holds herself and how incredible a businesswoman she is,"" she said.
Ms Moore is just one business benefiting from what experts have dubbed the ""Swiftonomics"" phenomenon.
The idea that a single pop star can create massive economic ripples when she moves through the globe might sound funny.
But there are some serious numbers backing up that theory.
About 620,000 tickets had been sold to Swift's Australian shows before a last-minute release of more tickets dropping on Tuesday.

The City of Melbourne estimates Swift will bring in more than $1 billion to the city's economy alone, during the three touring nights there.
For some perspective, Lord Mayor Sally Capp said over an entire year the city normally saw about $3.3 billion in economic value from its major events schedule.
""Tay Tay is going to deliver a third of that over a weekend,"" Cr Capp said.

That's about 28 per cent of what it expects to generate into this year's visitor economy for major events.
But not everyone's convinced by those projections.
KPMG chief economist Brendan Rynne said his colleagues had projected Swift would help the Australian economy grow — but only by around $10 million in the March quarter.
""Technically any spend associated with these patrons is just a transfer from one category of spending (or saving) to another,"" he said.
The visual signs of Swift's devoted fandom are obvious — several people rugged up in a bid to catch a glimpse of the star as she touched down in Melbourne in the early hours of Thursday morning.

Fans eager to join the bracelet-swapping trend that emerged in the wake of Swift's recent Midnights album have been heading to craft shops to stock up on beads and bracelets.
This week, fans have been reporting shortages in online shopping, while artisan bead makers have enjoyed a bump in sales.
A casual glance at Google searches over the past year also suggests interest in Swift's MCG gig could be even greater than its traditional blockbuster event — the AFL grand final.
While it's been a boon for legitimate businesses, others have also been cashing in on the Swift ticket interest online.
Authorities estimate hundreds of thousands of dollars have been lost to scammers offering fake tickets through a series of sophisticated traps.
With only two locations lucky enough to secure concert dates, fans are flying in from all over.
Qantas and Jetstar are expecting a 30 per cent increase in passengers on flights into Sydney and Melbourne over the concert period, compared to the same time last year.

Qantas added more than 60 additional flights — that's 11,000 seats — when Swift first announced she was coming to Australia.
This month, it had to add a further seven flights to continue to meet demand.
Those flights are coming from Brisbane to Sydney and from Perth, Auckland and Brisbane to Melbourne.
Qantas' bookings increased by a whopping 1,500 per cent when tickets went on sale compared to the same period the year before.
Jetstar said nearly 10,000 passengers booked flights when the concert was announced and it had seen a steady increase in bookings over the past eight months.
While Brisbane might have missed out on snagging dates for the Eras Tour, Swifties around the Sunshine State won't let that stop them from catching a glimpse of the singer.
It's estimated an additional 25,400 people will pass through Brisbane Airport's terminal to travel to Swift's concerts in Sydney and Melbourne, according to Brisbane Airport Corporation.
It expects passenger volumes will increase by 5 per cent around the concert days, with a surge in bookings between February 15 and 19 for the Melbourne dates and between February 22 and 27 for the Sydney dates.
The airport also said there had been a ripple effect on connecting flights from Queensland's regions including Cairns, Townsville, Mackay and Rockhampton, with an estimated 3,400 additional passengers.
All those fans flying into Melbourne and Sydney need somewhere to stay — and the accommodation industry says it's reaping the benefits.
Hotels in both Sydney and Melbourne are near capacity with the Australian Hotels Association saying it's amongst the highest demand they've seen for an event.
""The demand is phenomenal,"" CEO Michael Johnson said.
""I'd say we have seen events in the past create similar levels of demand but not for a while.""

The association expects occupancy rates in Melbourne to exceed 90 per cent by Friday.
It's more than a 25 per cent increase from what they were at the same time last year.
Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is the first tour to cross the billion-dollar mark, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end charts.
For Sydney, occupancy rates are sitting at about 86 per cent and are also expected to reach more than 90 per cent when Swift touches down.
Mr Johnson said it was about a 5-10 per cent increase on the same time last year, keeping in mind WorldPride was held in Sydney that weekend.
""Events of this nature are just a huge demand driver for the hotels and the visitor economy,"" Mr Johnson said.
""It's more than just our industry … it's the restaurants, the pubs, theatres, cafes, tourist attractions, everyone benefits.""
The economic impact of the superstar even found its way into a press conference grilling of the Reserve Bank of Australia's governor, Michele Bullock.
Ms Bullock was asked how the extraordinary interest and spending on Swift tickets fitted into the picture of services inflation across the nation.
As the megastar prepares to grace Australian stages later this week, Swift's name is everywhere — from the schoolyard to scholarly symposiums.
But Ms Bullock said in her own family's experience, people ""forewent other things in order to be able to afford Taylor Swift"".
""People are deciding what's really important to them and what's not as important to them,"" Ms Bullock said.
The Eras Tour is expected to be the first in history to gross over $1 billion.
Despite this, she's only expected to pocket about $35 million.
Economist Angel Zhong said Swift was the latest example of women positively impacting the Australian economy.
It follows the likes of the Barbie movie which surpassed $1 billion at the box office and the Women's World Cup which injected $7.6 billion into the economy.
Dr Zhong said we shouldn't underestimate the power of a role model like Swift.
""[Role models] boost the confidence of other women in Australia and around the world,"" she said.
""[And] encourage women to be more powerful and confident in how they approach their day-to-day lives.""",Mikaela Ortolan,Thu 15 Feb 2024,0

But there's been an unexpected casualty, with bead and bracelet shelves suffering a surge in popularity ahead of the Australian leg of Swift's Eras Tour.
In the eight-month lead-up to the concerts, Swift super fans have been gathering together to craft dozens of friendship bracelets.

""It's become a bit of a trend for the Eras Tour, that everyone makes friendship bracelets,"" said Swift fan Sophie McGlaughlin.
""You bring them all to the concert and you trade them with other people, so everyone gets to share around the bracelets that they made.""
Sophie and friend Kristy Allison are both travelling from Adelaide for Swift's concerts next week, and have prepared more than 50 bracelets each.
""Swifties are all so nice to each other … it's just a good way to make connections,"" Ms Allison said.
The trend stems from a track off of Swift's recent album Midnights, and has swept into Swiftie culture since the beginning of the international Eras Tour.
""So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it.""

But with thousands of fans heading to Swift's Melbourne and Sydney shows, craft stores have been bearing the brunt.
""We got our beads from Spotlight, and we ordered them online, but I think we had to order them about five different times,"" Ms McGlaughlin said.
""They kept getting refunded because they would get sold out as soon we put them in our cart.
""It was pretty difficult, but we managed to get enough in the end. We probably left it a bit too late.""

While the bracelet shelves were bare in Spotlight and Lincraft, boutique bead stores were relishing in the demand.
Owner of Adelaide's Need4Bead, Karen Cornish, said she has seen a massive jump in sales since the moment the Australian leg of Swift's tour was announced, and began making products specifically for fans.
""Sales have been through the roof, the kits are amazing sales,"" Ms Cornish said.
""They're dwarfing any other kit that we have at the moment.
Ms Cornish is not a member of the Swift army, but clued on to the trend early on after seeing an immediate increase in demand.

""As soon as the concerts were announced, we had people come in that weekend, looking for specific colours, the letters to make their bracelets,"" she said.
""Being inquisitive, I asked them what they were doing, and they were quite happy to share.""
Although running a small store, Ms Cornish's large stock managed to keep fans satiated for months, but eventually she also fell victim to Taylor-mania.
""We did get a small shortage probably three or four months ago, but we were quite easily able to get in more stock,"" she said.
It's been more than five years since Taylor Swift performed in Australia, and for many native fans it's been a long wait.
""I've been a Taylor Swift fan since I was very young, so I'm very excited for this concert,"" Ms McGlaughlin said
""It was kind of like my childhood, that I grew up listening to Taylor Swift.""

As the megastar prepares to grace Australian stages later this week, it seems Swifties are everywhere, from the schoolyard to scholarly symposiums.
So why is the world so obsessed with Tay Tay, and do we need to take Swifties more seriously?

Why is the world obsessed with Taylor Swift?  (BTN High)
In Australia right now, Swift holds the top five spots on the ARIA album chart, headlines about her romance with US footballer Travis Kelce are everywhere and on TikTok fans are wildly churning out friendship bracelets spelling out the names of her songs.

Earlier this week, a group of scholarly Swifties converged just a few kilometres up the road for Swiftposium, an academic deep dive into the singer's cultural impact.
Keynote speaker Brittany Spanos, a senior writer at Rolling Stone, teaches a class thought to be ""the world's first course on Taylor Swift"", at NYU's Clive Davis School of Recorded Music.
Her course isn't the first to be hinged on the work of a famous musician, but when it launched in 2022 the media interest was intense.
Ms Spanos says for her, a self-confessed Swift fan deeply entrenched in the comings and goings of the music world, the press attention was ""the first hint that the vibe was shifting dramatically around Taylor Swift"".
""(Last year) would confirm my suspicions that she had somehow become the most god-like superstar in the planet, bigger than I thought was even possible,"" Ms Spanos says.

When we took to the streets to find out what makes Swift so popular among one of her key demographics — teenagers — the word ""relatable"" was a big recurring theme.
And Swiftposium co-organiser Jennifer Beckett agrees.
""She's an amazing lyricist, she speaks about her life and as people have grown up with Taylor Swift … there's always a song that speaks to the moment you're in,"" Dr Beckett says.

""Taylor Swift has been compared to a lot of poets like Sylvia Plath … she's not just talking about relationships — she's vulnerably talking about relationships.
""She's taking you through the emotions she's having. It gives you something to connect to and … there's a simplicity to what she does, which makes it easy to grab on to.""
Dr Jennifer Beckett is a Swiftposium co-organiser. (ABC News)
From roots in country, Swift has reinvented herself multiple times.
After crossing into the world of pop, she worked with indie darling Jack Antonoff on the album 1989 in a partnership that endures today.
Then stripped-back albums like Folklore and Evermore, featuring collaborations with The National and Bon Iver saw her shapeshift again.
And with each reinvention she's brought with her a swathe of new fans.
""We've watched her grow up, we've watched her turn into different people along the way — she has reinvented herself,"" Dr Beckett says.
""And that's part of the things that keep you attached to an artist.""

Back on the street, fans say the star's connection with Swifties is another huge factor in her success.
And Ms Spanos agrees Swift's ability to intimately connect with her admirers is one of her superpowers.
""She's always been so engaged with her fandom,"" she says.
""She's commenting on videos, she's engaging with people … she's really active in a way that's so fascinating — she doesn't have to do, but she still chooses to do it.
""And [she] seems to understand the in-jokes that are happening (among fans) and makes references to them … she's so good at that kind of intuitive marketing and connection with her fans.""
The star's use of Easter eggs — tiny messages hidden in places like liner notes, lyrics or Instagram captions — also keeps fans highly engaged and is a source of much discussion online.

But both Dr Beckett and Ms Spanos acknowledge that Swift is also a ""savvy"" businesswoman.
""She makes very, very good decisions. And she has an excellent PR team,"" Dr Beckett says.
She says Swift's move to re-record her old albums after her masters were sold to music producer Scooter Braun was a serious power move.
""It's like a director's cut of a movie, right? That's effectively what she's done … and then when she renegotiated her new record contract, she negotiated it so that she owns her masters,"" Dr Beckett says.
""I've never heard of that in the industry before — so she's reshaping industry.""
Ms Spanos says in the pre-internet world ""all-consuming pop-cultural moments"", such as Beatlemania, Madonna madness and the hype around Michael Jackon's Thriller, were more common.

""[But] we have so few monocultural moments these days, largely because of how much entertainment consumption is determined by algorithms that allow us to tune out anything that does not match or adhere to our preset tastes and standards,"" she says.
Dr Beckett says there's a ""kind of legacy of having gone to that gig"" that people are keen to be a part of when it comes to the Eras Tour.

""I think about my dad talking about how he went to a Doors concert in Dublin,"" she says.
""Having been at an event like that is something you will have for the rest of your life.""
Ms Spanos says the public conversation about Swift's relationship with American footballer Travis Kelce is also an interesting indicator of the star's present popularity.
""She seems to be in a moment where more people love her than … truly hate her,"" she says.
""The conversations around her have changed so much.""
A decade ago, people would have been saying ""I can't wait for the break-up album"", Ms Spanos says.
But right now, fans are genuinely thrilled for the lovebirds.

Dr Beckett suggests another reason for Swift's enormous popularity at present is the hope she offers fans.
""I think, at the moment with everything that's going on in the world … we're looking for the hope,"" Dr Beckett says.
""We're looking for the person who displays their emotions in a way that is … not horribly violent.
""We want that sincerity … we're actively craving it — and Taylor Swift, in many ways, provides that for us.""

According to Lord Mayor of Melbourne Sally Capp, Swift's three Melbourne shows are expected to provide the city with $1.2 billion worth of value.
Melbourne's major events usually bring in about $3.3 billion annually — and Swift's visit will provide roughly a third of this in a single weekend.
But it isn't a phenomenon that's unique to Australia.
With sold-out shows in February, Taylor Swift mania is heading to Australia.
Wherever Swift performs, economic benefits flow, in an effect dubbed ""Swiftonomics"".
Every road Swift walks is seemingly paved with gold.
Last December, she was named Time magazine's Person of the Year.
And although her hesitancy to use her enormous platform to champion change has attracted significant criticism, she's also credited with increasing voter registration in the US on several occasions, with the power of a single social media post.
There's speculation about whether she'll weigh in on the upcoming battle for the White House.
Dr Beckett says while for some people the idea of studying Swift in an academic setting is fanciful, the pop star has an enormous amount of sway.
""When you come across someone who has the level of power and influence that Taylor Swift … has right now, economically, in terms of changing hearts and minds, all of that — we really need to unpack it,"" Dr Beckett says.
""And also, I think it's really easy to look at something like pop culture, or particular figures, and go, 'Oh, they're just a pop star with a lot of teenage girls who like them — what serious about that?'
""Teenage girls are very serious people … but they also have an enormous amount of economic clout, and they're going to grow up to be voters.
""So, I think that in belittling Taylor Swift, you're belittling young people in many ways … and that is never a good thing to do.""",Unknown,Wed 14 Feb 2024,0

There were rumours that Alicia Keys might be one of these people.
Sure enough, Keys made a grand entrance, dressed in red and behind a red piano, belting out her song If I Ain't Got You before joining Usher for their duet My Boo.
Rapper, producer and record executive, Jermaine Dupri also joined Usher on stage before singer songwriter H.E.R. took to the stage with an electric guitar.
Usher wrapped up his set with Yeah! And was joined by collaborators on that song Lil Jon and Ludacris.
Usher has collaborated with countless stars, so bets were placed on who might join him.
He had promised during an Apple Music press conference that his guest stars would ""deserve just as much recognition for what they do in their careers"".
Usher took it back to 1997 album My Way and the hit with the same title when he began his performance, quickly transitioning to Caught Up from Confessions.
Relive Usher's performance and check out his set list here.
Beyoncé tried her very best to ""break the internet"" as part of a Super Bowl ad for Verizon.
She certainly got people talking when she used the ad as a springboard to announce new music.
Move over Usher and Taylor Swift, Beyoncé's attempt to 'break the internet' was the big musical talking point of the Super Bowl.
It will be her eighth studio album.
She was pictured in the stands with her husband music mogul Jay-Z.
It was bound to happen. As soon as Taylor Swift's private jet touched down in the US from her tour in Japan, of course there would be just as much attention on her as there was on the game — and her ""boyfriend"".
In fact ""Taylor Swift's boyfriend"" has been trending on X since the show got underway.
Wonder what Super Bowl champion Travis Kelce thinks of that.

Steele Harris-Walker has an obsession with pop vinyl figurines.
At last count, there were more than 1,000 staring out from rows of shelves in his room in Broome, far north Western Australia.
Modern-day collector Steele Harris-Walker is obsessed with pop vinyl figurines.
With a retail value of about $20-40 apiece, they represent a significant investment for the dance teacher and school education assistant.
""I'd always liked the look of the pop vinyls and I knew as soon as I started buying them that I'd have to buy more than one or two,"" Mr Harris-Walker said.
Rows and rows of TV and movie characters, like My Hero Academia, line the shelves. (Supplied: Jayden Harris-Walker)
The figurines are vinyl toys depicting celebrities or characters from movies and TV.
Many are mass-produced, others are limited edition only.
As with most toy collectables, they are more valuable for resale if kept in the original packaging.
""But the ones that are still in the box, they're not allowed to come out.""
Characters from Star Wars, Stranger Things and Harry Potter are organised into sections, alongside Naruto and My Hero Academia pops.
While Mr Harris-Walker is reluctant to pick a favourite, the 25-year-old credits Japanese anime TV series Dragon Ball as the main reason he started collecting the pop vinyls.
""I just really like the look of the Dragon Ball characters. They're all charging up and getting angry, all ready to fight,"" Mr Harris-Walker said.

Another character that Mr Harris-Walker enjoys is Wally, namesake of the popular children's puzzle book, Where's Wally?
Children (and adults) pore over the book's illustrations to find the character, so Mr Harris-Walker moves the figurine version around the shelves of his room too.
""I'll put Wally somewhere random on the wall, and then they have to find him. I bring them in and just say, 'Where's Wally?',"" he said.
Mr Harris-Walker loves showing visitors his collection, and especially enjoys their shocked reaction.
""They're like, 'Wow, what the? This isn't your room?' And I say, 'Yes, this is my room',"" he said.
Mr Harris-Walker says there's too many in his collection to pick just one favourite. (ABC Kimberley: Roslyn Butcher)
It is hard not to feel that they are staring at you, with some of the characters having bobble heads and enlarged eyes.
""It's not until other people walk in and I see their reactions and I think, 'Oh yeah. I guess it is quite a large collection of things staring at you'.""

So declares HorsegiirL, AKA Stella Stallion, in the intro to her 2023 dance/electronic hit, My Barn My Rules.
MCR-T & horsegiirL - My Barn My Rules (Official Video)
The mixed-species Berlin DJ, also of mixed equine (Mustang x Haflinger in case you're curious) and human descent, has become a viral internet hit since embracing her horse/girl identity on stage and releasing a string of horsie EPs in the last few years, from Harvest Heartbreak to Farm Fatale.
And now she has flown all the way to the southern hemisphere for the first time, to perform a string of gigs in Australia and New Zealand as part of St Jerome's Laneway Festival — to the delight of thousands of reawakened horse girls.
She still can't quite believe it.
""I'm just this little pony out here making my silly little music and I really never thought I one day would be galloping with thousands of people on the other side of the world in Australia,"" HorsegiirL tells ABC Entertainment.
""I feel very, very grateful and happy to share the joy of horse music""
But the horse girl resurgence has been a long time coming.
Maybe you weren't a horse girl. But chances are you knew one at school.
Black Beauty changed them (I say ""them"", because horse girldom knows no binary gender, despite its gendered name).
Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron broke them. And can you blame them with that soundtrack?
They lugged around copies of The Saddle Club before the Bonnie Bryant books were adapted into the 2001–2009 television series, and could be found glued to the TV set every night a new episode of the show aired, gleefully singing the theme song.
Keenan Macwilliam, who played Carole in the show's first two seasons, wasn't a horse girl before being cast in the role. But she quickly became one — and would still describe herself as a horse girl at heart today.
""When I got the role I started riding — they gave me intensive training — and I just became addicted to it,"" says the Canadian, who now lives in NYC and works as a filmmaker, creative director and photographer.
""I was obsessed with my horse [on the show], Starlight … and I kept riding in between the seasons and after the show as well.""
hello world - the saddle club
When the first season aired, she was living at home in Ottawa, going to school and doing normal stuff.
""People went absolutely berserk for it in Australia and I only realised that when I came back for the second season. I couldn't believe how freaky everyone got about the show,"" she remembers.
At first, Macwilliam struggled to make sense of why The Saddle Club had blown up. What followed was a crash course in the 2000s horse girl identity.
""I remember, some of the people I talked to, their rooms were covered in posters of horses and they were drawing horses in every class,"" Macwilliam says.
She today describes a 2000s horse girl as anyone who felt horses had a sort of ""mystical quality"" about them, and spent as much time as possible poring over stories featuring ""girls with long, flowing hair with horses who like, read their minds, and they always ride bareback"".
""There was lots of lore around horses just knowing what you need — and showing up when you almost die — that was already embedded in society,"" she adds.
Bob's Burgers — Jericho scenes
""Attach on top of that shows like The Saddle Club … it was a recipe for complete mayhem.""
As the generation of early noughties horse girls began entering awkward teendom in the mid-00s to early 2010s, society stripped their horsie special interest of its childhood innocence.
The mocking of horse girls became de rigeur, with horse girl jokes in popular culture and real life tending towards some combination of the following ideas: Horse girls believe they are horses; horse girls want to do bestiality with horses (??? no link you heathens); horse girls are all thin, privileged and stuck up white girls, which makes them deserving of our derision.
As a horse and a girl, HorsegiirL thinks most horse girls ""are incredibly cute and just amazing human beings"" and doesn't feel like people should have ever hated on them.
She thinks the use of ""horse girl"" as a derogatory term in the past has a little to do with jealousy, a little to do with that ""equestrians = snobby rich white girls"" perception that remains rife, and a little to do with misogyny.
""I think it's jealousy, especially if it's a horse girl that actually knows how to ride a horse, because to be in tune with an animal that way, you have to really trust each other and know how to communicate without using human language,"" HorsegiirL says. (And as a horse, wouldn't she know?)
""And there's the stereotype that equestrians are all snobby rich girls … I think it's probably a class thing — having a horse is incredibly expensive.""
Fashions of the '90s and noughties are making a comeback — low-rise jeans and all. So, why are we drawn to past styles, and who decides which trends deserve a comeback?
It's important not to confuse 2000s horse girls with that rich person you knew at school who grew up with a fancy pony daddy bought them, winning blue ribbons at horse shows, with little or no concern for animal welfare.
A true 2000s horse girl wasn't obsessed with horses for what they could make horses do, but for who they innately are.
They weren't necessarily privileged enough to be able to spend time with real-life horses. But imagined that, if they were they able to, their horse-human bond would surpass everyone else's. (The sense they're ""not like the other girls"" was a key part of the 2000s horse girl identity).
And for what they may have lacked in proximity to their beloved equines, they made up for with an exhausting knowledge of horses.
""But I also think the media has played a big part in painting the narrative of who is a horse girl, or who owns a horse,"" adds HorsegiirL.
""In North American Indigenous culture, there have always been horse girls — horse people — and a lot of the early cowboys were Black. There's also a huge Hispanic culture of cowboys and girls, called [Vaqueros]. But there's been a lack of representation of those different kinds of horse people.
So, horse girls made themselves small. But HorsegiirL doesn't think horse girls ever really disappeared — just went into hiding, biding their time.
Old Town Road's success was fuelled by social media, but behind the memes is a debate about who gets to decide what defines a music genre.
With his inescapable 2018 country-rap hit Old Town Road, Lil Nas X, accidentally or not, reminded people of the overlooked history of African-American and First Nations cowboys.
Suddenly, a queer Black cowboy was at the forefront of pop culture — giving the horse girls laying dormant a little power in the process, too.
The next year, hobbyhorse girls shed any self consciousness and pranced in public.
The year after that, Black equestrians started making noise and claiming their space in the wake of the Black Lives Matter reckoning following George Floyd's death.
And, in 2021, a manifesto for the reclamation of the ""horse girl"" descriptor was published. (OK, it was more a series of heart-felt essays on the subject).
At the same time, film and TV production companies returned to horse girl canon stories, remaking Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron and Black Beauty for a new generation, along with fresh ""I'm not like the other girls"" horse stories such as Unicorn Academy.
Then the rich horse girls started leaning back into the equestrian aesthetic.
Macwilliam puts a lot of the recasting of horse girls in the 2020s as cool down to this — as well as social media.
""There's just a really heavy femme aesthetic you can lean into that's like a venn diagram with the ballet/dance girl aesthetic [think ribbons added to braids worn underneath helmets], wealth and colonialism,"" she says.
""And there are a lot of horse girls who are creative people and are infusing their horse girl energy into the things they do, which is then bleeding into the mainstream and places like TikTok.""
In 2021, Kim Petras rocked up to the Met Gala dressed as a horse/girl — Macwilliam counts the designer behind the look, Hillary Taymour of Collina Strada, as a friend, and confirms Taymour is a real horse girl.
The following year, Chanel declared horse girls high fashion, sending Monegasque princess/showjumper Charlotte Casiraghi down the catwalk astride a horse for their SS22 runway show. Stella McCartney swiftly followed suit, setting her FW23 Paris Fashion Week show in the École Militaire's sand arena, models strutting alongside a herd of dappled grey horses working at liberty.
What is 'indie sleeze' and why are we obsessed with nostalgia in pop culture?
And then there's HorsegiirL — the Black woman/horse/DJ whose current success suggests we're not only at a place where horse girls are done hiding their horse obsessions, but have also heard all the jokes and love making them themselves.
HorsegiirL's songs include the sort of random equine facts horse girls were labelled cringe for for so long (""Old Billy was the oldest recorded horse / Who lived to the ripe old age of 62 / This one is for you Old Billy / Yay!""). But instead of being embarrassing, the lyrics feel ironic-cool in a way only a DJ hailing from Berlin could truly attain.
And HorsegiirL regularly nickers throughout her fast-paced, happy hardcore tracks, the sound of hoofbeats often accompanying her cathartic neighs — acts horse girls would have been ruthlessly mocked for a matter of years ago.
But at HorsegiirL's live shows, they feel emboldened enough to whinny right back with abandon.
Because the horse girl is back and stronger than ever.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-09/usher-super-bowl-press-conference-special-guests/103446898,Usher hints at who he'll invite to join him on the Super Bowl half-time show stage,"The Super Bowl has always been as much about the advertisements and half-time show as it is about the main event.
The Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers will go head-to-head on the field on Monday (Australia time).
And on the stage halfway through the spectacle will be R&B star Usher who is headlining the half-time show.
At the official Super Bowl LVIII press conference on Friday presented by Apple Music, Usher was tight-lipped about who he might bring out on stage with him, but told radio host Nadeska Alexis, people need only look at his hits to determine for themselves who might join him.
""I think I made it easy for myself when I decided to have like, features on songs that became hit records,"" Usher said.
""That gave me the greatest point of reference.
""But here's what's beautiful, is that Apple has been following me throughout this entire process.
""So we're in the process of figuring out how we're going to share it with you, break the internet by that conversation.""
Fans are wondering whether the singer will make it to the Las Vegas game on Sunday after playing her last concert in Japan on Saturday.
Usher, whose full name is Usher Raymond IV, says his journey to the Super Bowl stage is being documented.
""There's also, too, a documentary crew that's been collecting all of the moments that have happened,"" he said.
""There's cameras around us at all times, looking at the process that we went through.
""You get a chance to see from the first moment that I got the call all the way up to the moment that I walk off the stage. At least that's the idea.
""But I am definitely, you know, went through a lot of ideas of who I would have share this moment with me.
""And I do feel like the people who are gonna share it deserve just as much recognition for what they do in their careers, whether we have collaborated together or whether they've had moments of their own.""
And a short film titled Where's Usher, which was screened after the press conference has people guessing that Ludacris will be one of his features.
In the film, a cast of characters including Ludacris, Taraji P. Henson, Lil Jon, Wesley Snipes, J Balvin and Anderson .Paak ""lose"" Usher after an epic night out and work together to try and find him in time for the Super Bowl.

Ludacris and Lil Jon feature on Yeah, which went to number one on the US and Australian charts.
Usher — Yeah! (Official Video) ft. Lil Jon, Ludacris.
Usher has worked with many other big name artists throughout his career.
His other famous collaborations include:
Usher himself made a cameo appearance on the Super Bowl stage in 2011 when the Black Eyed Peas headlined, and experienced a performance snafu that few people would have known about till now.
""Oh, man,"" Usher said.
""Oddly enough there was a moment that only I think I remember.
""My hand got caught in the wire that was holding me, like, 30 feet in the air. And I almost missed my first mark.
""I was like, 'Oh my god don't let this malfunction cause me to miss something.'
""But, that was one. The second was, afterwards, and how amazing it felt to be in front of that many people and feel the energy.
""So much so that it made me really passionate about eventually getting this moment that I'm getting to have.
""But it was really fuelled by being able to be just in that moment with the Black Eyed Peas.""
Before kick-off, country music star Reba McEntire will sing the national anthem. Hip hop artist Post Malone will perform America the Beautiful and Andra Day will perform Lift Every Voice and Sing, known as the black national anthem.
Taylor Swift is expected to be in the audience watching her boyfriend, tight end Travis Kelce, who plays for The Chiefs.
Usher is the first independent artist to headline the Super Bowl.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-09/bob-marley-one-love-biopic-movie-film-rita-marley/103438386,Many people feel a connection to Bob Marley. His widow Rita knew him better than anyone,"One of the most chilling moments in Bob Marley: One Love, is seeing his wife Rita Marley sitting in a car as someone sneaks up behind her and points a gun to her head.
It's a shocking moment that underscores a devotion and love story that will fittingly make its premiere in cinemas on Valentine's Day.
The film focuses on the period between 1976 and 1978, a time that represented a period of turmoil for Jamaican musician and global superstar Nesta Robert Marley.
A clear theme of the film is the love story he shares with his now widow Dr Alferita Marley, known as Rita.

Most would be aware that Bob Marley achieved a great deal in his 36 years.
But until now, perhaps only his inner circle were aware just how instrumental the matriarch of the Marley dynasty was in his success.
By his side for much of his journey, Rita Marley doesn't have a lot of lines in the film, but her presence is strong.
Flashbacks show their younger selves meeting and falling in love, filmed at significant places in Jamaica including Port Royal, and the pier where Bob and Rita first kissed.
The film's attention to detail and commitment to authenticity feels like a love letter of sorts from her to him — Rita Marley is listed as a producer.
Bob Marley and his music are legendary. (Supplied: Chiabella James)
Rita was part of a trio of vocalists known as the I-Threes, who joined the Wailers in 1974 and were an integral part of their sound. She later forged a career as a solo artist.
Bob Marley takes centre stage in the movie as he did in life, but the film has two people at its core.
""This really is the Bob and Rita Marley story, in a lot of ways,"" says director Reinaldo Marcus Green.
""It is a story about both of them.
""She is the backbone to the journey of Bob.
""She made a deep commitment to that man which lives on to this day, including with this film, which is why she's a producer on it.""

Despite becoming one of the most influential reggae musicians in the world, it's taken decades for Bob Marley's essence to be encapsulated on film.
It's a family affair: two of his children — eight-time Grammy winner Ziggy; and Cedella, who was 13 when her father passed away — were also producers, while eight-time Grammy award winner Stephen Marley was music supervisor. Hollywood superstar Brad Pitt was an executive producer.
Despite the family's involvement, Ziggy Marley says they didn't allow emotions to get in the way.
""We have approached this as a creative project, not an emotional thing,"" he said.
""My emotions are beyond this. It's about showing the truth.""
Part of that truth is revealing the not-so-pleasant moments in his life.
On December 3, 1976, seven armed men stormed Bob Marley's residence at 56 Hope Road in Kingston. They shot Bob in the chest and arm and Rita in the head, also shooting two others.
Miraculously, all survived. And remarkably, just two days later a defiant Bob Marley took the stage at the Smile Jamaica concert in his hometown to perform live, in a bid to unite a country through music that was divided by its two political sides.
""The people who are trying to make this world worse aren't taking a day off,"" Marley said at the time.
""How can I?""
Rita Marley is a musician in her own right. (Supplied: Chiabella James)
He would soon self-exile to London to write an album he felt could spread his message of peace and unity.
That album was Exodus by Bob Marley and the Wailers, an album Time Magazine named the best album of the 20th century.
It was released June 3, 1977.
The heavy task of playing a star so universally revered went to Kingsley Ben-Adir, already famous for being Barack Obama in The Comey Rule, Malcolm X in One Night In Miami, and a Ken in Barbie.
Rita and Bob also had a musical partnership. (Supplied: Chiabella James)
Rita Marley is played by Lashana Lynch (The Woman King, No Time to Die).
The teenage versions of Bob and Rita are played by Nia Ashi and Quan-Dajai Henriques.
Lynch did her research and it shows. She read Rita Marley's autobiography, No Woman No Cry, watched years of video interviews and performances and spent months with the Marley children.
""But my real research began when I had meetings with Mrs Marley,"" Lynch said.
""It was here that I built a clearer picture of her internal voice, her love for Bob, and the indescribable power she possesses. Once we met, a lot started to click into place.""
Bob Marley's children were young when he died. (Supplied: Chiabella James)
""Bob and Rita's relationship is the emotional centre of this film, no question,"" cinematographer Robert Elswit says.
And although the film doesn't shy away from revealing Bob Marley's infidelities during his marriage to Rita, it's clear the desire of the filmmakers to make something equal parts a biopic and an intimate love story was realised.

The Bear breakout star, who cut her teeth doing improv and stand-up, started strong with her opening monologue.
""SNL means so much to me, this really is a dream come true,"" she said, briefly choking up.
""I was born and raised in Boston, which makes me the first Black woman to ever admit that. Three days into February and I'm already making history.""
The sketches are all pretty great (shout-out to the NSFW song about the Dune popcorn bucket we covered last ICYMI), but if you're going to watch just one, it has to be her turn as Solomon, a nerdy teen boy who is ""hypnotised"" into coming out as bisexual (and a few other things, too). SNL must be kicking themselves that she never auditioned.
A post shared by Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl)
Meanwhile, SNL has announced that comedian Shane Gillis will host in two weeks.
That was surprising to hear, given Gillis was announced as a cast member back in 2019 then swiftly removed after his history of offensive comments came to light online. Maybe this week's sketch about a game show called Why'd You Say It? will return — but some things aren't as easy to make a joke out of.

This is not a drill, smut queens. The very first teaser for Bridgerton series three is here and the sexual tension is already glorious.
Bridgerton sneak peek
Per the books, the third instalment of the story will focus on the love story of Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) and Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) aka Lady Whistledown.
Tragically for those among us who love a good binge, season three will come to us in two parts. The first is set to drop on May 16, with the second a few weeks later on June 13. RIP to the girlies.
Let us now hard segue into the second huge teaser of the week: Squid Game. Netflix has given us even less to go on for this show's series return, releasing just 18 seconds of footage in promo of the Korean hit.
We have no release date info beyond the fact series two will air at some point this year.
But we do know that Lee Jung-jae is back as Seong Gi-hun, his hair still a vibrant red, with Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) and Recruiter (Gong Yoo) returning too. There will also be fresh blood — K-drama star Park Gyu-young (It's Okay to Not Be Okay) will join the show, playing an as-yet unnamed character.
And then we finally have the full trailer for the highly anticipated Amy Winehouse biopic, Back to Black, set to be released on April 18 in Australia.
Back to Black trailer
This isn't the first time we've seen Industry star Marisa Abela's impression of Winehouse ahead of the film's release, but it still jars.
Fans are in an uproar about the upcoming Amy Winehouse biopic. We're here to help you understand why.
Billed as a ""celebration"" of the iconic late star and directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (of Fifty Shades of Grey fame), Back to Black promises to offer ""an unflinching look at the modern celebrity machine and a powerful tribute to a once-in-a-generation talent"".
Whether it does so remains to be seen. But on the plus side, at least it also stars Jack O'Connell as Winehouse's ex-husband, Blake Fielder-Civil.

Hold onto your wine glasses, pop royalty will soon be landing in the Barossa Valley.
Now resolutely in their 50s, the three remaining members of 90s boy band Take That are playing seven shows across Australia and New Zealand — proving that you don't have to be boys or really even a band to claim the title.
Robbie Williams may not be gracing the stage, but nobody cares about that because audiences will get to revel in the comeback of Ricki-Lee (who I have always had a soft spot for after she was grossly under-appreciated on Australian Idol, am I the only one?) and the British glam of Sophie Ellis-Bextor — the real reason why everyone is so excited about this announcement.
The star has not only been living rent-free in the hearts and heads of every millennial out there, but she has also captured Gen Z, with countless imitations of that particular naked dancing scene from Saltburn hitting TikTok. And then there was last month's very excellent Like a Version from Royel Otis.
Sophie will be absolutely murdering the crowd on the dancefloor in WA, and then will leave a trail of joyous carnage in the Barossa, Melbourne, Sydney, the Hunter Valley, Mount Cotton, Queensland, and Auckland.
We cannot wait.

Revered art-rock band Talking Heads were reportedly given 80 million reasons to re-form this year, yet it still wasn't enough to convince the famously estranged group to put their differences aside and get back on stage.
Billboard reports that multinational entertainment company Live Nation offered the band $80 million USD (that's $123 million) to play ""six to eight festival gigs and headlining slots"" following an historic non-musical reunion at screenings of their 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense, remastered by A24 last year.
A look inside one of the most fascinating bands of all time
Besides one three-song performance at their induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, the band have not performed together since their acrimonious split more than 30 years ago.
The legacy of the band arguably looms as large as ever, though. In addition to Stop Making Sense's re-release, last week A24 announced Everyone's Getting Involved: A Tribute To Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense.
The tribute album will be packed with high-profile artists including Lorde, Miley Cyrus, girl in red, and The National, though there is no release date at this stage.

In a series of since-deleted Instagram comments, True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto apparently criticised the show's fourth season, which was penned by director, writer and producer Issa López and stars Jodie Foster and Kali Reis.
It was reportedly Night Country's links to the cold case in True Detective's first series, led by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, that drew Pizzolatto's ire.
""So stupid,"" he is said to have written.
""I certainly did not have any input on this story or anything else. Can't blame me.""
True Detective: Night Country trailer
López took the high ground in an interview with Vulture: ""I believe that every storyteller has a very specific, peculiar, and unique relation to the stories they create, and whatever his reactions are, he's entitled to them. That's his prerogative.
""I wrote this with profound love for the work he made and love for the people that loved it. And it is a reinvention, and it is different, and it's done with the idea of sitting down around the fire, and [let's] have some fun and have some feelings and have some thoughts. And anybody that wants to join is welcome.""

French pop duo Daft Punk called it quits in 2021, but could another album be on the way? (Sony Music)
Iconic French duo Daft Punk officially broke up in 2021, but one of the collaborators from their final album — 2013's Random Access Memories — has revealed there's a follow-up that was never released.
The unreleased record is ""in limbo"", according to Quinn Smith, a prolific session drummer who performs under the mononym Quinn and who gave the scoop to alt.news 26:46, a student-run media organisation.
After working with The Robots (aka Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo) in 2013, Quinn says he spent ""four, five days"" in a Los Angeles studio back in 2018, working on ""experimental … spontaneous"" ideas with the duo.
On the 10th anniversary of Daft Punk's Random Access Memories invading a rural Australian town, we look back at arguably history's strangest album launch with the folks who were there and ask 'Why Wee Waa?'
Quinn also says storied session guitarist Paul Jackson Jr. (another Random Access Memories alum, who's recorded with Michael Jackson and Elton John) came through.
Will we get to hear this Daft Punk material? Quinn says he keeps checking in on the record: ""I'm told they're working on it. It's coming out of the locker. I asked Daft Punk permission to talk about it for another article, 'cause they're very secretive as you know. And the greatest guys.""

The woman behind the wig who gave us the deep dance floor catharsis of Chandelier seems to be done with misguided attempts at movie making or weighing in on issues that don't affect her, and is instead focusing on what she's great at – writing bangers.

We are so lucky: Tracy Chapman has blessed us with a beautiful performance of her 1989 song Fast Car at this year's Grammys.
She was joined on stage by country singer Luke Combs, whose cover of the track helped it re-enter the charts last year, and made Tracy the first-ever Black woman to win a Country Music Award.
It was a pretty special moment, given the 59-year-old hasn't performed publicly in years, and it also marks 35 years since Chapman won a best female pop vocal performance Grammy for the track.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-02/mr-and-mrs-smith-tv-series-donald-glover-maya-erskine-/103419350,New Mr & Mrs Smith TV series creates another deadly combination,"There'll be comparisons made. That's what we do as humans.
But the new Mr & Mrs Smith television series differs considerably from the 2005 film of the same name.
In the film starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as John and Jane Smith, the assassin couple discover they are secretly working for rival agencies and have been hired to kill each other.
Meanwhile, in the new eight-part Prime Video series starring and co-created by Donald Glover (Atlanta, Swarm) and starring Maya Erskine (Pen15), the titular characters are strangers masquerading as a married couple who undertake a series of missions together.
When they start to catch feelings for each other, tension builds.
Co-creator of the series Francesca Sloane, who worked with Glover on Atlanta, outlines in the production notes that good spies need to be ""masters at lying"".
""On the other end of that, in order to be in a really healthy relationship, you have to be really honest,"" she said.
Bringing those two things together, she feels is ""the heartbeat and the impulse of the entire series.""

""What would a series feel like if our heroes weren't the two most beautiful people on the planet, but instead, were two lonely people, two underdogs, wanting more from life than what they currently had?"" Sloane posed.
""What if our John and Jane could be anyone — could be you and me?
""And lastly, but most importantly, how can two people let their guards down to fall in love with each other while simultaneously putting their lives on the line?
""What does love look like with spy stakes?
And that's the key to the new series — expressed best through the wry humour that litters each episode, all of this when the consequences could be deadly.
Glover points out that writing the script during the pandemic influenced the outcome.
""A lot of the themes in it deal with the emotions we all had being locked up in a house,"" he said in an interview provided to media by Amazon.

The TV series is slower paced than the film – which makes sense – there are an additional six hours to build up to the action.
And it's satisfying when the action does kick in.
But the best scenes are comedic. Couples therapy between two spies is especially hilarious (the therapist thinks they're computer software engineers).
The pairing of Erskine and Glover has got critics frothing at the mouth.
""Of course things soon turn messy, as you would expect from two attractive people,"" declares Rolling Stone.
""These are two very attractive people, my friends,"" writes The Guardian.
Maya Erskine said in an interview she decided Jane would still be sexy but in a different way to Angelina Jolie's portrayal.  (Supplied: Prime Video)
But Erskine herself has previously told The Guardian that trying to push herself to match Jolie's ""sexy"" wasn't a healthy way to approach the role.
""You look at Angelina Jolie in the film and she's a total goddess, and I was thinking: 'Well, I can't be her… I decided it would still be sexy, but in a different way.'""
Erskine called Jolie a ""total goddess"". (Supplied: Disney+)
And the intent – to portray a charmingly adorable but dorky couple – was realised.
Thinking about these characters as ordinary is a major departure given the legendary off-screen antics of the original couple.
Pitt and Jolie had undeniable chemistry and emerged from the film a real-life couple in a union that wouldn't last.
But their relationship is seared into the annals of popular culture.

When they became Brangelina, as they would come to be known, the reaction was feverish.
This had a lot to do with the fact that when Pitt and Jolie started working together, Pitt was married to Friends star Jennifer Aniston – with fans, and tabloid publications, taking sides.
Pitt and Aniston ended their marriage in 2005.
Fast forward a decade and Jolie and Pitt acrimoniously divorced in 2016, amidst a messy custody battle and allegations by Jolie that Pitt was violent towards some of their children.
But their celluloid paring as Mr & Mrs Smith remains available to stream on Disney+.
Backstage drama, while far less explosive, played out with the TV series as well.
Fleabag star and creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge was cast as Jane but six months in, abandoned the project due to ""creative differences"".
And people questioned – in a world full of Hollywood remakes – why Mr & Mrs Smith needed to join that list.
""Once we were announced, we saw the comment, 'Who needs this show?'"", Sloane said of the online commentary that followed the announcement.
""We didn't blame them. In a culture heavily inundated with remakes, this was a reasonable reaction.
""No one would need a show that retold the same blockbuster movie.
""But what we set out to do was to make something wholly original.""
And original it is.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-02/david-shrigley-tennis-ball-exchange-ngv-triennial/103400760,"David Shrigley doesn't approve of your tattoo, but he'll still draw it on","David Shrigley is a creature of habit.
The 55-year-old British artist wears a uniform — a dark polo with jeans — has a disciplined studio practice — 10am–6pm with a power nap in the middle — and is currently abstaining from meat, booze, gluten and dairy: ""New year, new me.""
It's not the rock'n'roll existence you might expect of one of the most well-known and acclaimed conceptual artists working today.
And yet, it's befitting of someone whose images of banal objects and droll musings about daily life have become his signature, and whose blend of cynicism and hope has amassed more than a million Instagram followers.
When we meet in a back room at the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV), Shrigley is affably jet-lagged and wearing his dark polo. His manner is very British, very deadpan, and quietly hilarious.
He's just touched down for the launch of his work, Melbourne Tennis Ball Exchange, an interactive installation in which punters can trade in their manky, chewed and beaten-up tennis balls for one of 8,000 brand-new ones, on show as part of the NGV Triennial Extra program.
Shrigley's muse for the project? His dog Inka.
""Her relationship with tennis balls isn't really to do with the way that human beings interact with objects, [in] that they have value and they want to keep them. The dog just sort of chases it and then gives up on it,"" he says.
""I guess it's like a substitute for a rodent or something.""
Shrigley says Melbourne Tennis Ball Exchange is about ""the joy of trade"". (Supplied: NGV, Tim Carrafa)
Originally staged at Stephen Friedman Gallery in Mayfair (UK), Tennis Ball Exchange subverts the traditional commercial gallery transaction (in which art is traded for sometimes vast sums of money). For Shrigley, swapping one object for an identical one ""felt like a sort of Dada-ist form of commerce"".
He was also surprised by the way the audience interacted with the work, having assumed people would simply trade a dirty tennis ball for a clean one.
""What actually happened was a lot of people made artwork on [the balls] and it became an opportunity to make an artistic intervention in the exhibition,"" says Shrigley.
I take this cue to retrieve my offering from my bag — it's a tennis ball with ""ART"" written on it.
""I like that"", he says and pulls out his phone for a photo.

For a work that Shrigley admits is ""pretty stupid"", it fits neatly into his highly conceptual oeuvre.
From pulping unwanted copies of The Da Vinci Code and reprinting them as George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, to making an LED digital clock that is blurry to the point of illegibility, or a giant, perfectly usable phone that has every number except ""0"", Shrigley has mastered the ability to mess with everyday objects in a way that tenderly mocks our engagement with them.
The seven-metre tall bronze sculpture, titled Really Good, is meant to be both ""ironic and sincere"". (Supplied: David Shrigley and Stephen Friedman Gallery)
But his works on paper — drawings and paintings combining simple images and text — are both Shrigley's bread and butter, and his true love.
They also appeal to his enormous online audience, with dark humour that's both a salve in an otherwise glossy, influencer-driven landscape, and a cutting reflection of our own existential ordinariness.

Some posts are a sure-fire hit: cats, dogs and anything drug-related.
Others have missed the mark: a few ill-timed posts were inadvertently read as political commentary, so Shrigley now leaves the posting to someone else.
But it's not really about the numbers. For Shrigley, making the work is about pursuing pleasure and joy.
Listen: David Shrigley on ABC RN's The Art Show
Given the simplicity of the images — his handwriting could belong to a primary schooler — you'd be forgiven for thinking Shrigley was deliberately snubbing his art school training.
""I have an odd relationship to the way that I go about making graphic art, whereby it's sort of borne of having some craft skills, but not really having evolved a great deal since I was about 12,"" he says.
You tell 'em, Shrigley. (Supplied: David Shrigley)
There are very few artists whose work you're as likely to encounter in a homewares shop as you are in a gallery.
But, like Andy Warhol or Keith Haring, Shrigley has managed to perforate the art world and thoroughly embed himself in the culture.
Through his '""Shrig Shop"" and countless collaborations, he's designed an eclectic suite of objects: Shrigley patches, pins, postcards, keyrings, salt and pepper shakers, tote bags, puzzles, teapots, rugs — even inflatable pool toys.

But of all the Shrigley merchandise, a bespoke tattoo reigns supreme.
It's a trend that ""happened by accident"".
""I'm willing to do it, I just don't approve of it"", he laughs.
Nonetheless, the cracks in Shrigley's disapproval are evident: a section of his website is dedicated to those ""indelibly marked"" by his designs, and he's participated in live tattooing events.
""I still embrace it to some extent, but I embrace it reluctantly because this is the path the art has taken me, and I find that amusing.
""I find it funny that I don't want to do it, but I still do it.""
And so, it's with some trepidation that at the end of our chat, I pitch Shrigley a trade: I contributed ""ART"" to his body of work, and now he can contribute ""ART"" to mine.
I don't mind if he thinks it's stupid, I offer as an out.
""The thing is, right: when you're me, there's nothing stupid.""
The ""joy of trade"" in action. (ABC Arts: David Shrigley)
Trade complete, we part ways: Shrigley to enjoy an overdue, gluten-free lunch, and me to call some tattoo studios.
But before he walks out the door, he turns back. ""You don't have to do this.""
""I know"", I say. ""Thanks Dad.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-30/reality-tv-dominating-australian-screens/103404904,"Why 11 seasons in, MAFS is so far from being cancelled","Channel Nine's Married at First Sight (MAFS) has once again dominated Australia's TV ratings with a reach of 2,461,000 viewers for the season 11 debut.
The show beat out Network 10 and Channel Seven's heavy hitters Survivor Australia and Australian Idol, and the ABC's political documentary Nemesis.
MAFS follows pairs of strangers who first meet at their ""wedding"" before living together for several weeks. Each season is full of drama, including affairs between couples, leaking OnlyFans images and participants throwing drinks at each other.
For the number of people who are watching, there are often just as many calling for it to be cancelled.
Although MAFS topped the overnight ratings, the fact that season 9 of Idol reached 1.7 million viewers and season 9 of Survivor reached 1.1 million, shows that there is a strong appetite for reality TV in Australia.
Editor and co-creator of TV Blackbox Steve Molk said this is because of the way reality TV allows viewers to ""take a sneak peek into other people's lives"".
""[It allows viewers] to find joy in their happiness and to find joy in their sadness sometimes,"" he said.
A Nine spokesperson said MAFS engaged Australians year on year ""and continues to become a part of the cultural conversation that captures the Zeitgeist"".
Whatever the reason viewers tune in for, MAFS will certainly be bringing joy to Channel Nine's bottom line.
""This is its 11th season, so by now they are deep in relationship with advertisers,"" Mr Molk said.
""They know how to integrate products into the show relatively seamlessly. It's a known entity in the advertising market.
""So if you've got a product that you want to get in front of the most viewers at this time of year, that's the show that you want to target.""
Married at First Sight has been on air for 11 seasons.  (Supplied: Nine)
The rate of return is likely massive for Nine. Compared to scripted drama, there can be real cost savings in reality TV.
""It costs a lot of money to make these [reality] programmes,"" Mr Molk said.
""In the case of MAFS, where they've got 10 couples, there's a cameraman and sound guy and a producer with them for the best part of 18 hours a day.
""And then there's an army of editors, producers, executives and a whole bunch of people in the background ... all of which exist in the scripted drama environment.
""The key thing that is missing is script writers, and we still need a cast and we pay actors more than we're going to pay reality participants.""
He said reality TV also had the added bonus of being able to easily integrate sponsored content into the show to increase their bottom line.
Survivor Australia first aired in 2002. (Supplied: Network 10)
Commercial networks are required under the Broadcasting Act to provide 55 per cent overall Australian content on their primary channels between 6am and midnight. Reality TV is just one way they fill that quota.
Coming this year, streaming services which tend to have a larger portion of scripted drama shows, will also have to fulfil local content quotas.
From mid-2024, the federal government will require major streaming platforms — such as Netflix, Disney and Amazon Prime — to put some of their revenue back into Australian content.
Mr Molk said the benefit paid streaming services have over free-to-air was the amount of data they have available about viewers, making it easier for them to commission drama more specifically.
And while streaming on-demand services continue to be popular, the 7:30pm time slot remains vital for free-to-air networks.
""Reality at 7:30 has become not only a standard but a necessary standard for the commercial networks.
""They know if they get the right formula or the big new thing, they'll get a big audience guaranteed.""
But as is with any show, there comes a point where audiences start to wane.
""The magic of television programming is working out when to cancel it or to move it on before it fades,"" Mr Molk said.
""And every year for the past three years I would have said, 'This is it, they can't do anymore, get any more outrageous, get any bigger than this with Married at First Sight'.
""And yet, every year the casting just continues to surprise us and deliver a massive series.""

Mr Molk said Channel Seven's revamp of Australian Idol was likely giving the network diminishing returns year on year and was an example of a show that would be at a crossroads of rejuvenating or dropping.
""We saw that with MasterChef particularly, it was huge for about five or six seasons then it started to fade.
""They made some changes, some didn't work, some did... it's done OK, but it's never really hit those heights again.""
Early seasons of MasterChef Australia were massively popular.  (Masterchef Australia: Channel 10)
However, Mr Molk said he expected MAFS will be around for many seasons to come.
""It will always top the ratings now until it goes beyond the pale, until someone does something that causes enough, broad outrage that the show gets 'cancelled' I think it'll be hard to stop.""",LBy Liana Walker,Tue 30 Jan 2024,0

Her devilish single Paint The Town Red just pipped the second place tune, G Flip's The Worst Person Alive.
The top 10 tracks from triple j's Hottest 100 of 2023 include songs from Doja Cat, G Flip and Dom Dolla.
Don't feel too bad though, G Flip walked out with their own mark in the history books, breaking a 20-year record for most entries from a single artist in a Hottest 100.
It was previously held by Wolfmother, who got six songs in the 2005 countdown, then Spacey Jane equalled the record in 2022.
But on Saturday, G Flip blew the competition away by landing a massive seven songs in the countdown — including the #2 spot, and three tracks in the top 30.
But perhaps the most interesting stat to come out of the weekend was the #79 spot for the Like a Version of Video Killed the Radio Star, by Teenage Dads.
That is the EXACT same spot that the 80s original claimed in triple j's Hottest 100 of All Time in 1998.
Coincidence?!!?! … yeah, probably.
Nicki Minaj is very, very angry at Megan Thee Stallion, spending her weekend incessantly live-streaming and posting hundreds of times across Twitter and Instagram in response to a line in Megan's new song, Hiss.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
The two — who have a song together, with Minaj popping up on Megan's 2019 Hot Girl Summer — have had bad blood since Megan released WAP with Minaj's enemy, Cardi B.
The feud was recently reignited with Minaj's potential diss on Pink Friday 2 track Red Ruby Da Sleeze. Minaj raps: ""I don't f*** with horses since Christopher Reeves"", seemingly a reference to the rapper's moniker.
Hiss bites back, with Megan's lyric: ""These hoes don't be mad at Megan/These hoes mad at Megan's Law."" Megan's Law is a US law requiring law enforcement to share information on registered sex offenders with the public: This includes Minaj's husband Kenneth Petty.
Minaj has since gone on a tirade, which is getting increasingly dark. (It's far too long to embed, but this one sums up the energy).
In her rapid-fire responses, Minaj has made reference to the rapper's late mother and implied Megan lied about being shot in the foot by rapper Tory Lanez in 2020. Lanez is currently serving a 10-year jail sentence over the crime, following a trial where he denied shooting her, with rapper Drake calling her a liar on track Circo Loco.
Minaj has also just dropped her own diss track, titled BIGFOOT and riffing off Megan's shooting, an incident Megan told the court she will ""never be the same"" after.
The track includes a threat to buy Megan's masters and more assertions that Megan lied over being shot. It ends with a minute-long voice memo where Minaj insinuates she could reveal secrets about Megan's family.

Tributes from everyone's neighbours and good friends are pouring in for 90s star Troy Beckwith, who died at age 48 on the weekend.
Beckwith portrayed the character Michael Martin — known by some viewers as ""Sicko Micko"" for his ""antisocial behaviour"" — from 1991-1998. His character was a troubled young man, acting out after the death of his mother in a car accident.
Fellow Neighbours star Kym Valentine (right) took to social media to pay tribute to Troy Beckwith (left). (Facebook: Kym Valentine)
Some of his most memorable moments include breaking out of a youth prison dressed as a woman, getting shot when he tried to intervene in an armed robbery, and getting busted with needles, only for it to be revealed that he was helping his diabetic girlfriend take her insulin.
Beckwith's family confirmed he died long after being diagnosed with cancer, and that he requested there be no funeral.
Other familiar Neighbours faces — like Kym Valentine, who portrayed Libby Kennedy alongside Beckwith — took to social media to pay their respects.
""It pains me so much to have to say this. Our dear old friend Troy Beckwith has passed away. Another member of our tv family gone way too soon …"" Kym wrote, alongside the above photo.

Fo shiz fo shiz, Justin Timberlake — or Lake, Timber-timber-timber-LAKE, as he's apparently called — is back, launching his first album in six years with new track Selfish.
Titled Everything I Thought It Was, the album is Timberlake's return to more straightforward R&B after 2018's Americana-tinged Man of the Woods. It's being billed as an ""introspective"" and ""honest"" album, no doubt a reaction to a rough few years in the public eye.
Timberlake hasn't necessarily done anything bad in recent years (depending on your feelings on said Americana-tinged album).
Instead, he's lost esteem due to cultural reexaminations of how he handled both his breakup with Britney Spears, highlighted in her recent memoir, and the fall-out from his 2004 SuperBowl performance with Janet Jacskon.
While he publicly apologised to both Jackson and Spears in 2021, it's clear Spears fans aren't quite ready for his comeback.
With Selfish on sale, Britney's biggest supporters have decided to bulk-buy Spears' song of the same name — a deep cut from 2011 album Femme Fatale.
So, 13 years after its release, Selfish by Spears is currently charting #1 on iTunes worldwide, two spots ahead of Timberlake's comeback track.
You could even say What Goes Around… Comes Around.

Fresh from a collaboration with Mumford & Sons, Pharrell Williams has another surprise for us: Piece By Piece, a biopic on the uber-successful hit-maker's life, made in collaboration with the Lego Group.
Set to hit screens on October 11, the film is teased to be ""an unparalleled motion picture experience that captures the magic and brilliance of Pharrell Williams, one Lego brick at a time.""
Producer, songwriter and recording artist Pharrell Williams has pretty much done it all.
Williams has partnered with Focus Features and director Morgan Neville, who's got a lengthy track record for producing docos around iconic figures (from Mickey Mouse to Anthony Bourdain) as well as musicians (Taylor Swift, U2, Leonard Cohen and Netflix's adaptation of the Song Exploder podcast).
""Five years ago, Pharrell Williams approached me with the idea of helping him tell his story through Lego animation,"" says Neville.
""It was one of those rare moments where I knew in a second that this was a journey I wanted to go on.""
It's probably too early to tell, but given Pharrell's sizable connections to A-list musicians, we're willing to bet Piece By Piece will have a blockbuster soundtrack to boot.

The video shows her stop talking to them and later motion to a member of staff in what appears to be a plea for help.
And look, we're guessing this was some sort of PR stunt designed to fabricate a viral moment (Kareem's video featured ""#ad"" at the end of the caption) but, before we get further confirmation of that, we have to at least ask: Is Tyra Banks lowkey a furry?

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-27/expats-review-nicole-kidman-amazon-prime-video/103388744,Nicole Kidman's swanky Hong Kong lifestyle comes to a tragic halt in new drama Expats,"In Lulu Wang and Nicole Kidman's new miniseries, Hong Kong is a city that alternately haunts, delights and humbles its wayward residents.
A street lamp somewhere is always casting jaundiced beams into shoebox bedrooms and palatial apartments alike, illuminating the foibles and follies of their occupants with an unsparing eye.
When a typhoon swirls in the series' penultimate instalment — a feature-length epic titled Central and the crown jewel in Expats' six-episode run — it feels nothing short of biblical.
“I always wanted to explore the intersectionality of class and race and gender,"" creator Lulu Wang told The Guardian. (Supplied: Prime Video)
Freighted with the history of all of cinema's classic deluges — say, the blinding cloudburst of Bong Joon-ho's much-loved Parasite, or the froggy downpour of Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia — the typhoon in Expats is menacing and purifying in equal measure.
It punctures the hermetic security of the city's wealthiest, whose high-rise abodes — unfailingly staffed by an underclass of live-in domestic ""helpers"", as they're euphemistically known — are suddenly besieged by blackouts and leaks.
For others, the storm severs the monotony of urban life. It is a glimpse of fantasy; a chance to surrender any mortal woes to the firmament overhead.
Above all, the rain in Expats is a purge, flushing long-held resentments and covert affairs out into the open. Hong Kong, as multiple characters caution throughout the series, is small. Nothing can stay hidden for long.
To shoot Expats, Kidman was exempted from Hong Kong's 21-day mandatory hotel quarantine during the pandemic. (Supplied: Prime Video)
And there are secrets aplenty in this series: a sinuous, often stirring adaptation of American author Janice Y. K. Lee's 2016 novel The Expatriates.
Lee's book tends towards a class satire of the mannered foreigners who work and frolic across their own artificial versions of Hong Kong. Wang strengthens the narrative's emotional heft.
Expats is the story of a trio of American women, each of them indelibly marked by a tragedy in the recent past whose backstory takes the better part of two episodes to unfold.
At the centre is Kidman's Margaret, whose swanky lifestyle with her husband is brought to a screeching halt when her youngest son Gus goes missing in a night-time market.
Wang created and directed the series after being approached by Kidman. (Supplied: Prime Video)
Flinty and falsely composed, Margaret is Kidman's prototypical character, recalling everything from her Oscar-nominated turn as a grieving mother in 2010's Rabbit Hole, to her lovelorn widow in 2004's Birth.
Kidman, here, is note-perfect, her steely resolve belying her manic desperation in the increasingly futile search for her son.
Hilary (Sarayu Blue) is Margaret's downstairs neighbour and one-time confidante, though their friendship has waned in the fallout of Gus's disappearance.
Twenty-something Mercy (newcomer Ji-young Yoo), meanwhile, was Gus's babysitter on the night he vanished. She is spiky, defiant — though her demeanour barely conceals a deep well of guilt.
""People like me,"" she intones in Expats' opening minutes. ""Are they ever forgiven?""
Yoo describes the difference between an 'expat' and 'immigrant' to The Guardian: ""Expats are temporary, they’re going to be leaving."" (Supplied: Prime Video)
Hong Kong, to all three women, holds an almost mystical appeal. They were lured here by love, money, or the promise of escapism, and each remains steadfastly bound to the city despite the aftershocks of tragedy.
As in her breakout film The Farewell — about an American woman journeying back to China for one last visit with her dying grandmother — Wang helms Expats with a masterful delicacy.
A morass of existential quandaries bubbles beneath the series: the stark class disparities of contemporary Hong Kong; the violence and anguish of motherhood; the pain and privilege of immigration.
In the distance, the city's 2014 Umbrella Revolution begins to stir.

Wang, however, never exploits these themes for entertainment. Expats could've easily imitated the gossipy thrills of fellow Kidman production Big Little Lies, or the eat-the-rich antics of The White Lotus, yet Wang imparts a singularly observational tone to her production.
It's when she turns her camera away from the main cast and towards the domestic staff propping up their lives that the magic of Expats reveals itself.
Towards the end of the series, we catch a simple shot of one of the helpers (Amelyn Pardenilla) on her single day off, rehearsing a song with her choir in a public square.
The song is Katy Perry's Roar; she beams, voice soaring to the heavens. It feels like clouds parting, a storm breaking — a brief second of clarity amidst the turmoil.

A cause of death wasn't given by her children Leilah, Jeordie and Beau Jarred who broke the news on social media, saying she ""passed, peacefully, out of this world and into the next"".
Melanie was just 22 years old when she performed to hundreds of thousands of people at the Woodstock music festival in 1969.
Born Melanie Safka in New York in 1947, Melanie said she was inspired to write the hit Lay Down (Candles in the Rain) after looking out into the crowd at Woodstock and seeing just that – people lighting candles as it started to rain while she was on stage.
Brand New Key was her biggest hit but it was reportedly banned from some radio stations due to a belief by some that the lyrics were suggestive.
Melanie topped the charts, including in Australia, for well over a decade, with her rendition of Ruby Tuesday by the Rolling Stones considered memorable.
The Hilltop Hoods sampled her 1972 track People in the Front Row in 2003 for the track The Nosebleed Section.
According to Rolling Stone, who were quoting her representatives, Melanie also founded the first female-owned independent label in rock history called Neighborhood Records.
Her family has asked for privacy as they grieve her death.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-25/griselda-blanco-sofia-vergara-netflix-series-true-story/103375916,Sofia Vergara is unrecognisable as the 'Queen of Cocaine' in Netflix miniseries Griselda,"Netflix is really into telling the real-life stories of drug cartel leaders.
What: The dramatisation of the life of Griselda Blanco
Starring: Sofia Vergara (Modern Family); Alberto Guera (Narcos: Mexico); Martin Rodriguez
When: January 25 (as long as certain court injunctions don't come through, more on that later)
Where: Netflix
Likely to make you feel: Like an empowered girlboss who can take on anything, including control of an international drug cartel
First they knocked it out of the park with Narcos, which focused on Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar and launched the career of Pedro Pascal.
Now, they're bringing us Griselda, based on the life of Griselda Blanco, the drug lord who allegedly showed a young Escobar the ropes before he claimed his cartel throne.
Griselda is the ""Cocaine Godmother"" you've never heard about, so we thought we'd bring you up to speed.
Born in 1943 in Cartagena, Colombia, Blanco grew up within the world of crime. She was reportedly involved in the kidnapping of a child when she was 11 years old, where she allegedly shot the child after the parents wouldn't pay the ransom.
She married a small-time criminal when she was in her teens, and the couple had three children. They later divorced and Blanco was accused of ordering a hit on her one-time betrothed.
By the early 1970s she was in a relationship with Alberto Bravo, who introduced her to the drug trade. Using New York City as their base, they started bringing cocaine into the US.
In 1975, after a fight over supposed stolen funds, Bravo died in a shootout with Blanco. She reportedly also ordered the death of her third husband, earning her the nickname ""The Black Widow"".
By the late 70s Blanco was in Miami, and running one of the largest and most profitable drug importation operations in the US.

She was the first to use human ""mules"" to carry cocaine into the US, and later became a mentor to Pablo Escobar, who took over her operation.
At its peak, it was thought to be shipping 1,500 kilograms of cocaine a month to the US.
In 1985, Blanco was arrested on drug charges and sentenced to 15 years in a US prison. Prosecutors soon began to piece together all of the people in Blanco's circle that mysteriously ended up shot in the head, and she was also charged with three murders.
Blanco was handed three concurrent 20-year sentences for her involvement in the killings. She was released and deported to Colombia in 2004.
She led a quiet life in her home country until 2012, when she was shot twice in the head while leaving a butcher shop in Medellin.
No charges were ever placed in relation to her murder.
It looks like Griselda will largely focus on Blanco's time in Miami, when her business was at its peak.
Modern Family's Sofia Vergara will be ditching her comedy roots to step into the cocaine boots of Griselda Blanco.
Vergara's physical transformation for the show included fake eyebrows, a fake nose and even fake teeth (which explains why Vergara looks so uncanny valley in the promo material).
Vergara’s facial transformation took “hours” every morning according to series creator Eric Newman. (Supplied: Netflix)
She also wore five different wigs to represent Blanco at five different time periods. Considering the series is only six episodes, time jumps are definitely on the cards.
Also expect lots of shootouts, stare-downs, beautiful people drenched in sepia tones and the highly anticipated acting debut of Colombian reggaeton star Karol G as Griselda's friend Carla.
The show contrasts Griselda's ruthlessness in business with her role as a parent.
In promos for the show, Griselda is identified as a ""mother"", as well as a ""queenpin"" and ""innovator"".
But her youngest — and only surviving — son, Michael Corleone Blanco, isn't super happy about the show. (Yes, he's named after The Godfather.)

The youngest Blanco filed a lawsuit last Wednesday in Miami against Netflix and Vergara, among others.
Court documents claim Young Blanco, ""has devoted several years to meticulously documenting the private narratives of his, as well as his mother's life, with the intention of publishing a book and developing a Spanish soap opera"".
He says he discussed details of his mother's life with two of the defendants, Andres Hernando Lopez and Rafael Alfredo Rojas Vega, between 2009 and 2022 in the hopes of writing a book. He claims they then turned around and gave that info to Netflix.
Young Blanco also says Netflix refused to consult with him for Griselda.
He is seeking a temporary injunction to stop Netflix releasing the series, as well as more than $US100,000 ($152,000) in damages.
Young Blanco is currently gearing up to release his own book about Griselda Blanco: My Mother, the Godmother, and the True Story of Michael Corleone Blanco, the Son of Griselda Blanco.
Even after their matriarch's death, the Blanco family drama continues.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-22/icymi-jacob-elordi-saturday-night-live-pitchfork/103375482,"ICYMI: Jacob Elordi is very tall on SNL, the most hyped films from Sundance, and Pitchfork gutted","It's the fourth week of January, and 2024's pop culture machines are in full effect.
While you were focusing on the Emmys and shortlisting your Hottest 100 votes, a whole heap of important, silly and wild things happened in the world of entertainment.
Off the back of starring in Saltburn and Priscilla, Australian actor and internet 'babygirl' Jacob Elordi hosted Saturday Night Live this weekend, with most of the jokes focusing on him being handsome and very tall (he's 6 foot 5).
The internet has been a bit obsessed with Elordi lately — mostly because of Saltburn's explicit scenes, with Elordi joking in his opening monologue that most people know him via the film's clips on TikTok. He also immediately spoils a pretty major twist in the movie, so be warned.
Given Elordi's mostly played dramatic roles, this is the first time most have seen his comedic chops, so how'd he do? Judge for yourself. Across the sketches, he mostly plays a hot, tall guy, with a few lines of his Lois Griffin impression thrown in.
There's a Bachelorette sketch where he's chosen over his short king competitors despite his many, many red flags and a scene where everyone in AA can't help but hit on him. He's not exactly given much to do.
One highlight is a segment that's not about his height and looks, where he and cast member Bowen Yang are professional lip-readers for Entertainment Tonight, playing off everyone trying to decipher Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift's gossip at the Golden Globes.
In other SNL news, Mean Girls (2024) star Reneé Rapp was this week's musical guest, performing Not My Fault with help from Megan Thee Stallion. Plus, there was a surprise appearance by the OG Regina George, Rachel McAdams — a big deal, given McAdams didn't feature in that OG cast reunion (aka commercial) or appear at any of the recent red carpets. SNL still draws those big names like no other!

Last week, publisher Condé Nast (Vogue, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair) announced at the end of last week that they'd be gutting Pitchfork, one of the world's biggest and most influential music publications.
The title is set to merge with men's publication GQ to consolidate music coverage across the publishing group, resulting in ""mass lay-offs"" of senior staff.
Pitchfork was started by music fan Ryan Schreiber in 1996 and acquired by Condé Nast in 2015. It's long been revered (and sometimes maligned) for its considered and often lengthy takes on music that didn't always attract mainstream attention.
""Pitchfork's editors were extraordinarily committed to investing in new critical talent, the writers and editors who were the driving force in unearthing and chronicling the defining alternative acts of the 21st century,"" former associate editor Laura Snapes wrote in The Guardian.
Snapes's tribute is just one of many that have appeared since news of the downsizing emerged, highlighting the impact that the publication had on artists, writers, and music fans.

Fresh off winning best supporting actress for The White Lotus at both the Golden Globes and the Emmys, Jennifer Coolidge has been cast in the live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time.
Minecraft, which has almost 140 million monthly active players, is a sandbox game with little plot, that is instead focused on building, exploring and fighting through an infinite world. Even putting aside the blocky graphics, it's not exactly a cinematic game: It involves a lot of digging.
The adaptation's been in the works for a decade, but is finally going ahead, directed by Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess. It seems like the time for video game adaptations is now, considering the box office smash of last year's Mario movie.
Coolidge joins a previously announced cast of Jack Black, Jason Momoa and Kate McKinnon, alongside The Colour Purple's Danielle Brooks, Wednesday star Emma Myers and Kiwi Jemaine Clement. They're filming in New Zealand right now, with a release slated for April 2025.
No concrete news yet on the plot or what role Coolidge will play, though Black will star as Steve, Minecraft's nondescript default character. Maybe she'll finally get her dream role as a dolphin?

Can't wait until December for all the lists about the best films of 2024? Well, over the weekend, Sundance Film Festival shared many of the flicks that will probably feature heavily.
If there's one film that's getting spruiked by the festival it's Steven Soderbergh's Presence. You might know Soderbergh from convincing us he knew COVID was coming with 2011's Contagion. This time he takes on the classic, family-moves-into-new-home, home- already-occupied-by-ghosts trope, but his deft hand and stars Lucy Liu, Callina Liang and Julia Fox make it something original.
Keep your eyes open for Love Lies Bleeding, a romantic thriller starring Kristen Stewart as a tough gym manager and Katy O'Brian as her bodybuilding paramour. As their relationship grows, the pair soon find themselves embroiled in a criminal underbelly. This is a rare Sundance premiere that actually has an Australian release day. (March 14th!! Put it in your calendar!!)

I Saw the TV Glow is the much-talked about follow-up feature from Jane Schoenbrun, who dazzled Sundance in 2021 with the creepy We're All Going to The World's Fair. If you like getting obsessed with pop culture, mysterious lights and Brigette Lundy-Paine then this is the film for you. Also Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst AND Phoebe Bridgers AND Caroline Polachek have bit parts. Do with that information what you wish.

Lastly, the 2000s quirky comedy is back in the form of My Old Ass. Produced by Margot Robbie — the Midas of Hollywood producers — My Old Ass sees a high school graduate played by Maisy Stella form a friendship with her 30-something self from the future! And her future self is played by Aubrey Plaza.
Expect to see My Old Ass splashed across Australian cinemas at some point in 2024.

The queer, non-binary, Mexican Irish diva/former X, Y and Me podcast host the internet loved to hate is over and out from the Sex and the City reboot.
Sources have reportedly said the character was deemed ""annoying"" by audiences, and have denied the move has anything to do with social media posts from actor Sara Ramirez about Palestine.
Ramirez seems to disagree, though, calling out the ""duplicitous"" entertainment industry on Instagram for ""making black lists of actors and workers who post anything in support of Palestinians and Gaza to ensure they will not work again"".

Midsumma — Naarm/Melbourne's annual celebration of all things LGBTQIA+ — kicked off with its famous carnival on Sunday, featuring drag performances, giddy explosions of rainbow (eco)glitter everywhere you looked and a bit more rain than people would have expected for a festival named as it is.
For the first time, an Australian mainstage show has been created and produced by an all-trans and gender diverse team.
Most hotly anticipated, perhaps, was the queer dog fashion show, where beloved pooches strutted their stuff and the whole crowd cooed and sighed at their chonky butts and slightly bemused expressions.
The carnival is just the beginning, though. It kicks off three weeks of queer artistic excellence. Some things high on our lists are Queer PHOTO, showcasing queer photography across Melbourne's west; the First Nations Drag Festival (hosted by Cerulean, Miss First Nation from WorldPride 2023); Janne Kearney's sugar rush of an exhibition, Eye Candy; the acclaimed play Overflow, about the gendered politics of bathrooms, featuring an all-trans or gender-diverse cast and crew; and let's not forget the Pride Street Party, held February 11, where hopefully there'll be even more dogs giving fashun.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-20/red-carpet-mens-fashion-revamped/103365280,Men have taken off the straight jacket — and black tie's dominance is doomed,"When a bloke like actor Barry Keoghan – small and muscular as a French Bulldog, a boxer in his spare time – pulls on a pillar-box red checked Louis Vuitton suit adorned with pearls, chains and a ruby earring to attend a major awards show, it's past argument that some of the red carpet's more performative trends are going to be picked up by men everywhere and that the spell of the black tuxedo will finally be broken.
Barry is no leading edge, here: actors like Timothee Chalamet have been wearing daisy patterns, and Wedgewood-blue suits and spangles with no undershirt for years, but someone like Barry? That's different. Is it that he's more – relatable?
Men's mainstream fashion has been a beggar at the table of flamboyant style for too long now, its original guests – Bowie as Ziggy Stardust, all of glam rock – having long departed. The power hold that the well-cut suit has over men is formidable, understandably. As Vesper coolly informs a young and impressionable James Bond, there are dinner jackets and there are dinner jackets: she had just provided him with the latter.
But it's been quite thrilling to see men everywhere in the last handful of years – from weddings to race meetings to weekend parties – unapologetically embrace colour and texture and decoration free of the anxiety that usually seems to accompany a radical fashion choice.

As Christian Allaire wrote in Vogue – how many times has he walked through the brightly coloured women's-wear floors in a department store only to find drab, monochrome menswear huddled in the basement. Despite years of runways from Gucci and Versace, the embellished look has never gone mainstream. It's only red-carpet events that seemed to crash through.
And now enough of those moments on enough different kind of men seem to have given men everywhere the licence to move out of their straight-jacketed lane and use fashion as women have for centuries: as one of the most pertinent and effective forms of self-expression.

The Billy Porters in their ball gowns or Troye Sivans in a sleek column dress aren't going to do it: fabulous as they are, that's Cher-level costuming for most men and won't beckon them across the cerulean Rubicon. But Andrew Scott in sporty all-white, Pedro Pascal in patterns or monochrome, or Dan Levy in chartreuse? That's something you can see yourself in. That's irresistible.
Yes, we can reasonably argue they've been Queer-Eyed: the phenomenal, cross-generational and cross-sexuality appeal of that television show can't be gainsaid in the context of men prepared to take that flowered shirt over that plain one, pin jewellery to their lapel, or even pull on a skirt. We've seen enough tough guys on that show break down when they see themselves sleek and adorned to realise this isn't trash exploitation. It's self-care and self-esteem on a whole other level.
Queer Eye has been a huge influence in the shake up of straight men's style.
But equally I think men have to tip their hats to the rich heritage of Savile Row, and its revived look of the last 10 years that first allowed men to get out of their boxy, boring suits, discover their shape, appreciate tailoring, adopt colour and even some dandyish style. The Brits, going a long way back, have a powerful tradition here.
The Savile Row thing has been something to behold, hasn't it? OK, sometimes it's meant seeing burly Aussie blokes in too-tight suits, their sleeves creeping up their arms; but it's also meant colour and pattern and peacocking with a sense of flair that I'm sure many men have been raised to scorn. I've also seen men with the kind of lapel decorations – jewellery, silk flowers – that only a few years ago they wouldn't dare to wear unless they were gay. And it makes me so glad.
A cultural shift like this only takes place when there's enough critical mass to give you coverage, and when the people you idolise do it first. And they're all doing it.
Start your weekend with the best of the ABC's journalism, presented by Virginia Trioli. Discover compelling features, big ideas and revealing analysis to understand the stories that matter to Australians.
There's a Reddit thread where a seemingly broad cross-section of blokes discuss with wonder the effect these highly-adorned men are having on them. One guy, a self-described married dad in his late 30s ""with grey in his beard"" wonders about the ""trickle-down effect"": ""I've been a little more adventurous with colours and stuff that I wouldn't have usually tried."" Another agrees and says he started stealing his wife's cardigans as they were softer and better cut than his. ""I'm trying to channel more of that energy this year.""
I guess we'll know when the rule of the black tux has been broken and we reach peak-peacocking when the Zeus of all things stylish, George Clooney, turns up to a red carpet in Harry Styles' feathers. There are suits, and suits, George. That will be the latter.
This weekend old bones, old mines and old Catholic beliefs in new and different times.
Have a safe and happy weekend, and with awards season in full swing, we can take a moment to celebrate the best songs that will be in consideration for the Oscars (nominations will be out in days). I've shared this with you at least once before so I can't do that again (well done, Sophie).

Sam, you're not the only one: we've got a few comments shouting out Tina and Amy's little Weekend Update segment.
I thought Anthony Anderson did a great job (especially compared to Jo Koy last week at the Globes) but I'd LOVE to see Tina and Amy host an awards show again.

By Jared Richards
If you were watching today, chances are you have one of these three theme songs in your head: Succession, The Bear or Beef.
These three shows absolutely dominated, but Succession and The Bear taking home six trophies each and Beef just behind with five. The only other multiple-award winner was Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, which won two categories.
(GIPHY)
But wait!
If you add in the Creative Arts Emmys, which took place last week, it tells a different story.
With those, The Bear reigns supreme at 10 wins, followed by Beef and The Last of Us with 8 - making it all the more wild that the latter didn't take home anything tonight. Succession stays at six, then sports doco Welcome to Wrexham (not nominated tonight) ties with The White Lotus at five wins.
The Emmys are kinda weird. Fun! But weird.
By Jared Richards
We've already covered Barry (six nominations) The Last of Us (five) and Better Call Saul not receiving a single trophy, but at least they're in good company.
(GIPHY)
The biggest snub of the night goes to Ted Lasso, nominated eight times but not nabbing any awards. The show's third (likely final) season didn't quite capture audiences like its first two, and the (lack of) awards reflect that.
In second place is Barry - thought being just snubbed of winning the snubbed list is perhaps willing of its own award, thereby making it ...not... a snub. (Anybody else vibing with this or am I clutching at straws?)
Tying in third place with The Last of Us at five nominations and no awards is Fleishman is in Trouble, the adaptation of the novel by Taffy Brodesser-Akner.
Then at four nominations, no trophy, we have Welcome to Chippendales and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, a previous Emmys favourite that, now in its fifth season, may have lost its shine.
And then we've got quite a few shows with three nominations, no win: Andor, Jury Duty, Wednesday, Only Murders in The Building, Bad Sisters and Daisy Jones & The Six.
By Liana Walker
Which ones do you recognise?
By Jessica Riga
I'm glad Andor still got some recognition too even though it was never going to win. That series made it clear for me that Star Wars can be prestige media in the hands of a capable writer, director & showrunner.
- Still an honour to be nominated
This is a great attitude to have!
By Jessica Riga
I LOVE the Bear. But is it a comedy???
- Georgie
Sure it's heavy, but it makes me laugh nonetheless, Georgie!
But in all honesty, isn't Barry even darker?
By Jared Richards
Bit bummed about Better Call Saul’s last season being overlooked but not surprised
- Maddy
Last of Us and Better Call Saul not winning any is a surprise!
- Bryce
Better Call Saul will now go down as having never won a Primetime Emmy from 27 nominations. Are there any shows that have had more than that?
- Tyson
Tyson, it's even worse than that: if you add in the Creative Arts Emmys, that's 53 nominations for Better Call Saul and not a single win. It's always an honour to be nominated, but that's gotta hurt.
I'm side-stepping the question a little (it's definitely up there, but I'm hesitant to say it's the most-snubbed show of all time), but I think the biggest snub ever has to go to The Wire, widely regarded of one of the best shows of all time, but only ever received two nominations.
By Jessica Riga
I was wondering why the last of us has been snubbed but then I remembered it’s a sci-fi and sci-fi is always disrespected :(
- Jesi
I jest, it won eight Creative Arts Emmys last week. But otherwise it won not one award tonight, despite being one of the most nominated shows.
I think it'll have better luck in season two... because Succession won't be a competitor!
By Jessica Riga
What did you think of the Emmys? Who deserved their win? Who got snubbed?
Importantly, which shows are you adding to your watchlist?
Personally, this was one of my favourite award shows to witness (and live blog!) because not only did Succession win a bunch of awards, but all the tributes to iconic series to mark the 75th Emmys was a lovely celebration of television!

SUCCESSION SWEEP
- Conhead
It's an impressive amount, but nowhere near the most-awarded show of all-time.
That honour goes to SNL with 73 trophies, though given that's been going since the '70s, it doesn't really feel like a fair fight.
Game of Thrones, which had its iron throne recreated tonight but without a cast reunion, comes in next at 59, then Fraiser at 37 and The Simpsons at 35.
If we know one things about the Roy family, it's that they're awful competitive: maybe we'll get a S5 one day down the line, just for an Emmys sweep. (I'm just not quite ready to say goodbye!)

Succession was the most nominated show this year, and has now won six Emmys tonight.
""We want to thank HBO, this wasn't necessarily an easy show to commission,"" creator Jesse Armstrong says.

It's a short and classy speech, with Armstrong finishing with ""thank you indeed.""

With an Ally McBeal reunion that saw cast members dance across a recreation of the show's iconic bathroom, I'm calling it: these awards have been a real delight with few awkward moments or cringe jokes.
Not even an In Memoriam section that mashed up the Fast & Furious song 'See You Again' with the Friends theme could ruin things. (Is it just me, or is that choice fairly tasteless?)
Let's not count our chickens just yet, but this is how you do an awards show: cute reunions, touching speeches, and no host making fun of how bad the awards are.
PS. Did you know an Ally McBeal revival is in the works? Or at least, they were in talks back in 2022, though there's been no news since. Maybe this mini-reunion will get the ball rolling again...

On his new album, American Dream, she confirms it.
American Dream begins and ends not with academy-award winning actor Morgan Freeman the way Savage Mode II did, but with 21 Savage's mother Heather Carmillia Joseph.
""My dreams have always gone beyond the crossings of a pond,"" Joseph starts the album.
""As a mother every path I walked was for my son.
""Challenges were a part of the journey. And what I wanted was an after thought.""

Joseph goes on to say her choices were not in vain.
""Dreams really do come true,"" she says towards the end of the album.
American Dream is the rapper's first solo album since 2018's I Am > I Was, which went to number one on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart and featured the song A Lot with J Cole, which won a Grammy for Best Rap song.
American Dream is quintessential 21 Savage. On the track Redrum, Savage throws in some pop culture references like ""How Sway?"" a common parlance adopted by those in the know after Kanye West challenged renowned hip hop journalist Sway Calloway in a 2013 interview.
The introspective Dark Days featuring Mariah the Scientist, urges children to ""stay in school"".

Other artists featured on American Dream include Doja Cat, Young Thug, Afrobeats superstar Burna Boy, Travis Scott, Brent Faiyaz (who performed a sold-out Australian tour this week) and Savage's long-time collaborator Metro Boomin.
The album is a soundtrack to Savage's debut film American Dream: The 21 Savage Story, which is set to be released on Independence Day in the United States and is directed by Donald Glover, Stephen Glover, Jamal Olori and Fam Udeorji.
A trailer for the film came out earlier this week.
It co-stars Savage, Glover and Caleb McLaughlin depicting three generations of Savage in the heat of a personal crisis.
Although this is Savage's first solo album since 2018, the artist has certainly been active in that time, releasing a 2022 joint album with Drake called Her Loss, and appearing as a featured artist on albums from DJ Khaled, Young Thug and Giggs.
Just to emphasise his ubiquitousness, Savage has been nominated for five Grammys this year.

His ""American Dream"" has not been without challenges, as his mother alludes to on the album.
When Savage was taken into custody on February 3, 2019, (Super Bowl Sunday) by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who said he was a UK national who had overstayed his visa, many of his fans learned for the first time that he was British.
People couldn't believe it and his distinct Atlanta accent and Southern drawl exacerbated their bewilderment.
The memes were, in a word, savage.
Some photoshopped him in with the royal family. Others in uniquely British settings. And the captions? Even 21 Savage had to laugh.
""Some of them was funny — I ain't gonna lie,"" he told the New York Times shortly after he was released from detention.
""I done been through way worse things in my life than somebody putting me on a meme. I been shot — what is a meme? A meme is nothing.""
Many a 21 Savage meme went viral. (Supplied: @atotheway3 on X)
Savage remained in detention till February 13 that year.
It meant he missed the 61st annual Grammy Awards ceremony, where he was supposed to perform on stage with Post Malone, who he collaborates with on the Grammy-nominated song Rockstar.
Pop star Demi Lovato temporarily deleted her Twitter account after prompting backlash, including from some big names, for tweeting: ""So far 21 savage memes have been my favorite part of the Super Bowl"".

Born, Shéyaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, in London, Savage was raised in Atlanta from the age of seven, living much of his life as an undocumented immigrant.
His largely absent father's family immigrated to London from the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent. His mother is from East London, her family from Dominica in the Caribbean.
Celebrities rallied against his potential deportation and a possible decade-long ban from entering the United States, Post Malone and Kendrick Lamar among them.

Jay-Z said the arrest was an ""absolute travesty"", with Savage telling the podcast My Expert Opinion that the music mogul played a role in getting him out of detention.
""It made me who I am,"" Savage told the New York Times.
""I wouldn't write it no other way if I had the choice. If they said, 'Hey, you could start your life over and make yourself a citizen,' I wouldn't have never did it.
""I still want to go through this right here 'cause it made me who I am, it made me strong.""
The rapper has since been issued a Green Card, and one of the first things he did was something he couldn't do in limbo – go overseas, performing with Drake in Canada, before booking a Europe tour, culminating in a London show.
Savage told Rolling Stone in December that his music is ""fiction as hell"".
""Some of it be based off of real life, but a lot of it be creative stories.""
He's been forced to defend his often violent lyrics after being targeted on X (formerly Twitter) when he appealed for peace on the streets.
He responded to people calling out his hypocrisy by emphasising that he's an entertainer.
The rapper's foundation, Leading By Example, seeks to provide financial literacy to underprivileged youth, while increasing their access to jobs and personal advancement.
In acknowledgement of his work in the community, the state of Georgia recognises December 21 as ""21 Savage Day"".

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-11/marvel-echo-native-american-cast-american-sign-language/103288276,How Marvel's new series puts First Nations culture at its centre,"When production started on the new Marvel TV series Echo, it began with a traditional native blessing ceremony for the cast and crew, followed by a traditional Choctaw hymn.
""It set a tone,"" actor Chaske Spencer, who plays Uncle Henry on the series, told ABC News. ""We all knew what we're going to do here and we were in a special project and when you have a ceremony like that, it just puts good vibes in the air.""
Echo is the first Marvel show led by a Native American cast. It also prominently features sign language.
The central character in Echo is Maya Lopez, played by Alaqua Cox, who was born deaf and is an amputee.
In Echo, Maya flees home to Oklahoma's Choctaw Nation, pursued by supervillain Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio), the head of a criminal empire she once worked for.
There she has to contend with her past and the family ties that have broken down since she was forced to leave the community as a child.
Maya was introduced in the Disney+ series Hawkeye as an antihero, but you don't need to watch that series first — Echo is designed as a standalone, five-episode series.
She leads a cast that also includes Devery Jacobs as Maya's cousin Bonnie, Chaske Spencer as her uncle Henry, Zahn McClarnon and Cody Lightning.

""I wanted to show people that amputees and people with disabilities can do anything,"" Cox said in the series' production brief.
""Although I am deaf and an amputee, I was able to do a lot of my fighting and stunts and it was important to me to show my prosthetic leg and not try to hide it under clothes … I wanted people with disabilities to have someone that they could look up to and see within themselves.""
The Disney+ show is the first to debut under the ""Marvel Spotlight'' banner, a new category of Marvel shows focused on character-driven stories.
Prior to filming, Jacobs travelled to the Choctaw Cultural Center in Oklahoma, where she learnt about Choctaw creation stories and history.
""So many people think 'Native American' as this one nation or one tribe and that's just not the case. In the US alone, there's over 562 — those are just the federally recognised tribes,"" she told ABC News.
""We have different languages and cultures — I'm Mohawk and so for us to make sure this was rooted in the Choctaw Nation and that we were doing this in collaboration with the Choctaw Nation was so important, especially when it came to the specificities of the language and culture from that territory.""
Themes of family and ancestral history are threaded into the plot. ""I thought the fact that there were so many references to small-town communities, and everyone knows everyone, and everyone's somehow related to each other, was super-relatable [to] growing up on my res [reservation],"" Jacobs said.
""That was part of the fabric of the world and part of involving Indigenous creators behind the project of Echo — feeling those nuances and feeling that relatable aspects of what it means to be growing up in an Indigenous community.""
Both Devery Jacobs and Spencer learnt American Sign Language for their roles, and worked with ASL Master Doug Ridloff (who also worked on the Marvel movie Eternals).
Ridloff translated the script line by line and got the actors to mimic the translations back to him. ""After a while, you start to develop muscle memory, and it starts to come quicker and quicker,"" Spencer said.
Chaske Spencer says the powwow filmed for the series was done in an authentic way. (Supplied: Marvel Studios)
Spencer said one of the most memorable days on set was when they filmed a powwow, which is a gathering held by Native American communities to dance, sing, and socialise.
""I don't want to give too much away, but you know there's a powwow and you really felt like we hit it home,"" he said. ""You don't get to see powwows being filmed like that, especially in a big budget show like this. It was very authentic. And I've been to some powwows in our time. And I gotta say, it looked completely real to me.""
Jacobs said dancers from across the country congregated in Georgia for the shoot.
""Everybody gave their all and danced through the night,"" Jacobs said. ""And it was take after take, but I think everybody wanted to get it right, and to be proud and show that culture and those communities on screen, on a platform that hasn't been shown before.""
Jacobs visited the Choctaw Nation ahead of filming to learn more about its culture and traditions. (Supplied: Marvel Studios)
Jacobs added that the welcoming ceremony at the start of production served as an important reminder that they were guests in other people's territory. (Notably, the Marvel film Thor: Love and Thunder directed by Taika Waititi, had a Welcome to Country ceremony on set during filming in Sydney.)
""I know that we're working with like huge movie stars, and we're working with people who might be considered on like a hierarchy, but it gets everyone onto the same playing field and, and making sure that there's respect and that we're all telling the story from, from a good place,"" she explained.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-03/five-of-the-most-unhinged-episodes-of-grand-designs/103278626,Are these the five most unhinged episodes of Grand Designs?,"Grand Designs is one of those shows that's great to watch out of order, depending on your mood.
Choose an episode from one of the early seasons and you'll be transported back to the late 90s/early 00s, when Grand Designs UK was about everyday (still pretty well-off, yes) British people trying to build their dream homes, with little money and even less building experience. The clothing, huge mobile phones and now-retro design sensibilities provide a delightful hit of nostalgia.
The later seasons, on the other hand, are great for when you're in the mood to judge the extremely wealthy as they try to pull off batshit design ideas, with varied and frequently juicy results.
Watch on ABC iview as Kevin McCloud follows some of Britain's most ambitious self-building projects.
He's relentlessly snarky, often impatient with the couples who appear on his show, and loves building drama. But somehow all of this is endearing.
There are Australian, New Zealand, Finnish and Swedish versions of Grand Designs too, but what is Grand Designs without Kevin?
And there's something funny about watching British people, specifically, try to pull off the biggest projects of their lives, only to fail.
The British obsession with the concept of finishing their nowhere-near-ready homes before Christmas and/or the birth of their first child is something to be marvelled at.
Of the more than 150 episodes of Grand Designs, these five are our favourites, for their unmatched levels of unhingedness. (Keep scrolling to the bottom for our list of honourable mentions.)
Australia's boldest and most inspired home renovators put their skills to the test in the quest to create their perfect homes.
The year is 2006 and social workers Chris Miller and Sze Liu Lai are sick of living in their 1.5-bedroom east London flat with their two children.
Except they don't want to rent somewhere bigger, and they can't afford to buy anywhere bigger.
So they purchase a rusting 86-foot barge for £10,000, moor it in the most desolate shipyard you've ever seen and get to work trying to turn it into an environmentally friendly three-bedroom home, using nothing but reclaimed materials.
They have no plans (houseboats aren't subject to any permissions or regulations and Chris sees planning as ""anal retention""), no architect, no building or design experience, no contract with their builder, and no idea where they will moor their future home.
Their budget is just £50,000.
What could possibly go wrong?
""Well, you could end up with a dog's dinner of a building,"" Kevin says. (Spoiler alert…)
Things get so bad the Millers soon find themselves camping out on their unfinished boat with no plumbing as winter approaches.
There is no happy ending.
There's something so good about coming to a show once no-one's talking about it online so you can just inhale it all over many hours/days/weeks without fear of seeing spoilers or having to wait for the next ep because you're being drip-fed.
Edward Short had always dreamt of living close to a wild and stormy sea, in a family home reminiscent of a lighthouse.
And in 2011, that dream felt within reach. Back then, the music producer had a staggering £1.8 million loan to build a luxury home on the breathtaking cliffs of North Devon. With the rock steadily crumbling below the plot, he knew it was going to be a tough build.
He didn't expect it to ruin his life over the course of a painful eight years.
This is possibly the saddest episode of television ever made.
Kevin provides desperately needed comic relief, doling out copious life lessons and playing around in stormy weather for the camera.
P.S. Do things stay so sad? Find out in the North Devon Grand Designs Revisited episode, S20E1.
In 2003, Clapham-based couple David and Anjana Devoy set about building their dream bougie home in the backyard of their south London property, overlooked by a housing estate.
Because they are £100,000 short of the money needed to build their home, Anjana has to step up as project manager (despite having no experience or training), while her similarly unskilled husband takes on the brunt of the physical labour.
They have absolutely no idea and it's wonderful. Truly giddy stuff.
See this quote from Anjana: ""The boys have informed me there is a problem. I'm actually just going to ignore them. Just function on in ignorance and believe that it's just going to be sorted out… that's the beauty of not knowing what you're doing.""
And did I mention their wannabe dream home is *curved*? Everybody who's anybody knows any deviation from a straight line in construction complicates things.
You need to see the hijinks that ensue.
Andy and Nicki Bruce want to live on the banks of the Thames because Andy is big into rivers.
But riverside land doesn't come cheap — even the tech company chief executive and his landscape designer partner can't afford to buy a property that would be straightforward to build on.
The best they can do is a plot on a private island along the Thames, and I know you're thinking ""a private island along the Thames"" sounds fancy, but it isn't. The island can't be accessed by vehicles — the only way onto it is a narrow footbridge. And my god is it in a flood zone.
Life in a flood zone obviously isn't a new concept, but Nicki and Andy aren't into the idea of a house on stilts. They want a house that can float so when the water level rises, the house does too.
This build is partly about architectural design. But mostly it's an attempt at pioneering civil engineering, and Kevin is very into it. This episode sees a kinder version of Mr McCloud — a Kevin who marvels at Nicki and Andy's ""amphibian house"" concept and who genuinely wants to see them pull it off.
But with a massively increasing budget, time constraints and widespread flooding threatening the project before it's even out of the ground — will they be able to?
""Who in their right mind, with several million [pounds] to spend would choose to live in a hole?"" Kevin says, asking the question on all of our minds at the beginning of this episode.
""Spatial planning consultant""/interior designer Audrey Lovelock and her investment banker husband Jeff are desperate to live in London's most expensive borough, Kensington, where they want to have thousands of square metres worth of space. So desperate that they buy an unassuming Holland Park flat with a basement that's more like a horror-movie maze: It's 25 interconnecting rooms on 13 different levels.
Audrey is determined to turn this actual rabbit warren into a feat of subterranean luxury.
In 2010, she ditches her ""spatial planning"" and interior design work to focus entirely on project managing the renovations at 1 Lansdowne House, with zero help from an architect and no drawings to supply the builders, who are quickly disillusioned.
""The best way to describe this project is bonkers and dangerously risky,"" Kevin says.
We're calling it: This episode features some of Kevin's best-ever scriptwriting. He takes great delight in a long-running Space Odyssey gag that you simply need to see. And his unwarranted lyricism and snark are next-level.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-28/celebrities-who-died-in-2023/103118182,Looking back at the celebrities who died this year,"From punk rockers to crooners, best friends to magicians, the world lost some well-known faces and creative geniuses this year.
Let's take a look back at who died in 2023.
Matthew Perry died this year, aged just 54.
Friends fans around the world were left heartbroken when Matthew Perry died unexpectedly in October at the age of 54.
The actor was best known for playing the bumbling and sarcastic Chandler Bing in the iconic sitcom, which rocketed him to stardom in the 1990s.
Following his death at his Los Angeles home, Friends co-star David Schwimmer praised Perry's ""impeccable comic timing"", while the show's co-creators and executive producer said ""he was always the funniest person in the room"".
""We will always cherish the joy, the light, the blinding intelligence he brought to every moment — not just to his work, but in life as well,"" Marta Kauffman, David Crane and Kevin Bright said in a statement.
Last year, Perry released a memoir in which he detailed his struggles with addiction and sobriety. In it, he spoke about how he wanted to be remembered for his work with people dealing with substance abuse.
""When I die, people will talk about Friends, Friends, Friends,"" he wrote.
""And I'm glad of that ... But when I die, as far as my so-called accomplishments go, it would be nice if Friends were listed far behind the things I did to try to help other people.""

Starting with her father Elvis Presley's untimely death when she was just nine years old, Lisa Marie Presley's life was marred by tragedy before her own early death this year. She was 54.
The singer and songwriter was suffering from complications related to an earlier weight-loss surgery when she went into cardiac arrest in January.
Her mother, Priscilla Presley, confirmed the news, describing her daughter as the ""most passionate, strong and loving woman"" she had ever known.
Throughout her life, Presley was married and divorced four times — including to Michael Jackson and Nicholas Cage — and lost her only son to suicide when he was just 27.
She detailed her grief in a 2022 essay, writing that she had ""dealt with death, grief and loss since the age of nine years old"". ""I've had more than anyone's fair share of it in my lifetime and somehow, I've made it this far.""
She was the rockstar's only child and the sole heir of the Elvis Presley trust.
Singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte dies at 96
Harry Belafonte, a singer, songwriter, and groundbreaking actor turned political activist, died in April, aged 96.
Belafonte was born in Manhattan but spent his early childhood in his family's native Jamaica.
Belafonte began his career as a calypso singer, best known for his 1950s hit ""Banana Boat"" song.
He was the first black person allowed to perform in many plush nightspots and also had racial breakthroughs in movies at a time when segregation prevailed in much of the United States.
His acting work pushed racial boundaries in a segregated US, which led him to the civil rights movement, working with his friend Martin Luther King Jr.
Belafonte travelled the world as a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, in 1987 and later started an AIDS foundation.
Belafonte was also the driving force behind the celebrity-studded, famine-fighting hit song We Are the World in the 1980s, raising $62 million.
Sinead O'Connor performs in 2014. (AP: Antonio Calanni/ File)
Sinéad O'Connor topped international charts with her rendition of Nothing Compares 2 U, but for many, it is the Irish singer's outspoken views on religion, sex, war and feminism and staunch activism that will endure. She died in London in July, aged 56.
The performer began her career singing on the streets of Dublin and soon rose to international fame. Her 1987 debut album, The Lion and the Cobra, made her a star, but it was her powerful performance of Prince's ballad that made her a sensation and earned her four Grammy nominations and one win.
O'Connor declined the award, describing it as a commercial exercise. The following year she made headlines when, during an appearance on Saturday Night Live, she ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II while performing a rendition of Bob Marley's War, in which she changed some lyrics to reference child abuse in the Catholic Church.
""I found her to be a very, very humble person, a very funny person, and someone who struggled with the injustices of the world,"" wrote Irish music promoter Fran Daly following O'Connor's death.
""I don't think anyone who's seen her perform has heard a sound like when Sinéad O'Connor opens up and sings.""
Irish songwriter and Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan dies at 65
Shane MacGowan, the singer-songwriter and frontman of The Pogues, died in November, aged 65
MacGowan, who was born on Christmas Day, grew up in Tipperary, Ireland, and later in England. He founded the Pogues — originally Pogue Mahone, an anglicisation of the Irish phrase póg mo thóin, meaning ""kiss my arse""— in 1982.
The band melded Irish traditional music and ""Celtic punk"" rock with McGowan's emotive songwriting and slurred, exuberant performances.
The band's most famous song, 1987's Fairytale of New York — with Kirsty MacColl —  is a bittersweet Christmas classic.
MacGowan struggled with alcohol and substance abuse, which lead to a tempestuous relationship with his band — he was kicked out in 1991 before rejoining a decade later. They disbanded in 2014.
MacGowan had years of health problems and used a wheelchair after breaking his pelvis.
Tina Turner performs in 2009. (AP: Hermann J Knippertz/File)
Tina Turner, the legendary queen of rock'n'roll, died in May after a long illness. She was 83.
The singer and songwriter was best known internationally for her hits What's Love Got to Do With It and (Simply) The Best, while her song Nutbush City Limits struck a particular chord with Australians, inspiring the now iconic dance routine.
Turner began her career in the 1950s performing with her husband Ike Turner — the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame has described them as ""one of the most formidable live acts in history"" — before embarking on a solo career after their split in 1976.
In the 80s she won six of her eight Grammy Awards and saw a dozen songs reach the Top 40 charts. She also used her platform to speak about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her ex-husband.
""Through her courage in telling her story, her commitment to stay the course in her life, no matter the sacrifice, and her determination to carve out a space in rock'n'roll for herself and for others who look like her, Tina Turner showed others who lived in fear what a beautiful future filled with love, compassion, and freedom should look like,"" said actor Angela Bassett, who played Turner in a 1993 film, following the singer's death.
""How do we say farewell to a woman who owned her pain and trauma and used it as a means to help change the world?""
Actress Raquel Welch dies aged 82
Golden Globe winning actor Raquel Welch died in February, aged 82.
She starred in about 30 films and 50 television series in a career spanning five decades.
Welch came to the wide attention of movie-goers for her role in the 1966 sci-fi adventure Fantastic Voyage, followed by her iconic appearance in the prehistoric drama One Million Years BC — where her fur bikini made her a bestselling pin-up.
She broke the mould of the traditional sex symbol with her strong female characters and went on to be an icon of the 1960s and 70s. She won a Golden Globe for best actress in a musical or comedy in 1974 for The Three Musketeers.
Her final film, How to be a Latin Lover, was released in 2017.

Harry Potter and The King's Speech actor Michael Gambon died in September, aged 82.
Gambon left school aged 15 to begin an engineering apprenticeship and by 21 he was fully qualified.
He was also a member of an amateur theatre group and in 1962, he auditioned for the great Shakespearean actor Laurence Olivier, who made him one of the founding members of the National Theatre at the Old Vic, alongside other young emerging greats including Derek Jacobi and Maggie Smith.
He moved into TV and film in the 1980s, and was best known to younger generations for taking over the role of Professor Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movies.
He won four BAFTAs, three Olivier Awards and two ensemble cast Screen Actors Guild Awards — for 2001's Gosford Park and The King's Speech. He was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1992 and knighted for services to drama in 1998.
Gambon retired from the stage in 2015 after suffering long-term memory problems but continued to act on-screen until 2019.
Jimmy Buffett was still touring into 2023. (AP: Matt Sayles)
The US singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett, best known for his hit songs Margaritaville and Come Monday, died in September, aged 76.
Buffett's ""tropical rock"" sound was popular with his boomer fan base — who called themselves Parrotheads — and featured songs like Cheeseburger in Paradise, It's Five O'Clock Somewhere and Why Don't We Get Drunk.
Buffett's most popular tune Margaritaville was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2016 for its cultural and historic significance, which helped brand Key West, Florida, as a holiday destination internationally.
One of the world's richest musicians, Buffett channelled the ""island escapism"" of his music into several business ventures, including the Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville chain of restaurants.
Buffett continued touring into 2023 despite undergoing treatment for a rare and aggressive skin cancer — Merkel cell carcinoma — for four years.
Some key moments from Jerry Springer's life and career
Controversial afternoon TV host Jerry Springer died in April, aged 79.
Love it or hate it, The Jerry Springer Show changed afternoon television with its bleep-filled family confrontations, chair throwing and the chant of ""Jerry Jerry, Jerry"" — an early indication on how popular reality TV would become.
Springer was born in a London underground railway station being used as a bomb shelter in 1944, before his parents, German Jews who fled during the Holocaust, moved to the US when he was five.
He first worked in politics and ran for office many times, including a stint at the mayor of Cincinnati. He went on to become a local political reporter before starting his talk show in 1991.
In its 4,000-episode run, which ended in 2017, The Jerry Springer Show found rebuke and criticism for its salacious storylines, but it was ratings gold, even outperforming Oprah's show at one stage.
Legendary American composer Burt Bacharach dies aged 94
Composer of some of the world's biggest earworms, Burt Bacharach died in February, aged 94.
The Oscar-winner is best known for hit songs, Alfie and I Say a Little Prayer, I'll Never Fall in Love Again and This Guy's in Love with You, usually working in partnership with lyricist Hal David.
He had a run of top 10 hits from the 1950s into the 21st century. There were few rivals for Bacharach's songwriting genius for catchy songs, which were performed, covered and played long after they were written.
Bacharach considered Dionne Warwick among his favourites, though he also created songs for Aretha Franklin, Dusty Springfield, Tom Jones and many others.
Elvis Presley, the Beatles and Frank Sinatra were among countless artists who covered his songs.",Unknown,Thu 28 Dec 2023,0

On a regular day at Star Wash, a car wash company on the outskirts of Chilean capital Santiago, patrons can see Chewbacca or a stormtrooper wiping down hoods or Darth Vader appearing to use The Force to summon cleaning cloths.
But the law firm representing the car wash said while owner Matias Jara was in the process of registering his brand with Chilean patent authority INAPI, he received a lawsuit from the franchise's creator, Lucasfilm.
Mr Jara's lawyers said Lucasfilm wanted to block the registration of the name and argued the brand could be confused as being affiliated with it.
It had not raised issues with the attendants, the lawyers said.
Lucasfilm, which was acquired by Disney in 2012, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr Jara is contesting the suit and argues the name is sufficiently different enough from the movie franchise to avoid confusion.
He also argues that while the production company's copyright covers products such as toys, furniture and non-alcoholic drinks, it does not extend to cleaning cars.
He said his young daughter had thought of the wordplay while on a family trip to a Disney theme park in the US which features a Star Wars area.
""We don't make movies or sell their products or anything like that,"" Mr Jara added.
He did note his business was, however, a ""stellar"" car wash.

Lee, 48, who played the head of a wealthy household in the film, had faced investigation over accusations of illegal drug use amid a government crackdown in which police questioned him three times, with one session running 19 hours over the weekend.
The actor had said he was tricked into taking drugs by a bar hostess trying to blackmail him, the Yonhap news agency reported.
Authorities found Lee in a search triggered by the report that he was missing, a Seoul official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, as the matter is sensitive.
Earlier, citing police, Yonhap said Lee was found in a car at a park in Seoul, after his manager told police the actor had left home, leaving an apparent suicide note.
Officials at Seoul's Jongno and Seongbuk police stations did not immediately respond to telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment.
Lee's agency, HODU&U Entertainment, also did not respond to calls.
Infringements of South Korea's tough drug laws can lead to six months in jail, or up to 14 years for repeat offenders and dealers.
Lee starred in Parasite, which won four Oscars in 2020 including Best Picture.
Parasite, a 2019 dark-comedy thriller directed by Bong Joon-ho, won Academy Awards in 2020 in the categories of best picture, best director, best original screenplay and best international feature film.
It received six Oscar nominations.
In the film, Lee acted as Mr Park, whose affluent home is infiltrated by members of a lower-class family posing as highly qualified domestic workers in a tangled scheme that leads to a gory end.
Lee, born in 1975, had leading roles in South Korean films such as the 2012 thriller Helpless and 2014's All About My Wife.
He played the lead in Apple TV+'s first Korean-language original series, which rolled out in 2021.
Dr Brain, a six-episode sci-fi thriller, was about a cold-hearted neurologist, Koh Se-won, who tries to find clues to a mysterious family accident through brain experiments.

Ye's apology, posted to X and other social media, follows reports that the release of his new album, titled Vultures, has been delayed until January. The release has been pushed back several times from its original date in October.

The artist sparked outrage last year with his anti-Semitic social media posts, including one that appeared to accuse musician Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of being controlled by ""the Jewish people"" and another that appeared to show a swastika symbol inside a Star of David.
The Anti-Defamation League advocacy group, which documents anti-Semitism, had described the musician's remarks as inflammatory and conspiratorial. It said he was directly referenced in 59 anti-Semitic incidents tracked by the group during 2022.
""I sincerely apologise to the Jewish community for any unplanned outburst. … It was not my intent to hurt or disrespect, and I very much regret any pain I may have caused,"" the musician wrote on Instagram in Hebrew.

After Ye went on a string of anti-Semitic rants in interviews and on social media, he lost his partnership with Adidas and Gap for Yeezy products. His remarks also led to restrictions on his social media accounts at the time.
""I am committed to begin with myself and to learn from this experience in order to ensure greater sensitivity and understanding in the future,"" Ye wrote.
""Your forgiveness is important to me,"" he wrote, adding that he was committed to making amends and advancing unity.
The rapper's comments on social justice issues have also sparked controversy, including in 2022 when he used a racial slur against comedian Trevor Noah. The same year he wore a shirt with ""White Lives Matter"" on it at Paris Fashion Week.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-27/why-romance-and-romantasy-novels-are-so-popular-on-tiktok/103198518,"The romance genre is 'blowing up' online. A bestselling author, publisher and bookseller explain why","They're bright, steamy and no longer hidden away in a bedside drawer – young women are embracing the romance genre with a ""refreshing lack of shame"" and are sending their favourites straight to the top of the bestseller list.
""When I was younger there was this image of Mills and Boon-esque romance novels,"" says Amy McKinnon, a bookseller at Brisbane's Avid Reader.
""But certainly in the last few years they've been something that's become very cool and very popular and certainly in our store we're noticing it's hugely popular.""
So why are readers swooning over the romance genre more than ever?
We spoke to a number one New York Times bestselling author, publisher and bookseller to understand why romance novels are being read with wild abandon.
For the uninitiated, two basic elements comprise every romance novel, according to the Romance Writers of America:
Romance is multifaceted, but the subgenre that's booming on social media is contemporary romance – so love stories set in the modern day, rather than historical romance.
Some readers find their next pick by sticking to their favourite tropes, whether that is friends to lovers, enemies to lovers, fake dating, forced proximity – the list is endless.

In Ms McKinnon's experience, it's mostly young women in their 20s and 30s who are the biggest consumers of romance novels and get most of their recommendations from social media or word of mouth from friends.
""Love is a very hopeful thing. I think that people really like the idea of these books that are hopeful and romantic,"" she said.
Ali Watts, a publisher at Penguin Random House, says romance is ""perennially popular"".
""We've been selling romance novels as long as books have been around, but they do seem to go in trends,"" she told ABC News.
""Now we're definitely seeing young readers coming on board with more of these TikTok books.""
Walk into any bookstore and you'll find the romance section stacked with colourful covers featuring cartoon illustrations of couples, some branded with a permanent sticker proclaiming 'TikTok made me buy it!'
Thanks to TikTok, viral memes and good reads come together in one big online community.
The bookish side of TikTok, known as #BookTok, has over 200 billion views and counting.
It's where the next viral hit finds its following and gains traction, the sheer number of reviews, ratings and reactions propelling a title through the algorithm.
Ms McKinnon says the accessibility of modern romance novels is also part of their huge appeal.
""It doesn't take a lot to read a romance novel. It's not a huge 800-page family saga,"" she said.
""And that's not to say that they're any less, but we get a lot of groups of girls coming in and saying 'I've read this one' and they kind of share.
Tessa Bailey, the number one New York Times bestselling author of several R-rated romances such as It Happened One Summer and Hook, Line and Sinker, believes the genre has become so popular of late ""because a younger generation has discovered the genre and blown it up"".

But Bailey also believes the COVID-19 pandemic assisted in creating the ""perfect storm"" of demand which has seen readers sustain their interest in the genre.
""During the pandemic, I do feel as though this generation was missing out on the angst and pining they would have typically been experiencing if life had been normal,"" Bailey, who lives in Long Island, New York, told ABC News.
""They got those feelings through romance novels, instead, and have maintained the interest – and craving for big gestures, heroic men and drama – even now that life has largely resumed as usual.
""Honestly, I just think it was the perfect storm of demand for entertainment and the vast influence of TikTok that has propelled romance to where it is at this moment.""
Along with Tessa Bailey, several other authors have become superstars of the romance genre, including Colleen Hoover, Emily Henry and Ali Hazelwood.
Fangirl Down by Tessa Bailey is a romantic comedy set to be released next February.
Last year Colleen Hoover held six of the top 10 spots on the the New York Times's paperback fiction bestseller list and sold 8.6 million print books in 2022 alone – more copies than the Bible, according to NPD BookScan.
This year Hoover continued her reign as the top-selling author in the US, according to the Associated Press – even without releasing a new book.
For Penguin Random House publisher Ali Watts, it's ""a bittersweet position for a publisher to be in.""
""The problem we've got here is the books that are dominating the charts, dominating TikTok, getting all the coverage – they're all coming from overseas,"" she says.
""I believe it's mathematically impossible to generate a bestseller, a TikTok phenomenon from Australia because our population here is so much smaller that we just haven't got the vast numbers of people all reading it at once and making the algorithm spike.
It's not just modern romances that are populating bestseller lists – the romantasy genre (romantic fantasy) has boomed in recent years due to the success of prolific authors like Sarah J Maas and, more recently, Rebecca Yarros.
Yarros's Fourth Wing was released in May this year and, thanks to the power of BookTok, shot to the top of the New York Times bestseller list.
""The sales figures are phenomenal,"" says publisher Ali Watts.
Its sequel, Iron Flame, was released just six months later in November and again sent the Empyrean series straight to number one.

""Romantasy is starting to take over the genre a little bit,"" says bookseller Amy KcKinnon.
""On the weekend we'll get a huge amount of people coming in asking 'what's the next romantasy I can read?'""
The Avid Reader bookstore held a midnight release party for Fourth Wing's sequel Iron Flame and were ""floored"" by the sold-out response, which was reminiscent of the late 2000s when the Harry Potter series was ending and the Twilight saga was beginning.
For Ms McKinnon, part of the appeal of romantasy is because it's ""escapism in its purest form"".
The Empyrean series, which is slated for three more instalments, features all the hallmarks of a romantic fantasy – brutal action, high-stakes drama and plenty of sex, referred to online as ""spice"".
For publisher Ali Watts, a strong level of spice across romance and romantasy is a huge factor in the appeal of the genres.
""Readers are looking for it and it's considered a strong selling point if it has a good, strong spice level,"" she says.
On BookTok, rating the level of spice in a review of a romance book is as common as giving it a star rating out of five, and lines where the enemies finally become lovers are annotated, analysed and celebrated.
It's arguably a far cry from the ""guilty pleasure"" sentiment that has shrouded the genre for generations.
""Genre fiction has for a very long time been a male thing, so fantasy, sci-fi, crime novels,"" says Ms McKinnon.
""[With] the rise of romance you have predominantly female readers reading predominantly female authors. I just think it's great to see women reclaiming some of genre fiction.""
Booksellers say the romance genre is often ""looked down upon because it's such a female dominated thing."" (Unsplash)
Ms McKinnon adds that romance is the fastest growing genre fiction at the moment, despite it being often ""looked down upon because it's such a female dominated thing.""
""I think it's about reclaiming women's sexuality and reclaiming things that are joyful for women and women not being ashamed of that as well,"" she says.
""Because quite often romance novels are silly to the extent that they hate each other and fall in love,"" she laughs.
""But there's nothing wrong with having things that are purely for female joy, whether that's the sex or the really cheesy romance of it.
""I think romance is very clever and it can be very nuanced sometimes. It's very difficult to write a book that always has the same outcome, which is the two people getting together in the end, but make the journey so exciting the whole way through.""
From Oprah to Reese Witherspoon, Kaia Gerber and now Dua Lipa — the celebrity book club trend has never been more popular. But do they have the same influence as they once did?
For bestselling romance author Tessa Bailey: ""Some people will never change their perception of romance novels.""
""To some, it will always be pirates in billowy shirts and helpless women – which has never been the sum total of the romance genre, it has always been more.
""But the truth is these novels are empowering, they breed empathy, they are escapism, they help readers recognise their own strengths.
""And a major difference now is that readers simply don't care how people perceive what they like to read.
""There is a refreshing lack of shame now from the new readers and I applaud that.",JBy Jessica Riga,Wed 27 Dec 2023,0

Take a look back at some of the Australians who died this year.
Celebrity chef Jock Zonfrillo died suddenly this year.  (Instagram/@zonfrillo)
The MasterChef Australia judge and celebrity chef, who had previously shared his battle with heroin addiction, died unexpectedly in May. He was 46.
Born in Glasgow to an Italian father and a Scottish mother, Jock Zonfrillo — born Barry Zonfrillo — moved to Australia at the age of 20. He went on to spend decades operating renowned restaurants in Sydney and Adelaide, before landing the television gig in 2019.
Zonfrillo was known for highlighting Australian native ingredients in his restaurants, sourcing ingredients from remote Aboriginal communities. ""I describe it quite simply as Australian,"" he said of his cooking in 2013.
A statement from his family released in the wake of his death said there were ""so many words"" to describe him, and ""so many stories"" to be told. ""For those who crossed his path, became his mate, or were lucky enough to be his family, keep this proud Scot in your hearts when you have your next whisky,"" it read.

Barry Humphries, the man behind beloved characters Dame Edna Everage and Sir Les Patterson, died in April aged 89.
Owing to his undeniable stage presence, brilliant comedic timing and quick wit, Humphries defined a genre and changed the face of Australian comedy.
""With over 70 years on the stage, he was an entertainer to his core, touring up until the last year of his life and planning more shows that will sadly never be,"" he family said in a statement following his death.
""The characters he created, which brought laughter to millions, will live on.""
While he was most known for his comedic alter egos, Humphries also appeared in more than 20 films and authored numerous books and stage plays. According to his family, he was also a painter, author, poet, collector and ""lover of art in all its forms"".
He died in hospital after being admitted due to ongoing complications from hip surgery.

Joy Chambers-Grundy, best known for her role as Rosemary Daniels in Neighbours, died peacefully in her sleep in September. She was 76.
Born in Ipswich in 1946, she also went on to star in The Restless Years and The Young Doctors. Her performances earned her multiple awards, including Logies for Best Female Personality in 1969 and 1970.
But Chambers-Grundy's talents extended beyond the silver screen — with her husband, multimillionaire media mogul Reg Grundy, she helped build a successful independent production company that operated across 20 countries.
""Joy will be remembered as a Logie Award-winning actress, a best-selling author, a poet, a philanthropist, and an exceptional businesswoman,"" her family said in a statement following her death.
In the 1990s, Chambers-Grundy found her niche in writing historical fiction, which was described as her ""fifth career"". She released her final novel, The Soldier's Choice, in 2014.

A giant in the fight for Indigenous land rights, Gumatj clan leader Yunupingu died in north-east Arnhem Land earlier this year. He was 74.
Yunupingu was a long-term chair of the Northern Land Council, serving eight terms over 24 years, a former Australian of the Year, a Garma festival chairman, singer, painter and force of community power. According to Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney, over two decades he was ""one of the most significant leaders ... of First Nations people"" across the country.
Born in 1948 to the powerful Gumatj clan leader Mungurrawuy Yunupingu, he was encouraged by his father to pursue a Western education while maintaining his Yolngu traditions.
Following his death, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Yunupingu was a man who ""walked in two worlds with authority, power and grace"".
""Yunupingu understood a fundamental truth: if you want to make your voice count, you have to make sure that it's heard.""
Actor Johnny Ruffo. (Supplied: Instagram)
An actor who starred in the TV soap Home and Away and competed in The X Factor, Johnny Ruffo died of brain cancer in November, aged 35.
Ruffo was born in Perth in 1988, and first came to public attention in 2011 as a contestant on the musical reality TV show The X Factor. After coming third in the competition he signed a contract with Sony Music Australia and recorded a duet with singer Guy Sebastian.
In 2013 Ruffo was cast as Chris Harrington in the TV soap opera Home and Away, and in 2014 was nominated for the most popular new talent award at the 2014 Logies.
Ruffo first revealed he had been diagnosed with brain cancer in 2017. He underwent surgery and later announced he was in remission. But his cancer returned in 2020, with Ruffo sharing on Instagram he had been experiencing unexpected seizures and ""excruciating headaches"".
In his 2022 memoir, No Finish Line, he revealed his cancer was terminal, describing the first moment he was told about the 7-centimetre tumour in his brain, also known as a stage three oligodendroglioma.
A statement shared on his Instagram account on November 10 said Ruffo died peacefully ""with the support of some incredible nurses and doctors"", surrounded by his partner Tahnee and family.
His Home and Away co-star Georgie Parker said Ruffo was ""truly one in a million"". ""It's ridiculously cruel that he's no longer here,"" she said.

One of Australia's most acclaimed and celebrated artists who was known for his vivid depictions of landscapes and nature, John Olsen died in April aged 95.
Born in Newcastle in 1928, Olsen studied art at Julian Ashton Art School before enrolling at East Sydney Technical College, where he quickly made a name for himself.
""It took a lot of courage to be an artist in those days and he had no hesitation but to run with it and in art he found his calling,"" his son and gallerist Tim Olsen said.
Olsen studied printmaking in Paris and lived in an artist colony in Mallorca before returning to Australia inspired to paint the landscapes and nature of his home country. In 1971 he was commissioned to paint the 21-metres-wide mural Salute to Five Bells, which still hangs in the Sydney Opera House.
During his 60-year career Olsen's works were exhibited in galleries around Australia and overseas. After receiving an Order of Australia in 2001, Olsen described art as a form of compulsion which he started developing at age four: ""Artists are born, not made,"" he said.
He won the Archibald Prize in 2005, the Wynne Prize in 1969 and 1985, and the Sulman Prize in 1989.
Olsen died in April, surrounded by his family.
""Apart from our First Nation artists, he changed the perspective and way that Australians looked at our magnificent landscape,"" Tim Olsen said of his father. ""He was a landscape poet to the end and a titan of the Australian art world.""

A Liberal senator and former major general in the Australian Army, Jim Molan died of cancer in January. He was 72.
Molan's military career spanned four decades and included deployments to Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Iraq, where he held a senior operations role.
He retired from the army in 2008 and became involved in politics in 2012, entering the Senate in 2017.
In April 2021, Molan announced he was taking sick leave after being diagnosed with ""an aggressive form of cancer"". He later returned to parliament, having undergone treatment, and was re-elected to a six-year term in the Senate in the 2022 election.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described Molan as ""a man of principle and a politician of conviction"". ""Jim Molan lived his life in service of our country,"" he tweeted.
In a statement Opposition Leader Peter Dutton described Molan as a ""distinguished soldier and military commander, an admired politician of centre-right convictions, and a perceptive author and respected public commentator who expressed his views with courage"".
""Whether it was on the battlefield, in the political arena, or on the media stage, Jim was admired for his discernment, leadership and unfailingly courteous manner,"" Dutton said.

A South Australian champion yachtsman and wine businessman, Sir James Hardy died in June, aged 90.
Widely known as ""Gentleman Jim"", Sir James was an Olympic sailor before he became part of the first team to defeat the United States in the America's Cup sailing race in 1983.
He was born in Adelaide in 1932, the great-grandson of the founder of his family's wine company, where he worked from 1953 until its sale to Accolade in 2003.
Sir James was made an OBE in 1975 and knighted in 1981 for ""services to yachting and the community"".
As well as serving as chairman of the Hardy company, he sat on the boards and councils of many public institutions and charities whilst continuing to sail competitively until late in his life.
Sir James passed away peacefully in Adelaide in June, his life celebrated in a state funeral at St Peter's College Memorial Hall.
""He was a business leader, Olympian and famously led the charge for Australia in three America's Cup campaigns,"" said South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas.

An AFL legend who won 10 premierships as a player and coach and pioneered the ruck rover position, Ron Barassi died after falling in September, aged 87.
The Melbourne Football Club coterie pledged looked after Barassi after his father, who played 58 games for Melbourne, was killed in Tobruk in World War II.
Barassi played 254 senior VFL games in his career: 204 for Melbourne and 50 for Carlton. He helped Melbourne win six premierships between 1955 and 1964 before moving to Carlton as captain-coach in 1965.
He retired from senior football in 1969 but continued on as coach, leading the team to one of the greatest comebacks in VFL history against Collingwood in 1970.
Barassi was one of the first inductees to the AFL Hall of Fame in 1996 when he was also elevated to Legend status. Ten years later he was elevated to a Legend of Australian Sport.
AFL Commission chairman Richard Goyder said Barassi was ""the most important figure in Australian football"" since World War II.
""He revolutionised the game as a player – created the position of ruck rover – built premiership success at clubs as a coach and then was our first great evangelist to take the game north and grow it to become what we have today,"" Goyder said.
""He was known all across Australia when football wasn't always known.""
Former Labor leader Simon Crean.
A former federal Labor leader whose generosity and commitment to his principles earned him respect from both sides of politics, Simon Crean died suddenly in Berlin in June, aged 74.
Crean was president of the ACTU before he moved into federal politics, serving as the member of parliament for the Melbourne seat of Hotham from 1990 to 2013. He was a cabinet minister in the Hawke, Keating, Rudd and Gillard governments and leader of the federal parliamentary Labor Party while in opposition from 2001 to 2003.
Crean famously opposed prime minister John Howard's decision to deploy Australian troops to Iraq in 2003, arguing the PM was justifying war, not planning for peace.
Labor minister Bill Shorten said Crean had shown ""incredible courage in opposing the second Gulf War in Iraq"". ""Being an opposition leader is very tough,"" he said, ""but to stand against the drums of war takes a very special brand of conviction.""
As arts minister, Crean in 2013 launched the National Cultural Policy, Creative Australia, which included increased investment in Indigenous art.
""Simon always believed culture defines us,"" his wife Carole said at his state funeral. He always celebrated that Australia had the oldest continuous culture on Earth, she said.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Crean, who died of a pulmonary embolism after his morning exercise, wold be missed enormously. ""Simon was a great servant of the Labor Party and of the broader labour movement,"" he said.
""Above all he was a thoroughly decent human being who was kind, generous and always of good humour. This brought him respect across the political spectrum.""
Bill Hayden at his home in Queensland in 2018. (ABC News: Amy Donaldson)
A former governor general, one-time Labor Party leader and an architect of universal healthcare in Australia, Bill Hayden died in October, aged 90.
Born in 1933, William George Hayden was raised in working class Brisbane. After leaving school at 16 he worked as a public servant, then a police officer, while he completed a degree in economics.
Hayden entered parliament in 1961 after being elected to the Queensland seat of Oxley. He served as social security minister and treasurer in the Whitlam government.
As minister for social security he introduced Medibank, the first plan for universal healthcare, as well as the first single mother's pension. As Prime Minister Anthony Albanese observed in October, Hayden's service as a police officer helped him understand that ""poverty too often trapped women in violent relationships"".
Still, when Gough Whitlam gave him the job of health and welfare, Hayden was initially disappointed. ""I said: 'Awh, is there anything else?'"" he said in 2014. ""I asked for economic portfolios, and he said: 'Grab it lad, it'll be the making of you'.""
Hayden became party leader after two election defeats in 1975 and 1977, giving Labor ""a new direction"" and empowering a new generation of talent, Albanese said. His leadership ""laid the foundation for the social and economic reforms that created three decades of economic growth and delivered Australia a new era in education, foreign affairs, environmental policy and – of course – universal healthcare"".
In 1989 Bob Hawke appointed Hayden governor-general, a position he held for seven years.
""We give thanks for the life of a remarkable Queenslander,"" Albanese said at Hayden's state funeral. ""A great Australian. And a profoundly good human being.""
Epidemiologist Mary-Louise McLaws in 2021. (AAP: Mick Tsikas)
An epidemiologist and infection control expert who became a go-to source for reliable information when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in Australia, Mary-Louise McLaws died in August, aged 70, 18 months after being diagnosed with and treated for a brain tumour.
Prior to the pandemic McLaws was a respected epidemiologist and emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales who also served as a World Health Organisation adviser to China, working in Hong Kong to help control SARS, then in Malaysia, becoming a member of the WHO's Infection Prevention and Control Global Unit.
The emergence of COVID-19 was McLaws' ""time to shine"" and she quickly became a reliable source for journalists scrambling to provide information on the crisis as borders were closed and lockdowns imposed. As Virginia Trioli wrote: ""Her kind and reasonable agreement to almost any request, no matter how ridiculously early or late, was astonishing.""
She was vocal about closing the Australian border and made a point of her commitment to speaking frankly about public health issues free of politics: ""My tone should always be, 'I'm not political but I will tell you what I think as an epidemiologist and as a global epidemiologist as well and what the [World Health Organisation] and others are trying to achieve',"" she told ABC Radio Melbourne.
In June 2022, McLaws was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the General Division ""for distinguished service to medical research, particularly to epidemiology and infection prevention, to tertiary education, and to health administration"".
Bob and Helena Carr in Vienna in October 2023. (AAP)
The wife of former New South Wales premier and foreign minister Bob Carr, Helena Carr died of a brain aneurysm while on an overseas trip in October. She was 77.
Ms Carr was declared dead after suddenly losing consciousness in her hotel bathroom in Vienna, Austria, where she and her husband had been walking, lunching with friends and enjoying the opera just hours before.
""She was the light of my life, the little friend always there,"" Mr Carr said in a statement at the time.
Mr Carr said his Malaysian-born wife had been ""the CEO, the CFO, the chief strategist and the financial planner"" of their 50-year marriage. She was also a successful business leader, running the security printing division at Coca-Cola Amatil before jointly buying a major printing firm from the John Sands Group in 1991.
At her funeral at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney, Mr Carr shared that she would often delay talking about her own achievements to let him shine as a rising MP. Only after he was first sworn in to a ministry under Neville Wran in 1984 did Ms Carr reveal she had been appointed to a board, he said: ""She hadn't wanted to take the gloss off my own initial climb up the greasy pole of politics.""
After serving as NSW premier from 1995 to 2005, Mr Carr returned to parliament in 2012 as a federal senator and foreign minister in the Gillard government. In his eulogy for his wife he said she had loved ""the play, the humour, the personality"" of politics. ""It's inconceivable I could have done this for the [Labor] party without Helena by my side.""
Justin Yerbury was well known for his advocacy for the rights of people living with a disability. (Supplied: University of Wollongong, Mark Nersham.)
Justin Yerbury, a renowned molecular biologist who spent years researching the very disease that would eventually claim his own life, died in July at the age of 49.
Yerbury, an award-winning professor at the University of Wollongong, began studying motor neurone disease (MND) after his mother, grandmother and aunt all died from the neurodegenerative illness in the space of six weeks in 2002.
When his sister died from MND at 26, Yerbury and his surviving sister were tested for the condition, which can be genetic and run in families. His test revealed he carried the gene for MND.
But Yerbury put his head down and in 2008 earned a PhD from the University of Wollongong before working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Cambridge.
Yerbury began experiencing MND symptoms in 2016 and soon after was diagnosed with the condition. He gradually lost his ability to walk, talk and breathe independently and needed around-the-clock care, as well as a motorised wheelchair, ventilator and eye-gaze technology to communicate.
Despite his many challenges and limitations he continued working on MND and demonstrated that protein deposits found in motor neurons resulted from dysfunction in a process known as protein homeostasis. He was awarded the University of New South Wales Eureka Prize for Scientific Research for his work, as well as the award for Excellence in Medical Biological Sciences in the 2022 NSW Premier's Prizes for Science and Engineering.
Yerbury was hospitalised with a collapsed lung in late 2022 and later began to experience paralysis of his eye muscles, which affected his ability to communicate.

Gabrielle Carey, an academic and co-author of the Australian coming-of-age novel Puberty Blues, died suddenly in May, aged 64.
Carey was a teenager when she and Kathy Lette wrote Puberty Blues, which contained frank depictions of teenage sex and sexism in surf and youth culture in 1970s Sydney. It was published in 1979 and turned into a film two years later.
Carey, who was a senior lecturer in creative writing at the University of Technology Sydney, wrote 10 books. Her most recent title, Only Happiness Here: In Search of Elizabeth von Arnim, was published in 2020.
Her 2013 book, Moving Among Strangers: Randolph Stow and My Family, jointly won the 2014 Prime Minister's Award for Non-Fiction and was shortlisted for the National Biography Award.
In December 2020 Carey wrote an opinion article in the Sydney Morning Herald about her struggle with depression, a mental illness from which her father also suffered.
""It was only decades later, when my father died from suicide on the very day he turned 64, that I became terrified of that number,"" she wrote. ""If I have inherited my father's disposition for depression, did that mean I would also end up in an early grave?""
Her literary agent Jane Novak said Carey was one of Australia's greatest writers, and her ""skill as a memoirist and biographer is particularly notable"".
""But it was her unflinching examination of the human condition and her emotional honesty that I loved her for,"" Novak said.
""That, and her formidable intellect and her wonderful sparkling and spiky personality. This is a terrible, terrible loss.""

A trailblazer of country music in Australia, winner of the first ever Golden Guitar award, and Slim Dusty's wife and manager, Joy McKean died in May, aged 93.
McKean was a talented songwriter and musician who, during her 70-year career, also wrote many of her husband's most famous songs.
She rose to country fame in the 1940s and '50s, working with her sister Heather as the McKean Sisters, though back then she said the industry was ""chauvinistic"": ""Nobody would have believed I was writing [the songs],"" she said.
Australian country music scored its golden couple when McKean teamed up with Slim Dusty, who she married in 1951 and managed professionally for decades.
In 1973 she won the first Golden Guitar award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival for the song Lights on the Hill, going on to win another six Golden Guitars during her career. McKean was also twice inducted into the Australasian Country Music Roll of Renown and also won the Industry Achiever Award from the Country Music Association of Australia, which she co-founded in 1992.
In 1991, McKean was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for ""service to the entertainment industry"" and in 2021 was the recipient of the Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music.
She died peacefully surrounded by her family after a long battle with cancer.

A social justice campaigner and ""people's priest"" who dedicated his life to standing up for the poor and marginalised, Father Bob Maguire died in April, aged 88.
Maguire was born in Thornbury, Melbourne, in 1934, and tragically lost two sisters and both his parents by the time he was 16.
He entered the seminary at Werribee in 1953 and was ordained as a priest in 1960.
Maguire was the parish priest of Saints Peter and Paul's Catholic Church in South Melbourne from 1973 to 2012, and left only after clashing with the Catholic Church hierarchy over its mandate that priests retire at age 75. He eventually reached a deal allowing him to remain a priest until he was 77, and he retired in 2012.
In his final mass, he said his forced retirement would not stop him from working to improve the lives of people less fortunate.
""I can't take the church with me, and I don't have another church to go to,"" he said, ""[But] I'm still Bob Maguire the Catholic priest and I'm still Father Bob the citizen.""
Maguire's charity and advocacy work and wicked sense of humour made him a popular man particularly in Melbourne, and he continued working with his foundation, which delivers hundreds of free meals to those in need each week, after he retired.
He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1989 for his service to homeless youth and was named Victorian of the Year in 2011.
He died at Cabrini Hospital in Melbourne months after his health began declining.

Renée Geyer, a soul singer whose husky vocals shot her to fame in the 1970s, died in January from complications of hip surgery. She was 69.
One of the country's most celebrated singers, Geyer described herself in her 2000 autobiography as ""a white Hungarian Jew from Australia sounding like a 65-year-old black man from Alabama"".
Born in Melbourne in 1953, Geyer sang with different bands in the 1970s, including the jazz-rock group Sun, before launching her solo career with a self-titled album in 1973. She released her highest-charting single, Heading in the Right Direction, in 1975.
She quickly became a sought after vocalist and collaborated with numerous artists during her career — Sting, Chaka Khan, Joe Cocker, Neil Diamond and others — and continued performing right up until the month before she died.
Geyer was nominated for several ARIA awards but never won, and was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Music Victoria Hall of Fame in 2013. She received the lifetime achievement award at the Australian Women in Music awards in 2018.
Geyer was known for her rebellious streak; she once slapped Molly Meldrum in the face while being interviewed live on air on Countdown and was open about her struggles with addiction in the 1970s and 80s.
While she was in hospital it was discovered Geyer also had inoperable lung cancer, her family said in her statement: ""She was in no pain and died peacefully amongst family and friends.""
""Renée was irrepressible, cheeky and loyal and her musical legacy speaks for itself,"" they said. ""Renée lived her life as she performed — on her own terms and to the fullest.""

An Academy Award-winning cartoonist best known for his sharp satire of Australian and world politics, Bruce Petty died in April after a long illness, aged 93.
Petty grew up on a small farm in the Melbourne suburb of Doncaster. At age 19 he began working at the Owen brothers' animation studio in Box Hill, and his first project was writing the script for a film that aimed to raise safety awareness among children, called Careful Koala.
After working briefly in the art department at Melbourne's Herald newspaper, in 1954 Petty moved to London, where his work was published in the satirical magazine Punch, and then onto New York, where his work was featured in The New Yorker and Esquire, among other publications.
Back in Australia, he established himself as prominent political cartoonist, creating sharp satirical works for The Australian and The Age.
""I suppose it is traditional that political cartoonists take on people with power in the community,"" Petty said in his bio for The Age.
""There is now even more important, more anonymous, figures who run our global, corporate world … We [cartoonists] keep drawing politicians but the real power is often with a different set of people. We draw them as a vague, ominous people.""
In 1977 Petty won an Academy Award for his short film Leisure, though he claimed to have never received the statuette. ""When I got it, the Oscar went to the producer. We got a picture of it, a very nice gold-framed picture,"" he told The Age in 2004.
He was also the recipient of a Silver Stanley Award by the Australian Cartooning Association in 2001, a Quill Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009 and a Walkley Award in 2016.

Before entering politics Murphy was a a senior public defender at Victoria Legal Aid and a barrister at the Victorian Law Reform Commission.
She was first elected to the House of Representatives in the Victorian seat of Dunkley in 2019 and became a ""rare figure"" in that she was universally liked across the parliament.
Murphy was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 but, after a period of recovery, her cancer returned shortly after her 2019 election victory. She had a metastatic breast cancer which was treatable but not curable, and in recent years had switched from oral to intravenous chemotherapy, which she received on three out of every four Fridays.
Working with the Breast Cancer Network Australia, she advocated for a national registry for metastatic cancer patients.
Murphy was with her husband Rod when she died in their family home.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government was ""broken-hearted"".
""It was so true to Peta's character that she channelled her personal battle with breast cancer into public policy, advocating always for others: for better treatment, more services and stronger support,"" Albanese said.
""In 2019, Peta received the news her cancer had returned two weeks prior to being sworn in as an MP. In her remarkable first speech in the parliament she said: 'I am neither unique nor alone in the fight I am about to take on'.
""In so many wonderful ways, Peta was unique. But as someone who inspired such affection and respect in the hearts of so many, she was never alone.""

A veteran media executive who helped the once-struggling soap opera Neighbours find global success and who was the creative force behind many other popular TV shows, Brian Walsh died suddenly in March, aged 67.
Walsh held senior positions at Network Ten, Sky Broadcasting in the UK, Sky TV in Asia, and Foxtel. He began his almost 50-year career at the ABC before moving into feature film production and distribution at Palm Beach Pictures, and promotions and publicity at Sydney radio station 2SM.
He later moved to Ten, where he played an integral role in the 1985 decision to acquire Neighbours after it was dumped by channel Seven. Walsh led the show's revival and is credited with helping build the careers of Nicole Kidman, Kylie Minogue and Hugh Jackman.
At Foxtel, which he joined in 1995, Walsh was the driving force behind numerous TV series including Deadline Gallipoli, The Kettering Incident, Wentworth, Upright, Love Me, Colin From Accounts and The Twelve.
He died unexpectedly after collapsing at his Potts Point apartment.
""Australia's creative community has lost a much-loved figure in Brian,"" said Foxtel Group chief Patrick Delany. ""For us, the loss is heavily felt. At the Foxtel Group, Brian was a long-time mentor, a confidant, a colleague and an unwavering friend to so many.""
Federal Art Minister Tony Burke said he was devastated to hear of Walsh's death: ""Countless Australian stories were told and careers forged because of Brian's vision, commitment and innate understanding of great storytelling.""",Unknown,Wed 27 Dec 2023,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-25/aussie-vanilla-slice-delicate-european-dessert-snot-block-bakery/103255450,The rise of the snot block: The fancy European origins of the humble Aussie vanilla slice,"In 1998, Victorian premier Jeff Kennett visited a town in regional Victoria and said he had discovered, in his opinion, the best vanilla slice in Australia at the local bakery.
He was so inspired by his slice experience that he established a new competition to determine, conclusively, Australia's best vanilla slice. The inaugural ""Great Australian Vanilla Slice Triumph"" was held in Ouyen, Victoria on October 23 that year.
Kennett's press release promoting the event declared this ""important Australian culinary delicacy has tantalised Australians since white settlement"" and ""the pursuit of the best vanilla slice and the best vanilla slice baker in Australia should be of great national interest"".
The competition became an annual event, hosted at Ouyen until 2001, when the honour was passed to nearby Merbein and has continued.
Imported from Europe, the vanilla slice has been fully assimilated into Australian food culture, an identifiable icon. (Supplied: merbeinvanillaslice.com)
After some COVID-related cancellations, the contest was on again in 2023. Judges advise entrants on the Triumph website that they are looking for ""a custard with a creamy smooth texture and a balance of vanilla taste with a crisp crunchy pastry topped with a smooth and shiny glaze fondant"". North End Bakehouse in Shepparton, Victoria took first place this year, fulfilling baker Matt Aylett's career-long quest for top honours.
Proclaimed as a national icon, the vanilla slice is a familiar sight in Australian bakeries — but where did this pastry come from?
Across Europe and the United States there are many versions of the vanilla slice, with the earliest mention found in a 1651 French cookbook as a gateau with frangipane.
The French version is called a mille-feuille, translated as ""one thousand leaves"" of pastry created by repeatedly folding a thin sheet of butter wrapped inside a dough covering. In the oven, the butter melts and its water content creates steam, separating the dough to make countless crunchy layers.
The Great Australian Vanilla Slice Triumph is on the move to Birchip, but not without a fight from Mildura Rural City Council.
Unlike the Aussie slice with its thick layer of custard, the mille-feuille has three sheets of puff pastry and only a centimetre of crème pâtissière in between.
In America, the same three-layer design is called a Napoleon, a corruption of Napoletana, referencing the origin of another version from Naples.
In Poland, there is the kremowka; in the Netherlands, the tompouce; in Serbia, the krempita; in Croatia the kremšnite; and then the caramel-covered version, the Hungarian Szegedinertorte.
With similar versions across the globe, it is impossible to trace the genealogy of the Australian treat, but the combination of crunch and cream clearly has universal appeal.
Replacing the plain English name (vanilla slice, custard block) with an irreverent and outrageous moniker (""snot block"" or ""phlegm sandwich"") is standard practice in Australia, where informality and a lack of pretence are hallmarks of the vernacular.
The Macquarie Dictionary blog suggests that ""snot block"" is a regionalism that originated in central Victoria, with less frequently cited variants in other states, including ""snot brick"", ""phlegm cake"" and ""pus pie"".
Has the original delicate nature of the pastry followed the slide into slang from the French mille-feuille to snot block? The slice has grown in size over time, now with so much filling it can be difficult to eat gracefully. Extra skill is also required of the baker, tasked with making a custard-filled tower with the structural stability to stand on its own.
Consulting the archives of Australian Women's Weekly provided tips and tricks offered to help home bakers ""make your custard set"".
For a dainty portion, with an extra layer of puff pastry, this is not a challenge.
Traditional pastry cream is not expected to be sliced like a jelly — it is a filling for cream puffs and eclairs.
Is this a snot brick or a phlegm pie? (Supplied: Alpha/flickr, CC BY-NC)
The taller the slice, however, the more thickening power is required, usually in the form of cornstarch, gelatine or pudding mix. This is a delicate balancing act, however, as too much thickener produces a filling with the consistency of a bouncy ball, and too little will result in an uncontrollable blob.
Cooking the custard just enough to maximise the thickening power of the cornstarch but not scramble the eggs is also a tricky business, requiring either a keen eye or a thermometer and constant supervision.
This may account for the staying power of the vanilla slice in the bakery, especially in its new high-rise evolution. Only the most daring of home cooks would tackle such a temperamental recipe, only to have guests say ""Oh, you made snot block!""
Imported from Europe, the vanilla slice has been fully assimilated into Australian food culture, an identifiable icon. A sure measure of its acceptance as a genuine element of Aussie culture is its unpretentious alias — snot block. You know you really belong when you finally get a nickname.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-24/album-cover-art-and-streaming/103261974,Why album cover art is still important in the age of music streaming,"A DC-3 aircraft rising above Uluru, set against an outback scene of crimson, gold and brown. Is Goanna's Spirit of Place Australia's most iconic record cover?
The album art from Spirit of Place, and others such as AC/DC's T.N.T., and The Divinyls' Desperate have etched themselves into our collective musical memory.
However, as streaming services take over the recorded music landscape, will album art go the way of the cassette single?
Last year Australian music consumers spent nearly 10 times as much on digital downloads and streaming as they did physical musical media such as compact discs and records, according to the Australian Recording Industry Association.
Subscription streaming services alone accounted for $410 million of Australia's $610 million recorded music market.
Sydney-based music enthusiast and part-time record valuer Mark Lumley said the shift from a physical ""record"" had diminished the potency of album art as a marketing tool, although not to the extent it was no longer important.

""We've lost something. The digital age has removed the tactile experience of looking at the cover, reading the cover notes, that type of thing,"" said Mr Lumley, who convenes record fairs in Australia's eastern states.
""Even though people may be listening digitally I still think, to a certain extent, many people use the digital method to road test albums they may buy later.
Physical musical recordings have been in decline over the past decade. CD sales fell 19 per cent in 2022 to $20.4 million. By comparison, Australians spent more than $140 million on CDs in 2013.
Vinyl records have bucked the trend. The amount spent on vinyl climbed 23 per cent in 2022 to $37 million. While fewer individual records (1,149,919) were sold than CDs (1,970,936), the dollar value and trend favoured vinyl, offering a larger canvas for album cover artists to work with.
Australian chamber-pop singer Kate Lucas, who performs as Coda Chroma, said record sales remained an important income source for performers.
""I make more money selling physical merchandise and music,"" Lucas said.
""It is substantial, especially in a live setting. The audience can buy and take home the music, which includes albums.""

Lucas said she considered art to be part of the creative process of putting together an album, regardless of how consumers spent their money.
""Putting songs together is a creative process that includes working with musicians and producers. You want have a visual component of that. It is a complete body of work,"" she said.
The cover of Lucas's most recent album, Dreamself, is as much a work of art as the songs contained within.
The basic artwork was designed by AI (artificial intelligence) before it was painted on canvas by Ballarat visual artist Vikki Nash.

""Vikki brought the image to life. It was a thousand times better than the original AI,"" Lucas said.
""I feel, if you come at a design approach for an album, you want it to say something about the music and what was happening at the time.""
Goanna singer-songwriter Shane Howard said graphic artist Judy Kenneally worked with the band to design Spirit of Place at a house the band dubbed The Goanna Manor.
He said Spirit of Place's imagery was based on Frank Clune's 1944 book The Red Heart but the artwork itself was deliberately meant to draw the eye, much like a band poster.

""It was a boldly Australian look for a boldly Australian band,"" Howard said.
""We prided ourselves on posters and artwork. With so many other band posters everywhere, you had to catch someone's attention in three seconds.
""It was basically three colours, so simple to screenprint and, with Uluru front and centre, it said to people that you should look at your own country.""

Mark Lumley admitted there was no great science to creating an iconic Australian album cover but the truly great ones tended to feature elements of Australiana and the era they were produced.
Here are 10 he considers among our best:
""It's an explosive album and it's an explosive cover. Perfect.""

""I look at Archie Roach as a humble, quietly spoken man who, when he did speak, had something worth listening to. The photo on the cover speaks to that.""

""''Daddy Who? Daddy Cool' was a catch cry of theirs, and it's written as if someone's done it with an old pen. It's also got a cartoon picture that's a really good caricature of a great Australian band.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-21/far-right-tradwives-see-feminism-evil-lifestyles-lie-equality/103252198,There is a seductive simplicity to the tradwife trend. But their far-right beliefs can be dangerous,"There is a seductive simplicity to the ""tradwife"" trend, with its filtered representations of domestic bliss — from homesteading to homeschooling, home baking to home making.
Tradwife is internet shorthand for ""traditional wife"". While tradwives emerge across the political spectrum, a small subculture use their platforms to promote the dark ideas of the far right. They operate across social media platforms, prominent on X (formerly Twitter), TikTok and Instagram. For some, the lifestyle seems driven by social media, but for others, it's a way of living.
The number of tradwives aligned with the far right may be small, but their popularity on social media platforms suggests their cohort is growing. And we know from our research that far-right tradwives are active in Australia, on places such as X and Tik Tok, Instagram and YouTube.
In 2020, UK-based extremism researcher Julia Ebner suggested 30,000 women identified as tradwives or Red Pill Women: women aligned with the far-right male online community Red Pill, who claim to be ""awakened"" to ""male subjugation by feminism"".
The traditional housewife movement is fraught with contention. But those who embrace it say they're far from oppressed.
Journalist Sian Norris, who has investigated the British far right, wrote this year that while most of these women are in the US, ""due to the networked nature of the modern far right"", trends that start there spread around the world.
Far-right tradwives believe contemporary society is beset by decadence and consumerism, sexual depravity and promiscuity, and ""unnatural"" ways of living. This is all supposedly engineered to weaken the white race. Becoming a tradwife is one way far-right women push back against these supposed threats.
Ebner believes ""the search for love is what radicalises most tradwives"": they adopt the rhetoric of men's rights activists who want ""a return to traditional power roles and exaggerated notions of masculinity and femininity"".
Our research shows far-right tradwives believe their roles as mothers and wives guarantee the survival of the white race, while actively weakening enemies. In an effort to encourage men to the cause, some tradwives claim they embraced their ""true"" femininity only after they were protected by a ""real man"" who embodies the (toxic) masculine ideals of the far right.
The exploitation of ""traditional"" gender identities to promote far-right ideas is dangerous. It makes women's subordination to men seem legitimate — and even natural — and justifies violence when this natural order is disrupted.
The tradwife is not a new phenomenon. In recent years, the identity has been adopted by women preferring domestic duties over the modern workforce. The tradwife aesthetic is soft, feminine and sometimes political. Not all tradwives are far-right — and of course, women have every right to choose the lifestyle that best suits them.
Tradwives across the political spectrum believe the place of women is in the home: as wives and mothers. They justify this through political or religious beliefs, or their own personal choices. Many argue they are returning to a traditional way of living that has become unconventional in a society that expects women to be part of the workforce.
For example, tradwife influencer Estee Williams, who has more than 134,000 followers on TikTok, includes submitting to her husband, no opposite-sex friendships and letting her husband have the final say on their finances in her advice for a successful marriage.
One Australian tradwife influencer with a substantial TikTok following (also active on X) similarly exalts submitting to her husband.
Estee Williams’ advice for a successful marriage includes submitting to her husband.
The far right has long had a girl problem. Far-right men (and women) discuss the ideal roles and behaviours of women almost to excess.
For instance, they describe the ""good woman"" as demure, well-behaved, quietly intelligent — and although incapable of leadership, key to the future of white people. These women are ""wounded by the lie of equality, but not broken by it"".
The tradwife is one celebrated form of women's identity in the far right, weaponised to promote racially focused ideas.
The far right centralises women's value as one of service. This means serving as a wife by caring for — and bearing children for — their husband, and serving children by being a mother. Through those two efforts, they serve — and indeed continue — their imagined racial and cultural heritage.
Far-right ideology has emotional appeal beyond racial concerns, too. Its ideology and structure provides certainty in times of chaos, order in times of disorder, and meaning in times of existential struggle.
Are tradwives harmless homemakers or right-wing extremists?
For far-right tradwives, ideology provides gendered clarity by mandating how they should behave, dress, live and interact with others. Their roles as wives and mothers are celebrated as a pure, authentic form of white womanhood. The far-right believe tradwives should be the norm — not an exception.
In an era of #girlboss and hustle culture, tradwives feel judged for their lifestyle choices. Ironically, though, many manage carefully curated, sometimes monetised social media followings. (Some even sell social media advice to followers.)
Far-right tradwives argue the insatiable demands of the capitalism system and feminism are complicit in an all-out war on womanhood.
One prominent far-right tradwife claims feminist domination has resulted in the repression of men who are tired of being shamed for their masculinity.
Those who do not conform to the feminine ideal are seen as unnatural, racial traitors or enemies. Some far-right tradwives use their social media platforms to attack the LGBTQIA+ community for not adhering to heterosexual norms, as well as feminists and victims of domestic violence.
For instance, in response to the claimed fall in white births, which she attributes to female ""traitors"", one tradwife infamously called for the ""white baby challenge"". ""I've made six!"" she wrote. ""Match or beat me!"" She is not an exception.
There's no problem with valuing 'traditional' roles as wives or mothers – the danger is when these roles are weaponised. (Flickr: Ethan)
Others use their platforms to denounce measures that aim to promote equality — one made a widely viewed video in which she said ""I blame feminism"" for welcoming attitudes to refugees.
The political actions of these far-right women are carefully positioned as ""protective and instinctual"", rather than ""power-seeking"".
Through the tradwife ethos, the far right projects a range of ideas harmful to women. They oppose divorce, birth control and women in the workforce, and support ""quiverfull"" notions of procreation: a conservative Christian movement that rejects contraception and views large families as a blessing.
Our research shows some even argue rape does not exist in marriage.
A favourite topic among far-right tradwives is feminism as an evil, dominating force. The liberal feminist agenda to integrate women into the workforce is seen as the catalyst to the downfall of white men and women — while sexual liberation has destroyed, and in some cases ""diluted"", the family unit.
They believe women ""forced"" to work are robbed of a happy family and strong male provider, while men have been stripped of their ""right"" to work, marry and bear children. Feminism is seen to erode ""traditional"" gender norms by undermining the roles women and men are biologically destined to fulfil.
Of course, there's no problem with women valuing ""traditional"" roles as mothers and wives. What's dangerous is when these roles are weaponised to advance the far right's racially focused agenda — or when women are coerced into conforming, and punished when they transgress its narrow construction of a ""good"" woman.
Tradwives: the young women shunning modern feminism
Tradwives believe they are returning to a ""traditional"" gender order.
But in fact, they are living a modern version of a very short period in history during which women were largely excluded from the workforce.
Women have worked outside domestic demands throughout history, including in textile production and managing crops and livestock. Women were employed in factories during the Industrial Revolution, and in munitions and other forms of military service and production in the 1940s.
This regressed in the 1950s, when women were largely denied genuine access to the workforce — or the ability to choose. The male breadwinner, female homemaker ""nuclear family"" ideal of this specific window in time is what tradwives glamorise as ""traditional"".
While women's roles as mothers and wives should be valued, this has been exploited by the far right for their own purpose.
It's ironic that women who choose to become far-right tradwives are romantically reimagining a time when women couldn't choose their own conditions — while condemning the feminism that has allowed them to make those choices today.

After starring in and directing the smash remake of A Star is Born, the actor-turned-filmmaker returns with Maestro, a swooning biopic of the legendary American composer Leonard Bernstein that — at its best — reaches the ecstatic heights of the conductor's symphonies.
Cooper sets the bar high with an opening quote from Bernstein, one that cannily doubles as a built-in defence against the film's critics:
It also sets the stage for a heady plunge into the life of a remarkable, multifaceted American figure.
""Smoking was a real hobby for both of them,"" Carey Mulligan said of the Bernsteins in an interview with Variety. (Supplied: Netflix)
Charismatic and larger than life, Bernstein was a 20th century musical giant whose career of composing and conducting for orchestra and film scores saw him achieve a kind of global cultural ubiquity. (His inspirational Young People's Concerts were broadcast on national TV and syndicated in some 40 countries around the world, from the 1950s through the 1970s.)
He was also a gay man in an era where the closet was the preferred mode for public figures — a fact testified to by his 27-year marriage to a woman, which forms the focal point of Cooper's film.
As Bradley Cooper brings Leonard Bernstein to life in the new biopic Maestro, Australian musicians weigh in on his performance.
Maestro begins in time-honoured music biopic style, with the older Bernstein (also played by Cooper) taking a moment to think about his entire life. Moments later, the film careens back in time to a black-and-white 1943, where the young conductor has just received his breakthrough call to head up the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall.
In the ensuing rush of stardom he falls — platonically, at least — for Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan, wielding a mid-Atlantic accent), a rising stage actor who clocks precisely what she's getting herself into.
""I know exactly who you are,"" Felicia tells Lenny. ""Let's give it a whirl.""
Though Felicia is accommodating of her husband's extramarital affairs, their life of willing deception will eventually take its toll. It's this domestic tension that drives Cooper and co-writer Josh Singer's screenplay, which endeavours to build a private, rather than our more familiar public, sense of its subject.
""[Felicia] was his everything; she was his muse, his inspiration, his closest confidant, his best friend, his lover,"" Mulligan told Variety. (Supplied: Netflix)
Inhabiting almost 50 years of Bernstein's life, Cooper delivers a rich, immersive performance, transforming himself both physically — makeup designer Kazu Hiro's work goes far beyond that much-publicised proboscis — and technically, lowering his voice to reflect the conductor's melodically nasal, four-pack-a-day timbre.
There's considerable craft to his creation, born of an obvious passion. The star spent some six years developing the project and learning how to conduct an orchestra, and even directed the movie while remaining in character as Bernstein. (For those of you playing at home, the Best Actor Oscar seems to be pretty much his to lose at this point.)
Cooper is a warm, generous actor; it shines through in his portrayal of a man who was bursting with vitality, who was eager to please everyone around him — even when it came at the expense of loving himself.
Cooper worked closely with Leonard and Felicia's three children during the production of Maestro. (Supplied: Netflix)
As the woman bearing witness, Mulligan has the less showy but just as detailed role, conveying the experience of a wife unravelling in slow motion, the frustration of living in the orbit of a Great Man, and the years of pleasure she's forgone.
Together, their show-stopping moment arrives in an explosive argument set against a Thanksgiving Parade, which Cooper lets unfurl in a long take that practically screams Oscar clip — that is until he deflates it all with a droll sight gag, one of the best of the year.
It's evidence of Cooper's growing confidence and craft as a filmmaker, which was already on display in his debut. He favours long, dramatic push-ins and off-kilter framing that he might have gleaned from his Licorice Pizza director Paul Thomas Anderson, and designs seamless camera moves that seem to glide across space and time.
Cooper told Screen Daily conducting the London Symphony Orchestra in a live rendition of Mahler's 2nd Symphony at Ely Cathedral was ""the most terrifying thing I've ever done"". (Supplied: Netflix)
A bravura early sequence, shot with smoky Old Hollywood glamour by cinematographer Matthew Libatique, reimagines Bernstein's 1944 ballet Fancy Free as a dance between Felicia and Lenny intertwined with homoerotic sailors.
As you might expect, the score — supplied by the London Symphony Orchestra — enriches these and other moments, giving Maestro the sustained feel of a musical movement. Variations on classical pieces by Schumann, Mahler and Beethoven mix with nods to Bernstein's own compositions from On the Town and West Side Story, adding grandiose flourishes to the story.
It all reaches a crescendo in a miraculous sequence set inside England's Ely Cathedral in 1973, with Bernstein — and Cooper — leading the orchestra through Mahler's Resurrection Symphony and into sweaty, spiritual abandon. Those prosthetics really get a workout.
Maestro is available in cinemas and on Netflix.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-19/2023-games-of-the-year/103233460,'I would recommend this to everyone I know': ABC Gamer's Top 5 releases of 2023,"The end of the year is almost upon us, so it's Game of the Year time!
At ABC Gamer we believe that Game of the Year is a rung, not a single title. With so many great games to choose from in 2023 it was tough to whittle our list down to just five — so we've gone through the trouble of making the case for each game.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder
Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the classic 2-D, side-scrolling Mario game we know and love, with a variety of twists added. Wonder Flowers trigger events throughout the game, the map holds many secrets, badges give you heaps of special moves: it's packed.
Mario Wonder is also the perfect multiplayer game. It encourages working together: from being able to resurrect your friends from ghosts to finish the harder levels in the game, to the search party levels that are easier to complete with a gang of mates.
Strong couch co-op bonds have been formed in my household as we screamed at the TV over boss fights and power-ups and just missing the end of the timed levels.
I came for the adorable new Daisy and Prince Florian character designs, and stayed for the thrilling gameplay.
Mario Wonder is so replayable, by anyone, with anyone and is easily, hands down, my pick for Game of the Year. I would recommend this to everyone I know, from my baby cousins to my nan.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2
Since the birth of superhero comics, fans like me have always craved seeing comic book characters on screen. And sure, we do have that in spades now — but Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is one of the most faithful adaptations I've ever seen.
It's a game that excels in grounding the alter-egos of the superheroes in reality. Sure, you can stick to walls and swing through buildings, but there are still those moments of just being Peter Parker or Miles Morales: helping friends and family; throwing out old takeaway containers; exploring Coney Island.
From the very first cutscene, every hallmark of Spider-Man was there. A crappy apartment, bills overdue, pictures of Aunt May and Uncle Ben, a bunch of science-y tech stuff, the Daily Bugle and, of course, the incredible hero shot of Spider-Man jumping out of a window and into trouble.
It throws you straight into the action, skipping over everything we already know (we get it, Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider in high school; we don't need a rehashing of that origin story).
It nails everything it means to be Spider-Man.
— Sam McEwen
Alan Wake II
As a fan of the original Alan Wake, I thought I knew what was in store. But I wasn't ready for this.
Alan Wake II didn't just do a bit more of the same and expand on the first game's rulebook. No, it hurled the rulebook into an alternate dimension, almost literally.
Its new, more open, world design feels like a real place we're visiting — one that is filled with just enough wonderful extras and puzzles to hunt down. (Although those puzzles that made me do maths can go away. What is this, year 10?!)
I loved its ability to stitch together so many influences.
It's equal parts Steven King novel, mashed with episodes of The Twilight Zone, Twin Peaks, X-Files, The Killing and Hannibal, and yet it still feels like its own unique beast.
Alan Wake II is just a phenomenal experience. It's a brilliantly terrifying horror game, and an exceptionally clever, deftly-directed and mature story that stands as a prime example of what storytelling in games can be.
It's the kind of unique gaming experience that is going to stick with me forever.
— Joe Reardon
Baldur's Gate 3
Baldur's Gate 3. Those three words can spark a forest fire of conversation, or elicit the biggest groan in history — because you've either been forced to listen to it before, or you just haven't embraced the joy, the wonder, the glory of Larian's dating sim disguised as an action RPG.
Well, darlings, I'm here to start another forest fire, because Baldur's Gate 3 is my game of the year.
It's full-on Dungeons and Dragons fantasy shenanigans without the need to drag your 20kg bag of shiny math rocks around. Never played DnD? Doesn't matter. You don't need to have an in-depth knowledge of it to enjoy Baldur's Gate 3. I certainly didn't when I first started.
Baldur's Gate 3 is the first RPG I've played in years where I truly feel I can be anyone. I can be the loveable rogue, the brooding wizard, the distrusting ranger or the naive warlock.
The game has taught me how to be a better player and, beyond that, how to embrace change, experiment, make mistakes, learn from them, have difficult conversations, take in the beautiful moments and live in the now.
What a wonderful thing for a game to be able to do.
— Gemma Driscoll
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
Of all the games that came out in 2023, Tears of The Kingdom (TOTK) straight-up tore through the video game burnout that I'd been feeling, and reminded me why games are so silly and fun.
Breath of the Wild allowed you to climb, glide and travel by mount; this isn't groundbreaking on its own, but that game filled the world with points of interest that make all of those traversal options fun.
Then TOTK comes along and is like, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, what if we did all that but then added in… experimentation?""
It's a game that gives you enough space to tackle the same puzzles and problems with different solutions.
The story in TOTK is something you discover piece-by-piece and there are a tonne of options to unfold it. It felt like a chatterbox way of telling a story — where even though there is a set story, the way you go about it is up to you.
Open-world games are plagued with choice paralysis and fatigue, but TOTK finds a way to pack something into every nook and cranny, and then also gives you the option to go buck wild.
To me, the game of the year can't just be an excellent game. It's gotta be one that you will continue to talk about for years.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2023-12-18/australian-video-game-layoffs-2023-survive-until-2025/103221762,'Survive until 25': Australian video game studios brace for grim year ahead,"When US mega-festival SXSW rolled into Sydney this past October, the second floor of a inner-city hotel transformed into an impromptu arcade.
Inside, a glimpse of gaming's future. An eclectic array of yet-to-be-released games lined the walls: a deer chased through a dark forest; Winnie the Pooh becomes infected with a virus; a shelter cat contemplates its bond with a new owner.
It was the finale of an unofficial, month-long celebration of the Australian game industry that kicked off at Melbourne International Games Week a month prior.
And in 2023, there has been plenty to celebrate.
For instance, Stray Gods, by Melbourne's Summerfall Studios, was nominated for a Grammy Award. PlaySide Studios ascended to online juggernaut status thanks to the success of its 'Dumb Ways to Die' TikTok trend. Word game Gubbins attracted global attention, toppling New York Times on the iPhone charts – if only briefly.
One of Australia's largest and most celebrated game developers has made sweeping redundancies and ""paused"" development on a highly anticipated title.
But behind the success, there's been a growing unease; an acknowledgement many Australian games studios might be approaching breaking point. Industry experts point out how, as the economic conditions have deteriorated and interest rates have increased, publishers and investors have tightened their purse strings.
Instead of growing, studios have had to downsize. League of Geeks, a highly celebrated independent Melbourne developer, laid off half its staff in November as potential investors took money off the table.
Studios the ABC spoke to said this has really shaken the local industry — if such a massive, celebrated studio is finding it hard, what of the smaller developers and indies? Some of those have endured redundancies, too, pausing development on IP and turning to work-for-hire contracts.
""It's the worst year I can imagine since I started doing this,"" said Sanatana Mishra, a game designer at Brisbane's Witch Beam studios.
And it may get worse before it gets better.
Even with bumper revenues and a new government tax offset injecting cash into studios, a phrase is being uttered at industry events and gatherings that reflects another tough year ahead: Survive until '25.
To get the full picture, we have to go back to December 2019.
In China, a highly contagious virus had begun circulating. Within months, much of the world was forced into lockdown. Everyone bunkered down indoors.
The video game industry was primed to take advantage of the situation because remote work and international collaboration were already commonplace.
And it did. The industry boomed in 2020, as people stuck indoors looked for ways to occupy their time. Games were being bought and played – and talked about. And investors, wanting to cash in on the boom, took bets on smaller studios and teams hoping to uncover big hits with big money-making potential.
Flush with cash, many studios were able to scale up. Statistics from the peak industry body in Australia, the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association (IGEA), show that full-time employees in the games industry increased 63 per cent, from 1327 in June 2020 – 2021 to 2104 for the same period in 2021–22 — the largest single-year increase since the survey began in 2016.
In addition, IGEA's data suggested developers were hoping to hire over 300 new employees in the next year.
""Companies over-hired and over-invested on the basis that the growth that happened during COVID was going to be sustainable, and was 'the new normal',"" suggested Katie Roots, marketing manager at Melbourne studio Hipster Whale.
It was not to be. 2023 has seen a correction, of sorts, with the industry laying off thousands of staff. Developers cite the war in Ukraine, a weak Australian dollar and the rise in interest rates as a reason for the contraction of the industry this year.
Some unofficial estimates suggest more than 7,000 workers have been laid off across the world. In Australia, the number is likely in the mid-hundreds, but Brendan Keogh, a digital games researcher at the Queensland University of Technology, said official figures were hard to come by.
""There's all sorts of much quieter lay-offs, studios just kind of disappearing without anyone really knowing about them,"" Dr Keogh said.
For those that manage to stave off the end, they may have to change tack entirely.
Ed Orman has been in the Australian game development scene for more than 15 years. He's seen it during its best — and worst — times.
Mr Orman was employed by 2K Australia, a subsidiary of global gaming powerhouse Take-Two Interactive. The Australian studio became famous for helping develop big budget titles in popular franchises like XCOM, Borderlands and Bioshock.

In 2011, he left 2K to form an independent studio in Canberra, Uppercut Games. At the time, Australian game development appeared to be on the brink of collapse. High profile studios were closing and smaller, work-for-hire outfits had all but disappeared.
Uppercut started out making mobile games, Orman says, before shifting to premium console games about four years in.
Over the past few years, it's been working on a new title, demoing it for publishers and hoping to strike up a deal. Orman says it was attracting ""a huge amount of interest"" at trade shows, like the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.
""We had four or five really solid opportunities,"" he said.
But the tide turned quickly.
The funding would have kept the studio healthy for another three years but it wasn't to be. To stay afloat, Uppercut went through a round of redundancies this past June, the team shrinking from about 40 people to just 16.
The studio has been able to re-hire some of those staff on contracts, but it's put its passion project to the side, returning to work-for-hire contracts to get by. Orman calls it ""survival mode.""
""We didn't have a choice,"" he said.
In 2023, Amanda Schofield's game development house, Studio Drydock, had an entirely different experience.
""For us, it's been really stable,"" Ms Schofield said.
In 2019, just before the pandemic hit, Ms Schofield and a colleague at Melbourne mobile developer Firemonkeys, Alex Holkner, co-founded Studio Drydock. What seemed, initially, like an inopportune time to build something new turned out to be fortuitous.
As work from home became the norm, the studio found remote work was an advantage. It didn't have the brick and mortar costs of leases and overheads for a work space. And it provided access to freelancers and contractors from across the world – people already working from home.
""We were seeing some of the best talent we've ever worked with in the industry,"" Ms Schofield said.

The studio's first title, Wylde Flowers, was released in early 2022 on Apple's gaming subscription service, Apple Arcade. It went on to win Apple Arcade's game of the year and has been steadily growing its community since release. The support from Apple, and critical acclaim, helped Studio Drydock build a solid foundation for 2023, cushioning it against the worst of the economic downturn.
The studio doesn't plan to grow its headcount in 2024 but a job opening it had earlier in the year provided some insight into how crowded the job market has become in the wake of global lay-offs. In just five days, the position had 1100 applicants, which Ms Schofield said was unprecedented.
She said it's heartbreaking to see friends and former colleagues suddenly out looking for work. She hadn't heard the 'Survive until '25' phrase, but suspected that continued high interest rates could prevent a rapid turnaround over the next year.
Game developers remember the rapid studio closures, extreme job losses and talent drain that occurred following the global financial crisis of 2008.
Unity, one of the most popular game engines in the world, has been universally panned for slapping developers with a new fee.
""It's like this real defining moment of Australian game development,"" Dr Keogh said.
By the early 2010s, video game development in Australia was almost entirely obliterated.
Back then, game development was centred around large studios, employing hundreds of staff. There were multiple international corporations, like 2K Australia, that set up offices Down Under — largely because of the cheap labour. The GFC put an end to that.
The current economic conditions are reminiscent of those periods but Jeffrey Brand, a professor at Bond University in media research, believes this time around, Australia is in a better position.
Professor Brand points to the size of the industry and consumer base as a bulwark against collapse, in addition to the agility and creativity of Australian studios. In video game parlance, the industry has levelled up.
He also points to renewed government support at both a federal and state level that can help studios cover growing wages in ways that might otherwise be impossible. For instance, the Digital Games Tax Offset, introduced in July 2022, provides mid- to large-sized studios an opportunity to recoup 30 per cent of costs, he says.
For Goldie Bartlett, art director at Melbourne studio Ghost Pattern, smaller support opportunities are just as important. She points to the Originate fund by Victorian development agency VicScreen as one example — and how it's focused on supporting emerging voices and projects in the space.
""That's a super unique fund,"" she said.
""It's going to help university graduates and first timers, and even established people ... develop their prototypes.""
What the industry will look like by the end of 2024 is uncertain, but there are already signs of change.
Ms Roots was one of the thousands in the game industry that experienced a redundancy this year. She was fortunate to quickly find her next role but she suggests that, with the rise of generative artificial intelligence in game space — especially operations and marketing — others may come back to an entirely different industry.
""When it comes to the rehiring, I think there'll be many roles that change,"" Ms Roots said.
YT Indie Video Games Saved
And, similarly to the post-GFC crash, some developers may not return to the industry at all.
Ms Bartlett said uncertainty around investment and having to chase commercial success can be stressful. As her studio begins looking for funding on its next game project, she's even considered pivoting away from the industry altogether.
While Ms Bartlett jokes she has ""Survive until '25"" tattooed on her inner lip, it's a mantra that she and many other developers are taking seriously.
So how might studios weather the storm? Ms Bartlett says this period might be a good time to do some soul searching. But most importantly, she says, developers need to support each other.
""I think the main thing that leads to a healthy, successful industry is taking interest in other people's work and what new voices have to say,"" she said.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-16/breast-cancer-support-group-hervey-bay-boob-choir-soul-sisters/103224180,'Boob choir' spreads joy and awareness about breast cancer through song,"Twila Whittingham always thought of music as medicine, so when doctors found a pre-cancerous tumour in her breast mid-2022, she knew she would need more than conventional treatment to cope.
So, she formed what she cheekily describes as a ""boob choir"" — an ensemble of women whose lives have been impacted by the disease.
Twila Whittingham formed the group to provide music therapy to people impacted by breast cancer. (ABC Wide Bay: Lucy Loram)
Once a week, up to 35 women gather in Hervey Bay, three hours north of Brisbane, to rehearse the classics — ABBA, Leonard Cohen and, at this time of year, Christmas carols.
While they focus on their sheet music, they're also working through something bigger.
""The intention was to create therapy with music,"" Ms Whittingham said.
""It is medication, it does make a difference. It makes a difference to the ones that are having depression.
""I always wanted to be a music therapist, but the time is ticking away, so I'm not going to have time to go through the whole study aspect … but you know what? This is music therapy.""
The Soul Sisters have been rehearsing and performing songs for more than a year. (ABC Wide Bay: Lucy Loram)
As Margie Maassen neared the end of her chemotherapy treatments a few months ago, she said The Soul Sisters rehearsals were a light at the end of the tunnel.
""Every second rehearsal is straight after my chemo … [the treatment] knocks you off your feet, but I force myself to come,"" she said.
""Once I get here, the pain disappears … it takes any stress and tension away … you just feel love.""
Margie Maassen says the music has been a welcome distraction from her breast cancer treatments. (ABC Wide Bay: Lucy Loram)
This sisterhood even helped Ms Maaseen come to terms with her breast cancer diagnosis.
""They help you to live fearlessly and just get on with your life,"" she said.
When Gayle Searle was told about The Soul Sisters by a breast cancer nurse at the McGrath Foundation last year, it felt like divine intervention.
""When I was diagnosed last year, I was actually praying and I said to God, 'Can you please bring something to me? Because I really need something' and along came the choir,"" she said.
Gayle Searle says people of all singing abilities are welcome in the choir. (ABC Wide Bay: Lucy Loram)
Like many women in the group, Ms Searle joined for the music, but she stayed for the friendships.
""Whether you can sing or not, the importance is just getting with a group of women that actually can be with you and support you… and I suppose, take you to the next level really and continue to enjoy your life,"" she said.
""You don't focus on yourself; you focus on other people.""
The Soul Sisters perform anywhere from retirement homes to local cafes.
The CEO of the National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF), Cleola Anderiesz, said while the women were spreading joy through song, they were also spreading awareness about a disease effecting more Australians each year.
About one in seven women in Australia will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and one in 500 men, according to the NBCF.
The Soul Sisters choir is made up of around 30 women who get together once a week to rehearse. (ABC Wide Bay: Lucy Loram)
Diagnoses have increased by 21 per cent in the past 10 years, but death rates have declined by about 40 per cent since the NBCF formed in 1994.
That's largely thanks to research, early detection and better treatments.
""The earlier a cancer is discovered, the greater the number of treatment options that are available and the better the prognosis.""
For singers like Penny Kilner, the ""boob choir"" was a way back into what was once a favourite pastime.
She has been with The Soul Sisters since their first rehearsal in 2022.
""Like a zillion years ago, I sang in choirs and church choirs, that sort of stuff, and then didn't sing for 60 years,"" Ms Kilner said.
""When this came along, I wanted to get back into singing and this is just joy.""
The Soul Sisters want to inspire others going through breast cancer treatment. (ABC Wide Bay: Lucy Loram)
But for all members, the group has provided hope as they navigated treatment and supported each other through recovery and setbacks.
""You can still enjoy yourself. You can see we do.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-16/mike-parr-anna-schwartz-gallery-israel-gaza-war-art/103234478,In time perhaps Mike Parr's art should be seen in the same context as Picasso's Guernica,"In 1970, at the height of the opposition to the Vietnam War, a group of American artists including Louise Bourgeois (whose works are on display in Sydney right now) and Donald Judd signed an open letter demanding that the artist Pablo Picasso remove one of his greatest lifeworks, the painting Guernica, from the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
When war broke out in Europe in 1939, Picasso asked the art institution to take in and safeguard the monumental painting of the 1937 Nazi bombing of the Basque town. But by the late '60s, that painting of broken bodies and screaming horses had come to represent something else.
The artists wrote: ""The continuous housing of Guernica in the Museum of Modern Art, New York, implies that our establishment has the moral right to be indignant about the crimes of others — and ignore our own crimes.""
The significant and controversial Australian performance artist, Mike Parr — now 78 and in his 50th year of provocative, sometimes ugly, often unsettling work — has said he wants to talk about war, too. About the complexity of the war and the crisis in the Middle East, about what he describes as ""the disproportionate impact of what's happening now in Gaza"".
Going Home is a four-hour recorded performance of Parr painting text and blood red pigment on the walls. (Supplied: Zan Wimberley)
The third part of his long performance piece, Sunset Claws, at Anna Schwartz Gallery in Melbourne is called Going Home and you probably know of it because of the controversial rift it has caused between the artist and his long-time supporter and gallerist, Anna Schwartz.
That issue is an unsettling one and has resulted in a discomfiting series of criticisms between the former collaborators.
But there is another reason you should know about this complex work, and there is never any replacement in an art controversy for the act of going to spend time with the work itself. Because while the hurt on both sides of this divide is real and understandable, the final part of this performance piece is mighty and upsetting, and for some follows an important political path in the tradition of that famous Picasso work.
""It is a history painting of our time,"" says leading Australian curator Juliana Engberg, the former Sydney Biennale and ACCA director. ""A profound and perplexing work; a Babel; a blind scribe; an obliteration; a monstrous mess and huge mourning for a tragedy.""
""It's our Guernica.""
A performance of Going Home by Mike Parr at Anna Schwartz Gallery. (Supplied: Zan Wimberley)
Going Home is a four-hour recorded performance of Parr painting text and blood red pigment on the walls of the famed Melbourne gallery while ""blind"": he had his eyes closed for the entire process, including climbing and descending ladders to the top of the walls.
The text, which is read to Parr by an assistant, is a series of quotes about the conflict, from all sides, taken from the London Review of Books. Parr painted them on large paper panels with closed eyes, then overpainted them with red paint and large black images of horses, and then removed the panels to the opposite walls, turned them upside down and hung them, leaving behind fragments of text, the stained outlines of the panels and a series of palimpsests of overwritten texts.
The leading artist has been terminated by his gallery of 36 years following a performance that included references to the conflict in Gaza.
The effect of standing in the room is, as Engberg says, overwhelming. The black inverted horses recalling Guernica in an unexpected way, floating on the blood red paint that Picasso eschewed in favour of his brutal monochrome.
Parr is brutal too. As a metaphor for the layered histories and competing stories of that ancient Holy Land, the violent scratching of his multiple texts is powerful and sometimes ugly, leading to the juxtaposition of words and statements that jar with their new meaning, including the co-placement of the words ""Israel"" and ""Nazi"".
For his former representative, the work is a wounding breach of faith. Schwartz says she can't work ""with an artist who has chosen to hurt me and insult my culture and the generations who come before me who have been annihilated"".
For Parr, he says the placement of the words was not deliberate, and he has accused Schwartz of obliterating his performance with the ""subjectivity"" of her response.
I know both these people from my many years writing and broadcasting about visual arts. It is awful to see them come to this.
It's impossible for me to talk only about the art divorced from its political and social context as a now deeply divisive piece. I cannot imagine that many gallerists of the Jewish faith could live with themselves and in their community with those two words, intentional or not, up against each other on their gallery walls.
Conversely, Parr has lived to outrage and offend, and said he wanted to provoke debate about this crisis, something that would surely come as no surprise to any director.
Listen: Anna Schwartz responds on ABC RN Breakfast
Beyond the walls of the gallery, I am well aware of Jewish friends who have been told to keep their children off public transport as their school has been warned about their safety. The antisemitism that once lurked but now flaunts through our otherwise progressive society is impossible to ignore. Sitting in a broadcaster's chair for all these years makes me well aware of the hatred out there.
Also, I see the before and after footage of the bombing of Gaza and wonder what possible life — and where — could there be now for those Gazans who have survived the onslaught?
Picasso's Guernica is now permanently displayed in Madrid in a gallery devoted to conflict. In time perhaps Parr's work should be seen in that context of war art too: painted ""blind"", reactive, messy and dangerous but holding up a mirror to a brutal conflict that none of us can close our eyes to.
This weekend is my final column for this year, and a moment to thank you for making time for my thoughts on your precious Saturday morning. I'll have a summary of the year's best reads for you in time for New Year, and I'll be back in your inbox by mid January.
In the meantime, we have deserts, waves and Oompa Loompas for you. It all makes sense in the end.
Have a safe and happy weekend. No Christmas music for you this time (I don't want to spoil your Whamageddon).
Instead, in the hope of a full recovery for our much-loved music legend Jimmy Barnes, these voices go out to the Barnes family to sustain them in their recovery, and to lift your hearts too. A happy Christmas to you all. Go well.

The abbreviation of ""the cost of living crisis"" was an official word of the year, as was situationship, de-influencing, rizz and doof stick, meticulously selected by the Oxford and Macquarie dictionaries.
But there's been plenty of other silly lil trends that defined 2023 even more — let's dive in.
We started off the year hot and sweaty, with Pedro Pascal edits doing nothing to help the situation.
The fancams were most likely due to his starring role in the hit TV adaption of The Last of Us, but how we then transitioned to Mr Pascal awkwardly eating a sandwich, I will never know.
WorldPride came to Sydney this year, with queer folk and party animals flying in from around the country to celebrate.
Overseas friends came to town too, but for exhausted Canadian tourist Chris Zou, it was hard to keep up.
It's been a tough year for many, but perhaps for no one more than Gwyneth Paltrow, who was accused of causing a ski collision by a mere civilian.
In the high profile court battle, she claimed it was in fact said normie who crashed into her, and she was found not to be at fault. She was still deeply affected by the whole affair though.

There were so many bizarre moments from this trial we simply could not fit them in. Luckily (?) for us though, the saga is being adapted into a stage musical.
We'd had green flags and red flags, but in May, the beige flag entered the chat.
Essentially, these are the little oddities one's partner does that don't quite fit into either the red or green flag category.
More than 4 million local Swifties attempted to nab tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras tour in June, with many of them left in virtual waiting rooms for 16 hours, hoping and waiting for Ticketek to let them through.
Swifties in the Philippines took matters into their own hands, as Taylor Sheesh, a Filipino drag queen that did her own version of the Eras tour in malls across the country,  blew up.
Complete with dance routines, LED backgrounds, costume changes, and even a security team, the clips of her shows are pure joy.

By July, Barbie (and Oppenheimer!) season was upon us.
Legions of fans hit the cinemas in full pink to catch Greta Gerwig's blockbuster, with some of them even doing Barbenheimer marathons to give Christopher Nolan's war movie a chance too.
Meanwhile in InternetLand, Ken Musk had been brewing something of his own, dumping Twitter's blue bird and re branding to something much more suited to a tech bro.

This was also the bumper month in which girl dinner was born.
The simple trend involved various women posting their lazy dinners online (think cheese and some carrot sticks), and we were treated to endless think pieces, takes and memes.
I could fill a book with all the silly moments from the Women's World Cup, so choosing just one favourite is very tough.
There's the L Word style chart of which players were dating each other. Or Dutch player Danielle Van Der Donk being forced to play in a literal swimming cap after a head injury, or the goalkeeper/icon that is Mackenzie Arnold becoming known as the Brick Wall, even by the PM.
There's Hayley Raso's obsession with the Naruto run, Sammy Kerr's Strawberry Kisses solo, or when (almost) an entire plane tuned in to Cortnee Vine's penalty.
But Australia's new Swedish Dad/own version of Ted Lasso (aka Tillies coach Tony Gustavsson) surely wins the most memeable figure of the tournament.
By September, scientists (TikTok girlfriends) made a shocking discovery about the minds of men. Specifically, how often they think about a particular historical period.
With the term ""my Roman empire"" becoming synonymous with being obsessed with something, I was truly sitting when I found a new Roman empire of my own.
triple j could have been the first radio station to play TJ Mack's viral hit, and he blessed the youth broadcaster with a call in to Drive with Abby & Tyrone.
On a crisp November morning in 2023, millions of Australians woke up to realise they'd been plunged back into the dark ages.
For some, it meant public transport or eftpos chaos. For others, they got to skip their dreaded morning Zoom meetings.
For cats, the consequences were catastrophic.
There were plenty of trends I simply couldn't fit in this wrap friends, and I sincerely apologise for it.
There was the capybara song, the time Elon Musk challenged Mark Zuckerberg to a cage match, the Fitzroy garage sesh making it to Scotland, and 55 burgers, 55 french fries (iykyk).

His publicist Jennifer Allen confirmed he died after a short illness.
Braugher is perhaps best known for his role as Captain Raymond Holt on the comedy series Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which ended in 2021.
His co-star Terry Crews posted a tribute to the actor on Instagram.
""Can't believe you're gone so soon,"" it read.
""I'm honored to have known you, laughed with you, worked with you and shared 8 glorious years watching your irreplaceable talent.
Marc Evan Jackson, who plays Dr Kevin Cozner, Braugher's on-screen husband posted a short tribute as well.
""O Captain. My Captain,"" it said.
Joe Lo Truglio, who played Charles Boyle, shared his favourite stories from his time on the show with Braugher.
""The man was so full of song and that's why the world took notice,"" he wrote.
""He was committed and passionate about the things he loved and that voice.
""It laid anchor to the roughest of dialogue.""
""Fiercely intelligent, remarkably kind, supportive, and generous and possessed a deep and extraordinary talent, and had even more to offer,"" Dirk Blocker, who played Michael Hitchcock wrote on Instagram.
The Chicago-born actor had his breakthrough role in 1989's Glory, starring alongside Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, who won an Oscar for the film about an all-Black army regiment during America's Civil War.
Despite the part, he told The Associated Press in 2019 that he struggled to find work in a Hollywood where roles for African American actors were ""few and far between. Period"".
But he would establish himself with the role of Detective Frank Pembleton, which he played for seven seasons in Homicide: Life on the Street, a gritty police drama on NBC based on a book by David Simon, who would go on to create The Wire.
Simon wrote on X that he was stunned.
""Andre Braugher. God,"" he wrote.

Years later he then moved to play a very different kind of cop on a very different kind of show, shifting to comedy as Captain Holt on Andy Samberg's Fox series, Brooklyn Nine-Nine.
Braugher won two career Emmys for the show from 11 nominations.
Though he'd dipped his toe into comedy in the TNT dramedy Men of a Certain Age, Brooklyn Nine-Nine still represented a major shift for Braugher, who was known for acting in dark and heavy dramas.
""I just felt as though it was an opportunity to do something strikingly different from the rest of my career,"" Braugher told the AP.
""I like it because it just simply opens up my mind and forces me to think in a different way. So I think I've become much more sort of supple as an actor, and more open to the incredible number of possibilities of how to play a scene.""
He was married for more than 30 years to his Homicide co-star Ami Brabson.
They had three sons.",Unknown,Wed 13 Dec 2023,0

But you know, that's just, like, my opinion, man.
The brown flannel robe is one of several items from the Coen brothers' slacker-noir film going under the hammer in California this weekend.
""These are the items that … bring the story to life,"" said Martin Nolan, chief executive of Julien's Auction.
""When [Bridges] shows up in this outfit … wearing his shorts, his T-shirt, the robe — just incredible.""
The 1998 movie stars Bridges as The Dude, a wastrel who criminals mistake for a millionaire in a caper that also showcases the comedic talents of John Goodman and Steve Buscemi.
The film became a cult classic and spawned several memorable lines that fans often trot out, including: ""That rug really tied the room together.""

In addition to the robe, which is expected to fetch up to $US50,000 ($A75,000), fans can also bid on The Dude's sunglasses and bowling pin props used in the movie and signed by Bridges.
The lot is part of ""Hollywood Legends"", a four-day event that will see thousands of items of memorabilia put up for sale.
They include an animatronic model of the head of E.T. The Extraterrestrial, which could go for as much as $US1 million, Mr Nolan said.

""These items are now considered an asset class … not just memorabilia items or a storyline from a time in our lives,"" he said.
""Something like this is much more fun than stocks or bonds, or a lot of the other items you have in your investment portfolio, and a great conversation piece.""
Also up for sale this weekend will be the blouse that Princess Diana wore in her engagement photo in 1981, which auctioneers expect could fetch up to $US100,000.

Armed with nothing more than a phone and a decent social media following, she has taken on Beyoncé and Lizzo, successfully convincing them to remove ableist slurs from their music.
And now the writer and actor has an even bigger target in sight.
The magical world of Disney.
""Trying to get the House of Mouse to do anything is quite tricky,"" Diviney said with a smile.
The thing she wants is for the Walt Disney Corporation to create a Disney princess with a disability.
Diviney has cerebral palsy, a physical disability that affects her fine and gross motor skills.
As a result, she navigates the world with the assistance of a wheelchair.
""Representation is the most important thing in the world,"" she told ABC Victorian Mornings.
Diviney believes ""ableism is often the forgotten prejudice."" (ABC Life: Luke Tribe)
It's been three years since she first started her petition to Disney for better on-screen representation.
More than 65,000 people have joined the cause, something Diviney said made her feel like a rock star.
""I've chosen one of the biggest companies in the world to target,"" Diviney said.
""It's going slower than I'd hoped; I think that's definitely a slow burn.""
Hannah Diviney says she has created her own space in the entertainment industry, through acting and writing. (Supplied: SBS)
Associate Professor Lauren Rosewarne, from The University of Melbourne's School of Social and Political Sciences, has spent years researching representation in media.
Dr Rosewarne said ""we're a while away from"" the likelihood of Disney acceding to Diviney's request.
""Hollywood is risk-averse and they do not spend big bucks on a film with an unknown talent at the helm … therefore risky projects tend not to be made,"" she said.

Dr Rosewarne said that fear of fiscal failure was partly why Hollywood was seemingly obsessed with reboots.
She said it would likely be up to TV series and production companies like Netflix to pave the way for larger corporations to have truly representative characters in cinema.
Hannah Diviney is pushing for Disney to develop a disabled princess character.
""You have to prime an audience to demonstrate that they're willing to watch this stuff, that then starts the process of desensitising them to different content, and I suspect that's more likely to happen through streaming services,"" she said.
Meaning a Disney princess with a disability probably remains a pipedream.
The Walt Disney Company did not respond to questions by the ABC.
Instead, it pointed to a previous statement released to Australian Women's Weekly where a spokesperson said the company was listening.
""We love Hannah's passion and hear her important voice on why inclusive and representative storytelling matters,"" the Disney spokesperson said in 2022.

""As storytellers at Disney, we're committed to reflecting the incredibly rich diversity of the human experience in ways that inspire, open minds and hearts, and bring people closer together in a world where we all belong.""
However, the company has yet to confirm whether that will include the creation of a character that uses a wheelchair.
Hannah Diviney will not be deterred.
""It's no accident that I want to increase representation for children because that's where I struggled the most,"" she said
""I've chosen one of the biggest companies in the world to target in doing that.

""I'm really lucky to have kind of created my own space in this industry, through acting and writing.

It was closely followed by its release date and meme companion Oppenheimer, which scored eight nominations, including best picture drama and for actors Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt.
Australia's Sarah Snook was also nominated for Best Actress in a drama series for her role in Succession as was Elizabeth Debicki for best supporting actress in that category, for her portrayal of Princess Diana in The Crown.

Alright, to wrap things up, here is who I'm thinking/hoping/predicting will take home the gong come January (in the main categories) sprinkled with a few far-fetched hopes and dreams.
FILM
TV
Considering Sheryl Lee Ralph was nominated for Abbott Elementary last year, and won the Critics Choice Award AND Screen Actors Guild Award, you wouldn't expect her to be overlooked like this.
Fellow co-stars Janelle James and Tyler James Williams were also snubbed, and Williams literally won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor earlier this year for his work in the previous season. WHAT HAPPENED?
And while The Morning Show picked up a couple of nominations, including Best Drama Series and Best Supporting Actor for Billy Crudup, neither Jennifer Aniston or Reese Witherspoon got a nomination.
I know the show has kind of lost the plot (last I heard since I gave up is they shot Reese's character into space) but this marks the first year that neither Aniston or Witherspoon have been recognised for the series.

On Friday, Grohl volunteered with non-profit The Big Umbrella Foundation at Melbourne's Federation Square. Despite the 36-degrees day, hundreds of people popped-up not to see Grohl, but due to the promise of an American BBQ meal.
Grohl, and fellow volunteer Australian YouTuber and chef Nat's What I Reckon, was a pleasant surprise, with the duo signing paper plates and taking pictures while helping plate up 430 meals.
How good. And below, we've wrapped up some more wholesome pop culture and entertainment news, from silly memes to a SNL skit featuring some of the best hip-hop-ballet you've ever seen.
Big Walk - reveal trailer
House House, the Aussie developers behind smash-hit avian adventure Untitled Goose Game, has announced their latest project: Big Walk, a cooperative puzzle and exploration game for PC set in the Australian bushland.
The first trailer for Big Walk, revealed during Friday's The Game Awards, opens with a crescendo of magpie and kookaburra cries at dawn, which fade away as the camera pans back to reveal two toy-like characters surveying the leafy expanse (toy-like insofar as they seem to combine those drinking bird things and Kong dog toys).
The pair throw themselves into the jungle in search of friends across the range; a bright flare trail leads them to a massive yellow sphere in the mountains, where they find their compatriots. From there, we're whizzed around activities in the expanse, as a team tackle a locked shed puzzle (reading like a very Australian take on 2016 game The Witness) and take time to goof off, exploring at their own leisure and play fighting amid a shoreline sunset.
The key thing here is that nothing can be solved solo. Good (and bad) news: you've got time to gather your party, as Big Walk is slated for a 2025 release.

Who says a comedy sketch needs to be topical? During Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update segment, cast member Chloe Fineman took over to demonstrate the ultimate gift this holiday season: performing the final, sexy (?) number of 2001 film 'Save The Last Dance' to your partner.
If you haven't seen it, don't worry: Fineman explains the film's premise and plot thoroughly as she pops and locks on-stage. All you really need to know is that lead actor Julia Stiles' moves – a …unique… combination of ballet and hip-hop – have befuddled audiences for decades.
The best part? Stiles makes a cameo and even joins in on the dance, happy to poke fun at her oh-so-serious moves.

Swifties, BTS Army and the Beyhive may be strong, but no fan base creates deranged memes quite like Nicki Minaj's Barbz.
This time, they've turned to AI, generating images of a pink wonderland called 'Gag City' in celebration of Minaj's new album, Pink Friday 2. And it's all because Minaj tweeted that the album would be ""gag city"", ie. would be gag-worthy (ie. so good they'll have no words).
The pastel-pink city soon trended on Twitter, with Barbz creating lore and song-referencing landmarks. Mayor Minaj has also enshrined Gag City's first laws, such as 1-button makeovers and a free mansion, car and canned goods on arrival.
Before jetting off, be sure to learn more about Gag City's ambulances, language, restaurants and more. Also be sure to read on which celebrities are and aren't allowed in Gag City due to feuds with Minaj, to avoid insulting residents by mentioning the banished. If you can't afford a pink private jet, you can always visit via online game Roblox.
The album, released Friday, is Minaj's first since 2018, billed as a spiritual successor to her lauded 2010 album Pink Friday.
Its 22-track feature verses from the likes of Drake, Future and Lil Uzi Vert, with 11 songs containing samples, including songs from Cyndi Lauper, Billie Eilish, Blondie and more.

Forget the Palm d'Or or Oscars: TikTok has announced that this year's best picture is Fitzroy Garage Sesh.
Last Wednesday, TikTok held its 2023 Awards in Sydney, handing out trophies to its finest Australian and Kiwi creators, comedians, musicians and more, as voted by the public.
If you're not familiar with Fitzroy Garage Sesh, it's a short video of some 20-something lads in Melbourne having an afternoon session in a garage, captioned simply ""the vibes are here #Melbourne"".
The video, which was uploaded at the tail end of December '22, went viral, with people across the globe making fun of the boys' fits (no-one is dressed for the same event) and their art bro vibes. But who's having the last laugh now?
Other winners include Indy Clinton for Creator of the Year, the Matildas for Sport Creator of the Year and Peach PRC for Music Act of the Year.
And what would an Aussie awards ceremony be without some random international guests? You can catch the Awards on Binge, featuring Megan Trainor's best friend Chris Olsen, train obsessive model Francis Bourgeois and rapper Armani White.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-08/dicks-musical-interview-aaron-jackson-josh-sharp/103199826,An adults-only take on the classic Parent Trap plotline: Is this the most unhinged film of 2023?,"Watching Dicks: The Musical, you're likely to be struck by a thought that its co-writers and lead stars Josh Sharp and Aaron Jackson have had many times: ""How on Earth did this get made?""
""A lot of people ask, 'did you ever think it would be a movie?',"" says Sharp. ""And no, in no world did we ever think it would be.""
Riffing off The Parent Trap, this musical sees two ""identical twins"" (Jackson and Sharp, who share no physical resemblance or relation) meet as adults and realise they were separated at birth when their parents — Nathan Lane and Will & Grace's Megan Mullally — split.
In this nonsensical, adults-only reimagining, the journey to get their parents back together involves an animated flying vagina, narration from a very gay God — played by SNL's Bowen Yang — and two diabolical puppet-creatures known as The Sewer Boys.
With characters called The Sewer Boys, it's no surprise where Dicks: The Musical ends up. (Supplied: Dicks The Musical)
Perhaps most bizarrely, it also features a show-stealing rap from Megan Thee Stallion, in a last-minute addition. (""I feel like I blacked out and a few hours later this song existed,"" says Jackson.)
Done and dusted in 86 minutes, it's best to not know specifics and just enjoy the ride, though Jackson and Sharp readily warn it's not for everyone. As reference points, the two list off John Waters films, Amy Sedaris's Strangers With Candy, and South Park creators' musical The Book of Mormon.
""If you like very absurd, surreal comedies, it's for you,"" says Jackson. ""It's for the freaks and geeks — people who are tired of the normal movie you get fed, where you know exactly what's going to happen next.""
""Truants and deviants, delinquents!"" adds Sharp. ""And fans of musicals.""
Dicks: The Musical | Official Trailer | A24
Dicks is a balls-to-the-wall parody of toxic masculinity, playing off one central conceit signalled with a pre-film disclaimer: the film was written by and stars ""two LGTBIQ+ gay guys"", who aren't particularly concerned with playing their womanising roles convincingly.
The titular Dicks are Sharp and Jackson's characters, two alpha thirty30something salesmen who meet when their workplaces merge, and the two peacock to prove they can sell the most robot vacuum parts.
Irreverent and camp above all else, Dicks has managed to avoid major culture-war controversy in the US, even with an utterly warped ""love is love"" closing song that sees God call himself a gay slur.
""It's as absurd and goofy as it is offensive — but it's always very joyful,"" says Sharp. ""It was never trying to be edgelord-y or make the audience feel bad.""
Josh Sharp (left) and Aaron Jackson (right) are just as surprised as viewers that Dicks: The Musical exists. (Supplied: Dicks: The Musical)
That's possibly because Dicks: The Musical retains its underground spirit. It was first created in 2014 as Fucking Identical Twins — a 30-minute, two-man, off-Broadway show at Upright Citizens Brigade, the sketch and comedy school whose alumni include Amy Poehler, Aubrey Plaza and Broad City duo Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson. It was never intended to go beyond its basement audience.
""If someone said this was going to take nine years of your life, I might have walked off stage. It's good we didn't know that,"" says Sharp.
""We were doing it in this theatre in the basement of a grocery store — it was a show we were doing for ourselves, that found its little audience.""
One of Dicks' biggest backers has been its director Larry Charles (Borat; Curb Your Enthusiasm), who helped sell the film in 2016 after seeing a tape of the stage show.
Caught in limbo for years due to studio mergers, Dicks was picked up again in 2022 by indie powerhouse A24 (Everything Everywhere All At Once; Talk To Me), who have made a name for left-of-centre films. Charles helped them hone the script, with 150 drafts getting us to the final product.
""Larry was the person who said it needed to be true to its origins and feel very scrappy and dangerous and electric — that it feels like you're in this naughty secret,"" says Sharp.
""He was always like, 'this film needs to go bigger, harder and crazier. If it doubts itself for one second, the audience will sniff it out'.""
Meet The Sewer Boys, named Backpack and Whisper.  (Supplied: Dicks: The Musical)
And so they did: even for the tight script, there was plenty of improv on set.
Sharp and Jackson hold their own, but the film leans on Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally's long-standing Broadway talents. They give it their absolute all, belting out ballads to Sewer Boys or jazzy numbers about having sex with inanimate objects.
Pay attention, and you might spot Sharp and Jackson cracking smiles as they break, one-upped by Mullally and Lane's improv chops.
""It was a little intimidating at first, but they are both so kind"" says Jackson.
""They were very paternal/maternal to us. I never felt like 'oh God, I'm making Nathan mad and I'm not doing a good enough job'. It was a dream.""

One highlight includes a physics-defying sex scene that Charles pushed for, which Sharp compares to the work of avant-garde modern dance company Pilobolus.
""We were like, 'Oh my God, are we allowed to do that?',"" says Jackson.
""When we saw the production schedule, we requested we move the scene to the last day, because we wanted to not worry about hurting ourselves,"" says Sharp.
""We knew we were gonna throw ourselves around.""
For all its ridiculousness, there's one very serious part of Dicks: the music.

While the lyrics and action might be obscene, musically they pass as Broadway tracks, co-written with Marius de Vries, whose credits include Moulin Rouge and La La Land.
Between the live singing and the obvious backdrops and studio lot sets, the film has a vibrancy of an old-school MGM musical at complete odds with its vulgarity.
""Larry pointed out that those grand musicals were weirdly very meta too — they were never trying to make you believe Gene Kelly wasn't in front of a backdrop, selling it on performance,"" says Sharp.
""And at the same time, we made it for $10 and a sandwich.""

In the century it has been around, it has experienced quite a bit of change, says film historian and professor of cinema at UCLA Jonathan Kuntz.
""The sign is outdoors on a mountain, basically, 24 hours a day,"" Professor Kuntz said.
""So it's taken quite a beating.""
Most recently, the sign was refreshed with more than 1,800 litres of paint after each letter was pressure-washed and primed last year.

Professor Kuntz says that is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the sign being spruced up over the years.
""The original sign of 1923, which was wood with electric light bulbs — that decayed over the years and became a mess,"" Professor Kuntz said.
""Some just wanted to remove it, but eventually it was in the late 1940s replaced with a more metal structure that is not illuminated.""
But that would not last either. Thirty years later, it had decayed again.
""In the late 1970s, money was raised by various people contributing quite a bit ... Hugh Hefner, several others and Gene Autry, the western star, and it was rebuilt again.""

Professor Kuntz says that 45 years on from that rebuild, despite better waterproofing technology, changes in temperature mean the Hollywood sign remains an ongoing project.
""There's also debates about it, of course, it's a controversial site,"" he said.
""Because, first off, for everybody that lives in that neighbourhood, the tourism that it brings – sometimes people will just be standing in the street taking pictures of the Hollywood sign, or walking across people's [yards] to get closer to the Hollywood sign and that has created a neighbourhood problem up in Beachwood Canyon underneath the Hollywood sign.""
While there have been numerous fully sanctioned refurbishments over the years, the Hollywood sign has also inadvertently taken a number of different forms.
""It was an advertising sign originally,"" Professor Kuntz said.
""Now, of course, it just advertises Hollywood itself, not a real estate development.
""Hollywoodland was the name of a real estate development in Hollywood.
""And so by the late 40s, when the sign was no longer being maintained by the people that had originally built it and it was becoming an eyesore, as they would say, the city and Chamber of Commerce of Hollywood took control of it and said, 'look, we'll pay to have this thing rebuilt in a more weatherproof fashion.
""'But it's not gonna say Hollywoodland anymore. We're taking off the land. Oh, it's just gonna say Hollywood.'
""Several of the letters had caved in already anyway.
""But it's been customised on several occasions in its history to read other things to promote various movies and TV shows and events.""
Professor Kuntz says that is not the only thing the sign has been used to promote.

""There's been attempts, you know, kind of you might say vandalism, where people have gone up there and furtively altered what it says, often to make political statements.
""It hangs right over Los Angeles, you might say, right over the city.
""Millions of people can see it every day, basically, and so in some ways, it's perfectly positioned if you want to get a message across to people.
""And so there have been folks who have taken it over … most famously in, I guess it was in the 1970s they changed Hollywood to Hollyweed – some folks who liked to advocate for the legalisation of marijuana.""
While a trespasser got away with altering the sign to again read Hollyweed in 2017, Professor Kuntz says it would be hard for someone to get away with that today.
""You're doing all kinds of things. You're trespassing. You're vandalising. So, they can throw the book at you, I suppose. It may not be hard time, but there'll be trouble.""",MBy Mawunyo Gbogbo,Fri 8 Dec 2023,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-07/the-boy-and-the-heron-review/103191608,The Boy and the Heron showcases the magical mind of anime master Miyazaki,"The world has missed Hayao Miyazaki.
It's been a decade since the Studio Ghibli guru announced his supposed retirement on the back of his elegiac and deeply personal The Wind Rises, and his reputation has only grown in his absence.
There were memes. There were controversies. And of course, there are the movies — arguably the greatest run of any filmmaker, working in live action or animation, across the last 40 years — that continued to win new generations of fans.
Now, at the tender age of 82, Miyazaki is back — and as soulful as ever — with the coming-of-age fantasy The Boy and the Heron.
The Boy and the Heron follows the story of Mahito and is partly based on Hayao Miyazaki's childhood memories. (Supplied: Studio Ghibli)
Though it marks a return to the director's more fantastical style, The Boy and the Heron is something of a spiritual sequel to The Wind Rises, drawing loosely upon Miyazaki's infant memories of his father — a Japanese aircraft designer — and their flight from the war-torn Tokyo of World War II.
It's 1944, and the nation is in the grip of the Pacific War. A year after losing his mother in a hospital fire, 12-year-old Mahito (voiced by Soma Santoki, and Luca Padovan in the English dub) and his father Shoichi (Takuya Kimura/Christian Bale) evacuate Tokyo for the countryside, where they take up residence in a quaint old mansion that seems to be unmoored in time.

Shoichi has remarried his late wife's younger sister, the newly pregnant Natsuko (Yoshino Kimura/Gemma Chan), who lives on the estate with a coterie of garrulous old maids who comically fuss and fawn over Mahito like he's a prize new pet.
The kid's already feeling out of sorts when he encounters a majestic and sinister Grey Heron, who swoops upon the house and starts rapping on the bedroom window. Its beak is bursting with leering, unnervingly human chompers, its voice crackling with invitations to the netherworld.
""I shall guide you to your mother,"" the Heron taunts Mahito, backed by a minion chorus of chanting frogs and fish.
It's been ten years since Miyazaki has made a film with Studio Ghibli. (Supplied: Studio Ghibli)
The Heron is voiced with prickly charm by Japanese actor Masaki Suda, and in the English dub by Robert Pattinson, who lets his freak mode flourish with a mischievous performance that swings between comic bluster and wounded pride.
(It's testament to Miyazaki's pull that the English version is full of big names putting in solid vocal work, though it goes without saying that you should see the Japanese language original if you can.)

Both white rabbit and shapeshifting trickster — the reveal of his true form is too funny to give away here — the Heron soon leads Mahito through a portal into a parallel world, where Natsuko has been kidnapped by an army of anthropomorphic parakeets engaged in a power struggle with a mad wizard (Shōhei Hino/Mark Hamill).
From his earlier feature work, like Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and My Neighbour Totoro, through to later masterpieces Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle, Miyazaki's films contain some of the most indelible fantasy images in cinema.
At the same time, they've always been anchored by a rich emotional thread that reflects their creator's humanist worldview and, in this respect, The Boy and the Heron is no different.
Will The Boy and the Heron be one of Studio Ghibli's best?  (Supplied: Studio Ghibli)
Miyazaki, who was born in 1941, has spoken of the war as one of his earliest childhood memories. The director's affection for his late mother, meanwhile, fuels Mahito's yearning, his petulance, his sense of disconnection from the world.
True to Miyazaki's style, Mahito's journey feels both everyday and dreamlike, where lost mothers become fire-wielding spirits, elderly cleaning ladies transform into seafaring adventurers, and harmless domestic birds take on the puffed-up shape of man-eating warriors.
Cinematographer Atsushi Okui told Deadline he was excited to work on the film alongside Hayao Miyazaki. (Supplied: Studio Ghibli)
The parakeets — led by a grave, stentorian king (Jun Kunimura/Dave Bautista) — are one of those signature Miyazaki creations that mix the threatening with the goofy. They're both unnerving and wildly comical, something a child would conjure in a daydream.
It's classic terrain for a filmmaker who has never dealt in the reductive binary of good and evil, whose worlds are populated by morally complex creatures deserving of empathy.
These unborn souls will delight Studio Ghibli fans. (Supplied: Studio Ghibli)
Just as the film features cutesy little egg-shaped babies whose plush likeness is bound for the Ghibli gift shop, it also contains disquieting scenes of pelicans cruising in through the darkness, like a squadron of fighter bombers, to snap them up and devour them. No mere villains, the pelicans get their own complicated story, relayed — in one of the movie's bleakest and most moving moments — by an injured bird (Kaoru Kobayashi/Willem Dafoe) with the gravitas of a fallen Shakespearian king.
Moments like this reveal the precarity of an ecosystem and an environment in crisis, but also the weight of legacy as new generations inherit the mistakes of the past.
Like Miyazaki's best work, The Boy and the Heron isn't merely nostalgic for its creator's childhood. It's a challenge to that next generation to rethink the way the world works. That's what keeps him vital, seven decades into his career.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-06/why-we-cant-stop-watching-oddly-satisfying-videos/103189612,What's an 'oddly satisfying' video and why do millions of people watch them?,"The internet is awash with videos of people power-washing pavements, mowing lawns and making perfect cuts of cakes.
These ""oddly satisfying"" videos have become a massive trend — on YouTube alone there are over 1.2 million videos — and people can't get enough of them.
""Oddly satisfying is a genre of YouTube content which celebrates the 'hard to put your finger on' sensory satisfaction of a particular everyday sound or activity — like the sharp click of a container lid closing perfectly on the first try,"" explains Dr Jessica Balanzategui, a senior lecturer in media at RMIT University.
So what is so satisfying about them? And who is watching them?
What constitutes an oddly satisfying video is incredibly broad. The term originated on Reddit and has since become a massive trend.
It seeks to capture the feeling of satisfaction that comes from a mundane activity done right.
One sub-genre has people making slime. Another has people picking up shards of ice, the bigger the better, and throwing them on frozen lakes.
Why? Well, the sound of tinkling ice is amazing — and the aesthetics of the shards can be quite beautiful.
Right now, some of the most popular videos in the genre are glass bottles being rolled down hard concrete stairs, which smash in a particularly edifying way.
Often these videos depict a tactile activity, like close-ups of hands playing with slime or playdough.
Others show someone doing an activity really well. For example, a handsome man who can cut logs in half with a few swings of his axe.
In their research, which involved analysing hundreds of YouTube videos, Dr Balanzategui found that despite how diverse these videos are, there is an identifiable pattern.
""People often link their enthusiasm to nostalgic feelings of comfort during childhood, which is interesting, because lots of actual children love this content, too,"" Dr Balanzategui says.
""We found that the genre's popularity with young people is linked to the way it simulates children's play with things like kinetic sand, slime and other materials you'd remember from playgroup or preschool.
""So, there's obviously some kind of primal pleasure in watching these videos that parallels the physical act of what we'd call 'tactile' play — play with materials with an interesting or unusual feel, that's driven by the sensory experience it offers to us.""
YouTube video by Joshua’s Garden: ‘Throwing ice on a frozen lake is so satisfying’. Video shows sheets of ice being thrown on a frozen lake and smashing into tiny pieces.
""Our research found that oddly satisfying videos have become very popular with children and young people, even though it's one of these online content genres with very ambiguous intentions and an unclear intended audience demographic,"" Dr Balanzategui says.
""For that reason, this genre is fascinating because it helps us understand how genres form in unique ways in 'participatory' online spaces.
“[On] platforms like YouTube and Reddit … the users and members of the community are creating the content that eventually becomes an identifiable genre. It's these same community members who are describing the genre and associating it with key terms and characteristics as it crystallises.""
The trend has a lot in common with ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) videos, which are often enjoyed for relaxation and mental health.
Dr Balanzategui says that watching these videos, which often have an element of play, can act as a kind of instant relief for anxiety.
""Oddly Satisfying content doesn't have a narrative structure, so the appeal seems to be sensory – watching these videos 'simulates' some kind of tactile, sensory response which some people seem to find very … oddly satisfying.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-05/tracing-the-10-year-wait-for-gta6/103189880,Grand Theft Auto VI has been 10 years in the making. The first trailer has finally arrived,"After more than a decade of speculation, our first official glimpse of Grand Theft Auto VI is here.
The trailer for the next instalment of the best-selling video game franchise was shared by developer Rockstar Games a day earlier than planned, due to a leak. It confirms the game will be released in 2025, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
Featuring gameplay footage, it also confirms long-standing rumours that GTAVI will be set in Vice City, the series' take on Miami, Florida, and has a female protagonist — a first for the series. The trailer sees Lucia and a male partner on a Bonnie and Clyde-esque crime spree captured via social media live-streams.
If you're not a gamer, it can be hard to understand the magnitude of the announcement. But it has been more than a decade since Grand Theft Auto V was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2013 – an exorbitant wait, especially with other blockbuster gaming franchises like Call of Duty, Super Mario and Final Fantasy averaging a new release every two or three years.
In that time, fans have filled the time with immense hype and speculation. The road to GTAVI has been windy, filled with conspiracies, leaks, company overhauls and an FBI investigation — just about as dramatic as the series itself.
YouTube Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1
Grand Theft Auto is a long-standing video game series that launched in 1997, where players take control of a criminal on a series of missions through a city, including car-jacking, bank robberies and murder. It's created by Rockstar Games, a company with 2000+ workers across studios in America, the UK, India and more.
The series is positioned as a violent satire of modern-day America: a ruthless world of violence and gangs, featuring parodies of pop culture, politics and advertising.
According to ABC Gamer's Harry Jun, it was 2001's GTAIII that established the series as a cultural and technological force, creating an open world that allowed players to roam freely through its city setting in addition to completing the game's missions.
""That was GTA's foray into the cultural zeitgeist,"" he says, ""with people talking about a video game for better or worse — about whether it caused violence in society, or it being an amazing experience and the next level of realism. It was almost like watching someone in real life.""

That realism has made GTA one of the most controversial video game series, criticised repeatedly for glamorising violence and criminal activity. In 2014, Target Australia and K-Mart removed GTAV from stores, after more than 40,000 people signed an online petition.
But the series remains incredibly popular and acclaimed: GTAV is regarded as one of the best video games of all time. And after selling more than 190 million titles — thanks to re-releases for the two successive generations of Xbox and PlayStation consoles — it is also the second-highest selling game of all time, too.
This June, Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive revealed that the franchise has generated more than US$8.33 billion revenue in the decade since GTAV's release.
Fan theorising over GTAVI began shortly after the release of GTAV, when Rockstar North's then-president confirmed they were throwing around ideas for the next game.
With the company tight-lipped on details, gamers have filled in the blanks themselves with a litany of Reddit threads, YouTube explainers and speculation. Most recently, gamers analysed an image tweeted by Rockstar Games featuring a waning moon, with users trying to ascertain a trailer date by comparing it to 2023's lunar phases.
YouTube videogamedunkey The Ten year wait for GTA 6
""Gamers love to solve puzzles,"" says Jun. ""There's a culture of Easter Eggs in games, of decades of developers coding secrets that aren't part of the main game, but reward discovery and experimentation.""
Some conclusions, whether by design or accident, have proven to be true. It's unclear whether a beach towel in GTAV reading ""I <3 VC"" was actively a clue to the game's Vice City setting, but fans pointed toward this as proof. Jun says Rockstar are particularly ""cheeky"" when it comes to teasing gamers.
""They'll put in little clues that don't confirm anything but are fun to find,"" he says.
""In a trailer for GTA Online, random numbers featured that viewers thought were GPS co-ordinates, and when they put them into Google Maps, it was an overhead view of a road in Virginia that looked like the letters VI. And everyone was like 'GTAVI CONFIRMED'. But it means nothing!""
At the same time, it seems that Rockstar did signpost the GTAVI trailer's original release date via an in-game T-shirt called ""ONEDAYWILLREVEALALL"", added to GTA Online earlier this year.
In September 2022, Rockstar Games was hacked, with GTAVI footage and data posted online in what was described as one of the biggest leaks in video game history.
More than 90 separate video clips of early development footage, showcasing animation tests, level layouts and gameplay were leaked, showing the now-confirmed GTAVI's Vice City setting and the female protagonist.

The footage was uploaded to GTAForums by user ""teapotuberhacker"", who later added they wanted to ""negotiate a deal"" with Rockstar over the return of unreleased data. They alleged this included source code, which, if leaked, could result in pirated or knockoff versions of the game.
The FBI investigated the hack, which was linked to a similar breaches at Microsoft, Uber, digital banking group Revolut and AI company Nvidia.
In the end, 18 and 17-year-old members of a hacking group called Lapsus$ were found guilty of the spree by a UK court.
During the production of GTA, Rockstar has faced an internal cultural overhaul and senior-level reshuffle.
Ahead of the release of Rockstar's 2018 game Red Dead Redemption 2, the company was accused of an inappropriate, ""frat-house"" culture, as well as extensive unpaid overtime by current and former employees, who alleged months of 55-to-60 hour, six-day weeks to finish the game for release.
This period of immense workload is known in the gaming industry as ""crunch"", and open-world games like Rockstar's are particularly brutal, given the hundreds of hands needed for play-tests and to fix any issues.
Many hands make games work when it comes to creating worlds like Vice City. (Supplied: Rockstar Games)
""Deadlines aren't approached in a practical way,"" says Jun.
""Pushing the release date will lose money, so they just burn out their employees. But I think that's starting to change … the bigger cultural issues will take longer.""
Following RDR2's release, Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser and GTA's main writer left the company, with several more executives since departing. In 2020, gaming site Kotaku interviewed 15 current or recent employees, who spoke of improved working conditions.
To reduce crunch, it's reported that GTAVI will launch with a smaller game map, which will be expanded via regular updates.
""It's taken 10 years,"" says Jun. ""I'm hoping they went with a slow development to push out the next big one.""
And with GTAVI's trailer featuring a vague 2025 release date, it's a sign Rockstar isn't in a rush. In the meantime, the trailer offers plenty of footage to scour for clues.",Jared Richards,Tue 5 Dec 2023,0

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-02/jessie-ware-disco-soul-no-dance-scene-for-middle-aged-women/103178194,"When you're on the 'wrong' side of club-ready, where do you go to dance?","There is something very special about watching a great singer watch another singer perform.
You must have seen the social media posts of rockstars and music legends watching a fellow star in full flight: the intimate understanding of their craft so clear in their expression; their attentive, quietly held focus on the choices their idol is making; the silently mouthed words (they know every one) and half-smiles at perfectly held notes and that tricky transition.
Watching them is like hearing the music twice: it's a secret masterclass, one caught unaware, in what a performer is really doing to move you with their music.
This week the superb British soul singer and disco revivalist Jessie Ware performed a short set in a small setting, and I was lucky enough to be there, sitting right near two of Australia's most significant singer-songwriters, Clare Bowditch and Kate Miller Heidke.
I was of course transported by the brilliant power, colour and floating beauty of Ware's voice (she deserves to be so much better known than she is right now, but I suspect that's all about to change) but I also couldn't keep my eyes off the singers watching the singer. What a gift.
Clare's joy at and capture by Ware's singing was beautiful to watch. I felt like I was receiving a wordless analysis of what it is to live a life of music on the stage: at some moments Clare seemed like she wanted to jump up there too; at others, she looked every bit the fan like me.
Being a fan never leaves you, and sometimes I think it's the highest calling of all – the forest that hears the tree fall.
I was there for a chat with Jessie Ware and also to gather a bunch of friends to hear music I knew they would love and to come together just us as the music fans we've been since our much younger days.
By the end of the night, the disco fire in our souls had been re-lit by Jessie's groove (I've shared this song with you before: just try staying seated while you listen to it) and we were only half-joking about wanting to go on dancing somewhere — but where? A bunch of mostly middle-aged women? Yeah, we had kids and husbands at home but why should that disqualify us from spinning around?
There's no dance scene for us anymore. Maybe it's ever been thus when you're on the wrong side of club-ready.
We had kids and husbands at home but why should that disqualify us from spinning around? (ABC News: Harriet Tatham)
A friend points out to me the distinct difference between that kind of after-dark life in Australia compared to many countries in Europe, where women of all ages seem welcome into a dance-club culture that is strictly age-defined here. Just as G-strings are on every aged body on European beaches, so too their club culture is nowhere near as ageist as ours.
Instead, my friend's daughter who is 19, says she is now ""too old"" for so many venues that just want the barely out of high school crowd. When it comes to anyone who is over 35, it's just impossible.
But I don't know if we can blame it entirely on a youth-obsessed culture. The distinct joy in that evening for me was being in the company of dear friends: kind, smart, funny women who think deeply and laugh readily and as with almost every choice we've made in our lives, we need to accept that we are in charge of defining ourselves as women who still dance — or not.
I've written here before about making and keeping friendships as we get older, and the necessity for rejuvenating those connections. I think the same challenge applies to the way we define the boundaries of ourselves, too — do we need to have such a strict definition around the kind of person we are, and what we do and don't do?
It reminds me in an odd way of the best broadcasting advice I ever received from the radio guru Valerie Geller, who said try to do something you've never done before every week: it can't always be skydiving or swimming with whales, so just make it alighting at a different tram stop, or going into that gallery you always walk past.
The friends I've made later in my life feel like a gift. Time speeds by when we are together, and yet I age backwards when I am with them.
One small, new thing to keep you alive to the possibilities around you. To keep learning that you can keep learning.
I suspect in a busy and sometimes even overwhelmed life, those little possibilities are the first to go: the things we don't need or that we ""just don't do anymore"" and after a while they become impossibilities, or a part of a lost self.
But I think I have the solution. While talking to music legend Kate Ceberano recently about her new book, she also lamented the lack of a club where women over 30 could go and dance, chat and not either be turned away at the door by the age police or hit on by blokes who probably shouldn't be there anyway. We decided we needed to start that club ourselves: an occasional pop-up disco of new and old stuff, decent booze and one hell of a dance floor.
We think we'll call it The Occasional Club: TOC, for short. Maybe we'll call it TicToc, just to annoy the kids we won't let in. Dress code: that 80s frock you just can't let go. Let me know if you want your name on the door.
This weekend: which Spotify type are you? The year ends ""wrapped"" as our music streamers call it, and I'm proud to tell you that for the first time in years I've reversed the ""ruined by kids"" outcome and my dance music just nudges ahead of gaming soundtracks. Score one for the disco tragic.
Have a safe and happy weekend and as we bring AusMusic Month to a close, I'll stretch the connection a little and celebrate with Jessie Ware joining our own queen in a joyful duet.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-30/spotify-wrapped-apple-music-audible-books-listening-australia/103168922,Spotify Wrapped is out. Here's how Australians listened in 2023,"It's that time of year. End-of-year lists are coming in thick and fast.
Despite fragmented listenership and the cost-of-living crisis making it difficult for some to maintain paid subscriptions, Australians still tuned in to hours and hours of content throughout 2023.
According to Deloitte's Media & Entertainment Consumer Insights 2023 report, Australians on average listen to nine hours and 15 minutes of audio content each week.
The vast majority of this time is spent listening to music or radio (seven hours and 20 minutes), with the remainder on podcasts and audiobooks.
Australia leads the world in podcast listenership, according to the report, with 41 per cent of people consuming at least one hour of podcasts and audiobooks a week.
So, Australians are listeners. But what are they listening to?
Spotify is the world's most popular audio streaming subscription service, with more than 574 million users, which includes 226 million subscribers in more than 180 markets.
Spotify Wrapped 2023 is now available to individual users, although some have reported experiencing glitches on the web interface.
Its stats are in, however, on how we listened as a whole as a country.
It doesn't matter who you are, whether you hate music or have never and will never use Spotify. Everyone fits the mould for at least one of these types on Wrapped day.
Taylor Swift was Australia's most-streamed artist this year, with Flowers by Miley Cyrus the most-streamed song in the country. The Wiggles were Australia's most-streamed local artists.
Globally, Swift beat out Bad Bunny to claim the number-one spot in 2023. It's the first time a female artist was the most-streamed on the platform since Spotify began collating stats in this way.
The top five genres according to Spotify were pop, rap, rock, hip hop and dance pop.
Swift also came out on top in Apple's end-of-year charts, with more subscribers listening to Swift in 2023 than to any other artist in the world. This set a new all-time record for the most listeners for any artist in a single year.
Cyrus finished at number one in Australia when it comes to singles, with Flowers.
Apple has more than 1 billion paying subscribers overall across its music, podcasts, books, iCloud, Fitness+, Apple TV+ and other brands.

The following lists contain data from Apple
Despite earlier this year expanding its offerings to include 15 hours of audiobook access a month, Spotify Wrapped doesn't include stats on audiobooks for 2023.
On Audible, the most listened-to audiobook in Australia was Prince Harry's Spare, with almost 50 per cent of the first-week sales in Australia being from audio.
Audible data also reveals a 19 per cent increase in listening hours for memoirs and pop culture content compared to last year, with Australia a nation of celebrity memoir enthusiasts.
While Apple's stats put Prince Harry on top in the non-fiction category, it was the other Harry – Harry Potter that dominated the fiction audiobook charts, with all of the top five slots going to author JK Rowling's books.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-30/the-seven-types-of-people-on-spotify-wrapped-day/103165306,There are seven types of people on Spotify Wrapped day. Which one are you?,"Happy psychological analysis (AKA Spotify Wrapped) day!
It doesn't matter who you are, whether you hate music or have never and will never use Spotify. Everyone fits the mould for at least one of these types on Wrapped day.
Which one/s are you?
It's probably no surprise that Australia's top artist for 2023 is Taylor Swift. But who else could the country not get enough of? And how about podcasts and audiobooks?
You feel the need to pretend you're ""so embarrazzed"" by your top songs and artists, even though those lists are filled with music you really love.
It just happens to be super basic. (I'm talking Billboard top 20 vibes.)
But you know what? I think you deserve some props.
You like what you like and you're unafraid to stick to exactly that… even if you are a little scared to parade the results online.
I say let the fear go and be truly unapologetically you.
We love you but we have no idea who your favourite artists are and we're too lazy to find out.  (ABC Everyday: Luke Tribe)
You listen to cool stuff and nothing but cool stuff and you want everyone to know it, even though your followers won't recognise your top songs and have no idea who your favourite artists are.
You earnestly caption the screenshot of your number one album: ""Imogen Cygler — Stranger Sometimes. Melbourne composer. Under 2k followers on IG. One of my fave discoveries this year. Imagine Stella Donnelly attending a renaissance fair with They Might Be Giants's lyrical attitude.""
In five years, when the rest of the world has caught onto the artists you've been listening to, you'll remind them that you were all across it first.
You are this meme and you are also this meme. Don't worry, we still love you.
Is your list lined with Kylie and Troye Sivan? (ABC Everyday: Luke Tribe)
This is you if your Wrapped features any of the following (I don't make the rules):
That your Wrapped is so gay is a beautiful thing.
You are obligated to post about it because we need to know and celebrate how gay we all are.
The algorithm doesn't lie darlings. (ABC Everyday: Luke Tribe)
You have ~no idea~ how World Class Sinner/I'm a Freak became your most listened to song of the year.
It just doesn't make any sense. You heard it play on that one episode of The Idol you could stomach and sure, you'll admit you listened to it a few more times after that because it was a good morning amp-up song but that was IT, SURELY?
Spotify has this all wrong! What does Spotify even know, anyway? Who do they think they're fooling that this is based on data? What does data know, anyway?

Good on you for taking the steps to improve your sleep hygiene.
We totally support you in your decision to pretend your favourite talk podcast was your number one, actually.
Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo. (ABC Everyday: Luke Tribe)
The Wiggles, Baby Shark, the Frozen soundtrack.
Not only were you forced to listen to this stuff far more times than you would have liked to over the last 365 days — you also miss out on truly experiencing Wrapped day.
This day now serves as a reminder of how much the soundtrack to your life has changed.
And look, there are good and bad things about this.
If you don't want this to happen again, there is a way to reset your algorithm.
Sorry to read you all like this but...  (ABC Everyday: Luke Tribe)
You might feel an impossible-to-ignore urge to post on your Stories lamenting the fact it's Spotify Wrapped day and insisting everyone stop posting about it.
Or you might hate the Spotify monopoly on the Wrapped concept and would like your followers to instead pay attention to your misc streaming service's janky attempt at cobbling together the same thing.
You diligently post your Apple/YouTube/last.fm/insert random music streaming platform's roundup to your socials in the hope that one day, someone will respond to it with equal enthusiasm.

If you're one of the million-plus people who bought the book, seeing protagonist Eli Bell hooning around the streets of 1980s Brisbane will trigger memories of Dalton's gripping and rollicking tale.
Likewise, getting a look at that red telephone and the faces of characters like Slim Halliday (Bryan Brown), Tytus Broz (Anthony LaPaglia) and Eli's mum Frances Bell (Phoebe Tonkin) may offer a new perspective.
YouTube | Netflix | Boy Swallows Universe |  Official Trailer | Netflix
Speaking with The Weekend Australian, Dalton said he was very moved by the treatment given to his novel.
""They swung for the fence,"" he said. ""I'm just so proud of how powerful and full-hearted it actually is.""
The series is directed by Bharat Nalluri and Jocelyn Moorhouse, and will hit Netflix on Thursday 11 January, writes Dan Condon.
90s pop tragics in Naarm had a field day, kind of literally, on Friday when Mother Aguilera showed up in style at the Flemington Racecourse.
That gorgeous Melb weather (read: absolutely pouring rain) really set the scene, first for a set from our new queer icon Nat Bass who, wearing a kind of sexy chainmail, paid tribute to this ""night of divas"" with a cover of I Wanna Dance With Somebody, and also teased a new 80s-style dance track from Rogue Traders.
Just when you thought more royalty couldn't fit onto that stage, crowds were then treated to Jessica Mauboy (feat. a great new red hair lewk).
And then, as the heavens really opened, XTina came on stage. Plastic ponchos were donned and the crowd was treated to her bellowing out the hits, launching straight up into Dirrty and Genie in a Bottle.
She revealed the last time she was in Australia she was pregnant with her 15-year-old son and later brought out her nine-year-old daughter, who is appropriately named Summer Rain.
""Thank you for your patience and allowing me a moment to be a mama and do what I need to do,"" XTina told the bellowing crowd.
""New music is really coming, I prooooomise, I'm so excited."" So are we.

Paul Lynch has won the 50,000-pound (AUD$96,000) Booker Prize for his novel Prophet Song, a dystopian novel set in Ireland in the near future.
This book describes a world of increasing political repression and social disintegration from the perspective of Eilish Stack, a mother of four living in Dublin.
The Garda National Services, Ireland's newly formed secret police, come looking for her trade unionist husband Larry, who soon goes missing. As the terror and violence ratchets up, Eilish carries on with her everyday life: caring for her children, going to the shops and helping her father.
""She's just an ordinary person living her life and trying to get back to what we all consider now to be normality,"" Lynch told ABC RN's The Book Show.
Judge Esi Edugyan described the winning novel as ""a triumph of emotional storytelling"" and praised Lynch for his visceral use of language.
""In these troubled times, we sought a novel with a guiding vision, a book to remind us that we are more than ourselves, to remind us of all that is worth saving,"" she said.

There have been rumours about Meghann Fahy and Leo Woodall for over a year, and we finally have proof!
Page 6 papped the pair ""packing on the PDA"" as they walked arm in arm through the streets of New York City last week.

Now that Emerald Fennel's follow-up to (the equally divisive) Promising Young Woman is in cinemas, the internet's awash with plenty of opinions, ranging from love to hate, horny to utter bewilderment — especially around the film's intense homoeroticism and its final act plot twist.
Emerald Fennell is back with a thrilling, dark satire set in an English mansion that doesn't shy away from the 'sticky and difficult' stuff.
(For the record, ABC Arts critic Michael Sun found the film's end third ""so convoluted it blurred the laser focus of its preceding 90 minutes"".)
If you've seen it, you'll understand: if you haven't, you're probably a little confused. As @mazza.h wrote on TikTok, ""why is everyone refusing to talk to me about it until I see it tomorrow, but acting as if they've been involved in something illegal by watching it???""
We don't want to spoil things too much, but maybe this recent quote from star Jacob Elordi about a masturbation scene with his co-star will provide a little context: ""I was very proud. I was very proud to have Barry Keoghan guzzling it like that."" Let's leave it at that.

Lead stars Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega won't feature in Scream 7, with Barerra fired as a result of pro-Palestinian sentiment on her social media.
Barerra, who played lead Sam Carpenter in both the annoyingly titled 2022 reboot Scream (actually Scream 5), and 2023's Scream VI, was let go by production company Spyglass due to posts interpreted as anti-Semetic — specifically, one in which she criticised ""Western media"" for showing only ""the [Israeli] side"".
After the news broke via Variety, director Christopher Landon posted and deleted a tweet in reaction to criticism, writing, ""Everything sucks. Stop yelling. This was not my decision to make.""
According to Spyglass, Ortega left the upcoming Scream 7 prior to this, due to a scheduling conflict with Wednesday's second season. The two played sisters in the series – now, without them, the film's writers are having to retool their script and find new leads.

Everyone's favourite surreal, murder-driven black comedy is back!
Following a slight departure for season four, starring Chris Rock and Jason Schwartzmann in a sprawling 1950s gangland epic, the series returns to its roots, set in the snowy present-day(ish) climes of 2019 Minnesota and North Dakota, with a focus on class, gender and lethal foul play (naturally).

With a reputation for all-star casts, this time around we get Jon Hamm (in his first major TV role since Mad Men) playing a shady local lawman investigating typical housewife Dot, played by Juno Temple (Keeley in Ted Lasso), after a very bad parent-teacher night involving a misfired taser. But then Dot is kidnapped, which may or may not involve her wealthy, acerbic mother-in-law, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Cue the intrigue.
There's only three episodes so far (streaming via SBS On Demand), but the set-up signals another gripping ride with unexpected twists and turns, including the trademark blend of arch dialogue, stylised direction and a ripping soundtrack selection, featuring surprising uses of prog rock titans Yes and The Prodigy's Smack My Bitch Up.
Oh, and Spoiler Alert: Jon Hamm gives us nipple-rings and some full-screen derriere action. How's that for a drawcard?

Although you will later be quietly cursing me, Disney and the whole Arendelle royal family when you realise you have Let it Go stuck on loop in your head, I think it's also fair to share the love for a story with women fighting their own battles, heartwarming sisterly bonds, songs you can truly belt along to and an animate snowman. The wider world also got to realise the witchy power of Idina Menzel, and is better for it.

On stage as a comedian I have the power","I stumbled into comedy in 2019. I enrolled in a six-week workshop in Byron Bay, to challenge myself creatively.
In the first week, the teacher asked why we were there. I said: ""I'm disabled, and I have stuff to say.""
A year earlier, while waiting for an appointment, I watched Hannah Gadsby's comedy special Nanette on my phone. In the show, Gadsby speaks about how she built a career on self-deprecation, and that she didn't want to do that anymore.
When watching Nanette, I didn't know that I was two years shy from becoming a stand-up comedian. I just understood what Hannah was talking about. It immediately resonated with my own experiences. To many, people disability can be an easy laugh.
But being the butt of the joke is something I never want to be.
Hannah's words have stayed with me. Tipping misconceptions about disability on its head has become the ethos for how I write and think about my comedy.
YouTube | The MelbComedyFest | Alexandra Hudson | 2023 Comedy Spotlight Festival
In the real world, I can't control how people perceive and interact with me. But once I am pulled up on stage, I have the power.
I can share my experiences and perspectives, on my terms. I put it back on the non-disabled audience. I challenge their ableism and mine it for laughs.
I love being disabled; how I move through the world is the only way I ever known
I didn't always feel like this. When I stopped trying to the achieve unattainable and unrealistic societal ideals placed upon me since birth — and started owning who I am, loving who I am and being who I am — my life became profoundly better.
It also gave me a new understanding of how I perceive the world, and the lens through which I am perceived. I was never the problem.
But oh my, society still gets it wrong about me. As well as disability in general. And there is so much comedy in that.
Given how slowly misconceptions can change, I don't think I am going to run out of disability material anytime soon.
As a comedian, I like to make people a little uncomfy in their seats as payback for making me uncomfy in the streets.
The goal on stage is always funny first. (Supplied: Jay Penfold)
I thought performing on stage would be the most difficult thing about comedy. I didn't realise it would become the space where I can be myself.
In the beginning I wasn't sure if audiences would get on board with my comedy. They seemed to frequently make sounds conveying their concern, as if asking: ""Can we laugh at this?"" But now, at each gig, I push them along with me.
With the goal to always be funny first, I don't like to put the audience at ease.
I never want to give audiences any reassurance.
I spent a good chunk of my life feeling like I had to reassure others — to put them at ease.
I have been told — through attitudes and interactions — that me being me is somehow uncomfortable for others.
I write comedy from my own experiences. If there is another person who exists on the fringes sitting in the audience or watching me online, I hope that they will laugh in the mutual knowing that we aren't the oddities. It's society's perceptions of us that are odd.
YouTube TheMelbComedyFest Alexandra Hudson - 2022 Raw Comedy National Grand Final
Nearly three-and-a-half years into my comedy career, I still get floored by the responses I receive. I love that I get to disrupt misconceptions of disability every night on stage.
To get non-disabled people laughing — mostly at themselves — is cool. But hearing the laughter of those who get it is the best feeling ever.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-22/squid-game-the-challenge-review/103130286,"Turning Squid Game into a real-life reality show seems ridiculous, but it makes utterly gripping TV","There are so many reasons why Squid Game: The Challenge shouldn't work.
Boasting the biggest cast and cash prize in reality TV history (456 people clamouring for USD$4.56 million), the show's logistics are enough to send even the most seasoned producer of The Bachelor into a head-spin. But perhaps even more mind-boggling is The Challenge's concept itself.
Cast your mind back – just for a second, I promise – to September 2021. Much of Australia (and the world) is in lockdown, but an ultra-violent, stylish, South Korean drama is cutting through the stale air of stasis, dread and fear.
Created by Hwang Dong-hyuk and made by Netflix, Squid Game threw us from one nightmare into another: a perverse, deeply unfair world where 456 down-and-out people opt to compete in a death match for the chance to take home 45.6 billion won ($5,400,700 AUD).
The frightening world of Squid Game is now a reality show. (Supplied: Netflix)
More sledgehammer than subtle commentary, Squid Game laid out the cruelty of late capitalism just as COVID-19 made apparent our many inequalities. A true monocultural hit, Squid Game remains Netflix's most-watched show to date.
So, another season is a no-brainer. But last year's announcement of a reality show spin-off raised eyebrows.
Wasn't the original show, in part, a parody of exploitative reality TV, taking the genre's tendency to dangle fame and money in front of the vulnerable to a bloody extreme?
The Challenge is, to some extent, the streaming giant equivalent of starting a Fight Club because Brad Pitt made it look cool; of loving the vibe (or value) or something and discarding the message.
But now that it's here, Squid Game: The Challenge doesn't cast off that slight ickiness so much as outpace it. It pushes aside the question of whether it's cheapening the original work by the sheer fact of being excellent, utterly gripping reality TV. (Besides, the killer guard plush toys might have gotten there first.)
Disbelief is all part of the challenge.  (Supplied: Netflix)
A hybrid of Wipeout's ridiculous games, Big Brother's claustrophobia and Survivor's social chess, The Challenge is high-stakes, higher drama and the highest production quality out.
Ten other popular shows and moves from South Korea you might've missed.
Even with death off the cards, The Challenge is only slightly less masochistic than Squid Game – and it's equally as intense.
It offers plenty of tragic eliminations, surprising twists and backstabbing, plus new games that would work well in the drama's upcoming second season.
Over ten episodes filmed across 16 days, The Challenge's cast live together 24/7 on a sealed recreation of Squid Game's set: a candy-cotton hellscape of pastel staircase mazes, boiler-suited guards and devilish game rooms that turn childhood classics like marbles and tug of war into treacherous, often rigged challenges.
The Challenge's prize money doesn't scratch the surface of this show's budget — the production scale is shocking.
Safe to say, things get heated immediately during the first game, Red Light, Green Light, where 456 people race across a field to the finish line while a giant killer doll's head is turned, freezing when she turns back to them – move, and they're shot dead. (In lieu of actual firing squads, eliminations are announced via a black ink pack exploding underneath each contestant's green-and-grey tracksuit. It's up to them whether to milk their ""death"" with a dramatic fall.)
It's absolute bloodshed. More than half of the contestants don't make it, and a majority of them don't even get a moment with the camera — missing out on the consolation prize of social media followers or momentary fame.
The Red Light, Green Light challenge was terrifying the first time around.  (Supplied: Netflix)
(Allegedly, 'Red Light, Green Light' was far more taxing than shown. Back in January, Variety reported on the ""inhumane"" filming conditions of the first day of shooting, as a two-hour shoot spiralled into a seven-hour game without water or bathroom breaks, prompting at least three players to faint.)
Squid Game was far from fair, and The Challenge isn't either, with plenty of wrong-time wrong-place twists. It's brutal out here, as even your snoring could piss off the wrong people.
Add to that the show constantly prodding contestants with yucky food, sudden eliminations and secret missions, and the pressure only rises.
Multiple contestants are surprised when they start sobbing mid-challenge, not realising just how highly strung they are. Just like watching Squid Game, your main thought during The Challenge will probably be, 'Glad that's not me.'
The Challenge is completely unpredictable.
The show's scale means even producers are at the whim of fate, with games that are equal parts skill and chance, plus the impossible-to-predict social blocs that form when hundreds of strangers from across the globe live together.
This challenge is clearly intense.  (Supplied: Netflix)
That means heroes and villains who dominate screens will be eliminated mid-storyline. No matter their sob story, unresolved rivalry or sheer charm, there's no plot armour here (or, at least, not in the first five episodes of the series, with The Challenge dropping episodes in three bursts over the next month).
Who makes up our cast? There are the beefy British bros, who perhaps got lost on the way to Love Island; a former The New York Times editor in her 60s, playing alongside her geeky son; messy drama queens; a MENSA gamer; single mothers clawing for the chance to change their lives; handsome, eccentric Italians; and a handful of TikTok microcelebrities, too — not that the show mentions it.
The challenges are based on games from the original series. (Supplied: Netflix)
While the show's flashy challenges will draw viewers in, it's the interpersonal dramas that prove most fascinating. Survivor fans will know the merits of a good ""social game"": the ability to balance alliances and avoid detection as a powerful player, even while winning.
Watching masters at work is awe-inspiring (and a little scary). The only thing more captivating is the contestants way out of their depth.
Ultimately, where The Challenge might have the upper hand on Squid Game is its sheer chaos.
Even at his most bloody, we could watch the original with a safe assumption that hero #456 would make it out alive. The same can't be said for any of The Challenge's cast, with some of its most lovable characters already gone.
Squid Game loves cruelty, but letting a villain take home $4.56 million? That'd elevate The Challenge to true art.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-19/your-top-five-bluey-episodes-biggest-little-bluey-countdown/103078468,Hooray! These are the top five Bluey episodes as voted by you,"Believe it or not, our favourite blue heeler and her family have now been in our lives for five whole years! Bluey is a show that revels in love, family, friendship and nature, and has taken the world by storm.
To celebrate this huge milestone, as part of ABC's Bluey Fest, we asked you to vote for your favourite episode in the Biggest Little Bluey Countdown!
And biscuits! A lot of people had opinions — more than 50,000 votes came in!
So get your cheese and crackers ready, 'cos here's your top five.
Here come the Grannies! Gets me every time.
This is the first episode we meet Granny Rita (aka Bingo) and Granny Janet (aka Bluey), and didn't they leave us wanting more?!
Well, hello Rita and Janet. (Supplied: Ludo Studio)
This episode has so many laugh-out-loud moments — including Bingo and Bluey's granny impressions, with their one-liners and their shaky voices.
Then there's Bluey and Bingo's actual Nana learning to floss (the dance, not the teeth), which I'm pretty sure kicked off the flossing craze in Australia and beyond.
Grannies also shares wisdom in Bluey's trademark non-preachy way; this episode provides a sisterly love lesson on being aware of others' feelings.
This is one of the favourites of Bluey executive director Daley Pearson.
Bingo's big-girl adventure. (Supplied: Ludo Studio)
Pearson told ABC News Breakfast that all the teams involved in Sleepytime ""went above and beyond"".
""That episode has everyone's love and sweat,"" he said.
Sleepytime is the one where Bluey's little sister Bingo has her first go at having a big-girl sleep in her bed.
It's beautiful, cinematic and, like some other Bluey episodes, uses classical music.
Jupiter, from Gustav Holst's orchestral suite The Planets, supports Bingo's narrative as she travels into space, bravely seeking her independence.
Rolling Stone gave Sleepytime a shout-out in its Best TV Shows of 2020.
It said the episode was a ""four-hankie dazzler about the challenges, rewards, and costs of growing up"".
The Grannies returned, and my family lost it — with squeals of laughter.
We all need a Muffin in our life. (Supplied: Ludo Studio)
This time Bluey and Bingo's cousin Muffin come along for the ride as fan favourite Grouchy Granny.
In Granny Mobile, the Heeler family help their older and not-so-assertive neighbour Doreen to get the right price for items she is selling at a garage sale.
It is laugh-out-loud funny when Grouchy Granny Muffin meets real-life Grouchy Granny, and the two haggle over the cost of a granny mobile.
Baby Race was in the first series of Bluey, and features the magically wise line from Bluey and Bingo's mum Chilli: ""Run your own race"".
Baby Race reminds us not to compare ourselves to others and ""run your own race"". (Supplied: Ludo Studio)
As a parent, I loved this episode. It not only shows children that we all learn differently and at our own pace, but it also reminds parents not to compare their children to other kids — or themselves to other parents.
Sounds like a no-brainer, but not so easy when you are sleep-deprived, overthinking and over-analysing way too much as you navigate the ever-changing world of parenting.
There were only 5,800 votes separating this episode from the number-one spot.
But there can only be one winner …
***Drum roll please***
Cricket certainly struck a chord with Bluey fans far and wide.
There were lots of big feelings about this episode on social media, and plenty of articles that raved about its magical appeal.
The episode features a neighbourhood game of cricket, with young Rusty's story taking the lead.
Rusty lives and breathes cricket. He practises and perseveres and he steps up when his older brothers and mates don't take it easy on him.
Can anyone get Rusty out? (Supplied: Ludo Studio)
""What Australians love about themselves is everything in that episode,"" said Pearson on ABC News Breakfast.
""[It shows that] persistence will get you to a good place where you can achieve what your potential is, but it's also [about] fair play and being good to those around you.""
Rusty's dad, who is serving in the Australian Army (and is voiced by Blue Wiggle Anthony Field), sums up all the feels in this episode in a letter he sends home to the family — with a postscript to Rusty.
""As you grow up, you'll face harder things than a cricket ball, and you'll have two choices: Back away and get out, or step in front and play a pull shot,"" he writes.
""Just keep your eye on the ball and take care of your little sister for me.""

When Rusty eventually decides it is time to get out — he sets up a catch for his overjoyed younger sister — it's just beautiful!
Head of ABC Family & Children and executive producer of Bluey Libbie Doherty wasn't surprised about the number-one choice.
""Joe Brumm and the team at Ludo Studio have so perfectly captured the spirit of the game,"" she said.
""We hope all the backyard cricketers this summer give their younger siblings a catch, just like Rusty.""
You can watch the 100 to 1 countdown on the Bluey Fest live stream and Bluey Series 1 to 3  on ABC iview.
And hooray! There is more Bluey coming in 2024, including the longest episode yet — it's 28 minutes long and called The Sign.",Allison Jess,Sun 19 Nov 2023,0

There's no secret lair or identity and his weapon of choice is a pen, rather than a sword.
From his suburban home in Bundaberg, 400 kilometres north of Brisbane, Foley, 66, brings The Phantom comic character to life by illustrating both covers and comic sequences.
The retired paramedic began drawing The Phantom in 2016 and has now completed more than 500 pages of stories.
Shane Foley traded in his paramedic uniform to draw the original costumed crusader. (

            )
""I began reading The Phantom when I was about nine. It was the first comic I ever knew,"" Foley said.
""I found it under a seat in a caravan on a family holiday in Victoria, and I think a lightbulb went off when I saw that.
""I have loved comic book-style storytelling ever since.""
It was a passion that never left Foley and he would regularly peruse the newsagent stands.
Shane Foley has been illustrating The Phantom since 2016.  (
               ABC News: Johanna Marie
            )
""One day I picked a comic up and its cover was fairly awful,"" he said.
""It was clearly a panel from inside the story that was just blown up on a photocopier,"" Foley said.
He recreated that Phantom cover and sent it to the publishers, asking if they would like him to illustrate for them.
""They sent me a PDF of the story, and it was still in Swedish,"" he said.
""I couldn't read it, but I picked an image and did a cover, and very soon I did some more covers.""

               ABC News: Johanna Marie
            )
While he does get asked for his autograph from fans in the know, Foley said becoming a comic book illustrator was less about skill and more about practice.
""The artists of comics, believe it or not, are relatively ordinary people,"" he said.
The Phantom was first published by Lee Falk in 1936.
It became the longest-running comic-book character in the world, with almost 2,000 books published in Australia.
The Phantom is also known for being the first costumed superhero.
Foley has illustrated 11 Phantom covers in his seven years drawing the character. (
               ABC News: Johanna Marie
            )
""He's sort of like the bridge between Batman and Superman, which are generally thought of as the first,"" Foley said.
Saving lives is something Mr Foley shares with the character he creates.
Instead of a mask and costume, Foley would put on his Queensland Ambulance Service uniform.
When he began drawing for The Phantom, Foley stepped back from his work as a paramedic to become a patient transport officer. He then cut back to part-time work before officially retiring 12 months ago.
""At one stage I was getting up really early to do a couple of hours of [illustrating] work before I would go to work,"" Foley said.
""That worked really well for a long time, but now I'm very happy that I can put most of my working hours into drawing.""
Foley said The Phantom had barely changed since the early days of the comic strip, resisting the modernisation and upgrades given to other, more populist superheroes.
Shane Foley prefers to draw The Phantom the ""old-school"" way — with pen and paper. (
               ABC News: Johanna Marie
            )
Mirroring the character he creates, Foley also hasn't changed his technique in the digital age, preferring to keep his illustrations ""old school"".
""I use the old way of paper, drawing it in pencil, inking it with a brush and a pen,"" Foley said.
While he has recently started using a computer for the lettering and colouring, he has no intention of moving away from his pen-and-paper style.
""I remember being asked by somebody after I did a cover, if there was a paper copy of it, because a lot of people work digitally and there is no original artwork,"" he said.
Foley has been illustrating The Phantom since 2016.  (
               ABC News: Johanna Marie
            )
""I've had 11 covers published and I've kept the original art for all of them.""
Foley is just one of many people who continue to contribute to the legacy of The Phantom.
His work is  being showcased for the first time in an art exhibition, Phantom: Off The Drawing Board, at the Bundaberg Regional Art Gallery.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-18/pantless-women-dresses-absurd-fashion-trends-escape-grim-world/103118606,Visible underpants are in on the catwalk – and fashion is safe and well,"I think a lot of women look great wearing no pants.
I saw them all strutting by the Seine in their designer knickers and heels during the recent Paris Fashion Week, an oversize cashmere jacket thrown on top. They looked wild: like half-undressed Barbies, mildly amused at the stunt they were pulling, glowering at the mortals beneath them.
If you've got the legs, the confidence — if the breeze doesn't bother you and if you don't plan to take public transport — then go for it, I say.
The knickers they were wearing are turning up in boutiques now, and they're priced around the same as an extra-large air-fryer. Only time and multiple use will tell which is the better buy.
Yes, I'm as porous as anyone else when it comes to fashion trends. Like a Handmaid in an Attwood novel, I've been born and groomed into it. Skinny jeans and two-inch zip flies? Hell yes — right up to the moment I abandon them in favour of the wide-leg jeans I staggered around in during my teens.
So, don't roll your eyes when I tell you that while a girlfriend and I laugh ourselves sick about those now starting to turn up to events pant-less but in designer undies, I predict that by summer we'll be sending each other hasty selfies from clothing store changerooms asking, ""Can I get away with this?""
Another friend has been texting me for months about the absurdity of dresses with bits cut out of the waist; now, like a starving prisoner in a cell full of rats, she says they're starting to look good.
I came of fashion age when the Women's Weekly had a section called ""What people are wearing overseas"" and Myer had a women's clothing section called ""Better Dresses"". The concept of aspiration, a fashion hierarchy and a summit to climb was hardwired into me.
My first great fashion odyssey was an early Saturday morning train and bus trip from Nunawading to Lygon Street Carlton as a teenager to track down the Merivale pit suit I'd stumbled over in a hand-me-down POL magazine from the neighbour next door.
It was a stunning silk patterned jump suit, with contrasting collar and cuffs and I could never afford it. But I scraped together all I could in the hope of lay-buying this extraordinary thing that was going to be the chrysalis that would transform me.
When the jump suit I coveted was finally mine, I felt like I could date David Bowie wearing it. (Reuters: Dylan Martinez)
I was so eager in my mission that the store hadn't yet opened when I arrived. The sales assistant, a bit bewildered at the sight of this suburban teenage fashion victim, had to tell me that they didn't stock it — but I found another one there and put that away instead.
It took me months to pay off, but when it was mine, I felt like I could date David Bowie wearing it. I still wish, years later, that I hadn't given it away.
I know I have spent a fortune on clothes since, and I know some in my life shake their head at my devoted veneration of the fashion gods in my personal pantheon: Alexander McQueen, Albert Elbaz, Tom Ford, Martin Grant, Maria Grazia Chiuri.
Is there something wrong with me? What a question — how dare you? Go ask your mother that, as she turns this way and that in front of the mirror trying to find the one outfit for that socially-fraught occasion that will be like personal armour against the complexities of the day.
If only Carla Zampatti was still with us: she knew the battles we had to fight, and fashion Kevlar never looked as stylish as hers.
Fashion truth-teller and fellow fashion lover, the performer Celeste Barber, is about to present The Way We Wore on ABC TV and I'm with her as she asks: If fashion is so deep inside so many of us, then why is it so often dismissed as shallow?
Like Barber, I've spent enough time around the designers, the manufacturers, the sewers, the marketers and exporters (not to mention the Australian woolgrowers in whose industry I've had a minor specialty since my junior days as a business reporter) to know how serious a business this is.
Families, livelihoods economies and whole communities have relied on our design and technology smarts: where it gets fascinating is how and why we have fallen for their sometimes-nefarious psychological games.
First Look | The Way We Wore with Celeste Barber
But can we be blunt for a moment? Do you really think that culture is the sole creation of scores of shrewd Donatella Versaces and their impossibly narrow dresses, or Insta-nobodies and their carefully curated self-delusion?
Let me take you to the walls of the temples in the Nile Delta and show you the rituals and aspirations of ancient Egyptian women (and men) and their addiction to adornment, decoration, tiny waists, and a whole lot of eye-liner.
I can show you the staggering self-indulgence and self-decoration of the Romans who could afford the finer things, and the near-torture of 18th century undergarments for women in search of a vanishing curvature.
Today it's visible underpants; once it was chest bandages for a silhouette of pure androgyny. What's the difference?
The ancient history of adornment, as well as the unassailable psychological truths of ego and self-esteem, can tell us something lasting about the persistence of fashion and our vulnerability to its excesses and stupidity — nothing new there.
I'm always amused by the anger these fashion waves create: the pearl-clutching horror when crop-tops and mini-skirts come surging back.
Does all this seem offensively trivial during a cost-of-living crisis? Not at all: ask any economic historian about the endurance of the affordable treat — the new lipstick, a small scarf — as women and men make their joyless list of bills and costs and as more expensive pleasures are crossed off.
I think that's why I find the more absurd fashion developments so beguiling: it is their very absurdity, and the alternative reality they promise, that is the appeal when all else is grim.
Fashion becomes true costume, and costume means play, and performance and tapping out a new story on a different stage. And that sounds like a blessed escape right now.
This weekend recovered treasures, restored towns, and re-booted franchises. Recycling at its best.
Have a safe and happy weekend, and as AusMusic month rolls on, and after the fun of the Arias, it's time for these guys again. I love DMA's – that combination of sweet and crunchy – and their Best Group win was so well-deserved. This is from their latest album, and it's a jangly bit of joy.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-17/normal-gossip-podcast-kelsey-mckinney-alex-sujong-loughlin/103113422,Listeners of cult podcast Normal Gossip think they know who it's about but 'so far no-one's ever been right',"Kelsey McKinney was so bored in the early years of the pandemic.
As she and everyone else on the planet was going out less, she was hearing far less gossip.
And gossip was — is, to this day — her ""only interest"".
""So I tweeted that somebody should give me a podcast called Normal Gossip, where I would just find gossip stories and tell them back to people,"" she tells Beverley Wang on ABC RN's Stop Everything!
The Philadelphia-based writer and author got such an enthusiastic response that she pitched her idea to a slew of podcast production companies. None of them wanted it.
But fellow writer and editor Alex Sujong Laughlin believed in Kelsey's idea. She came on board as co-creator and producer and, together, the pair started recording Normal Gossip independently in 2022.
""And ever since then we've just been harvesting gossip from the lands,"" Kelsey says of their origin story.
That gossip has included captivating tales from people about things like family drama at Disney World caused by a mistaken group text, a love triangle at a farmer's market and lies spread on a local dog owners' Facebook group.
A guest is brought on each episode to share their perspective on gossip generally, hear the listener-submitted tale and weigh in on stranger's conundrums with abandon.
The world (and particularly Australia, apparently) is hooked. Normal Gossip now has five seasons, with two million downloads a month, and 56k Instagram followers. They even took the podcast on a live tour across the US earlier this year.
To Alex and Kelsey, it isn't gossip about celebrities, anyone with any sort of public profile or anyone they know personally.
And the stakes, Kelsey says, ""Can never be too high.""
""We also don't like to do infidelity stories because there tends to not be that much moral ambiguity and that's a thing we look for — stories that don't have a clear 'good guy' or 'bad guy',"" Alex continues.
""Because what we want is to have listeners debating who's in the right. That's part of the experience of gossiping as well.""
Once they've cobbled the entire story together through a series of interviews and fact checking, they scrub it of as many identifying details as possible to protect the people at the centre of it.
""We change all names, we often change genders [and] the relationships people have with each other… [anything and everything that doesn't] affect the truth of the story, because the truth of the story is the emotional truth,"" Alex explains.
""We jokingly and lovingly refer to our listeners as our 'girlies', and that is because every survey we have seen has shown us that the majority, by far, of our listeners are women between the ages of 18 and 28,"" Kelsey continues.
""A disproportionate number of whom are Australian listeners!"" Alex adds.
To Kelsey, Normal Gossip's audience skews so young and femme because this is the demographic who are ""maligned for gossiping"" in real life.
""Normal Gossip is an outlet for them they can take and use and feel good about,"" she says.
Kelsey sees the practice of gossip as something we need, for myriad reasons.
There's no doubt gossip is a guilty pleasure for many of us, but should we let go of the 'guilty' part, and lean into the pleasure?
""The first is that it's evolutionary,"" she says.
""We learned to gossip as a species so we could tell each other if there was danger or food ahead, or any kind of information that [we] might need.
""[And] it feels connective because you use gossip as a way to indicate trust with someone else. If I'm willing to tell you gossip about my life, [it means] I'm willing to entrust you with information or vice versa.""
Alex adds: ""I think there are few ways to create a sense of congeniality with somebody that you don't know that well, other than to say, 'Did you know that the owner of this coffee shop has been going through a really nasty divorce?'""
""And I think a lot of gossip is test-driving values and value judgements with somebody. So, if you're saying something about somebody and you're saying [it] in a kind of judgemental way and they agree with you, you know you're aligned on these values.""
Unsurprisingly, Normal Gossip's many would-be detective followers have jumped at the chance to undo the anonymity of it all.
""And so we told them, 'We're trusting you to treat this like a story and not treat it like an FBI search',"" Kelsey says.
""We really don't want this to be a platform for doxxing people … the point is that it's fun and an escape from the awfulness of the internet,"" Alex agrees.
But Kelsey and Alex have an agreement that if it ever gets to a point where their audience continues to disregard the podcast's values, they'll just pull the plug.
""We also get a lot of emails from people who are convinced they know who the gossip story is about and, so far at least, no-one has ever been right.
""Which is kind of a fascinating problem — and also one that makes you very scared about the tenor of behaviour of people in the world,"" Kelsey continues.
""Because if you're listening to one of these stories and saying, 'This is my group of friends', and I know for a fact that it's not … how many people are going on 25-person bachelorette trips to Europe?""
Quotes lightly edited for clarity and brevity.

The collection was assembled by a French collector who initially hoped to open a museum celebrating the musician but later scrapped the plan, according to RR Auction of Boston, which is overseeing the online sale.
The collector had reached out to individuals who worked closely with Prince to gather the items, believing that the trendsetting artist, who died in 2016, was not only a musical virtuoso but also a fashion icon, according to the auction house.
One of the highlights of the auction is a white ruffled shirt worn by Prince during his 1985 American Music Awards performance of the song Purple Rain.

The auction house estimated its value at $US15,000 ($23,500).
The auction traces Prince's evolution in music and fashion from his Purple Rain era through to his death, according to Bobby Livingston of RR Auction.
""What this auction really does is it shows the influence and legacy of Prince with his fashion choices and how it relates today, when you see all these artists on tour, you know, different costumes, different outfits, reinventing themselves for each tour,"" he said.

In addition to fashion, this auction includes original Polaroid photographs, master tapes of hit albums, and official documentation about his films and music videos.

Slap! jingle, I am Australian, Sherbet's Howzat named Sounds of Australia","The nostalgic jingle Slip! Slop! Slap! is credited for changing Australian attitudes towards sun safety, and now the earworm is being recognised for its cultural significance.
The well-known 1980s animated television advert featuring Sid the seagull slipping on a T-shirt, slopping on sunscreen, and slapping on a hat, became one of Australia's most successful health campaigns.
The jingle — written by Phillip Adams and composed by Peter Best for Cancer Council Victoria – has now been added to the National Film and Sound Archive's (NFSA) Sounds of Australia registry.
Slip Slop Slap jingle, 1981
Each year, the NFSA selects 10 recordings — from hundreds of public nominations — that have informed or reflected life in Australia to add to its collection. They include popular music, advertising themes, spoken word and radio broadcasts that are Australian and more than 10 years old.
This year 11 sounds — spanning 96 years — have been added, instead of the usual 10, after there was a tie for 10th place from the voting panel of audio and industry experts.
I am Australian, 1997
One of Australia's most recognisable patriotic songs, I am Australian — also known as We are Australian — makes the list with the 1997 cover version featuring Judith Durham, Russel Hitchcock and Mandawuy Yunupingu.
Written in 1987 by Bruce Woodley and Dobe Newton, the lyrics feature many references to Australian and First Nations history, environment, and culture — from red soil plains to Albert Namatjira.
It's regularly rolled out as an anthem at national sporting events, and has featured in branding and advertising for the 1999 republic referendum, Telstra and even the ABC.
Sherbet's 1976 hit synonymous with Australian cricket Howzat, the Loved Ones' eponymous rock song, and Robyn Archer's 1977 feminist blues anthem Menstruation Blues have also made the list.
Howzat by Sherbet
""This is perhaps one of Robyn Archer's most well-known or iconic songs. It comes from her first album and it's one that's been on her repertoire ever since,"" Mr Henderson said.
""It was actually the first album produced entirely by woman, so it really is deserving.
""It raises a lot of issues which were taboo then and possibly even taboo now in terms of Australian sound recordings.""
Menstruation Blues, 1977
The newest sound in this year's inclusions is the 2012 Aria award-winning album Concerto of the Greater Sea by the oud virtuoso Joseph Tawadros, while the oldest is a 1927 recording of Verdi's Anvil Chorus performed by pioneering harmonica player PC Spouse.
Percival Claude (PC) Spouse was Australia's most successful harmonica player from the 1920s to the 1940s. (Supplied: NFSA)
""Percy Spouse was a champion harmonica player and also had a very significant sound-recording career.""
Other inductees this year include actress and operetta star Nellie Stewart's Sweet Nell of Old Drury and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander singer Wilma Reading's I Only Came To Say Goodbye.
Wilma Reading spent most of her singing career overseas, with little fame or recognition back in Australia.  (Supplied: NFSA)
""Wilma Reading was perhaps much better known internationally. She had this amazing career after releasing a few recordings in Sydney in the early 1960s,"" Mr Henderson said.
""Her career took her overseas with Duke Ellington, touring behind the Iron Curtain in the 1970s in the Soviet Union right through to performing at the reunification of Germany.
""She had an amazing international career. She's from Cairns and is still in Cairns at the moment.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-14/lin-manuel-miranda-advice-mentor-stephen-sondheim/103043086,Writer of musical hit Hamilton shares the advice that powered 'three years of writing',"Lin-Manuel Miranda first crossed paths with Stephen Sondheim during the revival of one of the biggest musicals in history.
Miranda had been brought in to do Spanish translations of Sondheim's West Side Story lyrics.
""He said, 'What else are you working on?' He was more interested in that than West Side Story,"" Miranda recalls.
At that point, Miranda was in the process of writing what would become his record-breaking show Hamilton.
""I'll never forget, he threw back his head, he went, 'That is fantastic. No one will expect that from you. That's great. That's exactly what you should be doing,"" Miranda told Take 5 with Zan Rowe.
Those three years also cemented a friendship between the pair, with Miranda taking Sondheim at his word and sending him songs for feedback as he went.
It led to a single word of advice from Sondheim that Miranda still keeps front of mind.
""He would always write back, 'Variety. Variety,'"" Miranda said.
""Surprise is the one thing; every eight bars change up what's happening underneath the music. Change it.
""That was the biggest lesson he taught me.""
Icons in music and screen join Double J host Zan Rowe to delve deep into intimate moments in their lives as they share five songs they love.
Miranda said he knew he wasn't the only artist to have benefited from Sondheim's guidance and shared how hard his death had been in 2021.
""He leaves us two enormous legacies — he leaves us the eclecticness and mastery of his work, all these musicals, every single one, a completely different work unto itself,"" Miranda said.
""I'm one of thousands of artists he encouraged personally. His encouragement is [also] ... a legacy as the work itself.""
When it comes to the legacy Miranda plans to leave, his goal is to be ""well remembered by the people I love and who loved me and who I knew"".
Lin-Manuel Miranda says he was one of many artists mentored by Sondheim. (ABC: Take 5 with Zan Rowe)
After working by himself to craft the songs and story for Hamilton, Miranda's preference now is to seek out and tap into the expertise of others.
He said it had been ""staggering"" and ""really humbling"" to collaborate with composer Alan Menken, who wrote the music for a wide array of Disney's animated classics.
They worked together on the live-action remake of Disney's The Little Mermaid — a movie whose music had felt revolutionary when he was a kid watching on in the 1990s.
""Time has taken away how weirdly contemporary that song felt. That was a pop song.
""I just remember the thrill of that, so when I'm writing those moments for Encanto or Moana, I'm chasing that. I want kids to feel the way I felt in 1989 under the water.""
Miranda says he wants to write songs that thrill kids as much as hearing Under The Sea thrilled him.
It's safe to say Miranda has successfully recreated those feelings, with children and adults enthralled by the songs he has created for the screen — including the ones even he didn't expect to land.
""I was the most surprised by anybody that We Don't Talk About Bruno was the biggest hit to come out of the Encanto soundtrack,"" Miranda said.
""It is the most specific song in that score. Yet, I think that that's why it resonated with people.
""I think we all have those stories in our families that are like … 'We can't talk about that in front of Mum', or 'We can't talk about that in front of your brother.'""
Miranda also shared he didn't find out the song was gaining momentum through any of the usual channels.
""Really, my son was the town crier,"" Miranda recalled.
""He's the one who told me, 'Daddy, everyone in school is singing it. It's crazy.'
""He went from being freaked out … to being really proud pretty quickly.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/backstory/2023-11-13/celeste-barber-fashion-moments-nel-minchin-the-way-we-wore/103061628,Celeste Barber on Australia's 'uncomfortable' fashion moment,"Comedian Celeste Barber is no stranger to the absurdities of the fashion industry, but even she was taken aback to learn the extent to which some clothes – and the women who wore them – were policed in our nation’s past.
As the presenter of ABC TV's upcoming documentary, The Way We Wore, Barber steers the audience through Australia’s fashion story, exploring its social and cultural significance over the decades.
It includes moments of celebration, and, as Barber discovered, moments that are truly confronting.
One scene that left her jaw to the floor was vision of ""beach inspectors"" — volunteers whose job was to enforce modesty rules — physically removing women from beaches for wearing swimmers that were too revealing.
""That for sure made me really uncomfortable,"" Barber says.
The newspaper article goes on to say the inspectors made six girls adjust their shoulder straps on their swimmers. (Mirror newspaper)
Another related event that stood out was a gathering of the inspectors — all men — to critique and give feedback on the modesty of women's bikinis as they were modelled in front of them.
""Some people [on set] were like laughing, uncomfortable laughing, but oh my God,"" Barber says.
""I understand this is something that happened in history but I still feel very uncomfortable watching it.
Celeste Barber was taken aback by the way women's bodies were policed. (ABC: Mark Rogers)
The vision was also hard to stomach for writer, producer and director Nel Minchin, who shared her own surprising, and troubling, discovery from Australia’s fashion past: an ad demonising women’s ""thigh bulge"" from wearing shorts, and the latest clothing to fix it.
""You know what that's made me do, it's literally made me wear bike pants and look at my 'ugly thigh bulge' and just be like 'F**k that ad',"" Minchin says.
While exploring Australia’s past, Barber and Minchin are challenging viewers to ask themselves why, despite its social, cultural and economic influence, fashion is often considered shallow.
Minchin admits that even she, when approached to work on the documentary, was initially caught up in that narrative of fashion being something superficial.
""Initially, I was like, 'Ah, do I want to do that fluffy thing?',"" she says.
""Partly that comes from my own stuff where I [think] in my 20s people thought I was fluffy, and now I feel like I've got to a point where people go 'Oh actually she can tackle quite big subjects'.""
Minchin's directing credits include documentaries on the history of Bangarra Dance Threatre, sporting icon Steve Waugh, and rugby player Israel Folau.

Minchin says she grappled with an “internal monologue” as she considered the project.
""It's like a totally sexist response on my behalf, 'fashion's not fluffy, why are you even questioning this?'"" she says.
""Obviously, you don't want to make it too earnest because it is amazing and Celeste is inspiring. You want all that, you want to have a rollicking time.
""But just because it's fun doesn't mean there's not actually really big insights into our politics and systemic racism and systemic sexism.""

Minchin says after her initial hesitation, she set out to make the series with two things in mind.
The first was to explore the personal stories and memories of the show's guests, which include industry heavy-hitters, academics, designers and models.
""Fashion can be quite an exclusive and elite world, and it's really nice to break that down,"" she says.
The Way We Wore uncovers the cultural and historical significance of fashion, revealing how the clothes we wear can give intimate and surprising insights into how the country has evolved.
Audiences can expect Minchin to pull back the curtain on the industry, including filming snippets not usually shared with audiences.
""That was a very deliberate choice, to make sure it wasn't just the facade or the on-screen persona of fashion, that we were actually showing people as they were getting made up, as they were sitting down.""
Minchin’s second priority was to seek out the stories of people and communities that have, for the most part, had their contribution to our fashion history glossed over.
""I think the absence of stories or uncovering the absence of stories is as important as the ones that we see,"" Minchin says.
""Why was there such a multicultural environment in the 1800s, with Afghan cameleers, a large Chinese population, African people on our first ships, [but] … the English fashion, you know, prevail?
""Obviously, that's like a clue as to who was in power and why.
""If you actually do spend the time to look for [those stories], then they're there, and we've just got to start telling them more.""
The importance of diversity when we talk about fashion isn't lost on Barber either.
Anyone familiar with her Instagram account will know that at the heart of her videos is a challenge to the fashion industry to do better when it comes to inclusivity.
""Having done the documentary, it's like 'Oh, we really have come a long way', but my God we've been through a lot to get here',"" she says.
Now keenly aware of the struggles of the past, Barber says her personal wish is that the industry's progress doesn't stall.
""I think about body inclusivity for me and representation for minority groups, and not just going back to one type of person on a runway, or one type of person that fits into clothing,"" she says.
""It would be nice for that not to make headline news when there's someone [on the runway] who's over a size zero.""

But for people under 25, most content is now being watched on the small vertical screen of a phone.
Filmmakers are trying to keep pace with younger audiences, increasingly turning to platforms like TikTok and Instagram to tell their stories.
An upcoming horror-drama series – Greystanes — will be released exclusively on TikTok in one-minute episodes.
Matt Ferro and Ryan Cauchi directors of Greystanes say TikTok is a way to keep track with a younger audience (ABC News: Adam Griffiths)
""You have to hook an audience early online and not allow that slow burn and traditional build-up for horror that would then deliver a scare,"" Greystanes writer and producer Matt Ferro said.
""We went for the throat right from the beginning to show people a taste of what they have in store in future episodes.""
Ferro was a producer on blockbusters like The Matrix (1999) and Happy Feet (2006) and said filmmaking for TikTok had brought a whole new set of challenges.
""That excludes the desirability of certain wide shots that would be traditionally used to show a landscape or a panorama.""
Greystanes is set in the 1990s in the Western Sydney suburb of the same name.
Two children visit their grandmother's house where they uncover a host of dark family secrets rooted in terrifying stories from Maltese folklore.
Australia has the largest Maltese diaspora in the world – about 200,000 people, according to the 2021 Census.
But their their culture had rarely been reflected in films and on TV.

""Being a Maltese-Australian, I had never seen a Maltese person in a scripted series before,"" Greystanes writer and director Ryan Cauchi said.
""I've also never seen any of the unique monsters or superstitions from Maltese folklore depicted on screen.""
For Cauchi, Malta is represented by idyllic Mediterranean beaches and delicious pastizzi.
The culture, he said, has a darker side — with popular tales about child-hunting demons and tunnel-dwelling beasts.
""One of the key images of Maltese mythology is the idea of another world — of alternate timelines and multiple dimensions,"" Cauchi said.
""Each of these cavernous realms have their own race of nightmarish monsters and beasties.
""Through portals and holes, these creatures are able to traverse through these realms.""
AACTA-nominated actor, Frances Duca, is hoping the series she appears in will help share her culture with wider audiences.
""It's exciting to be able to be in a series on a platform that will deliver that.""

Greystanes was co-funded by Screen Australia, TikTok and NZ On Air, through their Every Voice initiative.
Head of online at Screen Australia, Lee Naimo said vertical videos on TikTok, and Instagram will be a significant part of the film industry's future.
""Traditionally, we've seen short film as a real pathway into feature filmmaking. The reality is that that opportunity and that pathway has narrowed,"" Mr Naimo said.
Screen Australia funded 15 TikTok series over the past two years through its Every Voice project.
Rather than taking over the industry, Mr Naimo said vertical video projects are likely to exist alongside traditional film and TV.
""Audiences still want to see projects on the big screen,"" he said.

""They want to see great content on their TV screens, on devices, and on mobile phones. I think it's just about that ecosystem of supporting Australian creators at every level.""
Screen Australia said monetising content on TikTok is difficult.
Filmmakers like Ferro and Cauchi are optimistic that the platform and the industry will adapt.
""We asked the same question about musicians and streaming services,"" Ferro said.
""Although it might not be clear how to monetise everything yet, as TikTok develops and more and more people rely on it for more substantive content besides just funny videos … that monetisation will find itself.""

The Liverpool band made history as the act with the longest gap between its first and last No.1 singles.
Billed as the last Beatles song, Now And Then features the voice of late member John Lennon and was developed using artificial intelligence.
It also features parts recorded by surviving members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr as well as the late George Harrison.
The group's 18th UK No.1 hit, it brings The Beatles back to the top of the Official UK Singles Chart 60 years after the group's first No.1 single From Me to You.
The feat also extends The Beatles' record as the British act with the most UK No.1 singles in official charts history.
""It's mind boggling. It's blown my socks off,"" McCartney said in a statement.
The song is the fastest-selling single of the year to date in Britain, with 48,600 physical and download sales based on its first seven days, the Official Charts Company said.
YouTube: Now and Then
It is also the fastest-selling vinyl single of the century so far in Britain, with more than 19,400 copies sold on vinyl, and the most-streamed Beatles track in one week, with 5.03 million streams, it added.
On the eve of the release of The Beatles' final ever song, a new documentary sheds light on the process of making it.
The group is also the act with the longest gap between No.1 singles — 54 years — and the oldest band to score a UK No.1 single, the Official Charts Company said.
McCartney is 81 while Starr is 83.
""Beatlemania has returned this week,"" Official Charts Company chief executive officer Martin Talbot said.
""The return of John, Paul, George and Ringo with the last ever Beatles single … has cemented their legend by breaking a catalogue of records — and in doing so underlined the extraordinary scope of their enduring appeal, across all the generations.""",Unknown,Sat 11 Nov 2023,0

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-10/ncis-sydney-uses-its-homegrown-crew/103088122,Homegrown crew highlights the best of the Harbour City in NCIS: Sydney,"Born and raised in Sydney, Sara Richardson's intimate knowledge of the city she calls home has come in handy since Endemol Shine Australia added NCIS: Sydney to its slate.
As the head of scripted, Richardson is an executive producer on the new show which showcases Sydney at its picturesque best.
Richardson's in-depth knowledge of her hometown was a vital resource to develop a unique character for the new wing of the franchise.
""When Paramount+ and Channel 10 first approached us about creating NCIS: Sydney, we looked at the other franchises,"" Richardson said.
""And the point of difference with all the franchises is their location. So, you have NCIS, the original, then you have the NCIS that's based in LA and NCIS New Orleans and then Hawaii.
""And when you look at each of the franchises, you realise that the location itself, it brings a flavour to the series and its own point of difference.""
From Bondi Beach to The Rocks, Sydney's beauty is put on display in the new series. (Supplied: Paramount+)
It's the first time the franchise has travelled outside the US with the plot centred on rising international tensions in the Indo-Pacific.
It prompts the US NCIS agents and the Australian Federal Police to form a multi-national taskforce and carry out high-stakes investigations.
Headquartered at Walsh Bay, the NCIS: Sydney series darts across numerous city locations. From Maroubra to North Head to Bondi Beach, each location is woven into the show's storyline.
An episode set at The Rocks, for example, begins with a ghost tour.
An episode set at Malabar Ocean Pool opens with a swimming lesson. And a visit to the Bob Hawke Beer and Leisure Centre in Marrickville is an opportunity for the Americans to learn a thing or two about Australia's 23rd prime minister.
""I hope Sydneysiders will enjoy going on the journey with us and, finding spots around the corner from their houses or pubs they've visited. There's a few of those,"" Richardson said.
""I hope they enjoy Sydney as a character as much as we did.""
And it isn't just the urban parts of Sydney that get a look in.
""I think that people outside of Sydney don't realise how many incredible bushland areas we have as well,"" Richardson said.
""So, Church Point is a really good example of that where we open an episode on a river with fishing, and it's completely out in the bush and you'll notice that's where you get a lot of the wildlife jokes from on that particular episode.""

Australia's natural habitat and wildlife, which can be intimidating to tourists, is played up.
From taipans to a harmless but scathing galah which mimics its owner's speech.
But with the magic of television, some locations are not what they seem, with filming taking place in a different locale to what's being portrayed at times.
""We really tried to avoid that,"" Richardson said.
""But there are a few instances which I'm hoping Sydneysiders will forgive us for.""
There's one location in particular they've purposely been vague about naming.
""Anyone who's been to Clontarf knows that beautiful cafe down on the harbour there.
""And so, we had to cheat the geography a little bit with Pyrmont, which any Sydneysider will know, that's not quite walking distance,"" she laughed.
There's a lot of Sydney you don't see in this series such as Auburn in the city's west or Cabramatta, south-west of the city, both places which would turn up some interesting storylines.
But Richardson is hoping for the chance to bring in other parts of the city.
""We only had eight episodes and we really did make sure each episode felt unique, not only in storyline, but in location,"" she said.
""So hopefully, if we ever get to go again, fingers crossed, we will get to explore those different areas.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-09/nightcore-music-trend-tiktok/103077116,How a Norwegian school project turned into a TikTok trend that is changing the way new music is released,"If you spend any time on TikTok, you've probably heard snippets of songs that sound like an alien consuming helium. This is called ""nightcore"" music and it's only getting more popular.
Nightcore is also known simply as sped-up music and, you guessed it, refers to music that is sped up — by 35 per cent or so, giving it the appearance of playing a 33⅓-RPM vinyl record at 45 RPM.
And it all started with a Norwegian school project way back in 2002.
Back in those hazy days of the early naughties, Thomas S. Nilsen and Steffen Ojala Soderholm started playing around with song tempo.
According to a New York Times interview, their school project involved them remixing other people's songs by changing the tempo, resulting in a much lighter tone.
They called it cheerful hardcore music — because they remixed sad or heavier songs to make them pleasant — and they called their DJ duo Nightcore.

Even thought their side-hustle wrapped up not long after, speeding up songs took off in 2009, after an Amsterdam software developer called Maikel631 posted some of the duo's tunes from LimeWire to Youtube. As enthusiasm grew, other people started to make their own ""nightcore"" music.
The DJ pair stumbled upon the scene in 2011 and were astonished and proud that their project had now influenced so many other remixes.
Vanessa Thaler, social media manager at a digital marketing agency in Sydney, says it offers something new.
""It's a great way to grab somebody's attention because you get immediately sucked in,"" she says.
""And [you] don't have the time to think about it.""
TikTok is all about pace — the most popular videos are usually short and fast, with users swiping rapid-fire through them.
That might be why fast-paced music seems to suit the platform so well.
The hashtag #spedupsongs has 11.2 billion views on TikTok and #speedupsongs has 12.9 billion.
New releases have been given a boost, with sped up versions of songs like Greedy by Tate McRae, IT GIRL by Aliyah's Interlude and Strangers by Kenya Grace dominating TikTok's playlists and trends.
Antonia Gauci, a Sydney-based engineer, mixer, producer and artist says it's helped songs reach new audiences.
""People ask for the name of a sped up song and look for the original version and then it will get millions of streams on Spotify,"" she says.
""That money goes back into the pockets of the artists, which is fantastic.""
And it's helping boost older or forgotten songs, too.
A couple of months ago, TikTok users may have had the refrain ""I wanna dance dance dance with my hands hands hands…"" on a loop in their heads.
It comes from the 2011 song Bloody Mary by Lady Gaga, which never hit the charts when it was originally released.
But when people started to emulate the unique dance style of Wednesday (as seen on the Netflix Addams-Family spin-off) to a sped up version of the song, it hit the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time.
The dance was actually set to an entirely different song in the show (Goo Goo Muck by The Cramps), but Netflix didn't care and happily jumped on the bandwagon, using Gaga's sped up song to announce that the show would return for a second season.
Promiscuous by Nelly Furtado (2006), Obsessed by Mariah Carey (2009) and The Boy Is Mine by Brandy and Monica (1998!) have also been repopularised on TikTok through nightcore versions of the songs.
""It's a wonderful thing because the music is getting recognition,"" says Hannah Balanay, an Australian TikTok creator and dancer with 18 million followers.
Nightcore has not escaped the attention of musicians, and many have capitalised on the trends themselves, re-recording or re-releasing tracks that have been popular on TikTok.
Summer Walker re-released her 2018 mixtape Last Day of Summer with all the songs sped up.
Steve Lacy's song Bad Habit debuted at the end of June in 2022. He released the sped up version at the end of September, and the track climbed to number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in October after receiving TikTok exposure. After 15 weeks, the song became the fourth longest-running number 1 song in Billboard Hot 100 history.
And giving early 2000s flashbacks, musicians like Doja Cat are releasing singles with multiple versions of the original.

Whether or not you're into the chipmunk-having-a-heart-attack vibe, it's obvious the Norwegians were onto something all those years ago: speeding up music has transformed how people enjoy their favourite songs.
And as the trends change quickly, each new song variation creates a memorable impression for fans.

But, when the calls went unanswered, G decided to go it alone.
""I made the decision, 'Well, that's not going to stop me, I'm going to learn how to produce myself',"" they told Take 5 with Zan Rowe.
""I gave myself a year to write as many songs as I could, and then I made a shortlist of about 10, and on that list was nearly all the songs on my first album.""
The next step — catching the attention of a music label — involved thinking outside the box.
""I got about 20,000 followers from drumming every day in that year, and then … I switched out the handle to G Flip [and] started posting singing content.
""I knew people in the music industry would be like, 'Oh, 20,000 followers, better give the music a listen'.
""I wanted to go at it so hard that if it didn't work, I could die knowing I tried really hard, I did everything that I could to try and make this be my life.""
Their tenacity paid off.

In 2018, G landed a record deal which kickstarted a career that has seen them tour the world and release two albums, the second of which debuted at number one on the ARIA charts this year.
They've also been nominated for six ARIA awards, including Album Of The Year and Best Solo Artist.
Professional success isn't the only thing bringing happiness to G's life at the moment, either.
Since the middle of 2022, they've been in a relationship with US reality TV star Chrishell Stause. The pair married earlier this year.
""I just feel very happy. We have a really great relationship and I really feel like I've found someone who's my person and we do life really well together,"" G said.
""I feel like everyone just sees this reality star version of her that's selling mansions and doing that, but if there was a show that was more about what she's actually like, [you would see] she's so down to earth.""

Icons in music and screen join Double J host Zan Rowe to delve deep into intimate moments in their lives as they share five songs they love.
To say there were a lack of role models G could identify with when growing up is an understatement.
G said the first time they realised drums could be front and centre was when Spiderbait's cover of Black Betty topped Australian charts.
But even then, there was still a lack of queer and non-binary artists doing what G aspired to do.
""I think for me, drums was this protection,"" they said.
""I wasn't out the front sharing my story, sharing my songs, I was hidden behind this kit that I could just stay behind and still do what I love, but I [didn't] need to share too much of myself.
""I think it wasn't until I came out that I was like, 'OK, I'm ready to share my music now' because a lot of my music I was writing was very queer and they were about girls that I'd fallen in love with.""
G Flip shares the impact being open out their sexuality had on being able to share their music.
For G, coming out as gay to their parents wasn't a big deal, but coming out as non-binary in 2021 was a ""bit harder for them to wrap their heads around"".
G put those challenges down to a lack of representation — something they hope they've already started to change.
""They didn't really understand, it hadn't been talked about much so my parents really struggled with it, but in the last six months they're getting my pronouns right,"" G said.
""My dad, he called me the other day and he's like, 'So my mate asked me, is G your daughter or your son?'
""And I was like, 'What'd you say Dad?' He's like, 'Well, I made up my own word for you — you're my dauson, a daughter and a son.'
""I almost wanted to cry. I thought it was the cutest thing and I was like, 'Thanks Dad, yeah, I'm your dauson'.""
G said they hope they can be the role model that didn't exist when they were growing up, and inspire people both musically and otherwise.
""Then I think what really warms my heart is kids these days sending me beautiful messages, being like, 'You've really helped me'.
""Knowing that I help the younger generation maybe discover their gender identity or start the conversations within the households, is really important to me.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-06/priscilla-presley-elvis-wife-movie-sofia-coppola/103068178,How does the film about Priscilla compare to Baz Luhrmann's Elvis epic?,"Many films and documentaries about music icon Elvis Presley have been made, but now his ex-wife Priscilla is in the spotlight.
A film directed by Sofia Coppola focuses on Priscilla's story — chronicling how she met the superstar as a teenager, married him and then separated from him in her late 20s.
The film is not out in Australia until January but, after screening in US theatres, it has prompted discussion about Priscilla's relationship with the star — and their 10-year age difference.
Before we unpack what we know about the film, here's a bit of background about the pop culture icons.
Priscilla Beaulieu was 14 years old when she and Elvis first met.
Elvis was 24.
Priscilla and Elvis first met in Germany in 1959, when the superstar was serving in the US Army.
Priscilla's stepfather, Joseph Paul Beaulieu, was stationed at Wiesbaden which, at the time, was the European headquarters of the US Air Force.
In a piece published by People magazine in 1985, Priscilla says she was sitting at the Eagles Club, where US soldiers and their families hung out.
She says she was approached by a man who invited her to join him and his wife on a visit to Elvis's nearby home.
The teenager said she'd have to ask her parents and, after about two weeks, she was allowed to go.

Priscilla was 21 — a few weeks off from her 22nd birthday — when she married Elvis.
Elvis was 32.
Priscilla is played by Cailee Spaeny, who starred in The Craft: Legacy, played the murder victim in TV cop drama Mare of Easttown and played Ruth Bader Ginsburg's daughter in On the Basis of Sex.
Elvis is played by Jacob Elordi, an Australian actor who is best known for his role in gritty high school drama Euphoria and teen rom-com Kissing Booth.
Many have commented about the height difference between the two, with photos of the pair at red-carpet events showing Elordi towering over Spaeny, perhaps emphasising the age gap between their characters.
However, AP reports that the crew used platforms to level out the differences and get the pair in frame together.

The movie is based on the book Elvis and Me.
It was published back in 1985, credited to Priscilla Beaulieu Presley with Sandra Harmon.

It was a bestseller, has been reprinted and was released as an audiobook for the first time last year.
In an interview with Vogue last year, Coppola says she originally read the book ""a long time ago"".
""A friend of mine was talking about her recently, and we got around to discussing the book.
""I read it again and was really moved by her story.""
She says Priscilla was not looking to make it into a movie, though.
""Sofia Coppola came to me and said she would like to make it into a film,"" Priscilla says in an Instagram post.
""I can't think of anyone I would have trusted more than Sofia to bring this book to life.""
Coppola credits Priscilla Presley as an executive producer on the film.
""She's been incredibly open,"" she says.

It tells the story of their relationship — from when they met until they separated in 1972.
When they separated, Priscilla was 27.
However, despite divorcing a year later, the pair were reportedly on good terms until Elvis's death in 1977.
Variety magazine reported it had obtained emails between Coppola and Elvis's late daughter Lisa Marie Presley sent in September 2022, four months before her death.
Lisa Marie read what was believed to have been an early draft of the script and contacted the director before the film was shot, Variety reported.
The magazine said Lisa Marie thought her father was depicted as ""a predator and manipulative"" in the script and she thought it was not representative of Priscilla's perspective of her father.
""I read this and see your shockingly vengeful and contemptuous perspective,"" Variety quoted Lisa Marie as saying.

The Elvis Presley estate did not participate in the movie.
It also did not let Coppola use any of Elvis's music.
In contrast, the estate was cooperative with Baz Luhrmann's biopic, Elvis.
Riley Keogh — Priscilla and Elvis's granddaughter — told Variety that Luhrmann spoke with her and her family for several hours before filming began.
The family also gave Luhrmann inside access to Graceland, although the film was shot in Queensland.
Priscilla herself was a fan of Luhrmann's film and was involved in promoting it.
Coppola tells the Associated Press the movie was all about Priscilla's perspective.
""I was just getting pressured to cut out anything negative about [Elvis] and I was being firm,"" she says.
""I was really clear that I wanted to tell her story and that was my priority.""
But while she says it is not a movie for Elvis fans, she wanted to show the human side of the superstar.
""I really didn't want to make him a villain,"" she says.
""I know she has so much love for him.
""And so much of the dark side of him comes from vulnerability and frustrations and to sort of show him as a human was important to me.""

Many point out the differences between Coppola's film and Luhrmann's Elvis.
In a review for US broadcaster NPR, Aisha Harris says Priscilla shows ""what Elvis leaves out"", with the film revealing a ""dramatic blueprint for emotional abuse and the confines of patriarchal domesticity"".
""Baz Luhrmann's polar opposite of a spectacle, Elvis, cast the singer in a sympathetic, near-infantilising light (and hardly mentioned his wife),"" Harris writes
""In Priscilla, though, the so-called king of rock-and-roll emerges looking like an egotistical, manipulative dirtbag as a romantic partner.
""Priscilla ultimately finds herself trapped inside a glass menagerie of Elvis's making, and the mental suffocation is palpable.""
Associated Press (AP) critic Jake Coyle also says it is the opposite of Luhrmann's film.
""Where Luhrmann's film was lurid and careening, Coppola's is muted and textured,"" Coyle writes.
""Her film is a kind of fairy tale that turns claustrophobic and cautionary.""
Shirley Li's review for the Atlantic called it a ""sensitive, minor-key portrait"" of Priscilla.
""Melancholy young women searching for escape are one of Coppola's favourite subjects, and Priscilla may be her most haunting endeavour thus far,"" Li writes.

I'm ineffably sad about Matthew Perry's death,"In 1994 I lived in a tiny sublet in the heart of Greenwich Village, New York, on a beautifully curving and tree-lined street.
My apartment was south-facing which, coming from Melbourne, dismayed me in anticipation of cold grey, sunless days. It was only when I moved in that I realised on the other side of the planet south was the new north.
I was studying communications at New York University, living off a generously-given but fast dwindling scholarship. My whole apartment was the size of your kitchen, with a hissing steam heater that the building supervisor switched on in October and off in March.
It was on the second floor of 19 Grove St and faced a splendid corner building with a scene from Rear Window in every room. Nobody ever drew their blinds and while I couldn't afford the installation of cable TV, the unfolding narratives visible from each window provided endless entertainment on many snow-bound nights.

As fall turned to winter, tour groups started appearing on the street below, gesturing towards my apartment block and the one opposite, and I had no clue why (gentle reader, I could do no quick search — the ""information super-highway"" had just been invented: I'd been given a brand new .edu email address at NYU which I was yet to use as I knew nobody else who had one. That address must still be out there, somewhere).
It wasn't until I returned to Australia after a year in that city and turned on the TV to watch a smash new show called Friends that I realised the exterior shot of Ross's apartment was my building, and the now-famous, implausibly large apartment of Rachel and Monica was the Alfred Hitchcock building opposite.
I had unwittingly been living in the middle of one of the biggest cultural moments of modern television history and been too technologically impoverished to know what was going on.

I don't know who decided that the world must be divided into those who love the Rolling Stones or the Beatles, those who love Seinfeld or Friends, but while I'm defiantly with the Stones in the former face-off, I back Friends all the way in the latter and to this day will rarely flick past a stumbled-upon repeat, and even less rarely will not know almost every line.
The brilliance of the show is contained in its title. Plot is simply the by-product of great characters being set loose as themselves, and unlike almost any other TV show of that time, the writing and characterisation of those six people was distinctive and distinctly different, one to the other.

Think of a line spoken by Monica, or Joey or Ross: now try to imagine that line being said by any other character in the show. It's impossible. The words belong only in their mouths. I don't think you could apply that rule to the characters of any other sitcom of its time, and particularly not those of Seinfeld, whose shared, universal awfulness was the whole schtick.
Like billions of others, I loved Friends. It turned out those characters were almost exactly the same age as me, making the struggle into the working world via a series of McJobs and failed relationships. And like many other women like me with ambitions to become quick, clever and fulfilled, and then find a bloke just as quick and clever — my favourite character was of course Chandler.
I suspect the creators of the show, Marta Kauffman and David Crane, knew very well that particular appeal of their smart, funny guy. Girls like me liked the funny ones. In an alternative-reality episode, Chandler was a writer with the New Yorker magazine — wise-cracking and confident, sexually suave in the way his usual narrative reality never allowed him — and that was only as it should have been.
His sarcastic impatience became a catchphrase for my ABC Melbourne Mornings team as we chased the clock each day in search of a program.
Friends Chandler and Joey scene
Matthew Perry wrote emphatically in his searing memoir about reading for Chandler and knowing with total desperation that this was the role he was born to play. By the time the cameras rolled on the final 10th season, it was impossible to tell the actor and the character apart.
Perry was a deceptively transparent comedic actor. He had a lightness of touch, was easy with physical gags, and transmitted mischievous joy with just an eyebrow or an upper lip. And yet when he was ordained into the Aaron Sorkin universe in two of that creator's great works — Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and The West Wing — he found a powerful stillness in the drama he was asked to play and could hold a room with just his physical presence.
I loved his Republican lawyer character, Joe Quincy, in the West Wing, and the delicious combination of Sorkin's rapid-fire dialogue and Perry's ease with its demands. Sorkin did however miss an opportunity for a Hepburn-Grant type romance between CJ Cregg and Quincy, another alternate reality I'll always regret.

I've been ineffably sad ever since the awful news of Matthew Perry's death. The first fatal rupture within an iconic cultural group — a band, an acting ensemble — is the true death of the group itself: any future work or reunions now impossible. Their achievements as a creative unit now live only in the past (unless you're The Beatles and refuse to live by mortality's usual rules).
The Beatles - Now and Then
But mostly I've been sad because after reading his book I was hoping for a redemption arc for Perry himself, for that extraordinary comic wit to come alive again somehow, to find someone to write new great material for him this late in life — sober, clean and healthy.
It wasn't my wish to make, of course, but after losing so many of my cultural idols in recent years to booze and pills and the ravages of addiction I wasn't up for losing one more.
This weekend the girl next door, the older dad and the return of those Beatles… I'll say it: does the world really need another maudlin dirge about John's weirdly enmeshed relationship? Do The Beatles and their heirs really need the acclaim, the money? Discuss … while I hide behind the couch.
Have a safe and happy weekend and I don't know about you but I'm running out of great TV dramas to stream: got any suggestions? You can tag me on Insta if you have.
I'm dreading the end of this new season of Morning Wars which has come back after a ludicrous season two with a breathless dive into a post-Roe v Wade America.

In a statement posted to Ticketek's website, the 33-year-old musician and star of HBO series The Idol said he was ""deeply disappointed"" but new dates for the After Hours til Dawn tour would be announced next year.
People who bought tickets for the cancelled dates will be contacted with new tour dates when they are known, and will be able to use their tickets for the rescheduled shows.
Those unable to make the new dates will be able to have their money refunded.
The prospective name change came after the artist told W Magazine he wanted to ""kill The Weeknd"" — and he's not the only artist to ditch their stage name.
A representative of tour promoter Live Nation said the company understood fans would be disappointed, and it was working with the Canadian singer to reschedule the shows.
""We will make a further announcement as soon as possible,"" the statement said.
The Weeknd, who recently said he was considering dropping his stage name and performing under his real name Abel Tesfaye, was scheduled to open his tour in Brisbane with two shows at Suncorp Stadium on November 20 and 21.
He was then set to play three shows at Sydney's Accor Stadium on November 24, 25 and 27, followed by four shows at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne on December 1, 2, 4 and 5.
Two shows in Auckland on December 8 and 9 have also been postponed.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-03/mariah-carey-sued-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-andy-stone/103061082,Mariah Carey's Christmas classic draws attention every holiday season. And she's again being sued for it,"Mariah Carey's ubiquitous Christmas classic All I Want for Christmas Is You is one of those enduring hits that attracts a lot of attention, airplay and streams whenever the holiday season rolls around.
The latest bit of attention the song is getting, however, would be unwanted by the pop star.
Musician Andy Stone is seeking $US20 million from Mariah Carey, alleging he co-wrote and recorded a festive song of the same name in 1989.
Carey is being sued by singer-songwriter Andy Stone, whose stage name is Vince Vance, of the band Vince Vance and the Valiants.
Stone alleges Carey copied a song, also named All I Want for Christmas Is You, which he released with his group in 1989.
Carey's song was released in 1994.
It is the second time Stone has sued over the song, after he withdrew a 2022 case. Troy Powers, who was responsible for the musical composition of the Valiants' song, is also named as a plaintiff.
In court papers seen by ABC News, Stone's legal team alleges that while the phrase in the song's title is part of the popular culture landscape now, it wasn't back when he co-authored his song in 1988 prior to its release the following year.
""The phrase ""all I want for Christmas is you"" may seem like a common parlance today, in 1988 it was, in context, distinctive. Moreover, the combination of the specific chord progression in the melody paired with the verbatim hook was a greater than 50% clone of Vance's original work, in both lyric choice and chord expressions,"" the papers say.
Carey co-wrote All I Want for Christmas Is You with star producer Walter Afanasieff, who Stone is also suing.
Speaking to Billboard to mark the song's 20th anniversary, Afanasieff spoke about how the track came to be.
The song's origin story forms part of Stone's latest lawsuit, in which he alleges discrepancies in Afanasieff's account.
""Defendant Afanasieff, who is a professional record producer and songwriter, purportedly composed ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" in a mere quarter of an hour with co-defendant Carey. But even this hubristic retelling strains credulity. Apparently, Carey created a conflicting provenance, seemingly out of thin air, about writing the song in 15 minutes when she was a minor. Afansieff later voiced his strong dissenting opinion on Carey's version of the song's origin story. It is Plaintiff's contention that however short that period of minutes it took for co-defendants to create their '94 version, the resulting song was unlicensed and it infringed upon Plaintiff's original Copyrighted work.""
Stone is suing for $US20 million ($31 million) in damages and claims his version of the song was a success.
""After its release, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" became a country music hit. After extensive seasonal airplay in 1993, ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" appeared on Billboard's Hot Country chart in January 1994. Vince Vance's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" returned seasonally to Billboard's Hot Country chart five more times throughout the 1990s, peaking at No. 31.""
The papers claim Stone was invited twice to perform at the White House when former president Bill Clinton was in power.
""""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" helped Vince Vance and the Valiants gain national prominence. In April 1994, Vince Vance and the Valiants performed at the White House, and were invited back again for a second performance in 1995.""
Stone is being represented by lawyer Gerard P Fox, who also represented two songwriters in a case against Taylor Swift over her song Shake It Off. They reached an undisclosed settlement in 2022.
She might not officially be known as the 'Queen of Christmas' but Mariah Carey reigns supreme.
Carey is yet to comment publicly.
ABC News has contacted Carey's record company Sony Music, which is also a defendant in the lawsuit, for comment.
Carey's All I Want for Christmas Is You is part of the holiday soundtrack in countries that celebrate Christmas around the world.
It spent weeks at number one on the ARIA charts last December, 28 years after its release.
It reportedly generates $US2.5 million for Carey each year, and by December 2021 had made more than $US72 million according to Forbes, which based its calculations on an earlier study by The Economist.

The newest addition to the genre comes in the form of Quiz Lady, which had its world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in September, and is now coming to streaming.
The film centres on a couple of down-on-their-luck sisters who turn to a television game show to pay their mother's gambling debts and, in turn, save a pet pug called Mr Linguini.
And those sisters are played by the beloved Sandra Oh (Killing Eve) and Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians; The Farewell).

The buddy comedy-style film is directed by Oscar-winning Chinese-American director Jessica Yu, who told the ABC's Stop Everything that it was the cast that drew her to the project. We don't blame her.
""I first read the script, I could imagine Awkwafina and Sandra Oh in it and I was just like, in love,"" Yu said.
Benjamin Law and Beverley Wang host your end-of-week blitz on what everyone's watching and listening to right now.
The film has the leading ladies playing against type — Jenny (Sandra Oh) is in her hot mess era who is there for the hustle; Anne (Awkwafina) takes on the role of the shy, nerdy one who is really good at game shows.
And, like most of us with siblings, both characters find themselves regressing around each other.
""When you're with your sibling, all of a sudden, you're back in grade school,"" Yu says.

""We had so much opportunity to talk about the script and talk about our own experiences as siblings … you know, talk about our families, talking about our Asian American experience.
""So, I think that a lot of that chemistry came out of those conversations; came out of them just becoming friends.""
Director Jessica Yu says there was a lot of on-set banter and chemistry among the film's comedic stars. (AP )
Unsurprisingly, the shoot for Quiz Lady was a lot of fun — not only because of time hanging out and laughing with Oh and Awkwafina.
The film also features the comedic stylings of Jason Schwartzman (as the gameshow's obnoxious champ) and Will Ferrell.
""There was so much funny banter,"" Yu said.
""Sometimes I'm working on a shot or something and I hear them laughing. I'm just having FOMO because I know there's something hilarious happening across the room.""

Ferrell is a producer-actor double threat here, playing quiz host Terry — who is written as a calming and warm presence.
""When you have somebody like Will Ferrell, there's just this natural humour that bubbles up,"" Yu said.
""So, there's not a lot of like, punchline moments that you have to write for him, just the way that he delivers lines where you just laugh, because it's Will. It's just that timing and comedic charisma.""
Yu also told ABC that Hollywood has hit a tipping point for Asian casts.
She referenced a line in the film where Jenny (Sandra Oh) — remember, she's the hot mess — complains about how hard it is to be an Asian woman in the US. The twist? Instead of it representing a genuine moment, she is manipulating the situation to be about her.

""I think that we are at a place where we're beyond the Asian character either being kind of a punchline or being there to explain their experience to the general audience,"" she said.
""I think it is a signal that we are expanding the kinds of characters that we see in the way that they're Asian American. This can be the fabric of their character, but is not the reason for the story.""
Quiz Lady is available on Disney+ from November 3.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-02/celine-dion-ice-hockey-game-stiff-person-syndrome/103053124,Smiling Celine Dion makes rare public appearance almost a year after revealing stiff person syndrome diagnosis,"Singer Celine Dion has made a rare public appearance at an ice hockey game almost a year after revealing her stiff person syndrome diagnosis.
Ice hockey team Montreal Canadiens posted footage of Dion with the coach and some of the players after their game in Las Vegas on Monday night.
Stiff person syndrome can impact a patient's mobility, with symptoms including muscle spasms, muscle rigidity, chronic pain and heightened anxiety.
Video shows Dion standing around with some of the players, joking and laughing with head coach Martin St-Louis.
St-Louis tells Dion he remembers watching her sing for Pope John Paul II when he visited Canada in 1984.
""Well it's been a while since then, eh?"" she responds in French.
""We've changed a little bit since then, but not too much.""

Dion fans commented on the team's post in support of the singer, who has been out of the public eye for the past year.
""She looks well! I hope she is feeling good,"" one said.
""It's so nice to see Celine Dion again. She looks better and that gives hope,"" another said.
It's a rare neurological illness which causes muscle stiffness, but can also be behind a host of other debilitating symptoms.
Patients may develop a greater sensitivity to noise, touch and emotional distress, which can trigger spasms, the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) says.
Some people lose their normal reflexes to catch themselves from falling — and this can cause serious injuries.
""Muscle spasms can be so violent they can dislocate joints and even break bones,"" the Stiff Person Syndrome Research Foundation says.
""Patients can be disabled, wheelchair bound or bedridden, unable to work and care for themselves.""
While the muscle stiffness affects patients' limbs differently, some people can develop an unsteady gait, while others may require a walker or wheelchair.
Last year, Dion said her spasms had been affecting ""every aspect of daily life"".
""Sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I'm used to,"" she said.

Last December, Dion tearfully told fans she had been diagnosed with the neurological illness, explaining that it was the reason she had been experiencing muscle spasms.
The message prompted an outpouring of support from her fans on social media.
She posted a Christmas message but, since then, posts on her Instagram account — which has 6.2 million followers — have been of archival footage and promotional material for the romantic comedy Love Again.
Dion plays herself in the movie and released five new songs as part of the soundtrack.
While the film was released earlier this year, it was shot in during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.
Fans have been posting on the footage with messages of support, some asking for updates on her health situation.
In May, she announced the cancellation of her Courage world tour — a date she'd originally postponed after her diagnosis.
""I'm working really hard to build back my strength, but touring can be very difficult even when you're 100 per cent,"" she said in a statement on social media.
""It's not fair to you to keep postponing the shows, and even though it breaks my heart, it's best that we cancel everything now until I'm really ready to be back on stage again.
""I want you all to know, I'm not giving up… and I can't wait to see you again!""
Dion hasn't posted a health update to her fans on her social media account or website in recent months.
But, in an interview with Hello! Canada published in September, her sister Claudette Dion said she was ""doing everything to recover"".
""It's an illness we know so little about,"" she said, explaining that her sister's muscle spasms were ""impossible"" to control.
""There's little we can do to support her, to alleviate her pain.
""We're crossing our fingers that researchers will find a remedy for this awful illness.""
There's no cure for stiff person syndrome, but the NINDS says symptoms can managed ""with appropriate treatment"".
Some of the treatments include muscle-relaxant medications, anti-seizure medication and immunotherapy.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-31/killers-of-the-flower-moon-intermission-interval-cinema-duration/103042006,'It's about choice': Cinema CEO blasts studios over no interval for Killers of the Flower Moon,"In order to run a film with an intermission, cinemas must get permission from the studios behind the movie.
That hasn't stopped a small number of movie theatres from showing Martin Scorsese's 206-minute film Killers of the Flower Moon without that permission.
US media outlets are reporting a handful of independent theatres in North America, the UK, Europe and South America began screening the movie with breaks ranging from six to 15 minutes.
The studios behind the film have reportedly informed those venues it violates their licensing agreements.
ABC News has contacted the film's producer, Apple Original Films, and distributor Paramount but has received no further comment.
The news has reignited debate about the length of some movies and whether intervals should be introduced for lengthy features.
Palace Cinemas, which runs 24 movie theatres across Australia, approached Paramount to ask if they could insert an intermission into Killers of the Flower Moon but the answer was no, says Chief Executive Benjamin Zeccola.
""They checked with their head office in California, LA, and the response came back that that would not be permitted,"" Mr Zeccola said.
""They've got this concept of how the director intended the film to be seen.
""And I find that somewhat awkward because, obviously, when these films are shown at home, on streaming on Apple TV, or any other platform, or DVD, there's a pause button, which people frequently use.
""It feels like cinemas are being discriminated against.
""It's unfair.""
Benjamin Zeccola says customers should be given a choice. (Supplied)
Mr Zeccola says the needs of the customer should be considered over and above any stylistic considerations.
""I think that it's absolutely imperative that the people that are contemplating this put the customer at the centre of the decision-making process,"" he said.
""It's not about the director, it's about the viewer.
""It's our duty, it's our obligation to put the viewer at the centre of the universe and make decisions that suit the viewer. Not the director, not the studio, not the exhibitor.
""Let's put the emphasis back on the customer.""
Mr Zeccola said people usually want a break after 2 hours, and Palace has received complaints about the length of some movies.
""During Oppenheimer was when we noticed customers requesting that we put a break into the films and then, knowing Killers of the Flower Moon was coming down the line with a long running time, that's what prompted the requests to Paramount.""
Martin Scorsese returns with a devastating yet beautifully rendered film exposing America's shameful history of genocidal violence.
He said any break does not need to be too long.
""A 10-minute break would be ideal,"" Mr Zeccola said.
""It's really a comfort stop that you can get up, stretch your legs and go to the bathroom if you need to.
""If you want to grab more refreshments, great.
""However, really, it's about that comfort factor.""
He said at cinemas where the clientele tends to be older, the break could run up to 15 minutes.
""And then we can advertise which sessions have the break and which sessions don't and customers can make their choice.
""And I think that's the most important thing, is that people want choice these days.
""It's about choice.""
From the 1950s and into the 1970s, intermissions during movies were commonplace.
""Part of it was technical,"" Mr Zeccola said.
""The film prints were running through projectors, and you'd get to the halfway mark and you had to change the reels of film being projected through the projector.
""So, there was a break there for the projectionists to get the next spool up. And customers loved it as well.""
Zeccola said it is not the first time Palace Cinemas has requested an intermission and in 2015, they were successful.
""There was an intermission in Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight some years ago, which was very well received.""
He believes in some cases there are directors who let their movies go on for too long and he would personally prefer if movies ran between 90 – 120 minutes.
""Beyond that, it's probably a bit over-bloated.""
He said the incentive for studios to run shorter films is long gone.
""This comes down to the fact that when film was printed on film, when it was actually printed on celluloid, each print of the film cost a lot of money — thousands and thousands of dollars and you paid per foot.
""So, the longer the film, the more expensive the print, so the studios used to have a reason to ensure that the films didn't run too long. They had a financial motivator there.
""And since digital, the cost of a digital file for a film is the same regardless of its length.
""So, there's no longer any sort of restriction from the studio or producer point of view. So, they're getting a bit long and a little bit self-indulgent.""
Some popular movies have been known to run over 3 hours. Here are a few.
Mr Zeccola said it could be hard on an exhibitor because it forces them to show fewer movies, which can affect a movie theatre's business model.
But it is not all bad news.
""We kind of love it as well because it really is the most incredible art form,"" he said.
""The way it combines the art of music, the mise en scène, the cinematography, acting and storytelling into one art form is just incredible.
""We're madly in love with it, as you can tell.
""So, when a film is truly spectacular, I don't think you feel the time dragging.
""It's only if they're padding out a story or if it's not quite efficient or economical enough that it's a problem.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-31/mark-coles-smith-surprising-bowie-connection-take-5/102957666,How David Bowie helped actor Mark Coles Smith unlock the puzzles of his life,"When it comes to brushes with fame, Mark Coles Smith has a story to rival even the best: a family connection to David Bowie.
""It was during his time in Australia, he met my grandmother Ningali Lawford,"" he told Take 5 with Zan Rowe.
""She was a beautiful young thing at Bangarra Dance Theatre in Sydney and they had this three-month-long romance.""
Across five episodes, icons in music and screen join Double J host Zan Rowe to delve deep into intimate moments in their lives as they share five songs they love.
But it wasn't to last. The relationship ended when Bowie asked Coles Smith's grandmother to go back to Berlin with him.
""She said 'I can't leave my country'. It took a very long time for me to forgive Nan [for] that,"" Coles Smith joked.
""I was like 'oh man, what was he like?' and she said 'he was a gentleman'.
""I went, 'of course he was'.""
As well as the novelty of the family connection, Coles Smith — who's starred in Mystery Road and Last Cab to Darwin — shared that Bowie's music had helped ground him during a transformative period.
""At 15, I went into the local CD store. I asked the older shop owner … 'I want you to choose an album for me that I wouldn't choose but you think I should listen to' and he gave me Bowie's latest release, which was Reality,"" he said.
""I felt like I was listening to a puzzle and inside the puzzle, Bowie was speaking to themes that I was on the cusp of understanding within myself.
""And if I could just keep listening, I might figure out what those things were and I did.""
Part of Coles Smith's puzzle at the time was his fledgling acting career.
The year before, at 14, he landed his first major role in an afternoon children's series shot in Broome.
""It was the beginning of me … participating in storytelling, as well as kind of really becoming discerning and seeking out what the good stories were,"" he said.
It began a now two-decade-long career on the big and small screens, which culminated in a Gold Logie nomination this year — making him the first Indigenous actor ever nominated for the award.
But, like many artists, acting isn't Coles Smith's only creative endeavour.
A Nyikina man, Coles Smith's parents separated when he was young. He describes the Kimberley as home, even though his early life saw him travel around the country with his mum, who lectured in Indigenous mental health.
The Take 5 is a podcast where the people you love, share five songs they love.
It wasn't until he was 10 or 11 that he reconnected with his dad and started visiting him in remote Aboriginal communities where he was running arts projects.
On one such visit, he heard a beat come on, blasted from a speaker nearby, that would spark a new creative love.
""All these senior elders were doing all these incredible canvases on the floor in there, and they had this dinky boom box,"" he recalled.
Mark Coles Smith has DJed at beach parties along the Broome coastline.  (ABC Kimberley: Andrew Seabourne)
The song was 90s house chart-topper 100% Pure Love by Crystal Waters.
""It was sort of my first exposure to infectious 90s vocal house and I think that ... sent me on my way to becoming a DJ, hosting a thousand plus beach parties on the coastline of Broome,"" he said.
""Then ... making the natural progression from being a DJ and playing other people's music to going 'hang on, how do I make this myself?'""
His interest in sound and music production grew, leading to his electronic music project, Kalaji.
""The music that I produce under is sort of this two-tiered love letter both to the art of sound design, music production, and also to Nyikina culture and to my mother's landscape,"" he said.
""Music's one of the most beautiful ways of telling stories, but it's also a beautiful way of bringing you into the story and making you part of it.
""I think that was something that I thought was sort of magic.""
While many will recognise Coles Smith from his fictional characters, one of his latest projects is a documentary that confronts the all-too-real issue of the disproportionately high rates of suicide in Indigenous men in the Kimberley.
Coles Smith says collecting people's stories was both difficult and helpful at the same time.
He said the motivation came both from his personal experience of losing his best friend in his early 20s, and seeing his experience reflected by so many other members of his community.
""[It] was a chance to sort of explore how we got to here and where we might go from here,"" he said.
Coles Smith said collecting and hearing others' stories was both difficult and helpful at the same time.
""Pain and loss are sacred,"" he said.
""It's what we choose to do with that pain that's most important.
""I try to honour all the parts of me that hurt by being available to others who hurt and being available to trying to make the world a better place.""

The actor, aged 54, was reportedly found dead in his hot tub or Jacuzzi at his Los Angeles home on Sunday.
His death was later confirmed in a statement by NBC and his family.
No official details have been released by Los Angeles police or the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner, which will determine the manner and cause of Perry's death. US media reported no drugs were found at the scene.
In the wake of his death, the actor's own words from his 2022 memoir about how he'd like to be remembered have circulated around social media.

He spoke of how he wanted to be known for his work to help people struggling with substance abuse.
He opened a home for sober living men in Malibu in 2013.
""When I die, people will talk about Friends, Friends, Friends,"" he wrote.
""And I'm glad of that, happy I've done some solid work as an actor, as well as given people multiple chances to make fun of my struggles on the world wide web.
""But when I die, as far as my so-called accomplishments go, it would be nice if Friends were listed far behind the things I did to try help other people.
""It won't happen, but it would be nice.""
A statement was released by Perry's family to People magazine calling it a ""tragedy"".
""Matthew brought so much joy to the world, both as an actor and a friend,"" his family told People magazine.
""We are heartbroken by the tragic loss of our beloved son and brother.""
They also thanked his fans by saying, ""You all meant so much to him and we appreciate the tremendous outpouring of love.""
The co-creators of Friends paid tribute to Perry in a statement.
In a nod to the way episodes of the sitcom were named, it started by saying ""This is truly The One Where Our Hearts Are Broken,"" co-creators Marta Kauffman, David Crane and executive producer Kevin Bright said.

""We are shocked and deeply, deeply saddened by our beloved friend Matthew's passing.
""We will always cherish the joy, the light, the blinding intelligence he brought to every moment — not just to his work, but in life as well.
""He was always the funniest person in the room. More than that, he was the sweetest, with a giving and selfless heart.""
The lead co-stars of Friends — Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc and Courtney Cox — have yet to publicly comment on his death.

But some of Perry's other co-stars from the TV show which ran from 1994 to 2004 have taken to social media to express their grief.
Maggie Wheeler, who played Perry's love interest Janice Hosenstein on Friends, said the ""world will miss"" him on Instagram.
""What a loss,"" she wrote.
""The world will miss you Matthew Perry.
""The joy you brought so many in your too short lifetime will live on.
""I feel so very blessed by every creative moment we shared.""
Morgan Fairchild, who played his mother on the show wrote on X, that she was in shock.
""I'm heartbroken about the untimely death of my 'son', Matthew Perry,"" she said.
""The loss of such a brilliant young actor is a shock.""
Paget Brewster, who played his love interest Kathy in season four also wrote about the death on X.
""He won't rest in peace though... He's already too busy making everyone laugh up there,"" she wrote.
Other celebrities who knew or were fans of Perry also spoke of him on social media.
Gwyneth Paltrow posted about when she met him at the Williamstown Theater Festival in the summer of 1993.
""We drove out to swim in creeks, had beers in the local college bar, kissed in a field of long grass. It was a magical summer,"" she wrote.
""I am super sad today, as so many of us are. I hope Matthew is at peace at long last. I really do.""
Selma Blair called him her ""oldest boy friend"" in an Instagram post.
""All of us loved Matthew Perry, and I did especially. Every day,"" she said.
""I loved him unconditionally. And he me. And I'm broken. Broken hearted. Sweet dreams Matty. Sweet dreams.""
Shannen Doherty, who worked with Perry on an episode of 90210 spoke of their lifelong friendship on Instagram.
""We were a gang way back,"" she said.
""We all grew up together going to the Formosa, North and constantly laughing. Matt, Roger, David, Roxana.
""I could be more poetic or say things better but right now, shock and sadness prevail.""
Singer Adele took a moment to talk about him during her show in Las Vegas on Saturday night.
She recalled how his work made her laugh and said that even though she'd never met him she was personally sad.
""I just want to say how much I love what he did for us,"" she said.
Jennifer Hudson, Nancy Sinatra, Octavia Spencer, Meredith Salenger and Joe Keenan also joined celebrities paying tribute to the actor online.
Saturday Night Live also showed a tribute card for Perry during the weekend's episode.

""While these are presently allegations and there has been no resolution in court, I personally don't feel comfortable performing my duties as co-host while these legal matters are outstanding,"" Chatfield wrote in a post she published on Friday morning.
Chatfield added that it was likely she would not continue with the event in years to come.
The headline act for the tour is US singer Jason Derulo, who was recently named in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on Thursday, October 5 by singer Emaza Gibson.
Gibson has accused Derulo of sexual harassment, intimidation and breach of contract.
This article contains external content that failed to load. It may have been removed or is no longer available.
In an interview with NBC News in the US, Gibson said in relation to the lawsuit that she was ""traumatised"".
""I have anxiety: I'm traumatised. I've dealt with inhumane work situations … I'm at this point where I'm back to zero and I have nothing.""
Derulo posted a response to the lawsuit earlier this month on his Instagram page, and said the claims were ""completely false and hurtful"".
""I stand against all forms of harassment and I remain supportive of anybody following their dreams.
""I've always strived to live my life in a positively impactful way, and that's why I sit here before you deeply offended, by these defamatory claims,"" Derulo said.
Derulo joined the Channel 7 show The Voice Australia this year as a coach, alongside UK pop singer Rita Ora and Australian pop singers Jessica Mauboy and Guy Sebastian.
Chatfield was meant to co-host the national tour with US rapper Fatman Scoop starting in Melbourne on Friday, November 10.
The line-up includes Boyz II Men, Flo Rida, Kelly Rowland, JoJo, 112, Travie Mccoy, Lay Gee and Vin Rock from Naughty by Nature and Australian DJ Havana Brown.
The tour includes dates in Perth, Adelaide, Auckland, Brisbane and Sydney.
It is the sixth year of the music tour, which brings together international R&B artists — mostly popular during the late 90s and early 2000s — to perform for Australian and New Zealand audiences.

Following a six-year hiatus, the Real Housewives of Sydney and its overhauled cast is gunning for nothing less, after the reboot's first season struggled to capture the zeitgeist.
Reportedly ""too mean"" and vulgar to be aired in the United States, season one was packed with profanity-fuelled one-liners, aggressive fights and capes thrown into Sydney Harbour. Finding the right balance between provocative and repulsive is an artform, with cast mates and producers alike playing loose with reality to create captivating TV.
As the new series is underway — currently airing weekly on Binge — we took a look at a select few of the key turning points in Australia's reality TV history to see how we ended up here.
(We're sorry in advance if your favourite show is missing. While we'd love to deep dive into Who Dares Wins, Cosima de Vito's nodules or when Australia's Next Top Model announced the wrong winner, charting the entire history of Australian reality TV would require a tome.)
Cheers and drama is all part of the fun on the Real Housewives of Sydney. (Supplied: Binge)
Australia's first foray into the genre of reality TV, Sylvania Waters, seems quaint by today's standards.
The 12-part series, a 1992 co-production between the ABC and BBC, followed millionaire couple Noeline Baker and Laurie Donaher and their children as they lived, drank and argued in the titular wealthy waterside Sydney suburb. It was incredibly popular, providing a blueprint for reality TV to come. But it also proved ultra controversial.
When it aired, the ABC received hundreds of complaints from viewers.
They believed the show was a harmful and stereotypical depiction of Australians as loud, uncultured, xenophobic drunks.
Locals were particularly upset — and for good reason, as the suburb is still associated foremost with the show to this day.
Similar shows sold as an inside look at affluent communities across Australia — Netflix's Byron Baes, Channel 10's short-lived The Shire, and Channel Seven's just-announced Made in Bondi — have copped criticism, even before airing, with locals often correctly worried they'll be depicted as vapid and uncultured.
Call it the Sylvania effect.
No Regrets, by Noeline Donaher (Sylvania Waters music video, 1993)
Labelled by press as the ""Neighbours from Hell"", the Baker-Donahers weren't ready for the spotlight, or for the nascent tricks of reality TV editing. And with Noeline copping much of the ire, it's almost like she was the original housewife of Sydney, a ""love-to-hate"" character delighting in boats, alcohol and arguments.
On an episode of You Can't Ask That, castmate Mick Donahers reflected that the family were shocked when they watched live and saw how their lives were edited, alleging footage of the cast with alcohol was spliced in repeatedly to make the them seem like heavy drinkers.
The family's 15 minutes, for the most part, came and went. Although Noeline made a now-classic, post-reality foray into music with No Regrets, her one and only single — a path many reality stars and real housewives to come would follow.
Once we'd seen a family in a house together, why not chuck 10 strangers together in a house filled with cameras and them cut off from the outside world? Among the first editions of this reality TV franchise — which began in the Netherlands in 1999 and now has more than 60 versions — Big Brother Australia was billed as not just reality TV, but a ""social experiment"".
In ""reality"", that meant watching a bunch of predominantly twenty-somethings bored out of their minds, driven to stupidity and drama in efforts to pass the hours in-between stressful challenges and commands offered up by an omnipresent voice.
With an average of 1.4 million viewers tuning in across the first season's 85 days and 98 episodes, the show saw housemates whittled down each week with contested public-voted evictions, and the winner taking home $250,000.
While ultimately coming third, it was 22-year-old Sara-Marie Fedele who became the main ""hate her or love her"" figure for the now-ludicrously simple trait of wearing pyjamas, bunny ears and doing ""the bum dance"". Fans even wore bunny ears in solidarity.
Sara-Marie and Sirens — I'm So Excited (The Bum Dance)
Later seasons were more mired by controversies and headline-grabbing moments, from housemate Merlin Luck's powerful silent protest for asylum seekers on live television, to accidental eliminations, cheating scandals and a nudity-filled Uncut program that some housemates weren't even aware existed. There was also a sexual assault during the show's sixth season in 2006, which saw two housemates immediately ejected from the house.
The incident saw then-PM John Howard declare ""get this stupid program off the air"" in a radio interview. But it would take until 2009 for him to get his wish. The show has since been rebooted twice, once in 2012 and again in 2020, and has now been aired by Channel Ten, Nine and Seven.
Big Brother's success was followed by an avalanche of international reality competitions making their way Down Under in the 00s, including The Biggest Loser, Dancing with The Stars, Australian Idol, Australia's Next Top Model, The Mole, So You Think You Can Dance, Beauty and the Geek and many, many more. Our obsession was well and truly underway.
The UK may have invented MasterChef, but Australia perfected it.
Transforming just another cooking show into a high-octane competition with tear-jerking eliminations, MasterChef Australia has proven to be one of our country's most popular reality shows.
Ashamed to admit you love reality TV? You're not alone.
For five nights a week across three months, amateur Australian chefs battled it out with a set of nail-biting challenges — from creating a dish around a mystery box, to challenging a celebrity chef to a cook-off or guessing every single ingredient in a curry.
Both low stakes (no love affairs or ugly fights here) and high-octane viewing (the cake didn't rise!), MasterChef proved to be a winning formula — entertaining, educational and wholesome.
It also launched an army of armchair culinary experts.
Sure, the show can be a little too dramatic — we'll never forget when then-judge Matt Preston smashed a dish in season two and called it ""disgusting"" right before an ad break, only for the show to return and reveal he called it ""disgustingly GOOD"", insisting he destroyed the meal because he couldn't bear to share its genius.
But is that not disgustingly good TV? Not to mention far less exploitative than the sadism seen elsewhere.
Masterchef Australia's Matt Preston calls a dish ""disgusting""
Across its 15 seasons (and counting), the show has introduced us to some of our most beloved public chefs and TV figures, including Adam Liaw, Poh Ling Yeow, Andy Allen and more. Notably, MasterChef Australia remains one of Australia's most reliably diverse shows too, with contestants sharing their culture, heritage and stories through their cooking.
While 80s game shows like Perfect Match (shout-out to matchmaker robot Dexter) introduced Australians to the idea of landing love on TV, The Bachelor kicked off our current obsession with dating competitions back in 2013.
Since then, we've seen: horrific chocolate bath dates; the Honey Badger stringing along a whole season of women, including Brooke Blurton; Sophie Monk's return to reality TV (Popstar is worthy of its own book); and some truly abhorrent behaviour between contestants, from gaslighting to slut-shaming.
Oh, and true love's blossom, once or thrice (Matty J and Laura, you make us believe).

The Bachelor's success has seen a proliferation of dating shows, including its own spin-offs The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise, as well as Love Island Australia, Married at First Sight and Love Triangle, plus a set of more wholesome takes, like Love on The Spectrum or Better Date Than Never.
Arguably, it's the potential train-wreck of most of these shows that keeps us coming back, as contestants run the gambit of being genuinely there for love and itching to enter influencing.
The Bachelor, in particular, straddles that balance of sincerity and vacuity, proving what every reality TV lover (and ex-contestant) knows: the genre can be both real and completely fake at once.",Unknown,Fri 27 Oct 2023,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-27/mutiny-in-heaven-film-review-nick-cave-early-band/103014008,The true story of Nick Cave and the group once labelled the most dangerous band in the world,"The reference point: the hellscapes of Hieronymus Bosch. The location: a garbage dump in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn. The occasion: a music video for libidinally cacophonous ensemble The Birthday Party.
The call to participate had been issued over local radio and via flyers at the Crystal Ballroom, then the sticky epicentre of the city's post-punk boom: ""Come dressed for a New Year's Eve party in HELL.""
In addition to the throngs of gothic youth that turned up, there were psychiatric patients bussed in for the occasion, a crucifix, pigs' heads mounted on sticks, a live goat. Open flames illuminated the abject carnival, burning unchecked trails through the detritus.
At the centre of it all was a wild-eyed stick insect of a man, cavorting his way through the squalid morass — the de-Boschery, if you will. The young Nick Cave appears naked except for a loin cloth, his pasty chest emblazoned with the words ""PORCA DIO"" — ""God is a pig"". Even more alarming is the fact he is unshod.
@hipsville Youtube: The Birthday Party - Nick the Stripper - 1981
It's a scene that would have set any OHS officer to weeping — the police and fire brigade must have been aghast when they got called in — just as surely as it would serve to ignite the dark passions of many a disaffected teen who saw the end result on TV.
The music video for Nick the Stripper — a honking, poisonous cut from the band's 1981 Prayers on Fire LP — is the only one the band made in its six-year lifespan (from 1977 to 1983). Decades later, it remains an electrifying spectacle, still exuding a vital danger, even — make that especially — when viewed alongside the output of more contemporary shock-rockers.
The Paul Goldman-directed clip is justly afforded the status of set piece in Mutiny in Heaven, a heady, collage-like documentary homage to the band.
Director Ian White cedes the screen to the Nick the Stripper video for its full duration; it acts as a kind of unofficial header for the film's middle section, in which the band — comprised of Cave, guitarists Rowland S. Howard and Mick Harvey, bassist Tracey Pew and drummer Phill Calvert — hit their distinctive musical stride.

It was after relocating to London that this gaggle of ghoulish larrikins, still in their early 20s, landed on the deranged, wonkily propulsive sound that would be their claim to music history, and pushed their live shows to the point of volatile confrontations.
Mutiny in Heaven opens with an instructive piece of footage from a live show, in which Cave – moody blue under the stage lights, black hair sweat-slicked into a cockscomb — admonishes a battered audience member: ""The front row is not for the fragile, my dear,"" he drawls. (Cinema-goers are, at least, safe from the jeers, bottles and limbs that were liable to be thrown around in the band room.)
White maintains a tight focus on his subject, keeping the gushing, retroactive assessments to a cool minimum.
Interviews with Rowland S Howard (R), who died in 2009, were used as the springboard for this documentary. (Supplied: Rainer Berson)
His interest is rather in crafting an immersive account of the band's heroin- and liquor-riddled rise and subsequent fallout — as told largely by the former members themselves, bar Pew, who died in 1986. (Howard's commentary was recorded shortly before his death in 2009, for an unrealised film project; these recordings would come to serve as the springboard for Mutiny in Heaven.)
Nick Cave has released an enormous volume of material over the years — the guy loves to work — so narrowing down a few records isn't easy.
If only, say, the Thurston Moore quote (a rock doc inevitability) could be swapped out for some insights from Genevieve McGuckin and the late Anita Lane, or the other girlfriends slash collaborators who went with the band to London, where the entire gang was confined to the one dire squat.
In its design, Mutiny in Heaven approaches, but doesn't quite achieve, the rigour and elegance of Todd Haynes's 2021 Velvet Underground documentary.
Where Haynes illustrated The Velvets' story through the avant-garde cinema of their day, White sometimes veers a little corny, prone to falling back on bits of stock footage of crows and cats overlaid with a scratchy analogue film filter.
Director Ian White says the band ""didn't meddle"" in the creative process of making the film. (Supplied: Getty Images/David Corio/Redferns)
Mutiny in Heaven does, however, proffer a trove of archival footage, as supplemented by animated sequences adapted from the drawings of Reinhard Kleist — author of 2017 graphic novel Nick Cave: Mercy on Me, rendered in striking black-and-white — that prove a cut above the standard.
The J Files: The Birthday Party
White's iris shot-like approach to The Birthday Party means that the film works to complement, rather than compete with, Richard Lowenstein and Lynn-Maree Milburn's 2011 documentary about Rowland S. Howard, Autoluminescent (not to mention the stack of tomes on Nick Cave).
It also mirrors a prevailing theme of isolation. Harvey explains that the band's London stint proved inspiring only in the negative: They were penniless, near-friendless and dismayed to discover a music scene that was almost entirely, as Howard elegantly puts it, ""bilge"". The Party was racked by malnutrition and spiralling heroin addictions. The hostility of their sound and stage presence blossomed in response to the hostility of their environment.
Mutiny in Heaven slouches doggedly toward the catharsis, and the majesty, of this theatre of bad vibes.

Until then, the lip-syncing duo's deceit went under the radar, despite the fact they'd left breadcrumbs, including a tape that skipped during a live appearance.
It seems no one had noticed the duo weren't even credited as vocalists on their European album either, released before they found overwhelming success internationally.
A new feature-length documentary currently streaming on Paramount+ tells the story of duo Robert ""Rob"" Pilatus and Fabrice ""Fab"" Morvan.
Pilatus died in 1998. He was 33.
If you grew up in the 1980s and 90s, you'll remember what happened, with former Nine newsreader, the late Brian Henderson, seen in the documentary delivering news of the epic lie to the Australian public.
The documentary brings new insights (and new villains) to the table and is as captivating as the audacious nature of the scandal.
Fab Morvan says he, along with Rob Pilatus, wanted to be famous. (Supplied: Paramount+)
Morvan anchors the documentary, sharing how he and Pilatus, who met during their youth in Germany, had similar goals. They wanted to be superstars. Their wish came true. But for all the wrong reasons.
In 1989, Milli Vanilli's debut US album went six-times platinum. Their hit song Girl You Know It's True sold more than 30 million singles worldwide.
Their singles Baby Don't Forget My Number, Blame It on the Rain and Girl I'm Gonna Miss You topped the charts.
But they weren't singing their own songs.
Some of the artists who were responsible for their sound are also featured in the documentary, including rapper Charles Shaw.
Vocalist John Davis died, reportedly from COVID-19, in 2021.
Visit the Grammys website now and there's no mention of Milli Vanilli, despite the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences keeping meticulous records when it comes to Grammy-nominated and awarded artists.
Even the highlights video of that particular Grammys ceremony doesn't feature them.
But their notoriety remains in the consciousness of 90s kids.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-25/britney-spears-book-the-woman-in-me-takeaways/103018768,'I am Britney Spears now': The chilling words from the father of Britney Spears and other takeaways,"Britney Spears has won a Grammy and countless other awards. She's sold more than 100 million records worldwide.
In 2021, Time magazine named her one of their 100 Most Influential People.
But the pop star went through a period where she had little control over her career, finances and even what she could eat under a restrictive conservatorship.
Her memoir The Woman in Me is out and it's being billed as Spears ""telling her own story, on her own terms, at last"".
Here are five takeaways.
The Woman in Me by Britney Spears is in bookstores now. (Supplied: Simon & Schuster)
It's always been about so much more than Spears's music. But that's the reason she's in the public eye, so let's start there.
Spears writes about taking control as a 16-year-old and changing the direction of what would become an iconic music video.
It was her idea to wear a school uniform while dancing around to … Baby One More Time.
""The mock-up I saw had me looking like a Power Ranger,"" she writes of the original concept in which she would play a ""futuristic astronaut"".
Spears also talks about what it was like to hold a snake while performing on stage at the 2001 MTV Awards.
She writes about feeling alive when she's on stage.
""Singing takes me to a mystical place where language doesn't matter anymore, where anything is possible,"" Spears writes.
""Music stopped the noise, made me feel confident, and took me to a pure place of expressing myself exactly as I wanted to be seen and heard.""
But for many years Spears was forced to perform under duress.

When Spears shaved her head in 2007, she did so in a defiant show of strength, she says, but that's not how it was perceived in the media.
Instead, it was held up as proof of her mental instability.
A conservatorship would follow.
""I am Britney Spears now,"" her father who was her conservator said to her, Spears writes. And for 13 years she had little agency.
What she ate was monitored. Who she was allowed to see was decided by others and yet despite being considered incapable of thinking for herself, she maintained a gruelling schedule as part of a four-year Las Vegas residency.
When Spears writes about being unable to sin in Sin City, it drives home just how baffling the terms of her conservatorship were.
A US judge has ended the conservatorship that has controlled pop star Britney Spears's life and money since 2008.
Spears documents that during her childhood, her father self-medicated with alcohol after enduring years of abuse at the hands of his own father.
She describes her father as being ""reckless, cold, and mean"" in the way he treated her but says he was even harder on her brother Bryan.
Spears writes about her parents being very poor, until she was able to provide for them.
Her mother and sister have both published books, which Spears dismisses as attempts to profit off her. (Spears has also previously published a book co-written with her mother Lynne.)
She no longer speaks to her family.
Spears has dedicated The Woman in Me to her two sons, who she had with Kevin Federline. She doesn't paint a flattering picture of Federline who she says kept her from her children.
But it's what she says about her former boyfriend Justin Timberlake that's making headlines.

There was a time when the two fronted the cameras united in double denim. But there was plenty happening behind the scenes.
Spears writes of an abortion, saying if it had been left to her alone, she would never have done it ""and yet Justin was so sure that he didn't want to be a father"".
She says Timberlake was the beneficiary of the double standard that applies to female artists, who aren't afforded the freedom that male artists are.
He dumped her via text, she says, amid cheating rumours, despite also cheating on her.
Spears rightly points out that her sexuality was no-one else's business, but she faced invasive questions from journalists about her virginity as a teenager, saying she was treated as dangerous for wearing crop tops, while being the subject of a ""Lolita fantasy"" for some.
Spears refused to reveal publicly what she documents in the book – that she had been sexually active since she was 14 years old.

The book was put to bed before her break up with model Sam Asghari, with whom she had suffered a miscarriage.
Spears, who has been free from her conservatorship since 2021, sums up the story by thanking the fans who cared about her wellbeing.
She hasn't teased any new music, but for now is relishing her freedom.
""Freedom means being goofy, silly, and having fun on social media,"" Spears writes.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-24/whats-behind-the-celebrity-social-media-wipe/103009290,The real reason entertainers like Dua Lipa and Kid Laroi are wiping their social media accounts,"Last week, if you — as I'm prone to do — went to check up on Dua Lipa via Instagram, you would have found absolutely nothing. The popstar had wiped her account of all previous posts.
She followed it up a few days later with a single snap of herself, but now with red hair (!!!).
As far as posts-per-follower ratios go, 1:88.8 million is pretty impressive — but we doubt that Dua did it for the bragging rights.
Instead, she was likely making way for a new ""era"" and album in addition to the new look (her last full-length release was Future Nostalgia in 2020). In fact, she's even done this before, deleting everything on her Instagram in the lead-up to that album.
And she's far from alone. At this point, the social media blackout is a tried-and-true trend for musicians and artists to essentially ""pre-announce"" new music and projects.
In the past decade, everyone from Radiohead and Taylor Swift to The Kid Laroi and Gang of Youths have all pointedly deleted posts, entire profiles and even their websites.
So how did we get to a stage where artists generate a heap of headlines for doing next-to nothing? And while crying over deleted Instagram posts might seem a little ridiculous given, uh, everything else in the world, are we losing something in the process?
Pop-culture powerhouses Kanye West and Lady Gaga — both masters of provocation, for better or worse — are some of the earliest adopters of the social media wipe.
Back in 2013, both artists deleted their Twitter posts to tease new albums. Kanye simply posted ""June Eighteen"", the release date of his album Yeezus, while Gaga, naturally, got a little more theatrical in the lead-up to ARTPOP. She removed all posts and her profile picture, posting a cryptic message about a ""temporary shutdown"".

Following their example, other artists began to experiment with deleting-as-album-hype.
In 2015, British pop group The 1975 went a step further by (briefly) deleting all their accounts, sending fans into a frenzy that they were breaking up; in 2016, The Weeknd wiped his Instagram; Radiohead even went so far as to remove their website ahead of A Moon Shaped Pool.
The few strands left by each artist — respectively, a comic, an Instagram bio saying ""Starboy"" and some leaflets Radiohead sent to some fans' houses — became clues of the album to come.
In a way, these promotions took inspiration from ARGS, aka Alternate Reality Games. These games — mostly marketing tools — unfold piece-by-piece as you dive down rabbit holes online, following cues from intriguing billboards, street posters, social media posts or anything else eye-grabbing. The reward at the end ranges from an unseen movie teaser to new background on a video game.
Probably the most successful ARG came from The Blair Witch Project. The 1999 horror film was able to use a cultural unfamiliarity with both the internet and found footage visuals to convince people the film was a documentary — one whose mystery they could solve by investigating cryptic clues and videos online.
But the clues behind a lone photo or an Instagram bio aren't quite as involved, and the mystery is pretty obvious: it's new music. Unless you can elevate the social-media blackout into a cultural moment.
In 2017, Taylor Swift embraced the power of a blank space — she disappeared, receding from public events and press before wiping her Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr and website in August.
Without diving too deep into Swift-lore, the hibernation followed a mainstream tide-turn against the pop-star, losing favour for having a calculated public persona, and for moving away from her country charm roots in the effort to become a ""stadium sell-out"".
From Adele to Taylor Swift to Lizzo, the concepts of 'pop star' and 'businesswoman' are becoming more and more compatible in recent years.
Her response? A blackout, followed a few days later by videos of a snake, and comeback single Look What You Made Me Do, a moody EDM track that played into Swift-as-master manipulator.
If you were there, you know: this return — and the resulting album, Reputation — was all-eclipsing, the true beginning of Swift as one of our few current monocultural figures.
Each move conjured tabloid coverage, fan conjecture and outright conspiracy — now standard for Swift — who plays into it with plenty of ARG-like ""Easter Eggs"" across videos, social media and virtually everything she posts.
It makes sense, then, that the social-media blackout blew up afterwards: the next year, everyone from Grimes to Miley Cyrus and BROCKHAMPTON followed suit.
With some artists, it does more than generate headlines. Taylor's blackout made thematic sense, for example, openly re-inventing herself for an album that plays with ideas of contrived pop personas and media narratives.
It enriched the album, just as a great music video or album cover can — but can the same be said for Sir Paul's social media managers deleting posts?
The social media wipe has caught on outside of music and celebrities, too, with fashion and beauty brands chasing the trend.
That almost feels more intuitive: where social media was once seen as a window into our lives — or, at least, a diary of some kind — now it's more like a shop window of ever-changing new wares, the old display chucked in the skip.
But does that render our artists as more product than person on social media, with only the present edition ever on display?
I'm not expecting to find grand revelations about Dua Lipa via Instagram, but it is nice to scroll through the evolution of an artist, even if that's just following their hair journey.
More than any one artist's history, it's the spontaneity that social media once offered — the chance to connect to artists you love — that has been sanded down.
When even deleting everything is to be expected, maybe it's time to try and do something new.",Unknown,Tue 24 Oct 2023,0
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-23/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-what-it-means-for-the-nfl/103008678,Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are a phenomenon that is not going away — here's what it means for the NFL,"Travis Kelce enjoyed one of the biggest and best days of his NFL career in Kansas City's victory over the LA Chargers on Sunday.
The Chiefs' Super Bowl-winning tight end was on track for a record-breaking game at half time, scoring a touchdown in the 31-17 win.
His touchdown was helped, in no small part, by a solid push from the developing partnership with Taylor — teammate Jawaan, that is.
Yet, for many, the real story — and real Taylor — was in the stands, where pop superstar Taylor Swift was watching on.

It shouldn't be a surprise that Kelce was impressive with Swift watching — he averages 108 yards receiving per game when Swift is watching on in the stands, compared to just 46.5 per game on the occasions she hasn't been present this year or, as the NFL wrote on their in-game graphic, when ""left to his own devices"" under a ""You belong with TE"" header.
The Chiefs are still undefeated when Swift attends their games — she's attended four now and only missed one game against the Minnesota Vikings in Minneapolis in Week 5 (although the Chiefs won that one too).
However, it's not just on the field where the Swift Effect has been in evidence.

Rumours had been swirling that there was a ""friendship"" developing between Swift and Kelce for a short while earlier in the season, but she was first seen at the Chiefs' Arrowhead stadium on September 25, sitting next to Travis's mother Donna Kelce in the player box as Kansas City powered past the Chicago Bears.
Kelce even scored a touchdown, with Swift shown screaming ""let's f***ing go"" in an extravagant show of support, before hugging mumma Kelce.
It had clearly been a topic of conversation in the locker room.
""I heard she [Swift] was in the house,"" quarterback Patrick Mahomes said after the game.
""I knew I had to get it to Trav … I think he wanted to get in the end zone just as much as all the Swifties wanted him to.""
The impact off the pitch was instant.

Hollywood Reporter said Fox's broadcast of the Chief-Bears game averaged 24.32 million viewers, the most of the weekend.
Fans were treated to multiple — and I mean, multiple — shots of Swift in her suite, cheering on her then-rumoured love interest.
The day after the game, sales of Travis Kelce's jersey were up nearly 400 per cent, according to a spokesperson for Fanatics, the NFL official apparel partner.
The spokesperson told AP that Kelce's 87 jersey ""was one of the top-five-selling NFL players"" on that day.
In fact, according to data analysis of Google Trends by betting site Replay Poker, searches for ""Travis Kelce jersey"" were 12 times higher than average and the highest since February's Super Bowl.
In that game, during what may become known as the pre-Swift era, Kelce caught six passes for 81 yards and scored a touchdown.
The data also showed that search interest in Kelce's jersey overtook searches for quarterback Patrick Mahomes's kit for the first time in their shared history.
Swift's appearance also resulted in a three-fold increase in ticket sales in a 24-hour window for Chiefs home games on ticket selling website StubHub.

The interest did not stop there.
The following week, the Chiefs were in New York to take on the Jets.
Speculation that Swift would be there supposedly increased interest among punters in attending that game.
StubHub reportedly saw a 175 per cent increase in sales for the game, with nearly 20 per cent of tickets for the game available on the site sold the night of Swift's appearance, according to Reuters.
The Chiefs-Jets game was also the second-highest-selling game for the weekend.
And Swift did turn up, with an entourage that included Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Sophie Turner, Sabrina Carpenter and Australian actor Hugh Jackman. Talk about star power.

Because Swift is such a massive star that even being associated with the 33-year-old is a recipe for success — in the 24 hours following Swift's appearance at Arrowhead, Kelce had over 300,000 more Instagram followers and his podcast went from being ranked in the low 100s to number one in the Apple Store.
Sure, he's still a long way shy of the 274 million Instagram followers Swift has on the social media platform, but then again, so is the NFL's official account, which has 28.5 million followers — roughly 10 per cent of Swift.
The increase in sales is important, but the demographic is, too.
According to Reuters, digital media player manufacturer Roku said the largest demographic increase for the Chiefs-Bears game was among women aged 18-49.
That represents a 63 per cent increase from the week prior.
The NFL has enjoyed a roughly 50 per cent female audience share for a while and is the number one ranked sport among Americans aged between 8-24, according to its own statistics — but any opportunity to target a new demographic cannot be sniffed at.

The partnership between the NFL and Swift is a twinning of arguably the two biggest forces in American popular culture — and the NFL are doing everything they can to cash in on it.
""It was a perfect storm of pop culture and sports colliding in a really positive way, with two incredibly passionate fan bases merging together and interacting in ways that they hadn't before,' Ian Trombetta, the NFL's senior vice president of social, influencer and content marketing told AP.
""So for us, it's fantastic,""
""Hopefully those — especially the young women — that have now gained an interest in not only Travis Kelce, but the NFL more broadly, can stay with us throughout the year and years to come.""

When the Chiefs won the Jets game, the NFL briefly changed its status to reflect's Swift's presence.
And that in itself is not a surprise.
Travis Kelce is a generational talent at tight end and the second-best player in the NFL's best team of this generation behind Patrick Mahomes.
He also knows the value of self-promotion.
As well as hosting a podcast with his brother, Jason Kelce, who plays centre for the Philadelphia Eagles, he has also appeared on TV reality shows to boost his brand.
Kelce appeared on the eponymous reality dating show Catching Kelce in 2016, when ""50 women from 50 states vie to win the heart of the pro football player"".
As he said of the show when he was guest host of Saturday Night Live following the Chiefs' Super Bowl win: ""It was kind of like The Bachelor, except instead of roses, I handed out footballs, and instead of watching, people did not.""

In the end, Kelce chose Maya Benberry (Kentucky) and they dated. Briefly.
Since then, though, Kelce has not been shy about wanting to meet Swift — he even made her a friendship bracelet, being a well-known marker of Swifties — with his number on it and wanted to give it to her after she performed in Kansas City in July earlier this year, but he did not get the chance to meet her.
""I was disappointed … She doesn't meet anybody, or at least she didn't want to meet me, so I took it personal,"" Kelce said of the non-meeting on his podcast.
He later named Swift as his celebrity crush and, as such, acknowledged that he had ""brought all this attention to me"".
ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.
""I'm the one that did the whole friendship bracelet thing and told everybody how butthurt I was that I didn't get to meet Taylor.
""You miss 100 per cent [of the shots] you don't take, baby.
""What's real is that it is my personal life.
""I want to respect both of our lives. She's not in the media as much as I am doing this show every single week.""
Incidentally, Swift has got her bracelet now, seen wearing a band with Kelce's 87 on it during the victory against the Chargers.
This is the Gen Z version of Posh Spice and Becks — the pop-star/athlete crossover romance between English footballer David Beckham and Spice Girl Victoria Adams that blossomed in the late '90s for the kids at the back — but on a scale that is simply unprecedented in the social media age.
A risk of that is over-saturation — particularly on broadcasts where any time Kelce does anything on the field, it's only a matter of seconds before the TV director cuts to Swift in the stands.
Previously, the only Kelce-Swift connection NFL fans were interested in was that between Jason and D'Andre at Philadelphia. (Getty Images: Dustin Satloff)
""Is the NFL overdoing it?"" Jason Kelce — whose Philadelphia Eagles team is the one Swift supposedly supports — asked Travis on a recent episode of the podcast they share.
The NFL, though, defended milking the budding romance as much as they could.
""We frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what's happening in and around our games, as well as culturally,"" the NFL said in a statement published by People in October.
""The Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we've leaned into in real-time.
""It's an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we've seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.""
Other teams have latched onto the romance too — with the Eagles highlighting their own Kelce-Swift partnership between Jason and D'Andre.
So, for the time being at least, if you're planning on watching the Chiefs play, be prepared to be exposed to plenty of Taylor Swift content.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-21/seinfeld-bit-adult-friendships-im-clinging-to-inverse-lesson/103001116,"When motherhood threw a grenade at my friendships, I tossed away some poor advice and found a new tribe","I don't know a person over 40 who can't recite by heart Jerry Seinfeld's famous riff about not making new friends in your 30s.
""Whoever you have in your life by then, that's who you're going with: you're not interviewing, you're not looking at new applications. 'Sorry — I'm not hiring'.""
OK – I probably know quite a few who don't know it – but it's not like I see them anymore…
Making friends in your thirties - Seinfeld
At a certain point in your life — and yes, it's the same point at which you seem to suddenly develop a passion for birdwatching — you realise you're done with making friends, you're full-up and you're just not hiring anymore.
And that, unlike the really gorgeous birdbath that you buy, may well be the biggest mistake you ever make.
The ABC's Megan Macdonald took a look at this, following alarming research earlier this year that showed one in three Australian adults are dealing with heartbreaking loneliness. How do you make new friends when you're no longer a kid in the park with a ball, which of course was the only pre-condition we ever needed to make that new connection?
The answer, according to some women she met who no longer wanted to feel so alone, is get practical: how about one friendship date a week for an entire year? Fifty-two of them?
I was that Seinfeld person once: fully hired, tribal, locked into a clutch of overlapping friendship groups that were just enough for me. In fact, I think I may have been that person who was actively hostile to the idea of anyone ""new"" joining the group. I wanted things to stay just as they were.
Until I realised that the world was full of fascinating people; and that life was speeding by while I was trying to keep everything comfortably the same.
Friendship blind dates and dinner parties with strangers: Creative ways these women are trying to make new friends in adulthood
I had to realise that the only form of life is change. That stasis – the true representation of stasis – is death. And it was way too soon for that.
Most discussions for women around friendships later in life centre on ending ""toxic"" friendships: the ones that have been slowly boiling you alive without you realising it. It's a frog-kisses-off-the-princess story, with an unusually happy ending. For men, the conversations focus on how commonly men can neglect their friendships, relying on partners to keep the social diary and keep social connections alive.
But we rarely discuss the joy that can come from crossing the room of your life to ask that stranger on the other side if they'd like to dance. It's one the of the scariest things you'll ever do as a grown up: open yourself up to the vulnerability of asking someone to be your friend.
But if you do, and it works, its exhilarating. And feels like life in some way has restarted for you, anew.
Late motherhood threw a grenade into my carefully tilled field of friendships. While everyone I knew was thrilled for me, once my son was born a couple of them melted away — not unkindly, and maybe even sorrowfully, but they did so decidedly, and I suspect also with a sense that the childless person they knew and relied on had been changed utterly and they could no longer find their place among it all.
Perhaps I had become less reliable, less focused on them with this life change. It's something I can understand well, and I never challenged any of my old friends on what they did.
We do what we can to manage in this world. They had to do what worked for them.
How do you make new friends when you're no longer a kid in the park with a ball? (ABC)
I got some poor advice in those early months: to steer clear of mothers' groups and the like because, as a relatively well-known and older mum, I wouldn't be likely to find kindred spirits, but would instead draw the sort of curiosity that I wouldn't enjoy.
After those first couple of weeks at home, starting to sink under the waves with a newborn, I tossed that advice and marched into my local maternal child health centre. There I found Beth, with her beautiful daughter Audrey, born just the day before Addison, and even though she now lives in another town and we rarely see each other, we feel each other's presence as if at the end of a tow-rope: firmly anchoring us to each other, and our every text, our every conversation picks up just where we were and is as full of love and care as it was with our newborns.
There is something very powerful about the connections you make in those sleep-deprived, struggling first days. I know that months could go by, but if I called Beth at 3am and told her I was in trouble, she'd ask only if I wanted her to stop and pick up coffee on her way to me.
When my son started school I had an awful sinking feeling. I could not imagine finding a tribe given my friends were well out of the school-gate years by the time I was finally able to fall pregnant. There's no serum slick enough to make you feel less old as you cluster with the bona fide yummy mummies at 3:30pm bell, their morning lycra still attached to admirably firm thighs.
Start your weekend with the best of the ABC's journalism, presented by Virginia Trioli. Discover compelling features, big ideas and revealing analysis to understand the stories that matter to Australians.
I don't know what I did to enjoy the good fortune, but instead I met and made friends with a group of incredibly kind, smart, funny women who, like me, are the ones on the school chat desperately asking at 9pm just what the kids are supposed to go dressed as tomorrow.
These later in life friends feel like a gift. Time speeds by when we are together, and yet I age backwards when I am with them.
I think that's the inverse lesson of the Seinfeld credo: each new friend that you're lucky enough, brave enough to make takes you back to the joy of your younger friendships and creates a time machine in your life.
This weekend, as well as reading about how you can make your next great friends, you can hang out with your other besties: Delta, Sam and Dolly. They'll be delighted to see you.
Have a safe and happy weekend, and next week I might have something to say on the fascinatingly divided commentary about Madonna's new Celebration tour, a retrospective of her almost five decades at the very top of the music business.
She's not an easy one to love these days, but you cannot deny her success or pop brilliance: so why the snark? I'll get to that.
In the meantime, if she's finally prepared to embrace her past, so can we.

""Growing up, I'd see the South by Southwest name across performances on YouTube,"" he told ABC News.
""And then when I got the email saying I was doing it this year, it just felt like a no-brainer.""
In its world-first debut outside of Austin, Texas, groundbreaking festival South by Southwest is coming to Sydney. So what is it? And how can punters get involved?
The Western Sydney rapper and producer played two sets at the creative arts festival this week.
SXSW has been held in Austin, Texas since its inception in 1987, but ventured outside of North America for the first time in Sydney.
The festival draws crowds from around the world for conferences, showcases, and acts across music, tech, and film.
It is known for turning emerging talent into household names, with a finger on the pulse for discovering the 'next big thing'.
Garcia is one of 13 west and south-west Sydney artists representing the area on the music line-up over the last week.
""My friends and I say 'haps', and SXSW Sydney just looks like the place where it's all happening,"" the 21-year-old said.
""It just feels sick to be doing stuff at a kind of official level with people that I really look up to.
Singer-songwriter Ashley Dawes has played at SXSW twice this year.
The 23-year-old, who performs as Ashli, brought her pop, soul, and R'n'B set to Texas back in March, and described it as an ""out-of-body experience"".
""The highlight was just meeting people, who come from all parts of the US, all parts of the world really, and seeing them engaged with the stories that I'm telling with my music was super priceless and motivating.""

Dawes played again in Sydney on Thursday and Friday and said the best part was sharing her new releases with the SXSW audience seven months on.
""There's nothing like home, it's kind of like when a sports team is playing a home game, it just hits different.
The New Jersey-born woman moved to Penrith when she was 11 years old and has lived there ever since.
Zion Garcia used to watch SXSW performances on YouTube as a child.  (Supplied)
""Growing up in the area and seeing all these artists rise and be proud of where we're from has influenced me a lot as a person and an artist,"" she told ABC News.
Garcia said he had always seen Western Sydney as a microcosm of Australia — an expansive, multicultural area boasting its own lingo, and where where no corner is the same.
He looks to the diversity around him, and his own Tongan-Spanish heritage to inspire his work.
""Western Sydney is undeniably, community-based. It's just beautiful, vibrant, there's so much untapped potential and culture that's there,"" he said.
Sudanese-Australian rapper Veronica Peter, known on stage as Vv Pete, describes her music as having a ""party vibe"".
""It's baddie, it's just embrace yourself and have fun with it,"" the 22-year-old told ABC News.
Peter raps about the inner goings of her life, including growing up in Mount Druitt, which she refers to as ""seven O'block"" after its postcode digits 2770.
""The things that you see happening, everything that I've gone through, my childhood – whether it's traumatic or fun, I feel like it's just influenced my life and shaped me to become who I am today.""
She said hip-hop subgenres like drill and trap are popular in Western Sydney, but most artists in the area lean into their own sound.
Vv Pete hopes to bring her ""party vibe"" to her SXSW act and beyond. (Supplied)
""I really do respect artists like myself who are really authentic to themselves — who are like their own genre,"" Peter said.
There's so much amazing music to see. You just have to be willing to get to it.
The cultural richness of the community is also reflected in the range of music coming out of the west, Dawes said.
But the scene isn't insular, Dawes argued, saying its inclusivity expands beyond Western Sydney.
""People who may have never found something that they liked in the Sydney scene feel represented by the music that's coming out of Sydney,"" she said.
""It's an integral part of a big puzzle piece.""
Sydney's nightlife and creative scene has been stunted in the last decade by lockout laws and lockdowns.
But despite the circumstances, Peter has faith the city can claw its way back to greatness.
SXSW Sydney begins the slow reveal of creatives who will take part when the music, gaming, technology and screen festival travels outside North America for the first time in October.
""Sydney is such a beautiful place with great scenery,"" she said.
""I feel like SXSW is going to elevate the city because it's been quite dead lately.""
Peter is playing her second show at SXSW today at the University of Technology Sydney.
""I am super honoured to be on the line-up, it's great for exposure, for clout and for elevation.""
Garcia said artists from out west could sometimes be viewed as an afterthought, othered from the city's wider scene.
""Western Sydney is Sydney, it's part of the overall landscape ... I think Western Sydney artists always get given, almost like a crutch.""
He hopes SXSW Sydney brings ""more of an understanding"" and recognition of what Western Sydney artists are creating.
""There's just so much life there that I think it's a shame people haven't gotten access to it yet ... Western Sydney could be the next San Francisco or New York,"" Garcia said.
""Hopefully people can get a sense of how much we are not playing around. We love doing what we're doing and we have such big ambitions.""
Peter said she hopes Australian artists continue to get the exposure they deserve.
""Mostly when people ask, 'who's your favourite artist?' everyone tends to turn to American artists.
""But I'd like people to also recognise Sydney, Melbourne, Perth,"" she said.
""There's good talent here.""

Garcia hopes Australia can secure its seat at the table when it comes to cultural influence and sees events like SXSW Sydney as an important step.
""I don't want people here to feel like we have to leave to make it.

His parents were Christians who weren't big fans of The Beatles — with their penchant for drugs and ""controversial"" hair — and thought the Fab Four would fade into obscurity.
""They weren't quite right on that one,"" the 51-year-old Paul MacCartney said, now a doctor and addiction medicine specialist.
Sir Paul McCartney — the second best songwriter of all time according to Rolling Stone — recently touched down in Australia for yet another world tour, aged 81.
Dr Paul has been preparing himself for an uptick in bad jokes.

The extra 'a' in his surname made no difference. Growing up in Melbourne's south-east suburbs, teachers would often single him out in school roll calls.
""At university when we first started, everybody had to write their name down on a list that went round the lecture theatre,"" Dr MacCartney said.
""By the end of that session there were two or three John Lennons, a couple of Ringo Starrs, and just one Paul MacCartney.""
But there have been some silver linings.
""When I was younger I sang in a band and maybe that was some kind of determinism,"" he said.
""It was always good to put it on a poster … and always a talking point on interviews.""

After giving up his dreams of pop stardom, Dr Paul found the name also came in handy as a doctor, helping break the ice with patients and ensuring they'd remember his name.
Dr Paul himself was never a huge fan of The Beatles. He owns just a couple of records — one of which was a best of — and no functioning record player.
Instead of an idol, Sir Paul was more of a spectre in his life — someone whose movements he was forced to follow by virtue of other people's comments, like when John Lennon died or Sir Paul got caught bringing marijuana into Japan.

It's also been a source of confusion.
""I did have a patient who was seeing another doctor, and the doctor wanted to know who their GP was, and my patient said 'my GP's Paul MacCartney',"" he said.
He said his kids were also sick of people's reaction when they found out their dad's name was Paul MacCartney.

As Sir Paul's private life became arguably tamer, the quips did die down to an extent.
Dr Paul still gets his fair share. It's not quite eight days a week, but at least once, often multiple.
""There's no good ones. I think I have a running bet for somebody who can come up with something original after all this time,"" he said.
Dr Paul has decided to embrace it, buying tickets for his whole family to Sir Paul's Melbourne concert this weekend.

But Oscar, Emmys and Golden Globes winner Nicole Kidman was on the South By Southwest Sydney (SXSW) stage on Thursday to talk about what it's like to produce film and television as opposed to starring in it.
Kidman said it was the first time she'd spoken in this capacity and was joined on stage by her production company co-founder at Blossom Films Per Saari, with her childhood friend Peter Overton, from the Nine Network, asking the questions.
While they couldn't talk about specific projects due to the actors' strike in Hollywood, Kidman and Saari gave an insight into what it's like to work behind the scenes, with topics ranging from knocking on doors, never giving up and teaming up with people you'd have dinner with, to being unable to find a bathroom on set.
""I have peed in the bush,"" Kidman told the audience.
""Because there was nothing around and we had very little time when we were losing the light. So, it's like, go behind the tree.""

The audience reacted with laughter, with Kidman continuing.
""Hey, you've got to do what you've got to do to get the shot.""
Speaking about finding a great location, only to realise once the cameras were rolling that it was on a flight path, Kidman said embracing the mistakes is often the key to making great content.

""If that's what it is, then you just stay very, very calm, almost like in a trance. Because if you do fight it, you'll get even worse.
""It will give something to the scene.
""Don't resist it, don't fight it… a lot of the mistakes are the things that actually make it magic.""
Kidman and Saari revealed Blossom Films was about to start filming a John Polson-directed project, The Last Anniversary, based on the book by Liane Moriarty, having already adapted her novels Big Little Lies and Nine Perfect Strangers.
""[It's an] Australian project with Australian accents for the world,"" Kidman said to applause.
Around 2,500 people gathered to witness the SXSW featured session with Nicole Kidman and Per Saari in conversation with Peter Overton. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)
The audience clapped again when Kidman mentioned the late TV pioneer Brian Walsh.
""This is his project,"" she said.
""He was watching over it.
""He wanted Binge and Foxtel to have it and he fought like crazy to get it and it's devastating that he's not here to … but maybe he is.
""Brian's been a huge part of my life, through my whole career. And to be able to just still continue his legacy is fantastic.
""So, Brian Walsh, we miss you and we love you.""
Peter Overton, Nicole Kidman and Per Saari greeted a captivated audience at SXSW Sydney. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)
The panel acknowledged Kidman's mother, who was in the audience, but Kidman pushed back when Overton referred to Saari as her ""second husband"".
""My other husband,"" she laughed and later gave a shout-out to Keith Urban when Overton again used the word husband to refer to Saari.
Budgeting was another topic on the agenda, with Kidman saying they ""haven't lost money for anyone"".
Per Saari says the production company takes investors' funds seriously and is committed to delivering a return. (ABC News:  Brendan Esposito)
Saari said returning money to investors was something they didn't take lightly.
""That's a responsibility that we really take seriously,"" he said.
""Whether it's a studio or an independent financier or the dentist down the street, they invest in us and what we believed in and we owe that back.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-18/please-judge-this-book-by-its-cover/102986416,Why it really is OK to judge a book by its cover (and what those covers say about you),"If you're someone who has posted a book you like to socials, with a splash of saucy  golden light to boot; if you have checked a potential lover's bookshelves en route to the bedroom, just to make sure you're definitely horny; if your attention slips from the Zoom meeting towards your colleagues' shelves — indeed, if you have artfully positioned your desk in such a way that it invites others to do the same — then you are likely someone who has judged a book by its cover.
It's okay! Books are status symbols, baby. In addition to the literal stories on their pages, there are the stories we tell ourselves and the world when we buy them: stories about who we are and what we love. This is nothing new.
Since the Middle Ages, when books were literally gold leafed and bejewelled, we've been coveting and flaunting them.
And now, in this algorithm-driven world, where books are more accessible than ever, book covers are judging us write back (geddit?!).
""Liked this?"" those wondrous li'l thumbnails on the internet say mathematically, ""Well, you're gonna love this.""
On my shelf, this phenomenon has escalated to the point where I'm currently up to my beret in five distinct categories of cover. Go on then, read me like a book:

Have you noticed the cult of the headless literary woman? She's a little bit Fleabag, a little bit Sally Rooney — a precarious mostly-millennial with a vivid inner life, a sharp tongue and a minimalist wardrobe.
Picture the reprint of Ottessa Moshfegh's My Year of Rest and Relaxation, in which the glamorous redhead slumped forward on her armchair looks dead — her sky-blue skirt suit the same colour as the armchair's wool upholstery.
There's Meg Mason's Sorrow and Bliss covergirl, in full Freudian contortion on the couch.
Or, a favourite of mine from recent years, Zarah Butcher-McGunnigle's Nostalgia Has Ruined My Life, in which a headless portrait of the author herself is featured in a turtleneck and vintage dress, reclining next to a desiree potato.
Many mean little articles have been written to malign this decade's spate of cool girl novels, but what they forget is that well-dressed and depressed bitches are razor sharp and funny! Their sucker punch prose is delivered with a wink or an eye roll.
For as long as I suffer under capitalism, I will read these women and ponder luxury products I might like to purchase, and I encourage you, dear reader, to do the same. It's not the literary trend that has become a parody, but this moment in history itself.

There's a meme doing the rounds. It's a packet of beef jerky swinging from a convenience store display. The pattern on the packet is colourful, like a camo print rendered as a sunset. Then there's the complementary fonts – a jaunty, handwritten one sandwiched between a modern, all-caps sans serif.
""Why does this beef jerky look like it's going to be shortlisted for the National Book Award?"" says the meme. The beef jerky could be the latest title from Torrey Peters, Brit Bennett, Akwaeke Emezi, Kylie Reid…
These blob covers are weird, because they give no clue about the diverse perspectives, they represent. These are mostly books by women and gender diverse folk, often people of colour, sometimes queer.
Maybe it's a way for publishers to play it safe — to suggest a book's broad literary appeal, its likely contention for prizes, without reducing the subject matter down to clunky signifiers that will date badly (remember when loads of books by Black writers featured red sunsets on their covers? Or blurry bejewelled women? Or Baobab trees?).
Maybe it's because they're cheap to reproduce? Maybe it's just because they look cool stacked on top of each other next to a croissant and a latte?
Whatever the reason, these are modern books for modern times: best consumed on the train, in the cafe and in bed on lazy weekend mornings. Propulsive page turners, they're also brilliant for book clubs.

Up to your turtleneck in unread Fitzcarraldo editions, Faber Classics, Daunt imprints, Vintage classics, Giramondo and Semiotext(e) titles, and/or the Penguins and Viragos?
Shout-out to those whose covers of choice are spartan, tending towards a serif font, a matte paper stock and a (minimal) signature colour palette.
There's status flexing here too, though it's of a different kind. The curatorial power of certain publishing houses means they can market themselves as taste makers, their authors as bankable good and the folks who read them chic and austere.
This is the legacy of Sir Allen Lane, who revolutionised publishing in 1935 with Penguin's cheap, uniform and widely available paperback. Sidenote, his brief to the designer for the imprint's iconic cartoon namesake was for something ""dignified yet flippant"", which could describe some of the choices I've made at bookshops in the past.
These books are the literary equivalent of Didion's mohair throw from her 1979 packing list chronicled in The White Album: they're always going to be stylish and relevant; they're always going to look good; they're great for all seasons.

Another meme. This one says ""Do women still like flowers or have I gotta buy an oil painting of her favourite snacks and beverages?"" My bookshelf not only likes flowers (Gretchen Shirm's The Crying Room) and oil paintings of my favourite snacks (Marlowe Granados' Happy Hour, Olivia Laing's Crudo) but also a series of other highly stylised photographs and drawings of stuff: rubber dish gloves (Sarah Krasnostein's The Trauma Cleaner); cigarettes (Nadja Spiegelman's I'm Supposed to Protect You From All This), art and stock photos (Rachel Cusk, Deborah Levy).
Think of the ripe fruit, moody and sensual, on the cover of Lisa Taddeo's mega blockbuster Three Women, which made this genre famous.
Loosely, these books occupy the memoir/biography/essay collection/autofiction realm, and are most sought out by people for whom interiority, rumination and self-interrogation is the plat du jour. Delish!

These ones need no real introduction: Zadie Smith, Lorrie Moore, Jen Beagin, Donna Tart, Bernadine Evaristo, Hanya Yanagihara.
Dominated by a massive strapline and massive colours, they seem to adhere to the DOORS! DOORS! DOORS! school of product placement, where it's not enough to merely say it on the tin, you gotta shout it in high volume across the tarmac at the airport.
Speaking of airports, these are the literary juggernauts that you often see for sale there. Best enjoyed on a banana lounge by a pool, these ones. Spill a bit of piña colada on them and leave them at the hotel for the next lucky reader.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-17/nicolas-cage-sighted-in-busselton-filming-the-surfer-movie/102986390,'You look like Nicolas Cage': Shop owner's suspicions confirmed as Hollywood actor browses Busselton,"Shop owner Annie Liban had no idea actor Nicolas Cage was shooting a movie in WA until he walked through the doors of her small Asian grocery store in Busselton.
The Hollywood star is believed to be filming the movie The Surfer in the popular tourist region.
The film tells the story of his character's return to his home town and a feud with a local gang of surfers.
The rumour mill had been running wild in recent months about Cage's plans to visit the South West.
But word didn't reach Ms Liban until the actor started browsing her shop shelves at lunch time on Monday.
""I said, 'Oh he looks like Nicolas Cage,' but I was like, 'What's he doing in this store,'"" she said.
""Why is he getting some eggs and some kimchi? We couldn't stop staring.""
She said staff barely recognised the star, but eventually worked up the courage to ask who he was.
""There were some clues … he was wearing boots in hot weather and a jacket, wearing some Prada sunglasses and the voice as well,"" she said.
""And then when he picked up the oranges in front of the shop we said to him, 'We only accept cash,' and he said, 'I only have US dollars.'

The film is expected to star surfers from WA's South West and will be filmed in the famous Margaret River and Yallingup regions.
A call-out went to high school students in August, asking for confident kids with a bit of ""attitude"" to be in the film.
Ms Liban said she was one of Cage's fans.
""Growing up in the Philippines, we love Nicolas Cage, so I am so looking forward to seeing that movie he's doing here in Australia,"" she said.
The Surfer is being filmed around Yallingup in WA's South West. (Supplied)
City of Busselton Mayor Grant Henley said it was a win for the region to have Cage — and the film's cast and crew — in town.

""[These things] have a huge economic spin-off to the region … accommodation and costs with a crew of that magnitude, you have 100 people here for a month, which is a massive injection of cash in the local economy,"" Mr Henley said.
Australian movies such as Drift with Sam Worthington and the karting movie Go! have been set in the region before.
However, Mr Henley said it was exciting to see Hollywood come to the region — and help boost the city's exposure.
""I think this movie obviously packs some star-pulling power to get someone like Nicolas Cage involved in filming,"" he said.
""So that will be a larger magnitude than perhaps some of those Australian-made films with a lot smaller budgets and perhaps distributions.
