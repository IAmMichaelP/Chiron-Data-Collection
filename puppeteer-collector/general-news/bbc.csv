Mike Jeffries will now be held in custody and treated in hospital for an initial period of up to four months to determine if his condition is likely to improve enough for the case to proceed.
Mr Jeffries' legal team said last December he has dementia and late onset Alzheimer's disease.
He is accused of using his wealth, power and status to traffic and sexually abuse vulnerable men over years - alleged crimes that could carry a life-term jail sentence.
Judge Nusrat Choudhury agreed on Friday that the defendant was ""suffering from a mental disease or defect"", making him ""unable to understand"" court proceedings.
The ruling followed an assessment by two medical experts - one designated by Mr Jeffries' defence team, the other chosen by prosecutors.
Judge Choudhury said in a court order that Mr Jeffries would be treated in hospital for up to four months to see if he is likely to regain competency.
Once a follow-up assessment is complete, the defendant could either face trial or the court will weigh up next steps.
These could include dropping the criminal charges against him, or releasing him to home confinement.
Mr Jeffries was arrested and charged last October along with his British partner, Matthew Smith, 61, and their middleman, James Jacobson, 72.  All three deny the allegations.
US prosecutors allege the men used force, fraud and coercion to make young men, many of whom were aspiring models, engage in violent and exploitative sex acts while Mr Jeffries was chief executive from at least 2008 until 2015.
The charges followed a 2023 BBC documentary and ongoing podcast series that revealed the three of them benefited from a sophisticated operation in which recruiters scouted young men for sex in cities including London, New York, Paris and Marrakesh.
The BBC has since revealed that more than 40 men, including Abercrombie & Fitch employees, have now come forward with civil allegations of sexual assault, drugging or rape - with claims dating back to 1992, the year Mr Jeffries started running the company.
Civil trial lawyers have told the BBC their clients are dismayed at the criminal court's decision that Mr Jeffries is unfit to stand trial.
""We've been speaking with our clients who are disappointed by the decision and still want justice,"" said Brad Edwards and Brittany Henderson, representing 26 alleged victims.
Brian Bieber, Mr Jeffries' criminal defence lawyer, said his client had recently been evaluated by doctors who determined he had Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body disease, and the residual effects of a traumatic brain injury requiring around-the-clock care, which ""will almost certainly worsen over time"".
Dr Cheryl Paradis, the US prosecutor's medical expert, also independently assessed Mr Jeffries. According to court papers, she found he was unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to properly assist in his defence.
""His memory impairment almost certainly would cause him to be unable to accurately recall key events and details,"" Dr Paradis said, according to the court filings, ""and severely limit his capacity to provide accurate and reliable information"".
She added: ""Additionally, his inappropriate behaviour, which is a symptom of his dementia, could further interfere with his ability to maintain proper courtroom demeanour. He may blurt out self-incriminating statements or engage in erratic behaviour, which would undermine his credibility.""
The BBC understands that Mr Jacobson and Mr Smith could still face trial on the same sex-trafficking and prostitution charges.
Alongside criminal charges, Mr Jeffries and his partner Mr Smith have been defending multiple civil lawsuits accusing them of rape, sex trafficking and assault, which they ""vehemently deny"".
The civil lawsuits had been stayed - or legally put on pause - until the resolution of the criminal case, which takes precedence to protect Mr Jeffries' right against self-incrimination.
While his criminal case remains uncertain, Mr Jeffries could still face a civil trial or reach a settlement over the allegations. If this was the case, the outcome could lead to compensation being awarded to alleged victims.
""Mike Jeffries attacked these men and ruined their lives at a point when they were at their most vulnerable and chasing their dreams,"" said civil case lawyer, Brad Edwards.
""He will still be held accountable by our lawsuit and his co-conspirators will still face the criminal justice system.
""For anyone affected still in fear about coming forward, you should be reassured that his power is now totally gone"".
Abercrombie & Fitch is also being sued for negligence, with lawsuits claiming that it knowingly facilitated ""heinous sexual crimes"".
The company - which also owns the Hollister brand - has previously said it was ""appalled and disgusted"" by Mr Jeffries' alleged behaviour.",Rianna Croxford,3 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grd0wqy22o,US jobs grow by more than expected despite tariff turmoil,"Hiring in the US remained solid last month, despite turmoil stemming from changes to trade policy.
Employers added 177,000 jobs in April, while the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2%, the Labor Department said.
The gain was bigger than many analysts had expected in a month marked by chaos in financial markets and rising concerns about the economy tracked in surveys of businesses and households.
The resilience of the US jobs market over the last few years has surprised analysts, helping to sustain spending even as households faced rising prices and a sharp jump in interest rates.
The latest figures have raised some hopes that the country may be able to weather the uncertainty from tariff policy without suffering a painful economic downturn.
But analysts expressed caution, noting that the impact of the sweeping import taxes announced by Donald Trump would take more time to be fully felt.
Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, said it was a good jobs report, despite revisions showing employers added fewer jobs in January and February than initially estimated.
""The key message coming from the totality of the data this week is that the US economy was fundamentally strong through the first week of April, however, the outlook remains very uncertain,"" he said.
The Labor Department's surveys were conducted less than two weeks after Trump announced his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, which have raised the average rate of import taxes in the US to the highest level in more than a century.
Many firms have said they are moving cautiously for now, citing rapid changes in policy and hope that Trump's promises of trade deals will bear fruit.
Hiring last month was led by healthcare, warehousing and transportation firms.
Employment declined in the federal government - where Trump has vowed to cut spending - but that was offset by gains in local government.
Payrolls also dropped at manufacturing and retail firms.
Average hourly pay rose 3.8% over the last 12 months, according to the report.
Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the figures suggested the US central bank does not face urgency to cut interest rates to support the economy.
""Why would the Fed start cutting rates right now when the unemployment rate is near record lows, the consumer is still fairly robust, and inflation is running above target?"" she said.
""The economy will weaken in the coming months but, with this underlying momentum, the US has a decent chance of averting recession if it can step back from the tariff brink in time.""",Natalie Sherman,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy79j2n7d4o,Temu to stop selling goods from China directly to US customers,"Temu has said it will stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform.
The online marketplace said sales would now be handled by ""locally based sellers"", with orders fulfilled from within the country.
The move comes as a duty-free rule for low-value packages is closed.
Temu, and rival Chinese retail giant Shein, had previously relied on the so-called ""de minimis"" exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without having to pay duties or import taxes.
Temu said it had been actively recruiting US firms to join the platform.
""All sales in the US are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country.
""The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses,"" it added.
Supporters of the de minimis loophole, which applied to parcels worth less than $800 (Â£600), argue it helped streamline the customs process.
But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs.
De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as ""of the smallest"".
In this context it refers to a US trade rule enacted by Congress in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import levies.
In the 21st Century, after a series of rises to the threshold, it allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to US customers without having to pay duties or taxes.
Shipments under the exemption accounted for more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US, according to the country's Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).
Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu had benefited greatly from the loophole.
Both platforms attracted millions of US customers with marketing blitzes that showcased their ultra-low prices
And it was the de minimis exemption that helped them offer those deals so cheaply.
Shein did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.
Last month, in almost identical statements, Shein and Temu said they had seen operating expenses rise ""due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs"", adding they would make ""price adjustments"" from 25 April.
In February, Trump briefly closed the loophole.
The suspension was quickly paused as customs inspectors, delivery firms and online retailers struggled to adapt to such a major change at short notice.
During the initial suspension of the exemption the US Postal Service temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.
The executive order announcing the latest move said it was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl.
It said many Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages ""to exploit the de minimis exemption"".
""These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone,"" it added.
The idea is not new. Last year, the Biden administration proposed rules intended to stop ""abuse"" of the exemption.
""The growing volume of de minimis shipments makes it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments,"" it said.
The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China.
Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on Chinese imports. His administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.
US authorities have also blamed the success of firms like Temu and Shein for putting strains on border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole surged from about 140 million a decade ago to more than one billion last year.
Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. The fee started at $100 and is due to rise to $200 at the beginning of June.
Even before these packages were subject to import taxes, US consumers were warned of potential price rises.
The American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy group, estimated last year that getting rid of the exemption would result in ""$8bn to $30bn in additional annual costs that would eventually be passed on to consumers"".
Chinese online retailers have also benefited from similar rules in the UK and the European Union.
In a move mirroring the US action, the UK has announced a review of low-value imports coming into the country.
In the UK, the current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than Â£135 without incurring import taxes.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the cheap goods are ""undercutting the British High Street and British retailers"".
The European Union has also proposed plans to scrap duty-free exemptions for parcels worth less than â¬150 (Â£127.50; $169.35).
Which means consumers in the UK and EU could soon also see prices rising.
Packages that arrived in the US under the exemption were inspected in the same way as other goods, including being checked for illegal substances. And most synthetic opioids are brought into the country through the border with Mexico, according to officials.
Some experts think ending the exemption will do little to curb illegal drugs and not address the challenges faced by US manufacturers.
There are also concerns the move will create more work for US border officials, who are already stretched as they try to stop drug smuggling.
According to pro-open trading association the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), removing the de minimis exemption would ""shift the CBP's focus away from the border, where a vast majority of illegal substances and products are entering the country.""
""CBP would need to hire and train new personnel, costing the agency millions or causing them to move agents from the already overburdened southern border,"" it added.",Peter Hoskins & Charlotte Edwards,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgnyplvdv8o,M&S supplier resorts to pen and paper after cyber attack,"One of Marks & Spencer's biggest suppliers has resorted to using pen and paper for orders as the disruption from the cyber attack on the retailer continues.
The boss of Greencore, which supplies sandwiches, rolls and wraps, says it has also ramped up deliveries by a fifth to make sure there is more than enough food for the bank holiday weekend.
M&S has been unable to offer online orders for clothing and homewares for over a week, and some stores have seen empty shelves as food deliveries have also been disrupted.
Two M&S workers told the BBC they were concerned about pay because they were unable to clock in and out of work and could not access staff apps.
In a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes situation at M&S, Greencore chief executive Dalton Philips said: ""In the absence of having all the systems speaking to each other, you revert to how it was 25 years ago.""
That means back to ""pen and paper"", he said.
Greencore has also been putting on additional shifts at its dedicated M&S factory in Northampton, putting more lorries on the road, and is sending more food to stores than they did over Christmas.
""They're a massive customer for us and we're trying to flood them with products to help them,"" said Mr Philips.
""There are times when you do need to revert to manual systems in any business... but look, it works well.
""With the challenges of the system we don't have intricate forecasting that we would have previously had, so we're just making sure that they've got everything they need and some more.""
George, not his real name, works at an M&S in Wales, and said it has been ""a nightmare"".
""We have been told pay will be given through a separate payment system. However, we have not been told whether the pay will be correct.
""Additionally, there have been back-and-forth instructions, which have changed hourly. For example: remove gift cards from shop floor, put them back (when working).""
One former M&S customer assistant from Scunthorpe, who retired from their store at the end of April, said they had been unable to clock in and out of work as a result of the attack.
""There is no way of receiving advice via managers or the outsourced HR,"" they told the BBC.
M&S has reassured staff that they will be paid for all contracted hours as usual.
As a former chief executive of the supermarket chain Morrisons, Mr Philips knows only too well the pressure M&S bosses are under.
""They will be literally working 24/7. You've got to work your way through it. Whenever I've spoken to the team this week, it's been really impressive how calm and focused they are.
""I think if you work in retail, you know people are often the most on their game and motivated at those periods of intense pressure.""
Greencore has also sent a handful of its own staff to key M&S stores in London to provide extra support.
M&S hasn't released details on how its systems have been affected, saying only that some have been temporarily taken offline leading to pockets of limited availability in stores.
One food industry veteran who knows the business well thinks M&S will be focusing on making sure it can still provide all of its best-selling items.
""The issue is, if you've got 7,000 products, then obviously that's a lot of data to review.""
But he also pointed out that for big seasonal events there will be a lot of buying in advance and the company will have historical back-ups. Suppliers will also have a view on what will sell well.
Ged Futter, a former buyer for Asda who now runs his own consultancy advising suppliers, says M&S is in a difficult situation, but believes it will find a way round it as retailers are very good at finding solutions.
""If they have to, they'll use a fax machine. Any silo mentality disappears and everyone becomes very clearly focused on how to fix it.""
But the longer this goes on, the risk of damage to M&S's reputation and to its customer loyalty increases.
The company has been praised for its communications with customers, but has kept quiet on the nature of the attack and how it unfolded. That may not be sustainable for much longer.
The chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, Liam Byrne, has written to M&S chief executive Stuart Machin seeking reassurances, saying it was ""imperative"" to understand what had happened.
One person, who is a former chief executive at another firm and had to deal with a data breach, told the BBC the advice from his PR adviser was simple.
""Say nothing until you know everything. Then say everything. Then say nothing.""
M&S has been contacted for comment.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkx3vy54nzo,"Co-op cyber attack affects customer data, firm admits, after hackers contact BBC","Cyber criminals have told BBC News their hack against Co-op is far more serious than the company previously admitted.
Hackers contacted the BBC with proof they had infiltrated IT networks and stolen huge amounts of customer and employee data.
After being approached on Friday, a Co-op spokesperson said the hackers ""accessed data relating to a significant number of our current and past members"".
Co-op had previously said that it had taken ""proactive measures"" to fend off hackers and that it was only having a ""small impact"" on its operations.
It also assured the public that there was ""no evidence that customer data was compromised"".
The cyber criminals claim to have the private information of 20 million people who signed up to Co-op's membership scheme, but the firm would not confirm that number.
The criminals, who are using the name DragonForce, say they are also responsible for the ongoing attack on M&S and an attempted hack of Harrods.
The attacks have led government minister Pat McFadden to warn companies to ""treat cyber security as an absolute priority"".
The anonymous hackers showed the BBC screenshots of the first extortion message they sent to Co-op's head of cyber security in an internal Microsoft Teams chat on 25 April.
""Hello, we exfiltrated the data from your company,"" the chat says.
""We have customer database, and Co-op member card data.""
They also showed screenshots of a call with the head of security which took place around a week ago.
The hackers say they messaged other members of the executive committee too as part of their scheme to blackmail the firm.
Co-op has more than 2,500 supermarkets as well as 800 funeral homes and an insurance business.
It employs around 70,000 staff nationwide.
The cyber attack was announced by the company on Wednesday.
On Thursday, it was revealed Co-op staff were being urged to keep their cameras on during Teams meetings, ordered not to record or transcribe calls, and to verify that all participants were genuine Co-op staff.
The security measure now appears to be a direct result of the hackers having access to internal Teams chats and calls.
DragonForce shared databases with the BBC that includes usernames and passwords of all employees.
They also sent a sample of 10,000 customers data including Co-op membership card numbers, names, home addresses, emails and phone numbers.
The BBC has destroyed the data it received, and is not publishing or sharing these documents.
The Co-op membership database is thought to be highly valuable to the company.
Since the BBC contacted Co-op about the hackers' evidence, the firm has disclosed the full extent of the breach to its staff and the stock market.
""This data includes Co-op Group members' personal data such as names and contact details, and did not include members' passwords, bank or credit card details, transactions or information relating to any members' or customers' products or services with the Co-op Group,"" a spokesperson said.
DragonForce want the BBC to report the hack - they are apparently trying to extort the company for money.
But the criminals wouldn't say what they plan to do with the data if they don't get paid.
They refused to talk about M&S or Harrods and when asked about how they feel about causing so much distress and damage to business and customers, they refused to answer.
DragonForce is a ransomware group known for scrambling victims' data and demanding a ransom is paid to get the key to unscramble it. They are also known to have stolen data as part of their extortion tactics.
DragonForce operates an affiliate cyber crime service so anyone can use their malicious software and website to carry out attacks and extortions.
It's not known who is ultimately using the DragonForce service to attack the retailers, but some security experts say the tactics seen are similar to that of a loosely coordinated group of hackers who have been called Scattered Spider or Octo Tempest.
The gang operates on Telegram and Discord channels and is English-speaking and young â in some cases only teenagers.
Conversations with the Co-op hackers were carried out in text form - but it is clear the hacker, who called himself a spokesperson, was a fluent English speaker.
They say two of the hackers want to be known as ""Raymond Reddington"" and ""Dembe Zuma"" after characters from US crime thriller Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a 'blacklist'.
The hackers say ""we're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist"".
Co-op says it is working with the NCSC and the NCA and said in a statement it is very sorry this situation has arisen.
UK government officials have met over the cyber attacks, with national security staff and the chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre discussing support for retailers.
In a keynote speech next week setting out government action, minister Pat McFadden - who has responsibility for cyber security - will say the attacks need to be a ""wake-up call"" for every UK business.
""In a world where the cybercriminals targeting us are relentless in their pursuit of profit - with attempts being made every hour of every day - companies must treat cyber security as an absolute priority.
""We've watched in real-time the disruption these attacks have caused - including to working families going about their everyday lives.
""It serves as a powerful reminder that just as you would never leave your car or your house unlocked on your way to work. We have to treat our digital shop fronts the same way.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1jwe7582o,Trump signs order to block funding to public radio,"US President Donald Trump has issued an executive order calling for all federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) to be blocked.
On Thursday evening, Trump alleged that both organisations have engaged with ""biased and partisan news coverage"".
The order instructs the board of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting (CPB), which distributes funding to PBS and NPR stations, to ""cease direct funding"" to the ""maximum extent allowed by law"".
PBS called the order ""blatantly unlawful"", while CPB said the organisation is not ""a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority"".
Meanwhile, Radio Free Asia, which receives funding from the government, said on Friday it was shutting down most of its news broadcasts and letting most staff go.
CEO Bay Fang said the cuts were due to the Trump administration withholding congressionally allocated funding, even though a federal judge sided with the broadcaster last week.
The executive order says the board should ""decline to provide future funding"" to the news organisations.
""Which viewpoints NPR and PBS promote does not matter,"" it continues.
""What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.""
Paula Kerger, CEO of PBS, called the president's order ""blatantly unlawful"" and said it ""threatens our ability to serve the American public with educational programming, as we have for the past 50-plus years"".
The White House has said that funding of news media is ""not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence"" and that the media landscape has become more ""diverse"".
However, the CPB budget has already been approved by Congress through 2027.
Patricia Harrison, CEO of the CPB, said the organisation is not ""a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority"".
""Congress directly authorised and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government,"" she said.
""In creating CPB, Congress expressly forbade 'any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting'.""
More than 40 million Americans listen to NPR public radio each week, and 36 million watch a local television station from the PBS network each month, according to their estimates.
NPR director Katherine Maher estimated in March that the radio station would receive about $120m (Â£90m) from the CPB in 2025, ""less than 5% of its budget.""
Both organisations have previously said that Trump's effort to cut funding could have a ""devastating impact"" on those who rely on them for credible news, including during emergency situations.
Media rights group RSF warned on Friday about ""an alarming deterioration in press freedom"" in the United States under Trump and ""unprecedented"" difficulties for independent journalists around the world.
Following the news of Trump's executive order, REM singer Michael Stipe was among the figures offering support to the journalists affected.
""Whether it's music or a free press â censorship anywhere is a threat to the truth everywhere,"" he said in a statement. ""On World Press Freedom Day, I'm sending a shout-out to the brave journalists at Radio Free Europe.""",Yasmin Rufo,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgrwxp5r15o,Meta threatens to cut off Facebook in Nigeria over huge fines,"People in Nigeria may lose access to Facebook and Instagram after parent company Meta said it faced large fines and  ""unrealistic"" regulatory demands from the Nigerian authorities.
Last year, three Nigerian oversight agencies imposed fines on the US-based social media giant totalling more than $290m (Â£218m) for violating various laws and regulations.
Meta was unsuccessful in a recent attempt to challenge the decisions in the federal high court in Abuja.
""The applicant may be forced to effectively shut down the Facebook and Instagram services in Nigeria in order to mitigate the risk of enforcement measures,"" the company said in the court papers.
Meta also owns WhatsApp, but it did not mention the messaging service in its statement.
The high court has given the company until the end of June to pay the fines.
The BBC has asked Meta to outline what its next steps will be but has not yet received a response.
Facebook is by far the most popular social media platform in Nigeria and is used by tens of millions in the country for daily communication and sharing news. It is also a vital tool for many of Nigeria's small online businesses.
In July last year, Meta was asked to pay three fines:
FCCPC chief executive officer Adamu Abdullahi said investigations carried out in conjunction with the data commission between May 2021 and December 2023 revealed ""invasive practices against data subjects/consumers in Nigeria"" but was not specific about what these were.
In its court submission, Meta said its ""primary concern"" was with the data commission, which it accused of ""misinterpreting"" data privacy laws.
Specifically, the commission has demanded that Meta seek prior approval before transferring any personal data out of Nigeria - a condition that Meta called ""unrealistic"".
The data commission also imposed other demands.
Meta was told it must provide an icon linking to educational videos about data privacy risks. This would be content created in collaboration with government-approved educational institutions and non-profit organisations.
The NDPC insisted that these videos highlight the dangers of ""manipulative and unfair data processing"" that could expose Nigerian users to health and financial risks.
Meta described the NDPC's demands as unfeasible, saying that the agency has failed to ""properly interpret the laws guiding data privacy"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg419qw9g15o,Talks or no talks: Who blinks first in US-China trade war?,"On Friday morning, a spokesperson for China's ministry of commerce announced that Beijing was assessing the possibility of tariff negotiations with the United States.
It was news the rest of the world had been waiting to hear as astonishingly high  tariffs - up to 245% on some Chinese exports to the US - throttle trade between the world's two biggest economies, raising the spectre of a recession.
""US officials have repeatedly expressed their willingness to negotiate with China on tariffs,"" the spokesperson told reporters.
""China's position is consistent. If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open... If the US wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel unilateral tariffs.""
The statement comes a day after a Weibo account linked to Chinese state media said the US had been seeking to initiate discussions, and a week after Trump claimed discussions were already underway â a suggestion Beijing denied.
""China has no need to talk to the United States,"" Yuyuantantian, a Weibo account affiliated with China Central Television (CCTV), said in Thursday's post. ""From the perspective of negotiations, the United States must be the more anxious party at present.""
Such comments follow a cycle of assertions and denials from both the US and China, as each side refuses to publicly initiate discussions.
The question is not whether those discussions will take place, but rather when, under what circumstances and at whose behest.
Experts characterise the tussle as a game of chicken between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as both men attempt to save face while covertly pursuing a mutually beneficial outcome â namely, a de-escalation of the trade war.
""I expect some of this back-and-forth, because neither Washington nor Beijing wants to look like they are the side that's giving in,"" says Ja Ian Chong, assistant professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.
""[But] a de-escalation would be to the overall benefit of both sides, so there is some overarching incentive to do so.""
Wen-Ti Sung, an academic member of the Australian Centre on China in the World, puts it another way: ""It's like two race cars going at each other: whoever swerves first will be seen as the weaker of the two parties. And at this juncture, neither party wants to look soft.""
The leader who admits he was the first to initiate tariff talks would be seen as the one compromising his position in negotiations.
""Whoever seems desperate loses bargaining leverage,"" Mr Sung says. ""Both sides want to portray the other side as the more desperate one.""
This peculiar stalemate â where both parties seek the same outcome, but neither wants to be the first to suggest it â has resulted in a tactic of ""constructive ambiguity"": the deliberate use of language so vague that each party could arguably claim to be in the right.
It is this tactic that Mr Sung points to as an explanation for Yuyuantantian's Weibo post.
""This is Beijing trying to explore the possibility of using word games to create an off-ramp for both sides, so that they can gradually climb their way down from this escalation spiral,"" he says.
One way to escape this game of chicken is when a third party mediates, offering both sides an off-ramp. The other option, Mr Sung explains, is a ""much looser understanding of what 'the other side has reached out' means"".
That way, the side that does indeed come to the table first is still able to characterise it as a response rather than the first move.
In Trump and Xi's case, it would also mean that tariff negotiations could begin with both leaders claiming to have achieved some kind of victory in the trade war.
The optics here are important. As Mr Chong points out, de-escalation is one thing â but another top priority for Trump and Xi is to ""deliver a win for their domestic audiences"".
""Trump obviously wants to show that he has made Beijing capitulate. And on the People's Republic of China side, Xi probably wants to show his own people and the world that he's been able to make Trump become more reasonable and moderate and accommodating,"" Mr Chong says.
On the domestic front, both leaders are facing tariff-induced headwinds. Trump this week struggled to quell fears of a recession as fresh data indicated the US economy contracted in its first quarter for the first time since 2022.
Meanwhile, Xi - who before the tariffs was already battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment - must reassure China's population that he can weather the trade war and protect an economy which has struggled to rebound post-pandemic.
""Both [Trump and Xi] recognise that at this point of the trade war, it's not going to be a winner-takes-all outcome for either side anymore,"" Mr Sung says.
""Trump recognises he's not going to get anywhere near 100% of what he wants, so he's trying to find a concession point where China can let him have just enough winning, especially for domestic purposes.""
While China is not unwilling, he adds, ""they are very much stuck on what's the right price point"".
For Xi, Mr Sung described the situation as a ""two-level game"".
""The China side needs to manage US-China bilateral negotiations, while domestically Beijing needs to save enough face so that the Chinese leadership can hold on to this narrative of 'the East is rising and the West is declining',"" he says.
""A kowtowing of the East towards the West is not a rising East.""
At the time of writing, the US has not denied China's claims that it has been attempting to initiate talks. But the fact that both sides have now made that assertion indicates there is ""some sort of contact"", according to Mr Chong.
""The two sides are talking,"" he says. ""And that is a sign that there is some possibility that some accommodation could be reached.""
But the start of negotiations does not mean that the US-China relationship - which was rocky even before Trump kicked off a trade war - is close to being steadied.
Mr Chong isn't holding his breath. For one, he believes the ""posturing"" suggests the two sides have not reached the point ""where they are both trying to seek a way out"".
""[Each party] may hope that there are concessions from the other side, so they're going to have this standoff until they see which side blinks first.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86jx18y9e2o,Apple says most US-bound iPhones no longer made in China,"Apple says it is shifting production of most iPhones and other devices to be sold in the US away from China, which has been the focus of President Donald Trump's tariffs.
The majority of the iPhones bound for the US market in the coming months will be made in India, while Vietnam will be a major production hub for items like iPads and Apple Watches, chief executive Tim Cook says.
It comes as the technology giant estimated that US import taxes could add about $900m (Â£677.5m) to its costs in the current quarter, despite Trump's decision to spare key electronics from the new tariffs.
The Trump administration has repeatedly said it wants Apple to move production to America.
The estimate comes as firms around the world are scrambling to respond to the huge shifts in global trade triggered by Washington's trade policies.
On a call with investors on Thursday to discuss the firm's financial performance, the Apple boss seemed keen to draw attention to its investments in the US.
Mr Cook opened the discussion with a reminder of the company's plans to invest $500bn across several US states over the next four years.
He also said Apple is shifting its supply chain for US-bound products away from China, but it is India and Vietnam that are poised to be major beneficiaries of that move.
""We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in US will have India as their country of origin,"" Mr Cook said.
Meanwhile, Vietnam will be the chief manufacturing hub ""for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods product sold in the US"".
China will remain the country of origin for the vast majority of total products sold outside the US, he added.
However moving production lines to India will take time and significant investment, costing billions of dollars.
Shanti Kelemen, chief investment officer at M&G Wealth, told the BBC's Today programme: ""There will still be tariffs that impact the supply chains [for Apple] and a cost to move them and build new factories.
""Apple have said they want to invest $500bn over the next few years.""
Apple shares had plummeted after Trump announced his administration would levy ""reciprocal tariffs"" on products imported to the United States, with the aim of persuading companies to manufacture more in the US.
But his administration faced significant pressure to moderate its plans. Shortly after the tariffs went into effect, it announced that certain electronics, including phones and computers, would be exempted.
For now, trade turmoil has left Apple's sales unscathed.
The company said revenues for the first three months of the year rose 5% from the same period last year, to $95.4bn.
Amazon, another tech giant whose results were being closely watched for signs of tariff damage, likewise said sales were holding up, rising 8% year-on-year in its North America e-commerce business in the most recent quarter.
It forecast similar growth in the months ahead.
""Obviously no one of us knows exactly where tariffs will settle or when,"" said Amazon boss Andy Jassy, while noting that the firm has emerged from periods of disruption â like the pandemic â stronger than before.
""We're often able to weather challenging conditions better than others,"" he said. ""I'm optimistic this could happen again.""
The shift of the iPhone supply chain to India was ""impressive"" according to Patrick Moorhead, chief executive of Moor Insights & Strategy.
""This is a marked change from what [Cook] said a few years back when he said that only China can build iPhones,"" Mr Moorhead said.
""There is lots of progress that Apple must show here but it's a pretty good start,"" he said.
Amazon is also repositioning itself to increase resilience in the face of the tariffs.
The company said it working to make sure it had a diversity of sellers and Mr Jassy said he felt the firm was well-positioned for the months ahead, pointing to the firm's scale and its role supplying everyday essentials.
For now, it said sales had not been hurt by the tariff turmoil. If anything, executives said the business may have benefited from some customers starting to stockpile.
Overall sales jumped 9% to $155.7bn in the first three months of 2025, compared with the same period last year, while profits surged more than 60% year-on-year to roughly $17bn.",Lily Jamali,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj4nev7p70o,"Warren Buffett, 94, stepping down as Berkshire Hathaway CEO","Warren Buffett has announced he will retire as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year.
The veteran investor, known as the Oracle of Omaha, told his company's annualÂ meeting he would hand over the reins to Vice-ChairmanÂ GregÂ Abel.
""I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive of the company at year end,"" said Mr Buffett, 94.
Mr Buffett, who built Berkshire Hathaway from a failing textile maker into an investment juggernaut worth $1.16tn (Â£870bn), is arguably the world's most successful investor.
After standing applause from the audience of around 40,000, he joked: ""The enthusiasm shown by that response could be interpreted in two ways.""
The billionaire told Saturday's company meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, that the only people who had known about his decision were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett.
Mr Abel, sitting next to Mr Buffett on stage, was apparently caught unaware by the announcement.
Mr Buffett handpicked Mr Abel as his successor four years ago but gave no indication at the time that he would retire.
During the meeting, Mr Buffett added that he does not plan to sell off any of his Berkshire stocks.
""I have no intention, zero, of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. It will get given away,"" he said, as the crowd cheered.
Apple CEO Tim Cook was among several business leaders who released statements praising Mr Buffett's business legacy.
""There's never been someone like Warren, and countless people, myself included, have been inspired by his wisdom,"" Mr Cook wrote on X/Twitter.
""It's been one of the great privileges of my life to know him. And there's no question that Warren is leaving Berkshire in great hands with Greg.""
In 2023, Mr Buffett issued a rare letter in which he acknowledged that whilst he had no desire to step down, he was ""playing in extra innings"".
Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 60 companies, including insurer Geico, battery-maker Duracell and restaurant chain Dairy Queen.
It also has major stakes in Apple, Coca Cola, Bank of America and American Express, among others.
Mr Buffett, who has given away billions to charity, was last month ranked by Bloomberg as the world's fourth-wealthiest person, with a net worth of $154bn.
He earned his first money as a six-year-old, bought his first shares at 11 and filed his first tax return at 13.
Despite being one of the richest people in the world,Â Mr Buffett has lived in the same modest house in Omaha for more than 65 years.
The announcement came as Mr Buffet spoke out against President Donald Trump's tariffs, telling investors that the US should not use ""trade as a weapon"".
""It's a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don't like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,"" he said earlier in the meeting.
""We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,"" he added.",Max Matza,2 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4le9n469o,Uber starts allowing customers to pay in cash,"Uber is now allowing passengers across most of the UK to pay in cash.
Following trials, the cash payment option was this week extended to all UK cities, except London, where it is being reviewed.
But individual drivers can still opt out of accepting notes and coins, partly if they are worried about safety of carrying them in their vehicles.
The move came as a major report suggested shops and services might need to be forced to accept cash in the future to protect those who rely on it.
On Wednesday, the Treasury Committee of MPs stopped short of recommending mandated cash acceptance now, but said its report was ""a wake-up call"" to government on the issue.
Uber has become a huge company and dominates the global ride-hailing market, as well as operating in a host of other transport sectors. Its rapid ascent has come with controversy and protests from other taxi providers.
The taxi app's success has been based around new technology, but meant customers needed cashless payments to use its services.
Following pilots in Birmingham, Stoke, Nottingham and Leicester, Uber said it has now extended the option of paying in cash to other UK cities, because some people preferred paying in cash or did not have a bank card.
""We believe that movement should be accessible to everyone, so following successful pilots in some UK cities over the last 18 months, we have decided to give passengers outside of London the option to pay for trips with cash,"" a spokesman said.
Passengers can select cash as their payment option on the app. Drivers can opt out in preferences on their own app.
If they do not have enough change, that is given as a credit to the passenger by Uber.
The cash option is being reviewed by authorities in London, and remains unavailable for Uber Eats or booking for other forms of transport via the Uber app.
Cash campaigner Ron Delnevo from the Payment Choice Alliance said Uber's move ""demonstrates that they now believe in the future of cash in the UK"", and brought the company's operations in the UK in line with many other countries.
He called on the government to introduce a law that would force all shops and services to accept cash.
Ministers have said there are no plans to introduce such rules.
However, the Treasury Committee's recent report did highlight various groups who relied on cash, including some people with learning disabilities and those who use cash to keep to a budget.
Among those reliant on cash, and who gave evidence to the committee, were victim-survivors of domestic and economic abuse.
Many face the dangers of being traced by their abuser via the payments they make. Buying a train ticket, for example, could only be done with cash in order to avoid an abusive partner becoming aware of their movements.
""It really is a matter of life and death,"" said Sam Smethers, chief executive of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse. ""Without it they find themselves monitored daily, with every transaction.""
Joint bank accounts and mortgages had also been used as a way to impose coercive control over somebody, she said.
And cash could be used as an eventual escape route.
""One victim-survivor said she hid pockets of cash around her house until she had enough to flee her abuser,"" she said.
The charity would like to see cash acceptance backed by law, but Ms Smethers said she welcomed the focus the committee's report had put on the plight of those facing economic abuse.",Kevin Peachey,2 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0z65dq771o,Wall Street stocks bounce back from Trump tariff losses,"Wall Street has clawed back losses incurred after President Donald Trump imposed global tariffs a month ago, capping the longest winning streak in two decades for US stocks.
Shares saw gains for the ninth day in a row for the first time since 2004 after a better-than-expected jobs report and rising hope of US-China trade talks.
Major US indexes were all up when the market closed on Friday - the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had both risen 1.5% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4%.
The tech sector made the biggest gains, with Microsoft and Nvidia growing by more than 2%.
It came as the Department of Labor said on Friday that US employers had added 177,000 new jobs in April.
The report outpaced analysts' predictions, although it was still a slowdown in hiring from the month beforehand. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%.
Another sign of encouragement for investors was Beijing's announcement on Friday that it was considering an offer from Washington to hold trade talks with the US.
At 145%, China faces the highest import taxes by far.
For some analysts the jobs figures tamped down recession fears in the wake of commerce department data this week showing a contraction in the US economy for the first time in three years.
""There is nothing to complain about here,"" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a research note.
""You cannot find any evidence of a nascent recession in these figures.""
Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, also saw cause for optimism.
""The economy will weaken in the coming months but, with this underlying momentum, the US has a decent chance of averting recession if it can step back from the tariff brink in time,"" she said.
But other experts said it would take time to see the full effect of Trump's tariffs.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grdke5r1jo,Tariffs on car parts entering the US come into force,"A 25% import tax on engines, transmissions and other key car parts has come into force in the US, raising pressure on an industry finding its way through a thicket of policy changes.
The new tariff comes days after Donald Trump eased the measure in response to business worries, but did not eliminate it.
The US president has said the new tariff, along with a 25% import tax on cars that went into effect last month, is intended to push carmakers to do more manufacturing in the US.
But analysts said any immediate expansions in the US were likely to come at the expense of production elsewhere, while also leading to higher costs for the businesses - and ultimately higher prices for customers.
For now, companies have been shielded from pain, as concerns about price hikes have prompted a sales surge.
General Motors and Ford this week reported double digit sales growth continuing in April.
But GM also warned it expected as much as $5bn (Â£3.7bn) in new costs this year as a result of the tariffs, including roughly $2bn in charges on cars it makes in South Korea and exports to the US.
Executives said they now expected prices to rise roughly 1%, instead of falling as previously forecast.
In a sign of the turmoil, other car companies, including Stellantis, maker of Jeep, Fiat and Chrysler, withdrew financial guidance for the year ahead, citing the fluidity of the situation.
""We remain subject to extreme uncertainties,"" Stellantis chief financial officer Doug Ostermann told analysts this week.
Nearly half of vehicles sold in the US last year were imported from outside the country.
When Trump announced plans in March to hit cars and certain car parts with 25% tariffs, an announcement that came amid a bevy of other tariffs, it sent shockwaves through the industry, drawing warnings of higher prices and risks to production and sales.
The president has since softened his policies, especially regarding Mexico and Canada - key parts of the industry's supply chain, due to decades of free trade between the three countries.
As it stands currently, parts made in Mexico and Canada in compliance with that free trade agreement will be spared the duties. Officials had initially described that exemption as temporary, but after customs instructions issued this week analysts said it now appeared likely to stick.
Trump this week also signed measures to shield firms from facing multiple tariffs on the same item, while setting up a two-year system carmakers can use to reduce the duties they have to pay on parts imported from other countries and used in US-assembled cars.
The administration had also already said firms importing cars made in Canada and Mexico would not be charged tariffs on US-made content.
""The changes that have come in the last couple of days are going to make it easier ... but even so it's still a dramatic change to the market,"" said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. ""It's still a big tariff.""
Executives at some firms have said they are exploring ways to increase production in the US to mitigate the new costs.
General Motors said it had expanded truck production at its factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana, by about 50,000 as a result of the tariffs. This week it also said it would cut back output in Canada.
Mercedes also said it had flexibility to expand at its factory in Alabama.
Art Wheaton, director of Labor Studies at Cornell University, said the US might see more such announcements in the months ahead, but he did not expect to see new factories getting built anytime soon, given the significance of that investment and how fast the situation is changing.
""If I'm going to make a multi-billion dollar decision... I wouldn't do it in a market that is this unstable,"" he said.
The administration has said it is working on trade deals with key countries for the industry, including South Korea and Japan.
Trump might also modify his policies if signs of economic damage start to emerge, Mr Wheaton said.
""Everything is pretty good now,"" he said. ""I don't think the full impact of those tariffs has hit yet.""",Natalie Sherman,3 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp31nknxgwlo,US court rules ex-Abercrombie CEO unfit for trial,"The former chief executive of fashion brand Abercrombie & Fitch is ""mentally incompetent"" and currently unfit to stand trial on charges of sex trafficking and prostitution, a US court has ruled.
Mike Jeffries will now be held in custody and treated in hospital for an initial period of up to four months to determine if his condition is likely to improve enough for the case to proceed.
Mr Jeffries' legal team said last December he has dementia and late onset Alzheimer's disease.
He is accused of using his wealth, power and status to traffic and sexually abuse vulnerable men over years - alleged crimes that could carry a life-term jail sentence.
Judge Nusrat Choudhury agreed on Friday that the defendant was ""suffering from a mental disease or defect"", making him ""unable to understand"" court proceedings.
The ruling followed an assessment by two medical experts - one designated by Mr Jeffries' defence team, the other chosen by prosecutors.
Judge Choudhury said in a court order that Mr Jeffries would be treated in hospital for up to four months to see if he is likely to regain competency.
Once a follow-up assessment is complete, the defendant could either face trial or the court will weigh up next steps.
These could include dropping the criminal charges against him, or releasing him to home confinement.
Mr Jeffries was arrested and charged last October along with his British partner, Matthew Smith, 61, and their middleman, James Jacobson, 72.  All three deny the allegations.
US prosecutors allege the men used force, fraud and coercion to make young men, many of whom were aspiring models, engage in violent and exploitative sex acts while Mr Jeffries was chief executive from at least 2008 until 2015.
The charges followed a 2023 BBC documentary and ongoing podcast series that revealed the three of them benefited from a sophisticated operation in which recruiters scouted young men for sex in cities including London, New York, Paris and Marrakesh.
The BBC has since revealed that more than 40 men, including Abercrombie & Fitch employees, have now come forward with civil allegations of sexual assault, drugging or rape - with claims dating back to 1992, the year Mr Jeffries started running the company.
Civil trial lawyers have told the BBC their clients are dismayed at the criminal court's decision that Mr Jeffries is unfit to stand trial.
""We've been speaking with our clients who are disappointed by the decision and still want justice,"" said Brad Edwards and Brittany Henderson, representing 26 alleged victims.
Brian Bieber, Mr Jeffries' criminal defence lawyer, said his client had recently been evaluated by doctors who determined he had Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body disease, and the residual effects of a traumatic brain injury requiring around-the-clock care, which ""will almost certainly worsen over time"".
Dr Cheryl Paradis, the US prosecutor's medical expert, also independently assessed Mr Jeffries. According to court papers, she found he was unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to properly assist in his defence.
""His memory impairment almost certainly would cause him to be unable to accurately recall key events and details,"" Dr Paradis said, according to the court filings, ""and severely limit his capacity to provide accurate and reliable information"".
She added: ""Additionally, his inappropriate behaviour, which is a symptom of his dementia, could further interfere with his ability to maintain proper courtroom demeanour. He may blurt out self-incriminating statements or engage in erratic behaviour, which would undermine his credibility.""
The BBC understands that Mr Jacobson and Mr Smith could still face trial on the same sex-trafficking and prostitution charges.
Alongside criminal charges, Mr Jeffries and his partner Mr Smith have been defending multiple civil lawsuits accusing them of rape, sex trafficking and assault, which they ""vehemently deny"".
The civil lawsuits had been stayed - or legally put on pause - until the resolution of the criminal case, which takes precedence to protect Mr Jeffries' right against self-incrimination.
While his criminal case remains uncertain, Mr Jeffries could still face a civil trial or reach a settlement over the allegations. If this was the case, the outcome could lead to compensation being awarded to alleged victims.
""Mike Jeffries attacked these men and ruined their lives at a point when they were at their most vulnerable and chasing their dreams,"" said civil case lawyer, Brad Edwards.
""He will still be held accountable by our lawsuit and his co-conspirators will still face the criminal justice system.
""For anyone affected still in fear about coming forward, you should be reassured that his power is now totally gone"".
Abercrombie & Fitch is also being sued for negligence, with lawsuits claiming that it knowingly facilitated ""heinous sexual crimes"".
The company - which also owns the Hollister brand - has previously said it was ""appalled and disgusted"" by Mr Jeffries' alleged behaviour.",Rianna Croxford,3 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grd0wqy22o,US jobs grow by more than expected despite tariff turmoil,"Hiring in the US remained solid last month, despite turmoil stemming from changes to trade policy.
Employers added 177,000 jobs in April, while the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2%, the Labor Department said.
The gain was bigger than many analysts had expected in a month marked by chaos in financial markets and rising concerns about the economy tracked in surveys of businesses and households.
The resilience of the US jobs market over the last few years has surprised analysts, helping to sustain spending even as households faced rising prices and a sharp jump in interest rates.
The latest figures have raised some hopes that the country may be able to weather the uncertainty from tariff policy without suffering a painful economic downturn.
But analysts expressed caution, noting that the impact of the sweeping import taxes announced by Donald Trump would take more time to be fully felt.
Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, said it was a good jobs report, despite revisions showing employers added fewer jobs in January and February than initially estimated.
""The key message coming from the totality of the data this week is that the US economy was fundamentally strong through the first week of April, however, the outlook remains very uncertain,"" he said.
The Labor Department's surveys were conducted less than two weeks after Trump announced his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, which have raised the average rate of import taxes in the US to the highest level in more than a century.
Many firms have said they are moving cautiously for now, citing rapid changes in policy and hope that Trump's promises of trade deals will bear fruit.
Hiring last month was led by healthcare, warehousing and transportation firms.
Employment declined in the federal government - where Trump has vowed to cut spending - but that was offset by gains in local government.
Payrolls also dropped at manufacturing and retail firms.
Average hourly pay rose 3.8% over the last 12 months, according to the report.
Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the figures suggested the US central bank does not face urgency to cut interest rates to support the economy.
""Why would the Fed start cutting rates right now when the unemployment rate is near record lows, the consumer is still fairly robust, and inflation is running above target?"" she said.
""The economy will weaken in the coming months but, with this underlying momentum, the US has a decent chance of averting recession if it can step back from the tariff brink in time.""",Natalie Sherman,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy79j2n7d4o,Temu to stop selling goods from China directly to US customers,"Temu has said it will stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform.
The online marketplace said sales would now be handled by ""locally based sellers"", with orders fulfilled from within the country.
The move comes as a duty-free rule for low-value packages is closed.
Temu, and rival Chinese retail giant Shein, had previously relied on the so-called ""de minimis"" exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without having to pay duties or import taxes.
Temu said it had been actively recruiting US firms to join the platform.
""All sales in the US are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country.
""The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses,"" it added.
Supporters of the de minimis loophole, which applied to parcels worth less than $800 (Â£600), argue it helped streamline the customs process.
But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs.
De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as ""of the smallest"".
In this context it refers to a US trade rule enacted by Congress in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import levies.
In the 21st Century, after a series of rises to the threshold, it allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to US customers without having to pay duties or taxes.
Shipments under the exemption accounted for more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US, according to the country's Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).
Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu had benefited greatly from the loophole.
Both platforms attracted millions of US customers with marketing blitzes that showcased their ultra-low prices
And it was the de minimis exemption that helped them offer those deals so cheaply.
Shein did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.
Last month, in almost identical statements, Shein and Temu said they had seen operating expenses rise ""due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs"", adding they would make ""price adjustments"" from 25 April.
In February, Trump briefly closed the loophole.
The suspension was quickly paused as customs inspectors, delivery firms and online retailers struggled to adapt to such a major change at short notice.
During the initial suspension of the exemption the US Postal Service temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.
The executive order announcing the latest move said it was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl.
It said many Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages ""to exploit the de minimis exemption"".
""These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone,"" it added.
The idea is not new. Last year, the Biden administration proposed rules intended to stop ""abuse"" of the exemption.
""The growing volume of de minimis shipments makes it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments,"" it said.
The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China.
Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on Chinese imports. His administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.
US authorities have also blamed the success of firms like Temu and Shein for putting strains on border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole surged from about 140 million a decade ago to more than one billion last year.
Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. The fee started at $100 and is due to rise to $200 at the beginning of June.
Even before these packages were subject to import taxes, US consumers were warned of potential price rises.
The American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy group, estimated last year that getting rid of the exemption would result in ""$8bn to $30bn in additional annual costs that would eventually be passed on to consumers"".
Chinese online retailers have also benefited from similar rules in the UK and the European Union.
In a move mirroring the US action, the UK has announced a review of low-value imports coming into the country.
In the UK, the current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than Â£135 without incurring import taxes.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the cheap goods are ""undercutting the British High Street and British retailers"".
The European Union has also proposed plans to scrap duty-free exemptions for parcels worth less than â¬150 (Â£127.50; $169.35).
Which means consumers in the UK and EU could soon also see prices rising.
Packages that arrived in the US under the exemption were inspected in the same way as other goods, including being checked for illegal substances. And most synthetic opioids are brought into the country through the border with Mexico, according to officials.
Some experts think ending the exemption will do little to curb illegal drugs and not address the challenges faced by US manufacturers.
There are also concerns the move will create more work for US border officials, who are already stretched as they try to stop drug smuggling.
According to pro-open trading association the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), removing the de minimis exemption would ""shift the CBP's focus away from the border, where a vast majority of illegal substances and products are entering the country.""
""CBP would need to hire and train new personnel, costing the agency millions or causing them to move agents from the already overburdened southern border,"" it added.",Peter Hoskins & Charlotte Edwards,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgnyplvdv8o,M&S supplier resorts to pen and paper after cyber attack,"One of Marks & Spencer's biggest suppliers has resorted to using pen and paper for orders as the disruption from the cyber attack on the retailer continues.
The boss of Greencore, which supplies sandwiches, rolls and wraps, says it has also ramped up deliveries by a fifth to make sure there is more than enough food for the bank holiday weekend.
M&S has been unable to offer online orders for clothing and homewares for over a week, and some stores have seen empty shelves as food deliveries have also been disrupted.
Two M&S workers told the BBC they were concerned about pay because they were unable to clock in and out of work and could not access staff apps.
In a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes situation at M&S, Greencore chief executive Dalton Philips said: ""In the absence of having all the systems speaking to each other, you revert to how it was 25 years ago.""
That means back to ""pen and paper"", he said.
Greencore has also been putting on additional shifts at its dedicated M&S factory in Northampton, putting more lorries on the road, and is sending more food to stores than they did over Christmas.
""They're a massive customer for us and we're trying to flood them with products to help them,"" said Mr Philips.
""There are times when you do need to revert to manual systems in any business... but look, it works well.
""With the challenges of the system we don't have intricate forecasting that we would have previously had, so we're just making sure that they've got everything they need and some more.""
George, not his real name, works at an M&S in Wales, and said it has been ""a nightmare"".
""We have been told pay will be given through a separate payment system. However, we have not been told whether the pay will be correct.
""Additionally, there have been back-and-forth instructions, which have changed hourly. For example: remove gift cards from shop floor, put them back (when working).""
One former M&S customer assistant from Scunthorpe, who retired from their store at the end of April, said they had been unable to clock in and out of work as a result of the attack.
""There is no way of receiving advice via managers or the outsourced HR,"" they told the BBC.
M&S has reassured staff that they will be paid for all contracted hours as usual.
As a former chief executive of the supermarket chain Morrisons, Mr Philips knows only too well the pressure M&S bosses are under.
""They will be literally working 24/7. You've got to work your way through it. Whenever I've spoken to the team this week, it's been really impressive how calm and focused they are.
""I think if you work in retail, you know people are often the most on their game and motivated at those periods of intense pressure.""
Greencore has also sent a handful of its own staff to key M&S stores in London to provide extra support.
M&S hasn't released details on how its systems have been affected, saying only that some have been temporarily taken offline leading to pockets of limited availability in stores.
One food industry veteran who knows the business well thinks M&S will be focusing on making sure it can still provide all of its best-selling items.
""The issue is, if you've got 7,000 products, then obviously that's a lot of data to review.""
But he also pointed out that for big seasonal events there will be a lot of buying in advance and the company will have historical back-ups. Suppliers will also have a view on what will sell well.
Ged Futter, a former buyer for Asda who now runs his own consultancy advising suppliers, says M&S is in a difficult situation, but believes it will find a way round it as retailers are very good at finding solutions.
""If they have to, they'll use a fax machine. Any silo mentality disappears and everyone becomes very clearly focused on how to fix it.""
But the longer this goes on, the risk of damage to M&S's reputation and to its customer loyalty increases.
The company has been praised for its communications with customers, but has kept quiet on the nature of the attack and how it unfolded. That may not be sustainable for much longer.
The chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, Liam Byrne, has written to M&S chief executive Stuart Machin seeking reassurances, saying it was ""imperative"" to understand what had happened.
One person, who is a former chief executive at another firm and had to deal with a data breach, told the BBC the advice from his PR adviser was simple.
""Say nothing until you know everything. Then say everything. Then say nothing.""
M&S has been contacted for comment.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkx3vy54nzo,"Co-op cyber attack affects customer data, firm admits, after hackers contact BBC","Cyber criminals have told BBC News their hack against Co-op is far more serious than the company previously admitted.
Hackers contacted the BBC with proof they had infiltrated IT networks and stolen huge amounts of customer and employee data.
After being approached on Friday, a Co-op spokesperson said the hackers ""accessed data relating to a significant number of our current and past members"".
Co-op had previously said that it had taken ""proactive measures"" to fend off hackers and that it was only having a ""small impact"" on its operations.
It also assured the public that there was ""no evidence that customer data was compromised"".
The cyber criminals claim to have the private information of 20 million people who signed up to Co-op's membership scheme, but the firm would not confirm that number.
The criminals, who are using the name DragonForce, say they are also responsible for the ongoing attack on M&S and an attempted hack of Harrods.
The attacks have led government minister Pat McFadden to warn companies to ""treat cyber security as an absolute priority"".
The anonymous hackers showed the BBC screenshots of the first extortion message they sent to Co-op's head of cyber security in an internal Microsoft Teams chat on 25 April.
""Hello, we exfiltrated the data from your company,"" the chat says.
""We have customer database, and Co-op member card data.""
They also showed screenshots of a call with the head of security which took place around a week ago.
The hackers say they messaged other members of the executive committee too as part of their scheme to blackmail the firm.
Co-op has more than 2,500 supermarkets as well as 800 funeral homes and an insurance business.
It employs around 70,000 staff nationwide.
The cyber attack was announced by the company on Wednesday.
On Thursday, it was revealed Co-op staff were being urged to keep their cameras on during Teams meetings, ordered not to record or transcribe calls, and to verify that all participants were genuine Co-op staff.
The security measure now appears to be a direct result of the hackers having access to internal Teams chats and calls.
DragonForce shared databases with the BBC that includes usernames and passwords of all employees.
They also sent a sample of 10,000 customers data including Co-op membership card numbers, names, home addresses, emails and phone numbers.
The BBC has destroyed the data it received, and is not publishing or sharing these documents.
The Co-op membership database is thought to be highly valuable to the company.
Since the BBC contacted Co-op about the hackers' evidence, the firm has disclosed the full extent of the breach to its staff and the stock market.
""This data includes Co-op Group members' personal data such as names and contact details, and did not include members' passwords, bank or credit card details, transactions or information relating to any members' or customers' products or services with the Co-op Group,"" a spokesperson said.
DragonForce want the BBC to report the hack - they are apparently trying to extort the company for money.
But the criminals wouldn't say what they plan to do with the data if they don't get paid.
They refused to talk about M&S or Harrods and when asked about how they feel about causing so much distress and damage to business and customers, they refused to answer.
DragonForce is a ransomware group known for scrambling victims' data and demanding a ransom is paid to get the key to unscramble it. They are also known to have stolen data as part of their extortion tactics.
DragonForce operates an affiliate cyber crime service so anyone can use their malicious software and website to carry out attacks and extortions.
It's not known who is ultimately using the DragonForce service to attack the retailers, but some security experts say the tactics seen are similar to that of a loosely coordinated group of hackers who have been called Scattered Spider or Octo Tempest.
The gang operates on Telegram and Discord channels and is English-speaking and young â in some cases only teenagers.
Conversations with the Co-op hackers were carried out in text form - but it is clear the hacker, who called himself a spokesperson, was a fluent English speaker.
They say two of the hackers want to be known as ""Raymond Reddington"" and ""Dembe Zuma"" after characters from US crime thriller Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a 'blacklist'.
The hackers say ""we're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist"".
Co-op says it is working with the NCSC and the NCA and said in a statement it is very sorry this situation has arisen.
UK government officials have met over the cyber attacks, with national security staff and the chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre discussing support for retailers.
In a keynote speech next week setting out government action, minister Pat McFadden - who has responsibility for cyber security - will say the attacks need to be a ""wake-up call"" for every UK business.
""In a world where the cybercriminals targeting us are relentless in their pursuit of profit - with attempts being made every hour of every day - companies must treat cyber security as an absolute priority.
""We've watched in real-time the disruption these attacks have caused - including to working families going about their everyday lives.
""It serves as a powerful reminder that just as you would never leave your car or your house unlocked on your way to work. We have to treat our digital shop fronts the same way.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1jwe7582o,Trump signs order to block funding to public radio,"US President Donald Trump has issued an executive order calling for all federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) to be blocked.
On Thursday evening, Trump alleged that both organisations have engaged with ""biased and partisan news coverage"".
The order instructs the board of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting (CPB), which distributes funding to PBS and NPR stations, to ""cease direct funding"" to the ""maximum extent allowed by law"".
PBS called the order ""blatantly unlawful"", while CPB said the organisation is not ""a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority"".
Meanwhile, Radio Free Asia, which receives funding from the government, said on Friday it was shutting down most of its news broadcasts and letting most staff go.
CEO Bay Fang said the cuts were due to the Trump administration withholding congressionally allocated funding, even though a federal judge sided with the broadcaster last week.
The executive order says the board should ""decline to provide future funding"" to the news organisations.
""Which viewpoints NPR and PBS promote does not matter,"" it continues.
""What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.""
Paula Kerger, CEO of PBS, called the president's order ""blatantly unlawful"" and said it ""threatens our ability to serve the American public with educational programming, as we have for the past 50-plus years"".
The White House has said that funding of news media is ""not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence"" and that the media landscape has become more ""diverse"".
However, the CPB budget has already been approved by Congress through 2027.
Patricia Harrison, CEO of the CPB, said the organisation is not ""a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority"".
""Congress directly authorised and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government,"" she said.
""In creating CPB, Congress expressly forbade 'any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting'.""
More than 40 million Americans listen to NPR public radio each week, and 36 million watch a local television station from the PBS network each month, according to their estimates.
NPR director Katherine Maher estimated in March that the radio station would receive about $120m (Â£90m) from the CPB in 2025, ""less than 5% of its budget.""
Both organisations have previously said that Trump's effort to cut funding could have a ""devastating impact"" on those who rely on them for credible news, including during emergency situations.
Media rights group RSF warned on Friday about ""an alarming deterioration in press freedom"" in the United States under Trump and ""unprecedented"" difficulties for independent journalists around the world.
Following the news of Trump's executive order, REM singer Michael Stipe was among the figures offering support to the journalists affected.
""Whether it's music or a free press â censorship anywhere is a threat to the truth everywhere,"" he said in a statement. ""On World Press Freedom Day, I'm sending a shout-out to the brave journalists at Radio Free Europe.""",Yasmin Rufo,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgrwxp5r15o,Meta threatens to cut off Facebook in Nigeria over huge fines,"People in Nigeria may lose access to Facebook and Instagram after parent company Meta said it faced large fines and  ""unrealistic"" regulatory demands from the Nigerian authorities.
Last year, three Nigerian oversight agencies imposed fines on the US-based social media giant totalling more than $290m (Â£218m) for violating various laws and regulations.
Meta was unsuccessful in a recent attempt to challenge the decisions in the federal high court in Abuja.
""The applicant may be forced to effectively shut down the Facebook and Instagram services in Nigeria in order to mitigate the risk of enforcement measures,"" the company said in the court papers.
Meta also owns WhatsApp, but it did not mention the messaging service in its statement.
The high court has given the company until the end of June to pay the fines.
The BBC has asked Meta to outline what its next steps will be but has not yet received a response.
Facebook is by far the most popular social media platform in Nigeria and is used by tens of millions in the country for daily communication and sharing news. It is also a vital tool for many of Nigeria's small online businesses.
In July last year, Meta was asked to pay three fines:
FCCPC chief executive officer Adamu Abdullahi said investigations carried out in conjunction with the data commission between May 2021 and December 2023 revealed ""invasive practices against data subjects/consumers in Nigeria"" but was not specific about what these were.
In its court submission, Meta said its ""primary concern"" was with the data commission, which it accused of ""misinterpreting"" data privacy laws.
Specifically, the commission has demanded that Meta seek prior approval before transferring any personal data out of Nigeria - a condition that Meta called ""unrealistic"".
The data commission also imposed other demands.
Meta was told it must provide an icon linking to educational videos about data privacy risks. This would be content created in collaboration with government-approved educational institutions and non-profit organisations.
The NDPC insisted that these videos highlight the dangers of ""manipulative and unfair data processing"" that could expose Nigerian users to health and financial risks.
Meta described the NDPC's demands as unfeasible, saying that the agency has failed to ""properly interpret the laws guiding data privacy"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg419qw9g15o,Talks or no talks: Who blinks first in US-China trade war?,"On Friday morning, a spokesperson for China's ministry of commerce announced that Beijing was assessing the possibility of tariff negotiations with the United States.
It was news the rest of the world had been waiting to hear as astonishingly high  tariffs - up to 245% on some Chinese exports to the US - throttle trade between the world's two biggest economies, raising the spectre of a recession.
""US officials have repeatedly expressed their willingness to negotiate with China on tariffs,"" the spokesperson told reporters.
""China's position is consistent. If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open... If the US wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel unilateral tariffs.""
The statement comes a day after a Weibo account linked to Chinese state media said the US had been seeking to initiate discussions, and a week after Trump claimed discussions were already underway â a suggestion Beijing denied.
""China has no need to talk to the United States,"" Yuyuantantian, a Weibo account affiliated with China Central Television (CCTV), said in Thursday's post. ""From the perspective of negotiations, the United States must be the more anxious party at present.""
Such comments follow a cycle of assertions and denials from both the US and China, as each side refuses to publicly initiate discussions.
The question is not whether those discussions will take place, but rather when, under what circumstances and at whose behest.
Experts characterise the tussle as a game of chicken between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as both men attempt to save face while covertly pursuing a mutually beneficial outcome â namely, a de-escalation of the trade war.
""I expect some of this back-and-forth, because neither Washington nor Beijing wants to look like they are the side that's giving in,"" says Ja Ian Chong, assistant professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.
""[But] a de-escalation would be to the overall benefit of both sides, so there is some overarching incentive to do so.""
Wen-Ti Sung, an academic member of the Australian Centre on China in the World, puts it another way: ""It's like two race cars going at each other: whoever swerves first will be seen as the weaker of the two parties. And at this juncture, neither party wants to look soft.""
The leader who admits he was the first to initiate tariff talks would be seen as the one compromising his position in negotiations.
""Whoever seems desperate loses bargaining leverage,"" Mr Sung says. ""Both sides want to portray the other side as the more desperate one.""
This peculiar stalemate â where both parties seek the same outcome, but neither wants to be the first to suggest it â has resulted in a tactic of ""constructive ambiguity"": the deliberate use of language so vague that each party could arguably claim to be in the right.
It is this tactic that Mr Sung points to as an explanation for Yuyuantantian's Weibo post.
""This is Beijing trying to explore the possibility of using word games to create an off-ramp for both sides, so that they can gradually climb their way down from this escalation spiral,"" he says.
One way to escape this game of chicken is when a third party mediates, offering both sides an off-ramp. The other option, Mr Sung explains, is a ""much looser understanding of what 'the other side has reached out' means"".
That way, the side that does indeed come to the table first is still able to characterise it as a response rather than the first move.
In Trump and Xi's case, it would also mean that tariff negotiations could begin with both leaders claiming to have achieved some kind of victory in the trade war.
The optics here are important. As Mr Chong points out, de-escalation is one thing â but another top priority for Trump and Xi is to ""deliver a win for their domestic audiences"".
""Trump obviously wants to show that he has made Beijing capitulate. And on the People's Republic of China side, Xi probably wants to show his own people and the world that he's been able to make Trump become more reasonable and moderate and accommodating,"" Mr Chong says.
On the domestic front, both leaders are facing tariff-induced headwinds. Trump this week struggled to quell fears of a recession as fresh data indicated the US economy contracted in its first quarter for the first time since 2022.
Meanwhile, Xi - who before the tariffs was already battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment - must reassure China's population that he can weather the trade war and protect an economy which has struggled to rebound post-pandemic.
""Both [Trump and Xi] recognise that at this point of the trade war, it's not going to be a winner-takes-all outcome for either side anymore,"" Mr Sung says.
""Trump recognises he's not going to get anywhere near 100% of what he wants, so he's trying to find a concession point where China can let him have just enough winning, especially for domestic purposes.""
While China is not unwilling, he adds, ""they are very much stuck on what's the right price point"".
For Xi, Mr Sung described the situation as a ""two-level game"".
""The China side needs to manage US-China bilateral negotiations, while domestically Beijing needs to save enough face so that the Chinese leadership can hold on to this narrative of 'the East is rising and the West is declining',"" he says.
""A kowtowing of the East towards the West is not a rising East.""
At the time of writing, the US has not denied China's claims that it has been attempting to initiate talks. But the fact that both sides have now made that assertion indicates there is ""some sort of contact"", according to Mr Chong.
""The two sides are talking,"" he says. ""And that is a sign that there is some possibility that some accommodation could be reached.""
But the start of negotiations does not mean that the US-China relationship - which was rocky even before Trump kicked off a trade war - is close to being steadied.
Mr Chong isn't holding his breath. For one, he believes the ""posturing"" suggests the two sides have not reached the point ""where they are both trying to seek a way out"".
""[Each party] may hope that there are concessions from the other side, so they're going to have this standoff until they see which side blinks first.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86jx18y9e2o,Apple says most US-bound iPhones no longer made in China,"Apple says it is shifting production of most iPhones and other devices to be sold in the US away from China, which has been the focus of President Donald Trump's tariffs.
The majority of the iPhones bound for the US market in the coming months will be made in India, while Vietnam will be a major production hub for items like iPads and Apple Watches, chief executive Tim Cook says.
It comes as the technology giant estimated that US import taxes could add about $900m (Â£677.5m) to its costs in the current quarter, despite Trump's decision to spare key electronics from the new tariffs.
The Trump administration has repeatedly said it wants Apple to move production to America.
The estimate comes as firms around the world are scrambling to respond to the huge shifts in global trade triggered by Washington's trade policies.
On a call with investors on Thursday to discuss the firm's financial performance, the Apple boss seemed keen to draw attention to its investments in the US.
Mr Cook opened the discussion with a reminder of the company's plans to invest $500bn across several US states over the next four years.
He also said Apple is shifting its supply chain for US-bound products away from China, but it is India and Vietnam that are poised to be major beneficiaries of that move.
""We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in US will have India as their country of origin,"" Mr Cook said.
Meanwhile, Vietnam will be the chief manufacturing hub ""for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods product sold in the US"".
China will remain the country of origin for the vast majority of total products sold outside the US, he added.
However moving production lines to India will take time and significant investment, costing billions of dollars.
Shanti Kelemen, chief investment officer at M&G Wealth, told the BBC's Today programme: ""There will still be tariffs that impact the supply chains [for Apple] and a cost to move them and build new factories.
""Apple have said they want to invest $500bn over the next few years.""
Apple shares had plummeted after Trump announced his administration would levy ""reciprocal tariffs"" on products imported to the United States, with the aim of persuading companies to manufacture more in the US.
But his administration faced significant pressure to moderate its plans. Shortly after the tariffs went into effect, it announced that certain electronics, including phones and computers, would be exempted.
For now, trade turmoil has left Apple's sales unscathed.
The company said revenues for the first three months of the year rose 5% from the same period last year, to $95.4bn.
Amazon, another tech giant whose results were being closely watched for signs of tariff damage, likewise said sales were holding up, rising 8% year-on-year in its North America e-commerce business in the most recent quarter.
It forecast similar growth in the months ahead.
""Obviously no one of us knows exactly where tariffs will settle or when,"" said Amazon boss Andy Jassy, while noting that the firm has emerged from periods of disruption â like the pandemic â stronger than before.
""We're often able to weather challenging conditions better than others,"" he said. ""I'm optimistic this could happen again.""
The shift of the iPhone supply chain to India was ""impressive"" according to Patrick Moorhead, chief executive of Moor Insights & Strategy.
""This is a marked change from what [Cook] said a few years back when he said that only China can build iPhones,"" Mr Moorhead said.
""There is lots of progress that Apple must show here but it's a pretty good start,"" he said.
Amazon is also repositioning itself to increase resilience in the face of the tariffs.
The company said it working to make sure it had a diversity of sellers and Mr Jassy said he felt the firm was well-positioned for the months ahead, pointing to the firm's scale and its role supplying everyday essentials.
For now, it said sales had not been hurt by the tariff turmoil. If anything, executives said the business may have benefited from some customers starting to stockpile.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj4nev7p70o,"Warren Buffett, 94, stepping down as Berkshire Hathaway CEO","Warren Buffett has announced he will retire as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year.

""I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive of the company at year end,"" said Mr Buffett, 94.
Mr Buffett, who built Berkshire Hathaway from a failing textile maker into an investment juggernaut worth $1.16tn (Â£870bn), is arguably the world's most successful investor.
After standing applause from the audience of around 40,000, he joked: ""The enthusiasm shown by that response could be interpreted in two ways.""
The billionaire told Saturday's company meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, that the only people who had known about his decision were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett.
Mr Abel, sitting next to Mr Buffett on stage, was apparently caught unaware by the announcement.
Mr Buffett handpicked Mr Abel as his successor four years ago but gave no indication at the time that he would retire.
During the meeting, Mr Buffett added that he does not plan to sell off any of his Berkshire stocks.
""I have no intention, zero, of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. It will get given away,"" he said, as the crowd cheered.
Apple CEO Tim Cook was among several business leaders who released statements praising Mr Buffett's business legacy.
""There's never been someone like Warren, and countless people, myself included, have been inspired by his wisdom,"" Mr Cook wrote on X/Twitter.
""It's been one of the great privileges of my life to know him. And there's no question that Warren is leaving Berkshire in great hands with Greg.""
In 2023, Mr Buffett issued a rare letter in which he acknowledged that whilst he had no desire to step down, he was ""playing in extra innings"".
Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 60 companies, including insurer Geico, battery-maker Duracell and restaurant chain Dairy Queen.
It also has major stakes in Apple, Coca Cola, Bank of America and American Express, among others.
Mr Buffett, who has given away billions to charity, was last month ranked by Bloomberg as the world's fourth-wealthiest person, with a net worth of $154bn.
He earned his first money as a six-year-old, bought his first shares at 11 and filed his first tax return at 13.
Despite being one of the richest people in the world,Â Mr Buffett has lived in the same modest house in Omaha for more than 65 years.
The announcement came as Mr Buffet spoke out against President Donald Trump's tariffs, telling investors that the US should not use ""trade as a weapon"".
""It's a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don't like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,"" he said earlier in the meeting.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4le9n469o,Uber starts allowing customers to pay in cash,"Uber is now allowing passengers across most of the UK to pay in cash.
Following trials, the cash payment option was this week extended to all UK cities, except London, where it is being reviewed.
But individual drivers can still opt out of accepting notes and coins, partly if they are worried about safety of carrying them in their vehicles.
The move came as a major report suggested shops and services might need to be forced to accept cash in the future to protect those who rely on it.
On Wednesday, the Treasury Committee of MPs stopped short of recommending mandated cash acceptance now, but said its report was ""a wake-up call"" to government on the issue.
Uber has become a huge company and dominates the global ride-hailing market, as well as operating in a host of other transport sectors. Its rapid ascent has come with controversy and protests from other taxi providers.
The taxi app's success has been based around new technology, but meant customers needed cashless payments to use its services.
Following pilots in Birmingham, Stoke, Nottingham and Leicester, Uber said it has now extended the option of paying in cash to other UK cities, because some people preferred paying in cash or did not have a bank card.
""We believe that movement should be accessible to everyone, so following successful pilots in some UK cities over the last 18 months, we have decided to give passengers outside of London the option to pay for trips with cash,"" a spokesman said.
Passengers can select cash as their payment option on the app. Drivers can opt out in preferences on their own app.
If they do not have enough change, that is given as a credit to the passenger by Uber.
The cash option is being reviewed by authorities in London, and remains unavailable for Uber Eats or booking for other forms of transport via the Uber app.
Cash campaigner Ron Delnevo from the Payment Choice Alliance said Uber's move ""demonstrates that they now believe in the future of cash in the UK"", and brought the company's operations in the UK in line with many other countries.
He called on the government to introduce a law that would force all shops and services to accept cash.
Ministers have said there are no plans to introduce such rules.
However, the Treasury Committee's recent report did highlight various groups who relied on cash, including some people with learning disabilities and those who use cash to keep to a budget.
Among those reliant on cash, and who gave evidence to the committee, were victim-survivors of domestic and economic abuse.
Many face the dangers of being traced by their abuser via the payments they make. Buying a train ticket, for example, could only be done with cash in order to avoid an abusive partner becoming aware of their movements.
""It really is a matter of life and death,"" said Sam Smethers, chief executive of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse. ""Without it they find themselves monitored daily, with every transaction.""
Joint bank accounts and mortgages had also been used as a way to impose coercive control over somebody, she said.
And cash could be used as an eventual escape route.
""One victim-survivor said she hid pockets of cash around her house until she had enough to flee her abuser,"" she said.
The charity would like to see cash acceptance backed by law, but Ms Smethers said she welcomed the focus the committee's report had put on the plight of those facing economic abuse.",Kevin Peachey,2 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0z65dq771o,Wall Street stocks bounce back from Trump tariff losses,"Wall Street has clawed back losses incurred after President Donald Trump imposed global tariffs a month ago, capping the longest winning streak in two decades for US stocks.
Shares saw gains for the ninth day in a row for the first time since 2004 after a better-than-expected jobs report and rising hope of US-China trade talks.
Major US indexes were all up when the market closed on Friday - the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had both risen 1.5% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4%.
The tech sector made the biggest gains, with Microsoft and Nvidia growing by more than 2%.
It came as the Department of Labor said on Friday that US employers had added 177,000 new jobs in April.
The report outpaced analysts' predictions, although it was still a slowdown in hiring from the month beforehand. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%.
Another sign of encouragement for investors was Beijing's announcement on Friday that it was considering an offer from Washington to hold trade talks with the US.
At 145%, China faces the highest import taxes by far.
For some analysts the jobs figures tamped down recession fears in the wake of commerce department data this week showing a contraction in the US economy for the first time in three years.
""There is nothing to complain about here,"" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a research note.
""You cannot find any evidence of a nascent recession in these figures.""
Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, also saw cause for optimism.
""The economy will weaken in the coming months but, with this underlying momentum, the US has a decent chance of averting recession if it can step back from the tariff brink in time,"" she said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grdke5r1jo,Tariffs on car parts entering the US come into force,"A 25% import tax on engines, transmissions and other key car parts has come into force in the US, raising pressure on an industry finding its way through a thicket of policy changes.
The new tariff comes days after Donald Trump eased the measure in response to business worries, but did not eliminate it.
The US president has said the new tariff, along with a 25% import tax on cars that went into effect last month, is intended to push carmakers to do more manufacturing in the US.
But analysts said any immediate expansions in the US were likely to come at the expense of production elsewhere, while also leading to higher costs for the businesses - and ultimately higher prices for customers.
For now, companies have been shielded from pain, as concerns about price hikes have prompted a sales surge.
General Motors and Ford this week reported double digit sales growth continuing in April.
But GM also warned it expected as much as $5bn (Â£3.7bn) in new costs this year as a result of the tariffs, including roughly $2bn in charges on cars it makes in South Korea and exports to the US.
Executives said they now expected prices to rise roughly 1%, instead of falling as previously forecast.
In a sign of the turmoil, other car companies, including Stellantis, maker of Jeep, Fiat and Chrysler, withdrew financial guidance for the year ahead, citing the fluidity of the situation.
""We remain subject to extreme uncertainties,"" Stellantis chief financial officer Doug Ostermann told analysts this week.
Nearly half of vehicles sold in the US last year were imported from outside the country.
When Trump announced plans in March to hit cars and certain car parts with 25% tariffs, an announcement that came amid a bevy of other tariffs, it sent shockwaves through the industry, drawing warnings of higher prices and risks to production and sales.
The president has since softened his policies, especially regarding Mexico and Canada - key parts of the industry's supply chain, due to decades of free trade between the three countries.
As it stands currently, parts made in Mexico and Canada in compliance with that free trade agreement will be spared the duties. Officials had initially described that exemption as temporary, but after customs instructions issued this week analysts said it now appeared likely to stick.
Trump this week also signed measures to shield firms from facing multiple tariffs on the same item, while setting up a two-year system carmakers can use to reduce the duties they have to pay on parts imported from other countries and used in US-assembled cars.
The administration had also already said firms importing cars made in Canada and Mexico would not be charged tariffs on US-made content.
""The changes that have come in the last couple of days are going to make it easier ... but even so it's still a dramatic change to the market,"" said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. ""It's still a big tariff.""
Executives at some firms have said they are exploring ways to increase production in the US to mitigate the new costs.
General Motors said it had expanded truck production at its factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana, by about 50,000 as a result of the tariffs. This week it also said it would cut back output in Canada.
Mercedes also said it had flexibility to expand at its factory in Alabama.
Art Wheaton, director of Labor Studies at Cornell University, said the US might see more such announcements in the months ahead, but he did not expect to see new factories getting built anytime soon, given the significance of that investment and how fast the situation is changing.
""If I'm going to make a multi-billion dollar decision... I wouldn't do it in a market that is this unstable,"" he said.
The administration has said it is working on trade deals with key countries for the industry, including South Korea and Japan.
Trump might also modify his policies if signs of economic damage start to emerge, Mr Wheaton said.
""Everything is pretty good now,"" he said. ""I don't think the full impact of those tariffs has hit yet.""",Natalie Sherman,3 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rz9p2d5ko,M&S working 'day and night' over cyber attack,"The boss of Marks & Spencer has told customers the retailer is ""working day and night"" to manage the cyber attack that has forced it to temporarily shut down its online operations.
Stuart Machin said he was ""really sorry"" for the disruption to services, but did not say when normal business would resume.
M&S's problems began over the Easter weekend, and last week it confirmed it was dealing with a ""cyber incident"" and paused online orders on its website and apps.
The Co-op and luxury department store Harrods have also been targeted and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has urged retailers to be vigilant.

In his message, Mr Machin said: ""We are working day and night to manage the current cyber incident and get things back to normal for you as quickly as possible.""
He also thanked customers for ""all the support you have shown us"".
The cyber attack has already had a significant impact on the retailer, as online transactions account for about a third of its clothing and home sales. On average, Â£3.8m is spent on clothing and home products on its website and apps every day.
There have also been gaps on the food shelves in some stores after the firm took some of its systems offline in an attempt to manage the attack, while its loyalty scheme and gift card payments have been disrupted too.
Analysts have pointed out that M&S risks losing out to rivals, as online shoppers can quickly switch to other retailers' websites.
The problems have also coincided with a period of warmer weather, when people are likely to want to buy new summer clothes.
M&S shares dropped almost 2% on Friday morning, and are now down about 5% from the point when the company first disclosed its IT systems had been disrupted.
With both the Co-op and Harrods also facing cyber attacks this week, the NCSC - the UK government body responsible for supporting organisations facing cyber threats - has extended its warnings about such attacks to all organisations in the UK and urged them to be vigilant.
NCSC chief executive Richard Horne said the recent spate of attacks should serve as a ""wake-up call"" for big retailers.
He said the NCSC was working closely with the companies that had reported incidents, ""to fully understand the nature of these attacks and to provide expert advice to the wider sector"".
Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said she was worried about the attacks and acknowledged it was concerning for customers and businesses.
She told the BBC's Today programme that big retailers could be vulnerable to such attacks because they were ""high-profile businesses, we all interact with retail each and every day"".
In addition, she added that they were ""highly digital businesses, not just from an online shopping point of view but retailers have lots of systems - payments systems, stock systems"".
However, she said that all of the businesses affected so far have been able to keep their stores open.",Vishala Sri-Pathma,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2y1yg8r2o,Businesses count costs as India and Bangladesh impose trade restrictions,"Businesses are bracing for possible impact after neighbours India and Bangladesh  recently imposed tit-for-tat trade restrictions after months of verbal sparring.
Last month, Bangladesh restricted land imports of cotton yarn from India to shield local industries from cheaper imports.
Dhaka's move came days after India abruptly stopped the transhipment facility it had offered Bangladesh to export its cargoes to third countries via its ports and airports, citing ""congestion"".
Relations between the countries have soured since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August after massive protests. She is currently in exile in India and an interim administration headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is in charge.
Since then Dhaka has demanded Hasina be extradited to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her, and Delhi has not officially reacted to the demand.
India has also frequently criticised reports of attacks on the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh. It recently said the alleged killing of a Hindu community leader ""reflects a pattern of systematic persecution under the interim government"".
Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation, denies targeting minorities, calling most incidents politically motivated or ordinary crimes. Hindus make up less than 10% of its 170 million population.
As the countries spar, firms are counting the cost.
Yarn, vital for Bangladesh's clothing factories, can still enter by sea and air - but they are slower and costlier routes.
In 2024, India had exported $1.6bn (Â£1.2bn) worth of cotton yarn to Bangladesh, a third of it via land ports.
The now-halted transhipment facility let Bangladeshi exporters send clothes made for high-end brands by road to Indian cities, from where it would be flown to Europe and the US.
""It's a blow [to Bangladesh's fast-fashion export industry],"" says Anis Ahmed, head of supply chain firm MGH Group, which ships for European fast-fashion brands. ""The India route got cargo to Western countries in a week. By sea, it takes up to eight weeks.""
Bangladesh, the world's second-largest garment exporter after China, shipped $38bn in clothing last year. Over $1bn of this moved via the India land-air route, which Ahmed says was thriving.
Limited air freight capacity and under-equipped airports hamper direct exports from Bangladesh.
Many see Delhi's withdrawal of the transhipment facility as a response to remarks by Yunus during a recent China visit.
He had called Bangladesh the ""only guardian of the ocean"" for India's landlocked north-east and suggested that the region could become an ""extension of the Chinese economy.""
Leaders from India's north-eastern states called the comments ""offensive"".
Yunus's remarks, spotlighting India's strategic vulnerability in the region to China, raised alarms in Delhi.
India's north-east is linked to the mainland by the 20km-wide Siliguri Corridor - dubbed the ""chicken's neck"" - flanked by Nepal and Bangladesh and close to Tibet's Chumbi Valley.
With a history of border tensions and having lost a war in 1962, Indian defence planners fear that China could target the corridor to cut off the north-eastern states from the rest of the country in any future conflict.
Bangladeshi analysts say Yunus's remarks were misinterpreted and aimed at promoting regional connectivity.
During his China visit, Dhaka also welcomed Beijing's interest in a $1bn Teesta River project in northern Bangladesh.
Indian analysts warn that Chinese involvement in the project, which is not far from the strategic Siliguri Corridor, could unsettle Delhi.
But there is concern on both sides over the frosty ties.
Resentment is growing in Bangladesh over tightened Indian visa rules, with approvals plunging since Hasina was driven from power. Previously, two million Bangladeshis visited India yearly for tourism, business, education and medical care. The number of visas issued daily has dropped by over 80% in the past few months according to local media.
Hasina's stay in India and the extradition demand remains a big irritant.
""They should realise that there is no way that we can just hand Hasina to them. We know what will happen to her if she's handed over. I think public opinion in India would not countenance that,"" says Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary.
Amid rising tensions, India's clothing manufacturers' association has called for a ban on Bangladeshi garment imports via land. Bangladeshi analysts warn that more trade barriers would be counter-productive.
""I think there is a strong view nowadays in Bangladesh that we should also reassess the other transit and transhipment facilities given to India [for its north-eastern states] by the earlier [Hasina] government,"" Debapriya Bhattacharya, a senior economist with the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka, tells the BBC.
India uses Bangladeshi ports, roads and waterways to transport goods to its landlocked north-east, cutting distance, time and costs. However, officials say transit volumes haven't reached expected levels.
Delhi-Dhaka tensions are rising amid growing ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Bangladesh, once East Pakistan, fought for independence in 1971 with Indian support. Hasina distanced herself from Pakistan during her 15-year rule.
Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch visited Dhaka last month, the first such visit in 15 years. A planned visit by Pakistan Deputy PM Ishaq Dar was postponed due to tensions between Delhi and Islamabad over the deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir last week.
""I don't think there is any concern over Dhaka's reachout to Pakistan. If there is any suggestion that there is an intent to work together and make things difficult for India, then that will obviously cause concern,"" says Saran, the former Indian diplomat.
Sharp official reactions from both sides are also influencing public opinion in India and Bangladesh. There is a growing anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh, with Indian media accused of exaggerating the attacks on minorities and Islamist threats.
The people-to-people ties built over years seem to be on the retreat, and analysts point out that if both sides fail to stay calm, their actions could harm trade and economic relations.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4vzpggkjno,McDonald's sales drop as diners face 'uncertainty',"McDonald's has suffered its biggest drop in US sales since the height of Covid, a fall that it said was driven by people's concerns over the US economy.
Despite a marketing tie-in with the Minecraft movie and extended price deals, US customers made fewer visits to the burger chain in the first three months of this year, compared to a year ago.
Chief executive Chris Kempczinski said customers were ""grappling with uncertainty"".
But he assured investors that the firm could ""navigate even the toughest of market conditions"".
McDonald's has been working for months to try to reignite enthusiasm among customers, after facing a backlash over rising prices, especially from lower income households.
However, revenue at US McDonald's outlets that have been open at least a year sank 3.6% in the first three months of 2025 compared to a year earlier.
That is the steepest decline in like-for-like sales in the US since the three months to the end of June 2020 when pandemic restrictions were in place.
The surprise drop in sales coincided with a contraction in the US economy, which shrank at an annual rate of 0.3% in the first three months of 2025, the first quarterly decline in output since 2022.
Reacting to the growth figures, President Trump called for patience, saying he needed ""a little bit of time"" and described the numbers as a reflection of the ""Biden economy"", a reference to his predecessor as president.
However, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said Americans were nervous and cutting back on discretionary spending as a result.
""They're worried prices will rise even higher and that household budgets, already feeling the impact of previous inflation, will be stretched beyond breaking point,"" she said.
""They're also nervous about the potential for job losses if the economy continues to stutter as businesses try and make sense of an evolving tariff environment.""
McDonald's figures reflect the first two months of Donald Trump's presidency, with the reporting period ending just before his barrage of tariff announcements on 2 April.
Dubbed ""Liberation Day"", that broadside prompted further confusion among many firms and consumers.
Mr Kempczinski said: ""Consumers today are grappling with uncertainty, but they can always count on McDonald's [...] for exceptional value"".
""McDonald's has a 70-year legacy of innovation, leadership, and proven agility, all of which give us confidence in our ability to navigate even the toughest of market conditions and gain market share,"" he added.
Over the same three-month period to March, the slump in McDonald's US sales dragged its global like-for-like revenue down 1%, despite growing sales in Japan, Australia, and the Middle East.
Businesses have had a mix of reactions since Trump began revealing and enforcing his plans for tariffs, which are a tax payable by a person or firm buying a good from overseas.
This week, technology giant Intel said costs would rise and a recession was more likely because of Trump's tariffs.
Sportswear brand Adidas said they would lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers including the Gazelle and Samba.
Meanwhile, delivery giant DHL paused deliveries worth more than $800 (Â£603) due to US trade policy before lifting them after negotiating ""adjustments"" to customs rules.
Trump and his allies have said the policies will help to bring more jobs to the US as firms base factories and operations the country to avoid the new taxes.
However, many companies and economists have said this will be difficult to achieve and will likely mean job losses and economic pain at least in the short term.",Mitchell Labiak,5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1zn9d9p4o,Xbox prices hiked worldwide amid tariff uncertainty,"Microsoft has significantly raised prices for its Xbox console, citing increasing development costs and what it called ""market conditions"".
The increases vary from country to country, with Xbox Series S consoles going up by Â£50 to Â£299.99 in the UK.
The US has seen even steeper price rises, with the Series X increasing in price by between $100 (Â£75) and $130, depending on the model.
It comes as US tariffs - which experts predict will increase prices for consumers - stir global economic uncertainty. However, Microsoft has not explicitly said tariffs were behind the increase.
Xbox prices are also rising in other countries around the world, with the Series S increasing by â¬80 in Europe and $50 in Australia.
It represents a big change in an industry which would typically see prices go down in the years after a console's launch.
""We understand that these changes are challenging,"" Microsoft said in a blog post.
""They were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development.""
Kedhrin Gonzalez, founder of Rip & Tear studios, told the BBC he felt the price rise was ""inevitable"" and ""catalysed by current tariff disruptions"".
""Gamers will suffer most, with little hope of prices decreasing,"" he said.
""This could significantly impact Microsoft's already modest Xbox sales and potentially trigger broader industry repercussions.
""This probably won't be the last price hike we see.""
And Christopher Dring, who writes about the gaming industry in The Game Business newsletter, told the BBC tariffs were ""certainly"" part of the decision to increase prices.
""With accessories and components made in China, the connection is pretty obvious,"" he said.
But he said there were other factors at play, such as inflation, changes in exchange rates and the ""general rising cost of business"".
""All of thisÂ is playing havoc in an industry that is seeing limited growth,"" he said.
""The console game sector has barelyÂ grown in terms of users in over 20 years, but costs of manufacturing and game development continue to rise exponentially.
""Any cost increases, even a small tariff, can have a serious impact on the profitability of these devices.""
Historically, in the years following a console's release it would drop in price, but this generation has seen the opposite.
Sony originally listed the PlayStation 5 digital edition at Â£360 in the UK when it launched in 2020, but over the years its price has increased to its current Â£429.99 RRP.
Meanwhile, the cost of future Xbox games is also in question, with the firm revealing it anticipated ""some of our new, first-party games"" would cost $79.99 in 2025.
This is the same retail price Nintendo announced for its upcoming Mario Kart World - a cost which caused concern amongst gamers who called it ""inaccessible"".
But unlike Mario Kart, which will cost less if bought digitally rather than in a physical box, Microsoft said its new price would be the same across the board.
It also clarified it did not plan to increase the price of existing games, only certain new titles developed by the firm itself.
But Microsoft declined to say whether it plans to increase the price of some future games in the UK as well.
""Local pricing may differ across countries and platforms,"" the firm said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4n94klqg9o,Tesla denies contacting headhunters to replace Musk,"Tesla has denied reports that it has contacted recruitment firms to launch a search for a replacement for Elon Musk as chief executive.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the electric car firm's board began looking for a successor to Mr Musk last month.
It said this was because of frustration around Mr Musk's focus on his job in US President Donald Trump's administration and Tesla's sinking share price.
However, in statement on Thursday, Tesla said the report was ""absolutely false"" while Mr Musk wrote on his social media platform X that the paper was ""a discredit to journalism"".
Tesla chair Robyn Denholm wrote on X: ""There was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company.""
""This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published).""
She added: ""The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.""
The denial comes after the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, wrote that Mr Musk was told by the board he needed to spend more time on Tesla and that he needed to say so publicly.
The paper said Mr Musk did not push back against the suggestion.
Last week, Mr Musk said on a conference call about earnings ""I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla"" and pledged to ""significantly"" cut back his government role.
Writing on X on Thursday, Mr Musk was heavily critical of the Wall Street Journal's reporting.
""It is an EXTREMELY BAD BREACH OF ETHICS that the WSJ would publish a DELIBERATELY FALSE ARTICLE and fail to include an unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors,"" he said.
He later reposted a comment from an X user that called the paper ""trash"".
Mr Musk's leadership of Trump's newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - has attracted a lot of criticism.
Some customers of Tesla say they no longer feel loyal to the brand because of Mr Musk's controversial political views and actions while in charge of Doge.
Some have pledged to boycott the firm while others have staged protests against it because of Mr Musk - in some cases causing criminal damage to dealerships.
Meanwhile, investors and analysts have said Mr Musk's reputation and his juggling of high-level roles is part of the reason why Tesla struggling financially.
In March, Trump - with Mr Musk by his side - told reporters at the White House gardens anyone using violence against Tesla would ""go through hell"".
He then pledged to buy a red Model-S, one of a number of Teslas lined up on the White House drive that day, to support the electric car firm.
Temporary government employees, such as Mr Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of Trump's inauguration, will end in late May.
But it is unclear when Mr Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely.
Trump said last month he would keep Mr Musk ""as long as I could keep him"".
On Wednesday, Mr Musk, who also runs space firm SpaceX, made light of the idea he was doing too many jobs.
In a video posted on X in a White House cabinet meeting, he was wearing two baseball caps.
""They say I wear a lot of hats,"" Mr Musk said in the video. ""That's true. Even my hat has a hat.""
Bloomberg reported that Mr Musk also said on Wednesday that Doge should examine the spending of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, particularly the cost of renovating its headquarters.
Mr Musk has made similar comments before, raising the idea that the Fed should be audited. However, such a move would pose questions about the bank's independence.",Mitchell Labiak,5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg456mzn8o,Seven takeaways from US-Ukraine resources deal,"The US and Ukraine have signed a deal that will give Washington access to some of the war-torn country's natural resources.
Months in the making, it sets up an investment fund that Ukraine hopes will cement US assistance as the country struggles to repel Russia three years after the invasion.
The Ukrainians have now published the deal and there have been public statements from both sides. Here are seven key takeaways.
Trump has previously demanded that Ukraine pay back the $350bn (Â£264bn) of aid that he claims has been provided by the US during the war - a condition that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected.
But Washington appears to have made a concession. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the agreement did not dictate that his country pay back any supposed ""debt"".


Trump has styled the agreement as a win for his side as well, saying his country will get back ""much more in theory"" than the billions that were provided to Ukraine by his predecessor Joe Biden.

The language used by the US in announcing the deal is notably harsher towards Russia than is usually the case from the Trump administration.
The agreement refers to ""Russia's full-scale invasion"" and the US Treasury Department adds that ""no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine"".
This will hearten Kyiv, which has demanded more pressure be placed on Russia in talks between Moscow and Washington discussing a possible ceasefire.
Despite the fact that much of the talk around the deal relates to Ukraine's mineral wealth, the agreement also includes provisions for oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons.
In all cases, the resources stay in Ukrainian ownership, even though the US will get joint access.
The inclusion of oil and gas has been seen as a softening of the Ukrainian position, since they were not in earlier drafts of the deal.
Senior administration officials told reporters they believe that ""more value"" can be derived from these resources if the fighting ends quickly.
Ukraine has long aspired to join the European Union and accession talks formally began last June.
There were some concerns in Kyiv that the resources deal could hinder Ukraine's ability to join the EU, if it gave preferential treatment to US investors, as Kyiv and Brussels already have a strategic partnership on raw materials.
But the deal's text says that the US acknowledges Ukraine's intention to join the EU and the need for this agreement not to conflict with that.
It also says that if Ukraine needs to revisit the terms of the deal because of ""additional obligations"" as part of joining the EU, then the US agrees to negotiate in good faith.
Additionally, Kyiv says the US will support additional transfers of investment and technology in Ukraine, including from the EU and elsewhere.
The US has framed the deal as an essential one to sign if Ukraine is to continue to receive its military assistance.
Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington DC to sign the deal - said it envisaged the US contributing new assistance in the future, such as air defence systems.
This, too, would mark a change in strategy for Trump - who has sought to wind down military support for Ukraine since returning to the White House.
One outstanding question is what the accord will ultimately mean for the state of the war. The Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.
It appears there are no concrete security guarantees from the US, which is something Ukraine and Europe have long been pushing the White House to provide.
Trump has long been reluctant to give the same military commitment that Biden had given.
Instead, his interest in staying the course with US support for Ukraine is more implicit, due to the economic commitments set out in this deal.
That means there would still be a fragility about the commitment of Ukraine's most important ally.
One intriguing point highlighted by Ukraine's government is that for the first decade of the reconstruction investment fund, profits will be ""fully reinvested in Ukraine's economy"", either in new projects or reconstruction.
This could be potentially significant if there is no financial benefit for the US for 10 years.
However, this provision does not appear to be in the agreement signed in Washington, although it might later be part of an additional ""technical"" deal.  Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on social media that ""these terms will be subject to further discussion"".
After that initial 10-year period, Kyiv says profits may be distributed between the partners.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News late on Wednesday that the deal was a signal to the American people that ""we have a chance to participate, get some of the funding and the weapons, compensation for those and be partners with the success of the Ukraine people"".
Speaking at the White House on Thursday, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller described the deal as ""repayment"" to the US for the  ""hundreds of billions of dollars that our taxpayers suspect subsidised the war"".","Paul Kirby, James FitzGerald and Tom Geoghegan",5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62x4zxe418o,Harrods latest UK retailer to be hit by cyber attack,"The luxury department store Harrods says it is the latest retailer to have been targeted by a cyber attack.
The firm said it had ""restricted internet access at our sites"" following an attempt to gain access to its systems.
It comes the day after the Co-op shut down parts of its IT systems to fend off a hack, while Marks & Spencer continues to deal with a cyber attack that has cost it millions of pounds in lost sales.
Harrods said its flagship store remained open, and it continues to operate its online sales.
Harrods did not clarify what the scale of the impact on its network was, but said customers were being asked to ""not do anything differently at this point"".
A statement from Harrods read: ""We recently experienced attempts to gain unauthorised access to some of our systems.
""Our seasoned IT security team immediately took proactive steps to keep systems safe and as a result we have restricted internet access at our sites today.
""Currently all sites including our Knightsbridge store, H beauty stores and airport stores remain open to welcome customers. Customers can also continue to shop via harrods.com.""
Harrods' online store appeared to be operating normally on Thursday evening.
Richard Horne, chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the UK government body responsible for supporting organisations facing cyber threats, said the spate of attacks should serve as a ""wake-up call"" for Harrods, the Co-op and M&S.
He said the NCSC was working closely with the companies that had reported incidents, ""to fully understand the nature of these attacks and to provide expert advice to the wider sector based on the threat picture"".
Cody Barrow, former cyber chief at America's National Security Agency, now chief executive of cybersecurity firm EclecticIQ, said the incident exposed the sector's ""mounting vulnerability to cyber threats"".
He said retailers should assume that they are targets for cyber attackers, due to the volume of customer data and the high impact that disruption can cause.
""For consumers, vigilance is crucial: update passwords, monitor financial activity, and watch for scams exploiting recent breaches,"" he added.
Marks and Spencer has seen its operations severely hampered by a cyber attack, the firm disclosed last week.
Customers are still unable to place online orders and shelves have been left empty in some stores.
The police are investigating.
Meanwhile, the Co-op said on Wednesday it had shut down parts of its IT systems in response to hackers attempting to gain access.
On Thursday, it emerged staff at the Co-op were being ordered to keep their cameras on during remote work meetings, and verify all attendees.
Experts say that indicates the company suspects hackers may be lurking in calls.
It is not known if the three incidents are connected.
Toby Lewis, Head of Threat Analysis at cybersecurity firm Darktrace, said it was possible that the three incidents impacting M&S, the Co-op and Harrods were a coincidence.
But he suggested two other possibilities: that all three retailers share a common supplier or technology that has been compromised and used as an entry point for hackers.
Or the scale of the attack on M&S had prompted security teams at other retailers to look more closely at their safety logs and act on activity they would not have previously judged a risk.
""It's a lesson again in the growing difficulty large organisations have in securing against threats in their supply chain, particularly as those threats grow in volume and sophistication,"" he said.
It is believed the disruption at M&S was a ransomware attack.
This is a type of malicious software used to scramble important data or files after gaining access to computer systems, essentially locking them away unless a ransom is paid.
Security experts told the BBC on Tuesday a ransomware group which goes by the name ""DragonForce"" was behind the attack.
The Co-op has not given any details of the nature of cyber attack made against it.
The chair of Parliament's Business and Trade Committee, Liam Byrne, has written to Marks and Spencer's chief executive, Stuart Machin, requesting further information about M&S's cybersecurity defences, and whether it had adhered to the guidance given by the NCSC.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg72kg5yn2ko,'They wanted $4m': Lessons for M&S from other cyber attacks,"As Marks & Spencer - and its customers - continue to reel from a major cyber attack, other people who have gone through similar experiences have been sharing what it is like to be targeted by hackers.
""It was an absolute nightmare,"" says Sir Dan Moynihan. He runs the Harris Federation, a group of 55 schools in the London and Essex area.
Sir Dan told the BBC how it was hacked four years ago by the Russian ransomware crime group REvil.
""Their purpose was to blackmail us into paying $4m (Â£3m) in cryptocurrency within 10 days,"" he said.
""If we didn't pay in 10 days, they wanted $8m.""
The hack caused chaos. The finances of the school group were hit, with staff and bills left unpaid.
Sir Dan said the group lost teaching materials, lesson plans and registration systems.
Even medical records and fire and phone systems were affected.
M&S has also been targeted with ransomware - malicious software which locks an owner out of their computer or network and scrambles their data.
Typically the criminals who use it then demand a fee to unlock those systems. Sir Dan says it was a demand he resisted.
Instead, the school group approached a firm of cyber specialists who employed a hostage negotiator. That individual then took on the role of an inexperienced school bursar - an administrator - who pretended to not know what was going on.
They took up negotiations with the hackers, with the purpose of delaying them for as long as possible so the school group could rebuild its systems.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Dan said: ""The Russians had stolen data from us - they didn't tell us what - and they threatened to put this stuff up on the dark web and cause us great embarrassment, and secondly they would lock down our systems.""
He said it took the group three months to get everything working again, at the cost of Â£750,000. Among the work was 30,000 devices that needed to be ""cleaned"" following the hack.
Was there ever a question of giving the criminals what they wanted? Never, said the school group boss.
""The money we have is for disadvantaged young people, and secondly had we paid we would have opened the door for other school groups to be attacked.""
The experience of being hacked can be a difficult one for individuals caught in the disruption.
Wedding dress designer Catherine Deane said it was ""devastating"" when her company's Instagram account was hacked.
""It felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. Instagram is our primary social platform, and we've invested the most amount of time and business resources into it.
""To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this workâ¦ it was just pulled.""
She told the BBC last month of the difficulty of fixing the problem with Meta, the owner of Instagram, describing that experience as ""almost traumatising"".
In June last year, staff at hospitals in London told of how they were left grappling with the aftermath of a cyber attack that led to many hours of extra work for their staff.
A critical incident was declared after the ransomware attack targeted the services provided by pathology firm Synnovis.
Services including blood transfusions were severely disrupted at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital and King's College Hospital (KCH).
Dr Anneliese Rigby, a consultant anaesthetist at KCH, told the BBC at the time: ""So what the labs are having to do is receive the blood sample, manually process that, which is a long, time-consuming process requiring a lot of staff which we don't have so we're having to get extra people to help with that.""
M&S has only issued limited information in its official statements, and has not put anyone up for interview.
However, people claiming to work for the retailer have given a sense of the chaos on social media.
On Reddit, users who identified themselves as M&S workers, something the BBC has not verified, described the impact of the cyber attack.
One wrote that most internal systems had been affected and that there had been experiments with ""resuming operations manually with paper and pen"".
Another poster said head office staff were working weekends, and that the problems were ""like going back in time"".
While some reported shortfalls in goods coming in, others described oversupply of some items, which meant food went to waste.
What is clear is other companies are watching what's happening closely, even more so since another retailer, the Co-op, shut down some of its IT systems this week in response to a separate cyber attack.
""We're patching like mad,"" is what one retailer told the BBC.
In other words, they are making sure every part of system has the most up-to-date software and protections.
Sir Charlie Mayfield, the former chairman of John Lewis, said other firms understood only too well how vulnerable they were.
""Online shopping has completely transformed retail - as technology becomes more pervasive, the risk of this kind of attack rises with it,"" he told the BBC.
According to the cyber security breaches survey, conducted by the UK government, 74% of large businesses said they were targeted with cyber attacks last year.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypw7pn9q3o,US and Ukraine sign long-awaited natural resources deal,"The US has signed a deal with Kyiv to share profits from the future sale of Ukraine's mineral and energy reserves, after months of tense negotiations.
The deal aims to provide an economic incentive for the US to continue to invest in Ukraine's defence and reconstruction - as well as to address Washington's concerns over the amount of aid it has already contributed.
Ukraine is believed to have vast reserves of critical minerals like graphite, titanium and lithium. They are highly sought after because of their use in renewable energy, military technology and infrastructure.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed both sides were committed to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.
The deal will also see the establishment of an investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from the war.
According to the statement from the US Treasury on Wednesday afternoon, the newly created US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund recognises the ""significant financial and material support"" the US has given Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.
The US treasury secretary said in a video statement that the deal would help ""unlock Ukraine's growth assets"".
The language of the announcement shows much more solidarity with Ukraine than is usual for the Trump administration.
It refers to ""Russia's full scale invasion"" and adds that ""no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine"".
The Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.
For Kyiv, it is seen as essential to accessing US military aid.
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington to ink the deal on Wednesday - said in a post on X that the new fund would ""attract global investment into our country"".
Listing the deal's provisions, she said it would involve projects in minerals, oil and gas, although the resources would remain the property of Ukraine.
The partnership will be equal, on a 50:50 basis, she added, and must be ratified by lawmakers in Kyiv.
Under the deal, the US would contribute new assistance to Kyiv, she added, including, for example, air defence systems.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for the agreement as a prerequisite to offering any future security guarantees to Kyiv.
Crucially, the draft of the deal indicates Ukraine will be giving Washington access to some of its natural resources in return for future US security assistance.
But that is significantly less than what Trump had wanted, which was to get paid back for all US military aid given since the start of the war.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has managed to eke out some concessions from Washington.
The deal was delayed after US authorities said Kyiv was trying to make last-minute changes.
On Wednesday afternoon, a US source familiar with the talks criticised Ukraine for seeking to reopen some terms that had apparently been finalised over the weekend.
The source said sticking points had included governance of the fund, issues with transparency, and steps to ensure that all funds would be fully traceable.
Technical documents were signed last week by representatives of both countries.
The initial agreement was due to be signed in February, but fell apart following a heated exchange at the White House when Trump accused Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"".
The breakthrough comes days after Trump and Zelensky held a face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, and as talks between Moscow and Washington over a possible ceasefire in Ukraine grind on.
Phoning into the NewsNation network on Wednesday evening, Trump said he had pressed Zelensky at Vatican City to seal the deal.
""I was telling him that it's a very good thing if we can produce a deal that you sign it,"" he said, ""because Russia is much bigger and much stronger. Russia is just chugging forward.""
The US president said the deal would recuperate the multi-billion dollar US assistance to Ukraine since the war began and ""much more in theory"".
""So I went to them and said, 'Look, we got to get rare earth.' They have great rare earth, meaning certain minerals, materials,"" said Trump.
""They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have.""
The agreement comes amid a US trade war with China, where 90% of the world's current rare-earth stocks are sourced.",Bernd Debusmann Jr,5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c807n4rnmjyo,Trump tells business chiefs he needs 'little bit of time' as US economy shrinks,"President Donald Trump has asked for more time on the US economy as it contracted for the first time in three years, stoking recession fears.
He said the figure was misleading because companies had stockpiled imports ahead of his imposition of tariffs.
Trump, however, said $8tn (Â£6tn) of inward investment had been promised, which he argued would restore American manufacturing prowess.
The US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, the US commerce department said, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. It comes as Trump marks 100 days in office, with opinion polls indicating public discontent over his economic stewardship.
Speaking on Wednesday afternoon at a White House event attended by business leaders, Trump blamed his Democratic predecessor, President Joe Biden, for the disappointing gross domestic product data.
""This is Biden's economy because we took over on January 20th,"" Trump said. ""I think you have to give us a little bit of time to get moving.""
It comes in the aftermath of the Republican president's import taxes, which have disrupted global trade and markets.
Trump's finger pointing at Biden drew scorn from Democrats.
Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, minority leader of the US House of Representatives, said: ""This is not Joe Biden's economy, Donald, it is your economy.
""It is the Trump economy, it is a failed economy and the American people know it.""
At Wednesday's White House event, Trump touted planned investments in technology, healthcare and infrastructure.
He introduced CEOs of major companies, including Hyundai's Jose Munoz, Toyota's Ted Ogawa, and Johnson & Johnson's Joaquin Duato.
Trump also urged Congress to pass his tax bill, which includes trillions of dollars in tax and spending cuts, but faces opposition from Democrats and some Republicans.
At a television appearance earlier in the day with cabinet members, Trump played down fears of shortages of items such as toys, as trade between the US and China falls sharply.
""Well, maybe the children will have to have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know?"" he said. ""And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.""
Trump has enacted 10% levies on imports to the US from nearly all countries, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs. The amount paid by these countries could change after the period expires in July.
Another 25% tariff has been imposed on Mexico and Canada. The levies on China, however, have led to an all-out trade war with the world's second largest economy.
Trump imposed import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US and China hit back with a 125% tax on American products.
His administration said when the new tariffs were added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7jdn09lxo,'We don't care': A defiant China looks beyond Trump's America,"""We don't care about sales to the United States,"" says Hu Tianqiang as one of his toy fighter jets flies past our heads.
It's hard to hear him above the buzzing toy planes and miniature drones, an almost rhythmic backdrop to the cacophony of toys that surround him, all clamouring for the attention of buyers.
Hu's stall, Zhongxiang Toys, sits inside the world's biggest wholesale market in the small Chinese city of Yiwu.
It's a huge showroom of more than 75,000 shops where buyers come seeking just about everything, from twinkling Christmas lights and kitchenware to umbrellas and massage guns. It can take most of the day just to get around one department given each of them has an airport hangar's worth of goods on show.
Yiwu is in the province of Zhejiang, along China's eastern coast. The manufacturing and export hub, home to more than 30 ports, accounted for 17% of all Chinese sales to the US last year.
That puts Yiwu, and this region, at the frontline of the US-China trade war.
Mr Hu, too, is on the frontline. He sits among rows of snazzy toy jets, squeaking dogs, fluffy stuffed animals, barbies and motorcycle-riding spidermen â a sliver of the $34bn (Â£25bn) worth of toys China exported in 2024.
About $10bn of it went to the US. But now, these Chinese exports to America face up to 245% tariffs. And US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he blames Beijing in particular for cornering too much of the global market.
But things have changed here since Trump's first trade war against China, which kicked off in 2018. It taught Yiwu a lesson, summed up by Mr Hu: ""Other countries have money too!""
That defiance has become a familiar theme in the world's second-biggest economy, which is bracing itself for another turbulent Trump presidency.
Beijing, which has been repeatedly telling the world that the US was bullying countries into trade negotiations, has not backed down yet from the trade war.
The propaganda online has ratcheted up, applauding Chinese innovation and diplomacy in contrast to the uncertainty unleashed by Trump. On the country's highly controlled social media, there are plenty of posts echoing the leadership's promise that China will keep fighting.
And in factories and markets, businessmen and exporters now say they have other alternatives, beyond Trump's America. Mr Hu, for instance, says around 20%-30% of his business came from US buyers. But not anymore.
""We don't care about that 20-30%,"" Mr Hu says. ""We now sell mostly to South America and the Middle East. We are not lacking money, we are rich.""
When we ask about Trump, his colleague Chen Lang jumps in, rolling his eyes: ""He's cracking international jokes like no other. One day, one joke. Adding tariffs for him is like cracking a joke.""
Nearby, one of the thousands of buyers that flock to this market every day is negotiating a price to buy more than 100 robots that turn into cars in a series of beeps and buzzes. After tapping various numbers into a calculator, the final price is written in chalk on the floor.
The buyer, we are told, is from Dubai. The BBC met many others from across Africa and South America.
Lin Xiupeng says he has noticed the shift away from American buyers in his last 10 years in the toy business.
""A few days ago, the shop next to us had an order from a US client. It's worth more than one million yuan. But because of tariffs, the shop owner decided to cancel it,"" he says, offering us cups of tea.
""They must need China,"" he says, adding that the country supplies most of America's toys.
""I think there are a lot of businesses in the US protesting these days.""
Mr Lin is correct. Some toy shop owners in the US have written to the White House describing the tariffs as ""disastrous"" for their business.
""The tariffs are taking a hatchet to small businesses across America,"" Jonathan Cathey, who owns a toy company in Los Angeles, told the BBC over the phone.
He invested his last $500 in his company, Loyal Subjects, in 2009, which he ran from his two-bedroom bungalow in West Hollywood. He says it's now a multi-million-dollar business, but the tariffs could derail his plans.
""The entire toy industry could go under. We are looking at the total implosion of the supply chain. It's going to get really ugly,"" he warns.
He says swapping suppliers is a huge task: ""You need a lot of resources on the ground to produce a toy and many of these Chinese businesses have spent 40 years perfecting their craft.""
China has been a big part of Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, with his administration going head-to-head with Beijing.
""He seems to be launching a crusade against the whole world,"" says former Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, who served in the People's Liberation Army. ""But of course he's trying to bash China the hardest.""
Trump accused China of operating the Panama Canal, which is run by a Hong Kong-based firm, and vowed to take it back. He has been on the hunt for ways to mine rare earth minerals, which China effectively has a monopoly over, making this a key part of any deal with Ukraine. His threats to take Greenland are also likely aimed at curbing China's ambitions in the Arctic.
And, of course, he initiated another trade war, which takes special aim at China's neighbours, such as Vietnam and Cambodia, that have been crucial to its evolving supply chain.
In the last week, he suggested the levies on Chinese goods could be halved and spoke of ""a fair deal with China"" that his administration was ""actively"" negotiating.
But China's Commerce Ministry rebuffed this as ""groundless with no factual basis"". The headlines in state media haven't spared him either:  ""Trump is probably the worst president in American history,"" read one on state TV.
It seems the US president is waiting for his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to pick up the phone.
""We in China say â we have to let the bullet fly for a moment,"" Col Zhou says. ""That means in the fog of war, we do not know what will come next. I believe this kind of tit-for-tat would last for maybe one or two months â hopefully not more than three months.""
It cannot go on, he adds, because that would not be good.
It's certainly not good for China. Trump's tariffs are not even the biggest challenge facing the country, which is also grappling with domestic economic pain, from low consumption to a housing crisis that has dented people's savings and confidence in the future.
The terrible timing aside, the tariffs are biting Chinese businesses.
Goldman Sachs has forecast that China's economy will grow by 4.5% this year, short of the government's target: 5%.
The BBC reported from the trading hub of Guangzhou in mid-April that US-China trade was grinding to a halt, with exports to American households piling up on factory floors. That is borne out by this month's economic data, which show that activity in factories has sharply slowed.
When the BBC rang suppliers to see if shipments to the US had resumed, what emerged was a messy picture. One supplier said he had half-a-million pieces of clothing waiting to ship to Walmart, and a few others echoed his uncertainty. But two exporters we spoke to said some shipments from US retailers had indeed restarted.
The range and complexity of the trade between the two economies, which includes cargo cranes, umbrellas and everything in between, means that it's often down to different businesses and supply chains as to how they deal with the tariffs.
Whatever the business, there is no doubt the American consumer will feel the absence, or potentially higher prices, of Chinese goods.
The US still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing to meet its own domestic demand â think phones, computers, semiconductors, furniture, clothes and, of course, toys. Electronics and machinery alone account for more than 50% of US imports.
Walmart and Target reportedly told Mr Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could carry on until Christmas.
Some 90% of all Christmas decorations hung around American homes come from Yiwu in China, where sellers, surrounded by signs wishing the world ""Feliz Navidad"" told us they're now trying to focus on sales to South America.
And that effort is very evident in Yiwu.
In the early morning, before the shutters even open, the cavernous lobby of the wholesale market echoes with voices reciting key phrases.
""Shukran,"" says the teacher in Arabic. The students repeat it several times to perfect the pronunciation before learning that it means ""thank you"". ""Aafwan"" comes the reply, or ""you're welcome"".
These are free lessons offered by a local government association. Most of the students are women, dressed in their best to also impress their customers.
""These women are the backbone of trade across China,"" says one stall holder, who is originally from Iran and is giving private lessons to an eager student.
""They're doing these lessons to stay ahead of one another, to stay in competition.""
Most of the traders can already speak a few words of English. Now they say they need to greet their new buyers in Spanish and Arabic â a small but crucial sign of China's shifting trade relationships.
Oscar, a Colombian who would only give us his first name, was wandering the halls of the market with bags filled with fluffy bunnies and bears.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62xv43xqq5o,Apple referred for possible criminal contempt investigation,"A US district judge has found Apple wilfully violated her injunction in a case brought by Epic Games - and that a top Apple executive ""outright lied"" under oath.
The injunction was supposed to block Apple from anti-competitive conduct and pricing, opening the App Store up to outside payment options.
Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said she was referring the matter to the US Attorney for Northern District of California to investigate whether a criminal contempt proceeding is appropriate.
In response, an Apple spokesperson said: ""We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.""
Wednesday's judgement refers to a 2021 case brought by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, one of the world's most popular games, which argued that third-party payment options should be available to customers.
It challenged the up-to-30% cut Apple takes from purchases - and argued that the App Store was monopolistic.
In her 2021 judgement, Judge Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple could no longer prohibit developers linking to their own purchasing mechanisms.
As well as game purchasing, another example of how this would work is a movie-streaming service being able to tell customers to subscribe via its own website, without using Apple's in-app purchasing mechanism.
In a contempt order issued Wednesday, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple nevertheless continued to interfere with competition with attempts that the court stated ""will not be tolerated"".
Judge Gonzalez Rogers added that internal company documents she reviewed showed Apple deliberately violated the injunction.
The documents reveal ""that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option"", she wrote.
She said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with the injunction and allowed CFO Luca Maestri to convince him not to.
""Cook chose poorly,"" she wrote.
She also said Apple's vice-president of finance Alex Roman ""outright lied under oath"".
The judge wrote that one example of Apple's attempts to evade the injunction included a decision to charge a 27% commission on off-app purchases, when it had previously charged nothing.
The company also imposed new barriers and requirements to discourage customers from using competing purchasing platforms, she said.
In a post on X, Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said his company would return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week and offered an olive branch to his long-time rival.
""Epic puts forth a peace proposal: if Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return 'Fortnite' to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic,"" Sweeney wrote.
In another post, he wrote: ""NO FEES on web transactions. Game over for the Apple Tax. Apple's 15-30% junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Unlawful here, unlawful there.""",Lily Jamali,5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd3mey1ej2o,Meta warns of 'worse' experience for European users,"Meta warned on Wednesday that European users could face a ""materially worse"" experience following a key regulatory decision by the European Commission.
Meta recently introduced a ""consent or pay"" model which leaves users to choose between paying for a monthly subscription or letting Meta combine data it has collected on Facebook and Instagram.
Last week, the European Commision - the EU's executive - announced it had decided that the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and fined Meta â¬200m (Â£171m).
""Based on feedback from the EC in connection with the DMA, we expect we will need to make some modifications to our model,"" Meta said in its quarterly earnings statement.
Meta said it expected those modifications ""could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact"" to its European business and revenue.
The company said those impacts could kick in as soon as the third quarter of this year, and may be in effect while it appeals the decision.
They would not apply to users in the UK, where Meta has not implemented its ad-free subscription model.
It is currently in discussions with the UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), about a similar model for UK users and what it might look like.
A Meta spokesperson told the BBC it was engaging with the ICO to ensure its service satisfies regulatory expectations ""while delivering the UK Government's commitment to ensure that regulators and regulation support growth"".
""Personalised advertising on our platforms drives over Â£19.5 billion in revenues for UK businesses every year,"" they added.
Eric Seufert, analyst at Mobile Dev Memo, said Meta may be trying to strategically turn European users into ""vocal cheerleaders"" for its products amid a regulatory clampdown.
""What they ultimately want to do is turn public opinion against this regulatory regime which will demonstrably degrade the product offerings that are available to EU residents,"" Seufert told the BBC in a phone interview after the announcement.
Meta, formerly known as Facebook, includes the social media network in addition to the photo sharing app Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp.
The Commission has said that Meta's consent-or-pay model does not allow users to freely consent to how their data is used.
The body is currently assessing another option Meta introduced last year, which the company says uses less personal data to display advertisements.
Meta was given 60 days to comply with the DMA's recent decision, or risk further fines.
Apple was also issued a â¬500m (Â£428m) fine over its App Store practices last week.
Meta's announcement comes as it released quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street expectations.
The results showed Meta continues to bring in significant advertising revenue.
The company touted its AI tools on Wednesday.
""We're making good progress on AI glasses and Meta AI, which now has almost 1 billion monthly actives,"" Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.
""Our community continues to grow and our business is performing very well,"" he said.
Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said the results showed that Meta has gone ""full throttle on investments in AI"".
Britzman also noted the 6% jump in daily active users.
""There had been some concerns that we might see a slowdown in new users this year, but this was a very strong start and a signal to investors that Meta's family of apps has a grip on users that's hard to displace,"" Britzman said.
The recent rollout of its Meta AI chatbot to users in Europe was met with ire by some WhatsApp users, however.
Meta defended the ""optional"" tool that users cannot remove, saying it would listen to user feedback.
The EC fine comes amid what Meta called ""an active regulatory landscape"" in its earnings report.
The company is currently defending itself at trial in a case brought by the US Federal Trade Commission which alleges that Meta runs a social media monopoly.
The FTC, the top antitrust watchdog in the US, says Meta cemented its monopoly by purchasing Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwz9kl12l1o,US economy shrinks as firms import more ahead of tariffs,"The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year as government spending fell and imports surged due to firms racing to get goods into the country ahead of tariffs.
The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said.
The figures marked the first quarterly decline in three years, and came as the introduction of import taxes by President Donald Trump has scrambled global trade and created major uncertainty.
But analysts said it would take more time to understand the impact of the tariff changes.
While imports count against growth in calculations of gross domestic product (GDP), the surge is expected to be reversed in the months ahead. Those swings do not necessarily indicate an economy performing poorly.
The report also showed consumer spending - the primary driver of the US economy - expanded 1.8%, though at a slower pace than in 2024.
At a television appearance with cabinet members, Trump blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the economic weakening, maintaining that his policies would drive investment in the US and an economic boom.
""This is Biden,"" he said, while appearing to dismiss bubbling fears of price increases, supply shocks and shortages of items such as toys, as trade between the US and China falls sharply.
""Well, maybe the children will have to have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.""
In a statement, the White House said the GDP figures were a ""backward-looking indicator"".
""The underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering,"" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.
Since re-entering the White House in January, Trump has taken the business world by storm, announcing a series of new trade tariffs that he says will raise money for the government and help boost US manufacturing.
While he has watered down some of the policies in face of domestic outcry, analysts say the measures still leave the US with the highest overall effective average tariff rate in more than 100 years.
This report tracked activity through the end of March, a period before Trump announced his most far-reaching ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on China and other countries around the world, which sparked a dramatic sell-off in the stock market and turmoil in currency and debt markets.
It showed imports skyrocketed by more than 40% in the first three months of the year, while consumer spending grew 1.8%, down from 4% at the end of 2024.
Analysts cautioned that those figures could be distorted by people pulling forward their purchases in anticipation of tariffs.
The report also showed an unexpected jump in business investment, while final sales to private domestic purchasers - a closely watched indicator of overall demand - grew a solid 3%, little changed from the previous quarter.
""Overall, not as bad as feared,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.
Tariffs are a tax on imports, which economists have warned will lead to higher prices.
Some firms, such as toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker on Wednesday, have already announced plans to raise prices in response to the measures.
If shoppers baulk at higher prices and demand falls as expected, it could dampen growth further.
As corporate America enters a busy period of public updates for investors, many companies, including carmakers such as Stellantis and Mercedes, have said they cannot provide guidance about sales expectations for the months ahead, citing the uncertainty.
Leading stock indexes in the US, which had recovered from steep losses as Trump rolled back on some of his plans, opened lower after the figures were published but ended the day roughly flat.
But economists at Wells Fargo said it was difficult to draw firm conclusions from the latest data, noting that the drag on growth from trade was the biggest since the 1940s.
""The US economy is at a greater risk of recession today than it was even a month ago, but this contraction in GDP is not the start of one,"" they said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg30dlp1vo,Billionaire Isaacman takes big step toward leading Nasa,"A 42 year-old entrepreneur who was the first non-professional astronaut to walk in space is on his way to becoming the head of Nasa.
Jared Isaacman won approval from a key Senate committee and now only needs to clear a vote of the full chamber to lead an agency that has set its sights on returning to the moon.
While he is expected to win that vote, the billionaire with ties Elon Musk has encountered scepticism. Members of both parties asked at his confirmation hearing about possible conflicts of interest, his desire to send astronauts to Mars, and budget cuts.
President Donald Trump has said Mr Isaacman's leadership will pave the way ""for groundbreaking achievements"" in science and technology.
The committee voted 19 to 9 to send his nomination to the full chamber, with most of the votes against him coming from Democrats.
Mr Isaacman, along with Space X's Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space. They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.
He'll be expected to do the same at Nasa, whose space programmes are regarded by private sector operators as wasteful and often significantly over budget.
Mr Isaacman has said that the major aerospace contractors are ""incentivised to be economically inefficient"".
He has made it clear he would like to expand the human spaceflight programme at the agency.
In a confirmation hearing on 9 April, Mr Isaacman said he hoped to pursue the Artemis mission to the moon, as well as potential missions to Mars.
But lawmakers feared he would sacrifice the long-planned moon mission to focus on Mars. He sought to reassure them that the two were related and ""we could be paralleling these efforts and doing the near-impossible"".
""We will prioritise sending American astronauts to Mars and along the way we will inevitably have the capabilities to return to the moon,"" he said.
""We don't have to make a binary decision of moon versus Mars, or moon has to come first versus Mars,"" he later added.
During the confirmation process, it emerged that he had been arrested at the Canadian border in 2010 and returned to Nevada to face charges that he had passed bad checks to casinos.
In a questionnaire, Mr Isaacman said that the dispute with the Palms Casino in Las Vegas stemmed from a travel reimbursement that the resort promised but failed to deliver.
He added that the issue was resolved in 24 hours, with charges dismissed and court records sealed.
On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision: ""This second space age has only just begun.""
""There will inevitably be a thriving space economy â one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space,"" he wrote. ""At Nasa, we willâ¦ usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq7y8vl55yo,Xi's real test is not Trump's trade war,"Listen to Laura read this article

If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.
The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.
Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels â some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.
China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.
""For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for developmentâ¦ it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,"" he said this month.
His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.
Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested â and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?
With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.
This has not been prompted by the trade war â but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.
Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.
The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most ""extreme estimate"" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.
Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects â lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled ""ghost cities"". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.
The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.
And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.
They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension â over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.
There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.
The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.
""Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,"" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.
""Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.""
According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, ""China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administrationâ¦ The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.""
To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not ""sustainable"".
""We need a long-term mechanism,"" he says. ""We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.""
This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.
Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.
A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.
All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.
""Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,"" Xi said in 2012.
This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.
Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.
It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.
Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.
The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.
Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.
President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.
""In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,"" says Prof Zhang. ""But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.""
Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa â and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.
China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.
In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.
As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.
The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.
Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.
Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.
""Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,"" says Prof Zhang.
China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.
Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.
According to Prof Huihua, ""about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions"".
There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.
China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.
In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.
Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be ""holding China's hand"" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.
China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.
Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.
And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".
Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.
""Trump has chickened out,"" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.
Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.
The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets â especially in the Global South.
This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws â and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy747g49ezo,Starbucks to hire more baristas in bid to win back customers,"Starbucks will hire more baristas and scale back plans to roll out automation, the coffee shop giant's chief executive Brian Niccol says.
The move, which is part of his strategy to win back customers, comes as other food and drink chains increasingly adopt technology to cut costs.
Also on Tuesday, the firm announced worse-than-expected financial results as its sales continue to fall.
Mr Niccol was brought into Starbucks last year tasked with turning the business around as it struggles with rising prices and consumers cut back spending.
""Over the last couple of years, we've actually been removing labour from the stores. I think with the hope that equipment could offset the removal of the labour,"" Mr Niccol said during a call with investors.
""What we're finding is... that wasn't an accurate assumption with what played out.""
Increasing staff numbers was tested in a handful of stores around the time Mr Niccol joined the firm in September 2024. He has been expanding the approach to include around 3,000 stores this year.
At the same time the firm said it will pull back from deploying its Siren Craft System. Named after the iconic Starbucks logo, it is a suite of technology and equipment that was introduced in 2022 to streamline drink-making.
Mr Niccol highlighted that taking on more staff would mean higher costs but said he was ""banking on some growth to come with the investment"".
Alongside recruiting more baristas, Starbucks is also revamping its coffee shops, menus and the company's dress code.
Starbucks said in April that its baristas would wear dark, single coloured shirts to ""allow our iconic green apron to shine and create a sense of familiarity for our customers"".
In January, it reversed rules for its cafes in North America that allowed people to use their facilities even if they had not bought anything.
The changes were a U-turn from a policy introduced six years ago that allowed people to linger in Starbucks outlets and use their toilets without making a purchase.
So far Mr Niccol's turnaround efforts have seen limited results.
The company's latest financial figures showed that global sales fell by 1% in the three months to the end of March, the fifth quarterly decline in a row.
But while trading continued to show weakness in the US, which is its biggest market, sales rose in China and Canada.
Starbucks shares fell by more than 6.5% in extended trading after the earnings were announced.",JoÃ£o da Silva,6 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rd35wg4ro,"Border crossings, egg prices and jobs - Trump's 100 days speech fact-checked","President Trump used a rally in Michigan to mark what he claimed had been ""the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country, according to many, many people"".
He highlighted his efforts to tackle illegal immigration, to bring back jobs to the US and end what he called ""the inflation nightmare"".
BBC Verify has looked into some of the main claims from his speech.
Trump said ""gasoline prices are down by a lot"" since he took office.
On 29 April, the average price for a gallon of ""regular"" gas - or petrol - across the US was $3.16 (Â£2.36), according to data from the American Automobile Association (AAA).
That is slightly up from the $3.125 (Â£2.33) recorded by the AAA on the day Trump entered the White House.
In his speech, he added that gas prices had ""just hit $1.98 in a lot of states"".
This is a claim he has made several times but we cannot find evidence of prices this low.
As of 29 April, no state had an average gas price lower than $2.67 (Â£1.99), according to the AAA.
The US president also spoke about the cost of eggs - a concern for many US consumers due to an ongoing bird flu outbreak - and said: ""Since I took office, the cost of eggs is down 87%.""
This claim is false.
The average national price for consumers of a dozen large Grade A eggs when Trump entered office in January was about $4.95 (Â£3.70).
This rose to a record high of around $6.23 (Â£4.65) per dozen in March - according to the latest available figures.
The White House has pointed to wholesale egg prices as evidence of improvement.
Wholesale prices have gone down since Trump took office - but by about 52% - from $6.55 (Â£4.89) for a dozen large white eggs in January to $3.15 (Â£2.34) in the past week, according to the US Department of Agriculture.
Trump spoke at length about his efforts to tackle illegal immigration - a key campaign issue in last year's election.
He said: ""For two months in a row, we have set all time records for the lowest number of illegal border crossings ever recorded.""
This claim is backed up by the latest monthly figures on ""encounters"" of illegal migrants recorded by officials at the US-Mexico border.
In March, there were 7,181 encounters of migrants there and in February there were 8,346.
These are the the lowest numbers since these monthly records began in 2000.
By comparison, there were about 140,000 encounters at this border in each of those months last year under President Biden.
His term saw record numbers of border crossings which then fell towards the end of his presidency.
The Migration Policy Institute think tank has studied monthly averages of annual figures available before 2000 and says this year's illegal border crossings are the lowest since the late 1960s, rather than the lowest for ""all time"".
President Trump praised Elon Musk's work at the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) saying: ""They've saved over $150bn on waste, fraud and abuse"".
Doge, an advisory body, publishes a running total of its estimated savings on its website - it was $160bn the last time the site was updated on 20 April.
However, less than 40% of this figure is broken down into individual savings - which include cancelling government contracts, grants and leases.
Analysis by BBC Verify found only about half of these itemised savings had a link to a document or other form of evidence.
Doge says it is working to upload all receipts in a ""digestible and transparent manner"".
Federal contract experts we spoke to also raised questions about Doge's biggest claimed savings and said some had been overstated.
Trump said: ""In three months we have created 350,000 jobs.""
This claim is backed up by official figures.
During Trump's first two full months in office up until March (the latest available data) 345,000 jobs have been added, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
However, over the same period last year 468,000 jobs were added under President Biden.
Trump also said: ""For the first time in recent memory, job gains for native-born Americans now exceed job gains for foreign workers.""
It is true that during President Trump's first two full months in office more jobs have been created for native-born workers than foreign-born workers.
This also happened between February and April last year under President Biden.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5w156y3jeo,Richard Branson criticises Donald Trump's tariffs,"The UK remains a ""fantastic"" place to start a business despite the ""setback"" of Brexit and the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs, Sir Richard Branson says.
Speaking at the launch of his Virgin Group's hotel in Shoreditch, east London, the entrepreneur said that the world of business would ""have to deal with... the complete uncertainty"" of the impact of the US president's tariffs.
The 74-year-old also told the BBC that he wanted to ""make London prosperous for everybody"" following the UK's decision to leave the EU.
Sir Richard said: ""I still think it's a good time to start in the UK and... if we businesspeople can generate enough income for the UK, then taxes will start going down for people.""
He told the BBC that, more than 50 years after launching Virgin Records in London, the UK remained ""really special"" and was ""one of the few countries in the world that is stable"".
Sir Richard said: ""I think that he [Trump] got a nasty shock when the whole world looked like it was going to melt down.
""When he thought he could get away with ridiculous tariffs, he had to backtrack and hopefully he's learned his lesson and there will be a more sensible regime put in place - but with him you never know what's going to happen.
""It's that unpredictability that has done a lot of damage in the world in the last couple of months.""
James Bermingham, chief executive of Virgin Hotels, said: ""Londoners will weather any storm, and we've seen that decade after decade and crisis after crisis.
""The way people bounce back in the city truly sets a standard for the world to follow.""
On the possible introduction of a tourist tax in the capital, Mr Bermingham said he would support a ""small, reasonable fee"", that ""doesn't restrict demand, is industry-led and focused on... improving the tourist experience and improving tourism"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjewggl0yqeo,"Fifty years after the war, Vietnam faces a new US threat - tariffs","On a searing afternoon in Vietnam, Tung Linh declared she ""basically knows nothing"" about the bloody, decades-long war that pitted her country's Communist-run North against the United States-backed South.
""My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,"" says the 20-year-old college student.
Stuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.
Today's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat â it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.
Its authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China.
But that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war â it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.
Vietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.
But it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle âwhich hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.
Vietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).
""I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,"" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. ""And yes, success for me too,"" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.
It's a dream that suits her bustling city â now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.
You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon.
And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.
America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over.
The victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.
But few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their ""reunification"".
Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back â they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.
""I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,"" Linh said.
Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future â and her country's - is not uncommon.
A little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could ""become successful"".  With a laugh, she added: ""And rich!""
When we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.
""We're not angry,"" she says. ""We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.""
Vietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.
The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.
The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the ""middle-income trap"", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment â and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.
After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as ""the boat people"". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.
""Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,"" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.
""The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.""
It's no coincidence this shift began around 2018, when Trump declared his first trade war against China.
Two young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: ""Now it's ready to go.""
They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world â but ""it's a lot better here than China"", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.
Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. ""I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.""
Vietnam is again being asked to choose â America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.
Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing â the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.
As Vietnam insists on ""looking forward"", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.
But even they say there must be no return to the past. ""I used to have a scar here,"" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged.
""There are still some pieces of shrapnel in my body that couldn't be removed. There were battles where it seemed like we would all be killed. But some of us survived while others fell.""
But he says he bears no anger anymore.
""We must have peace. We have already made a lot of progress. People's lives are more prosperous and fulfilled. Now we must work together with the Americans for the future.""",Rupert Wingfield-Hayes,6 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14xydjzn5eo,"Canada will deal with Trump 'on our terms', Carney tells BBC","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said his country deserves respect from the US and will only enter trade and security talks with President Donald Trump ""on our terms"".
Speaking exclusively to the BBC as the polls were closing, Carney said he would only visit Washington when there was a ""serious discussion to be had"" that respected Canada's sovereignty.
Carney and Trump have since spoken and agreed to meet in the near future, according to the Canadian prime minister's office.
""The leaders agreed on the importance of Canada and the US working together â as independent, sovereign nations â for their mutual betterment,"" the statement reads.
Trump was also said to congratulate Carney on the election.
Since Trump's re-election to the White House, the US president has repeatedly mentioned making Canada the ""51st state"" of America, and earlier on Tuesday this was reiterated by the White House on Tuesday.
""The election does not affect President Trump's plan to make Canada America's cherished 51st state,"" White House deputy spokesperson Anna Kelly said.
Carney, who secured a historic victory for his Liberal Party in a snap election on Monday, said such a scenario was ""never, ever going to happen"".
""Frankly, I don't think it's ever going to happen with respect to any other [country]... whether it's Panama or Greenland or elsewhere,"" he added.
However, he said there was a ""win-win possibility"" for his country if it could secure a deal with the US and also build on trading relationships with the European Union and the UK.
The US is a big market for Canadian businesses with roughly 75% of Canada's exports heading south.
Canada accounts for a much smaller 17% of US exports.
Canada is also America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. America's trade deficit with Canada - expected to be $45bn in 2024 - was mostly driven by US energy demands.
Canada and US relations have been strained in recent months, driven by Trump's talk of a ""51st state"" and referring to previous Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as ""governor"" - the title for leaders of individual American states.
The US president has also sparked a global trade war in which Canada was one of the first countries targeted with tariffs.
Trump has partially imposed a blanket 25% tariff on various Canadian goods, along with 25% import taxes on all aluminium and steel imports, but has exempted products covered by a US, Canada and Mexico trade deal known as USMCA.
Canada has retaliated with some C$60bn ($42bn; Â£32bn) worth of tariffs on US goods.
Carney said talks with Trump would be ""on our terms, not on their terms"".
""There is a partnership to be had, an economic and security partnership,"" he said.
""It's going to be a very different one than we've had in the past.""
Carney has touted his experience handling global economic crises as a way to deal with Trump on tariffs.
Before becoming PM in early March, Carney had never held political office.
He is a banker by trade, leading the Bank of Canada during the 2008 global financial crisis before becoming the first non-British person to take on the top job at the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020.
The PM said Canada was the ""biggest client for more than 40 states"" in the US.
""Remember that we supply them [the US] with vital energy. Remember that we supply their farmers with basically all their fertiliser,"" Carney told the BBC.
""We deserve respect. We expect respect and I'm sure we'll get it in due course again, and then we can have these discussions.""
Canada and the US, along with Mexico, have deeply integrated economies, with billions of pounds worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders on a daily basis, for example, car parts.
The introduction of tariffs, which are taxes levied on goods as they enter a country and paid for by the importer, threatens decades of collaborations between the nations.
Trump has argued tariffs will encourage more Americans to buy domestically-made goods, which will ultimately boost US manufacturing and jobs.
While America's main opponent in the global trade conflict is China, the introduction of Trump's blanket, so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"" on the likes of the UK and other European countries has led to allies seeking fresh agreements in response to barriers to trading with the world's largest economy.
Carney, who endorsed UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves during the British general election, said ""one would think"" that Canada and the UK could sign a stalled free trade agreement as part of diversifying trade, but highlighted about 95% of trade between the countries is effectively tariff-free already.
""We could expand the level of integration between our countries, like-minded countries. You think about defence partnerships, and those conversations have just just begun, so there's a lot that we can do,"" he added.
In a statement congratulating Carney, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: ""I know we will continue to work closely on defence, security, trade and investment.""
Carney said the G7 summit hosted by Canada in June would be ""very important"" in deciding the future path of the global trade war, adding it would ""put to the test"" whether the group of the world's seven most advanced economies - which includes the US - was still the most ""like-minded of like-minded countries"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxg7xpr2j0o,Trump calls Bezos as Amazon says no plan to show tariff price rises,"US President Donald Trump has called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after it was reported that the retail giant planned to detail the cost of trade tariffs to its customers.
Amazon said it had looked into itemising the impact for shoppers using Amazon Haul, a low-cost site it launched in the US last year to compete with Shein and Temu.
But it said it had decided not to move forward and the idea had never been under consideration for its main platform.
The White House decision to go on the attack over the report is an indication of the pressure it is facing over its new import taxes, which analysts say will lead to higher prices for consumers and increase the chances of a recession.
At a news conference marking the president's first 100 days in office on Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she had discussed Amazon's reported move with the president and argued it represented ""another reason why Americans should buy American"".
""This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,"" she said. ""Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?""
Trump has ramped up tariffs since re-entering office in January, measures he argues will boost manufacturing and raise tax revenue for the US.
Even after rolling back some of his initial plans this month, Trump's announcements have left many foreign imports facing new duties of at least 10%, while products from China are facing import taxes of at least 145%.
The measures have prompted a sharp drop in trade between the two countries, and raised fears of supply shocks and shortages of products from baby prams to umbrellas, items for which China is a major supplier.
Some businesses are starting to detail the costs of the measures for customers, with Shein and Temu, known for business models that ship directly from Chinese manufacturers to customers, among the online platforms to already announce price hikes.
Merchants from China represent about half of the sellers on Amazon in the US, according to analysts.
Amazon's plan to detail the tariff impact for customers was first reported by Punchbowl News on Tuesday, citing an anonymous source.
Asked about the report, Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle confirmed that the company had considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products for its Amazon Haul store.
""This was never approved and is not going to happen,"" he said in a statement to the BBC.
A source familiar with the Amazon discussions said they had been sparked by the end of the exemption from tariffs for shipments from China worth less than $800.
The person said the decision not to spotlight the new costs was not a response to the White House complaints on Tuesday.
But asked by reporters about his call with Mr Bezos, Trump said the billionaire, who stepped down as chief executive in 2021, had ""solved the problem"".
""Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. He did the right thing. He's a good guy,"" he said.
Amazon was among the many businesses to donate money to the president's inauguration and Mr Bezos was given a seat of honour at the event.
Mr Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, met Trump after the election and has praised his push for deregulation and lower taxes.
But the two men have had a tense relationship in the past.
Trump repeatedly criticised Amazon and the Washington Post during his first term, while Mr Bezos in 2016 accused Trump of using rhetoric that ""erodes our democracy around the edges"" and once joked about blasting him to space in a rocket.
In 2019, Amazon filed a lawsuit against the Pentagon, alleging that it had been denied a $10bn contract due to Trump's decision to ""pursue his own personal and political ends"" to harm Mr Bezos, ""his perceived political enemy"".

He is accused of using his wealth, power and status to traffic and sexually abuse vulnerable men over years - alleged crimes that could carry a life-term jail sentence.
Judge Nusrat Choudhury agreed on Friday that the defendant was ""suffering from a mental disease or defect"", making him ""unable to understand"" court proceedings.
The ruling followed an assessment by two medical experts - one designated by Mr Jeffries' defence team, the other chosen by prosecutors.
Judge Choudhury said in a court order that Mr Jeffries would be treated in hospital for up to four months to see if he is likely to regain competency.
Once a follow-up assessment is complete, the defendant could either face trial or the court will weigh up next steps.
These could include dropping the criminal charges against him, or releasing him to home confinement.
Mr Jeffries was arrested and charged last October along with his British partner, Matthew Smith, 61, and their middleman, James Jacobson, 72.  All three deny the allegations.
US prosecutors allege the men used force, fraud and coercion to make young men, many of whom were aspiring models, engage in violent and exploitative sex acts while Mr Jeffries was chief executive from at least 2008 until 2015.
The charges followed a 2023 BBC documentary and ongoing podcast series that revealed the three of them benefited from a sophisticated operation in which recruiters scouted young men for sex in cities including London, New York, Paris and Marrakesh.
The BBC has since revealed that more than 40 men, including Abercrombie & Fitch employees, have now come forward with civil allegations of sexual assault, drugging or rape - with claims dating back to 1992, the year Mr Jeffries started running the company.
Civil trial lawyers have told the BBC their clients are dismayed at the criminal court's decision that Mr Jeffries is unfit to stand trial.
""We've been speaking with our clients who are disappointed by the decision and still want justice,"" said Brad Edwards and Brittany Henderson, representing 26 alleged victims.
Brian Bieber, Mr Jeffries' criminal defence lawyer, said his client had recently been evaluated by doctors who determined he had Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body disease, and the residual effects of a traumatic brain injury requiring around-the-clock care, which ""will almost certainly worsen over time"".
Dr Cheryl Paradis, the US prosecutor's medical expert, also independently assessed Mr Jeffries. According to court papers, she found he was unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to properly assist in his defence.
""His memory impairment almost certainly would cause him to be unable to accurately recall key events and details,"" Dr Paradis said, according to the court filings, ""and severely limit his capacity to provide accurate and reliable information"".
She added: ""Additionally, his inappropriate behaviour, which is a symptom of his dementia, could further interfere with his ability to maintain proper courtroom demeanour. He may blurt out self-incriminating statements or engage in erratic behaviour, which would undermine his credibility.""
The BBC understands that Mr Jacobson and Mr Smith could still face trial on the same sex-trafficking and prostitution charges.
Alongside criminal charges, Mr Jeffries and his partner Mr Smith have been defending multiple civil lawsuits accusing them of rape, sex trafficking and assault, which they ""vehemently deny"".
The civil lawsuits had been stayed - or legally put on pause - until the resolution of the criminal case, which takes precedence to protect Mr Jeffries' right against self-incrimination.
While his criminal case remains uncertain, Mr Jeffries could still face a civil trial or reach a settlement over the allegations. If this was the case, the outcome could lead to compensation being awarded to alleged victims.
""Mike Jeffries attacked these men and ruined their lives at a point when they were at their most vulnerable and chasing their dreams,"" said civil case lawyer, Brad Edwards.
""He will still be held accountable by our lawsuit and his co-conspirators will still face the criminal justice system.
""For anyone affected still in fear about coming forward, you should be reassured that his power is now totally gone"".
Abercrombie & Fitch is also being sued for negligence, with lawsuits claiming that it knowingly facilitated ""heinous sexual crimes"".
The company - which also owns the Hollister brand - has previously said it was ""appalled and disgusted"" by Mr Jeffries' alleged behaviour.",Rianna Croxford,3 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grd0wqy22o,US jobs grow by more than expected despite tariff turmoil,"Hiring in the US remained solid last month, despite turmoil stemming from changes to trade policy.
Employers added 177,000 jobs in April, while the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2%, the Labor Department said.
The gain was bigger than many analysts had expected in a month marked by chaos in financial markets and rising concerns about the economy tracked in surveys of businesses and households.
The resilience of the US jobs market over the last few years has surprised analysts, helping to sustain spending even as households faced rising prices and a sharp jump in interest rates.
The latest figures have raised some hopes that the country may be able to weather the uncertainty from tariff policy without suffering a painful economic downturn.
But analysts expressed caution, noting that the impact of the sweeping import taxes announced by Donald Trump would take more time to be fully felt.
Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, said it was a good jobs report, despite revisions showing employers added fewer jobs in January and February than initially estimated.
""The key message coming from the totality of the data this week is that the US economy was fundamentally strong through the first week of April, however, the outlook remains very uncertain,"" he said.
The Labor Department's surveys were conducted less than two weeks after Trump announced his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, which have raised the average rate of import taxes in the US to the highest level in more than a century.
Many firms have said they are moving cautiously for now, citing rapid changes in policy and hope that Trump's promises of trade deals will bear fruit.
Hiring last month was led by healthcare, warehousing and transportation firms.
Employment declined in the federal government - where Trump has vowed to cut spending - but that was offset by gains in local government.
Payrolls also dropped at manufacturing and retail firms.
Average hourly pay rose 3.8% over the last 12 months, according to the report.
Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the figures suggested the US central bank does not face urgency to cut interest rates to support the economy.
""Why would the Fed start cutting rates right now when the unemployment rate is near record lows, the consumer is still fairly robust, and inflation is running above target?"" she said.
""The economy will weaken in the coming months but, with this underlying momentum, the US has a decent chance of averting recession if it can step back from the tariff brink in time.""",Natalie Sherman,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy79j2n7d4o,Temu to stop selling goods from China directly to US customers,"Temu has said it will stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform.
The online marketplace said sales would now be handled by ""locally based sellers"", with orders fulfilled from within the country.
The move comes as a duty-free rule for low-value packages is closed.
Temu, and rival Chinese retail giant Shein, had previously relied on the so-called ""de minimis"" exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without having to pay duties or import taxes.
Temu said it had been actively recruiting US firms to join the platform.
""All sales in the US are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country.
""The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses,"" it added.
Supporters of the de minimis loophole, which applied to parcels worth less than $800 (Â£600), argue it helped streamline the customs process.
But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs.
De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as ""of the smallest"".
In this context it refers to a US trade rule enacted by Congress in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import levies.
In the 21st Century, after a series of rises to the threshold, it allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to US customers without having to pay duties or taxes.
Shipments under the exemption accounted for more than 90% of all the cargo entering the US, according to the country's Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).
Chinese online retailers like Shein and Temu had benefited greatly from the loophole.
Both platforms attracted millions of US customers with marketing blitzes that showcased their ultra-low prices
And it was the de minimis exemption that helped them offer those deals so cheaply.
Shein did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.
Last month, in almost identical statements, Shein and Temu said they had seen operating expenses rise ""due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs"", adding they would make ""price adjustments"" from 25 April.
In February, Trump briefly closed the loophole.
The suspension was quickly paused as customs inspectors, delivery firms and online retailers struggled to adapt to such a major change at short notice.
During the initial suspension of the exemption the US Postal Service temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.
The executive order announcing the latest move said it was aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl.
It said many Chinese shippers use deceptive practices to hide illicit substances in low-value packages ""to exploit the de minimis exemption"".
""These drugs kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, including 75,000 deaths per year attributed to fentanyl alone,"" it added.
The idea is not new. Last year, the Biden administration proposed rules intended to stop ""abuse"" of the exemption.
""The growing volume of de minimis shipments makes it increasingly difficult to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments,"" it said.
The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China.
Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on Chinese imports. His administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.
US authorities have also blamed the success of firms like Temu and Shein for putting strains on border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole surged from about 140 million a decade ago to more than one billion last year.
Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. The fee started at $100 and is due to rise to $200 at the beginning of June.
Even before these packages were subject to import taxes, US consumers were warned of potential price rises.
The American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy group, estimated last year that getting rid of the exemption would result in ""$8bn to $30bn in additional annual costs that would eventually be passed on to consumers"".
Chinese online retailers have also benefited from similar rules in the UK and the European Union.
In a move mirroring the US action, the UK has announced a review of low-value imports coming into the country.
In the UK, the current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than Â£135 without incurring import taxes.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the cheap goods are ""undercutting the British High Street and British retailers"".
The European Union has also proposed plans to scrap duty-free exemptions for parcels worth less than â¬150 (Â£127.50; $169.35).
Which means consumers in the UK and EU could soon also see prices rising.
Packages that arrived in the US under the exemption were inspected in the same way as other goods, including being checked for illegal substances. And most synthetic opioids are brought into the country through the border with Mexico, according to officials.
Some experts think ending the exemption will do little to curb illegal drugs and not address the challenges faced by US manufacturers.
There are also concerns the move will create more work for US border officials, who are already stretched as they try to stop drug smuggling.
According to pro-open trading association the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), removing the de minimis exemption would ""shift the CBP's focus away from the border, where a vast majority of illegal substances and products are entering the country.""
""CBP would need to hire and train new personnel, costing the agency millions or causing them to move agents from the already overburdened southern border,"" it added.",Peter Hoskins & Charlotte Edwards,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgnyplvdv8o,M&S supplier resorts to pen and paper after cyber attack,"One of Marks & Spencer's biggest suppliers has resorted to using pen and paper for orders as the disruption from the cyber attack on the retailer continues.
The boss of Greencore, which supplies sandwiches, rolls and wraps, says it has also ramped up deliveries by a fifth to make sure there is more than enough food for the bank holiday weekend.
M&S has been unable to offer online orders for clothing and homewares for over a week, and some stores have seen empty shelves as food deliveries have also been disrupted.
Two M&S workers told the BBC they were concerned about pay because they were unable to clock in and out of work and could not access staff apps.
In a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes situation at M&S, Greencore chief executive Dalton Philips said: ""In the absence of having all the systems speaking to each other, you revert to how it was 25 years ago.""
That means back to ""pen and paper"", he said.
Greencore has also been putting on additional shifts at its dedicated M&S factory in Northampton, putting more lorries on the road, and is sending more food to stores than they did over Christmas.
""They're a massive customer for us and we're trying to flood them with products to help them,"" said Mr Philips.
""There are times when you do need to revert to manual systems in any business... but look, it works well.
""With the challenges of the system we don't have intricate forecasting that we would have previously had, so we're just making sure that they've got everything they need and some more.""
George, not his real name, works at an M&S in Wales, and said it has been ""a nightmare"".
""We have been told pay will be given through a separate payment system. However, we have not been told whether the pay will be correct.
""Additionally, there have been back-and-forth instructions, which have changed hourly. For example: remove gift cards from shop floor, put them back (when working).""
One former M&S customer assistant from Scunthorpe, who retired from their store at the end of April, said they had been unable to clock in and out of work as a result of the attack.
""There is no way of receiving advice via managers or the outsourced HR,"" they told the BBC.
M&S has reassured staff that they will be paid for all contracted hours as usual.
As a former chief executive of the supermarket chain Morrisons, Mr Philips knows only too well the pressure M&S bosses are under.
""They will be literally working 24/7. You've got to work your way through it. Whenever I've spoken to the team this week, it's been really impressive how calm and focused they are.
""I think if you work in retail, you know people are often the most on their game and motivated at those periods of intense pressure.""
Greencore has also sent a handful of its own staff to key M&S stores in London to provide extra support.
M&S hasn't released details on how its systems have been affected, saying only that some have been temporarily taken offline leading to pockets of limited availability in stores.
One food industry veteran who knows the business well thinks M&S will be focusing on making sure it can still provide all of its best-selling items.
""The issue is, if you've got 7,000 products, then obviously that's a lot of data to review.""
But he also pointed out that for big seasonal events there will be a lot of buying in advance and the company will have historical back-ups. Suppliers will also have a view on what will sell well.
Ged Futter, a former buyer for Asda who now runs his own consultancy advising suppliers, says M&S is in a difficult situation, but believes it will find a way round it as retailers are very good at finding solutions.
""If they have to, they'll use a fax machine. Any silo mentality disappears and everyone becomes very clearly focused on how to fix it.""
But the longer this goes on, the risk of damage to M&S's reputation and to its customer loyalty increases.
The company has been praised for its communications with customers, but has kept quiet on the nature of the attack and how it unfolded. That may not be sustainable for much longer.
The chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, Liam Byrne, has written to M&S chief executive Stuart Machin seeking reassurances, saying it was ""imperative"" to understand what had happened.
One person, who is a former chief executive at another firm and had to deal with a data breach, told the BBC the advice from his PR adviser was simple.
""Say nothing until you know everything. Then say everything. Then say nothing.""
M&S has been contacted for comment.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkx3vy54nzo,"Co-op cyber attack affects customer data, firm admits, after hackers contact BBC","Cyber criminals have told BBC News their hack against Co-op is far more serious than the company previously admitted.
Hackers contacted the BBC with proof they had infiltrated IT networks and stolen huge amounts of customer and employee data.
After being approached on Friday, a Co-op spokesperson said the hackers ""accessed data relating to a significant number of our current and past members"".
Co-op had previously said that it had taken ""proactive measures"" to fend off hackers and that it was only having a ""small impact"" on its operations.
It also assured the public that there was ""no evidence that customer data was compromised"".
The cyber criminals claim to have the private information of 20 million people who signed up to Co-op's membership scheme, but the firm would not confirm that number.
The criminals, who are using the name DragonForce, say they are also responsible for the ongoing attack on M&S and an attempted hack of Harrods.
The attacks have led government minister Pat McFadden to warn companies to ""treat cyber security as an absolute priority"".
The anonymous hackers showed the BBC screenshots of the first extortion message they sent to Co-op's head of cyber security in an internal Microsoft Teams chat on 25 April.
""Hello, we exfiltrated the data from your company,"" the chat says.
""We have customer database, and Co-op member card data.""
They also showed screenshots of a call with the head of security which took place around a week ago.
The hackers say they messaged other members of the executive committee too as part of their scheme to blackmail the firm.
Co-op has more than 2,500 supermarkets as well as 800 funeral homes and an insurance business.
It employs around 70,000 staff nationwide.
The cyber attack was announced by the company on Wednesday.
On Thursday, it was revealed Co-op staff were being urged to keep their cameras on during Teams meetings, ordered not to record or transcribe calls, and to verify that all participants were genuine Co-op staff.
The security measure now appears to be a direct result of the hackers having access to internal Teams chats and calls.
DragonForce shared databases with the BBC that includes usernames and passwords of all employees.
They also sent a sample of 10,000 customers data including Co-op membership card numbers, names, home addresses, emails and phone numbers.
The BBC has destroyed the data it received, and is not publishing or sharing these documents.
The Co-op membership database is thought to be highly valuable to the company.
Since the BBC contacted Co-op about the hackers' evidence, the firm has disclosed the full extent of the breach to its staff and the stock market.
""This data includes Co-op Group members' personal data such as names and contact details, and did not include members' passwords, bank or credit card details, transactions or information relating to any members' or customers' products or services with the Co-op Group,"" a spokesperson said.
DragonForce want the BBC to report the hack - they are apparently trying to extort the company for money.
But the criminals wouldn't say what they plan to do with the data if they don't get paid.
They refused to talk about M&S or Harrods and when asked about how they feel about causing so much distress and damage to business and customers, they refused to answer.
DragonForce is a ransomware group known for scrambling victims' data and demanding a ransom is paid to get the key to unscramble it. They are also known to have stolen data as part of their extortion tactics.
DragonForce operates an affiliate cyber crime service so anyone can use their malicious software and website to carry out attacks and extortions.
It's not known who is ultimately using the DragonForce service to attack the retailers, but some security experts say the tactics seen are similar to that of a loosely coordinated group of hackers who have been called Scattered Spider or Octo Tempest.
The gang operates on Telegram and Discord channels and is English-speaking and young â in some cases only teenagers.
Conversations with the Co-op hackers were carried out in text form - but it is clear the hacker, who called himself a spokesperson, was a fluent English speaker.
They say two of the hackers want to be known as ""Raymond Reddington"" and ""Dembe Zuma"" after characters from US crime thriller Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a 'blacklist'.
The hackers say ""we're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist"".
Co-op says it is working with the NCSC and the NCA and said in a statement it is very sorry this situation has arisen.
UK government officials have met over the cyber attacks, with national security staff and the chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre discussing support for retailers.
In a keynote speech next week setting out government action, minister Pat McFadden - who has responsibility for cyber security - will say the attacks need to be a ""wake-up call"" for every UK business.
""In a world where the cybercriminals targeting us are relentless in their pursuit of profit - with attempts being made every hour of every day - companies must treat cyber security as an absolute priority.
""We've watched in real-time the disruption these attacks have caused - including to working families going about their everyday lives.
""It serves as a powerful reminder that just as you would never leave your car or your house unlocked on your way to work. We have to treat our digital shop fronts the same way.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1jwe7582o,Trump signs order to block funding to public radio,"US President Donald Trump has issued an executive order calling for all federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) to be blocked.
On Thursday evening, Trump alleged that both organisations have engaged with ""biased and partisan news coverage"".
The order instructs the board of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting (CPB), which distributes funding to PBS and NPR stations, to ""cease direct funding"" to the ""maximum extent allowed by law"".
PBS called the order ""blatantly unlawful"", while CPB said the organisation is not ""a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority"".
Meanwhile, Radio Free Asia, which receives funding from the government, said on Friday it was shutting down most of its news broadcasts and letting most staff go.
CEO Bay Fang said the cuts were due to the Trump administration withholding congressionally allocated funding, even though a federal judge sided with the broadcaster last week.
The executive order says the board should ""decline to provide future funding"" to the news organisations.
""Which viewpoints NPR and PBS promote does not matter,"" it continues.
""What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.""
Paula Kerger, CEO of PBS, called the president's order ""blatantly unlawful"" and said it ""threatens our ability to serve the American public with educational programming, as we have for the past 50-plus years"".
The White House has said that funding of news media is ""not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence"" and that the media landscape has become more ""diverse"".
However, the CPB budget has already been approved by Congress through 2027.
Patricia Harrison, CEO of the CPB, said the organisation is not ""a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority"".
""Congress directly authorised and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government,"" she said.
""In creating CPB, Congress expressly forbade 'any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting'.""
More than 40 million Americans listen to NPR public radio each week, and 36 million watch a local television station from the PBS network each month, according to their estimates.
NPR director Katherine Maher estimated in March that the radio station would receive about $120m (Â£90m) from the CPB in 2025, ""less than 5% of its budget.""
Both organisations have previously said that Trump's effort to cut funding could have a ""devastating impact"" on those who rely on them for credible news, including during emergency situations.
Media rights group RSF warned on Friday about ""an alarming deterioration in press freedom"" in the United States under Trump and ""unprecedented"" difficulties for independent journalists around the world.
Following the news of Trump's executive order, REM singer Michael Stipe was among the figures offering support to the journalists affected.
""Whether it's music or a free press â censorship anywhere is a threat to the truth everywhere,"" he said in a statement. ""On World Press Freedom Day, I'm sending a shout-out to the brave journalists at Radio Free Europe.""",Yasmin Rufo,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgrwxp5r15o,Meta threatens to cut off Facebook in Nigeria over huge fines,"People in Nigeria may lose access to Facebook and Instagram after parent company Meta said it faced large fines and  ""unrealistic"" regulatory demands from the Nigerian authorities.
Last year, three Nigerian oversight agencies imposed fines on the US-based social media giant totalling more than $290m (Â£218m) for violating various laws and regulations.
Meta was unsuccessful in a recent attempt to challenge the decisions in the federal high court in Abuja.
""The applicant may be forced to effectively shut down the Facebook and Instagram services in Nigeria in order to mitigate the risk of enforcement measures,"" the company said in the court papers.
Meta also owns WhatsApp, but it did not mention the messaging service in its statement.
The high court has given the company until the end of June to pay the fines.
The BBC has asked Meta to outline what its next steps will be but has not yet received a response.
Facebook is by far the most popular social media platform in Nigeria and is used by tens of millions in the country for daily communication and sharing news. It is also a vital tool for many of Nigeria's small online businesses.
In July last year, Meta was asked to pay three fines:
FCCPC chief executive officer Adamu Abdullahi said investigations carried out in conjunction with the data commission between May 2021 and December 2023 revealed ""invasive practices against data subjects/consumers in Nigeria"" but was not specific about what these were.
In its court submission, Meta said its ""primary concern"" was with the data commission, which it accused of ""misinterpreting"" data privacy laws.
Specifically, the commission has demanded that Meta seek prior approval before transferring any personal data out of Nigeria - a condition that Meta called ""unrealistic"".
The data commission also imposed other demands.
Meta was told it must provide an icon linking to educational videos about data privacy risks. This would be content created in collaboration with government-approved educational institutions and non-profit organisations.
The NDPC insisted that these videos highlight the dangers of ""manipulative and unfair data processing"" that could expose Nigerian users to health and financial risks.
Meta described the NDPC's demands as unfeasible, saying that the agency has failed to ""properly interpret the laws guiding data privacy"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg419qw9g15o,Talks or no talks: Who blinks first in US-China trade war?,"On Friday morning, a spokesperson for China's ministry of commerce announced that Beijing was assessing the possibility of tariff negotiations with the United States.
It was news the rest of the world had been waiting to hear as astonishingly high  tariffs - up to 245% on some Chinese exports to the US - throttle trade between the world's two biggest economies, raising the spectre of a recession.
""US officials have repeatedly expressed their willingness to negotiate with China on tariffs,"" the spokesperson told reporters.
""China's position is consistent. If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open... If the US wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel unilateral tariffs.""
The statement comes a day after a Weibo account linked to Chinese state media said the US had been seeking to initiate discussions, and a week after Trump claimed discussions were already underway â a suggestion Beijing denied.
""China has no need to talk to the United States,"" Yuyuantantian, a Weibo account affiliated with China Central Television (CCTV), said in Thursday's post. ""From the perspective of negotiations, the United States must be the more anxious party at present.""
Such comments follow a cycle of assertions and denials from both the US and China, as each side refuses to publicly initiate discussions.
The question is not whether those discussions will take place, but rather when, under what circumstances and at whose behest.
Experts characterise the tussle as a game of chicken between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as both men attempt to save face while covertly pursuing a mutually beneficial outcome â namely, a de-escalation of the trade war.
""I expect some of this back-and-forth, because neither Washington nor Beijing wants to look like they are the side that's giving in,"" says Ja Ian Chong, assistant professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.
""[But] a de-escalation would be to the overall benefit of both sides, so there is some overarching incentive to do so.""
Wen-Ti Sung, an academic member of the Australian Centre on China in the World, puts it another way: ""It's like two race cars going at each other: whoever swerves first will be seen as the weaker of the two parties. And at this juncture, neither party wants to look soft.""
The leader who admits he was the first to initiate tariff talks would be seen as the one compromising his position in negotiations.
""Whoever seems desperate loses bargaining leverage,"" Mr Sung says. ""Both sides want to portray the other side as the more desperate one.""
This peculiar stalemate â where both parties seek the same outcome, but neither wants to be the first to suggest it â has resulted in a tactic of ""constructive ambiguity"": the deliberate use of language so vague that each party could arguably claim to be in the right.
It is this tactic that Mr Sung points to as an explanation for Yuyuantantian's Weibo post.
""This is Beijing trying to explore the possibility of using word games to create an off-ramp for both sides, so that they can gradually climb their way down from this escalation spiral,"" he says.
One way to escape this game of chicken is when a third party mediates, offering both sides an off-ramp. The other option, Mr Sung explains, is a ""much looser understanding of what 'the other side has reached out' means"".
That way, the side that does indeed come to the table first is still able to characterise it as a response rather than the first move.
In Trump and Xi's case, it would also mean that tariff negotiations could begin with both leaders claiming to have achieved some kind of victory in the trade war.
The optics here are important. As Mr Chong points out, de-escalation is one thing â but another top priority for Trump and Xi is to ""deliver a win for their domestic audiences"".
""Trump obviously wants to show that he has made Beijing capitulate. And on the People's Republic of China side, Xi probably wants to show his own people and the world that he's been able to make Trump become more reasonable and moderate and accommodating,"" Mr Chong says.
On the domestic front, both leaders are facing tariff-induced headwinds. Trump this week struggled to quell fears of a recession as fresh data indicated the US economy contracted in its first quarter for the first time since 2022.
Meanwhile, Xi - who before the tariffs was already battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment - must reassure China's population that he can weather the trade war and protect an economy which has struggled to rebound post-pandemic.
""Both [Trump and Xi] recognise that at this point of the trade war, it's not going to be a winner-takes-all outcome for either side anymore,"" Mr Sung says.
""Trump recognises he's not going to get anywhere near 100% of what he wants, so he's trying to find a concession point where China can let him have just enough winning, especially for domestic purposes.""
While China is not unwilling, he adds, ""they are very much stuck on what's the right price point"".
For Xi, Mr Sung described the situation as a ""two-level game"".
""The China side needs to manage US-China bilateral negotiations, while domestically Beijing needs to save enough face so that the Chinese leadership can hold on to this narrative of 'the East is rising and the West is declining',"" he says.
""A kowtowing of the East towards the West is not a rising East.""
At the time of writing, the US has not denied China's claims that it has been attempting to initiate talks. But the fact that both sides have now made that assertion indicates there is ""some sort of contact"", according to Mr Chong.
""The two sides are talking,"" he says. ""And that is a sign that there is some possibility that some accommodation could be reached.""
But the start of negotiations does not mean that the US-China relationship - which was rocky even before Trump kicked off a trade war - is close to being steadied.
Mr Chong isn't holding his breath. For one, he believes the ""posturing"" suggests the two sides have not reached the point ""where they are both trying to seek a way out"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86jx18y9e2o,Apple says most US-bound iPhones no longer made in China,"Apple says it is shifting production of most iPhones and other devices to be sold in the US away from China, which has been the focus of President Donald Trump's tariffs.
The majority of the iPhones bound for the US market in the coming months will be made in India, while Vietnam will be a major production hub for items like iPads and Apple Watches, chief executive Tim Cook says.
It comes as the technology giant estimated that US import taxes could add about $900m (Â£677.5m) to its costs in the current quarter, despite Trump's decision to spare key electronics from the new tariffs.
The Trump administration has repeatedly said it wants Apple to move production to America.
The estimate comes as firms around the world are scrambling to respond to the huge shifts in global trade triggered by Washington's trade policies.
On a call with investors on Thursday to discuss the firm's financial performance, the Apple boss seemed keen to draw attention to its investments in the US.
Mr Cook opened the discussion with a reminder of the company's plans to invest $500bn across several US states over the next four years.
He also said Apple is shifting its supply chain for US-bound products away from China, but it is India and Vietnam that are poised to be major beneficiaries of that move.
""We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in US will have India as their country of origin,"" Mr Cook said.
Meanwhile, Vietnam will be the chief manufacturing hub ""for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods product sold in the US"".
China will remain the country of origin for the vast majority of total products sold outside the US, he added.
However moving production lines to India will take time and significant investment, costing billions of dollars.
Shanti Kelemen, chief investment officer at M&G Wealth, told the BBC's Today programme: ""There will still be tariffs that impact the supply chains [for Apple] and a cost to move them and build new factories.
""Apple have said they want to invest $500bn over the next few years.""
Apple shares had plummeted after Trump announced his administration would levy ""reciprocal tariffs"" on products imported to the United States, with the aim of persuading companies to manufacture more in the US.
But his administration faced significant pressure to moderate its plans. Shortly after the tariffs went into effect, it announced that certain electronics, including phones and computers, would be exempted.
For now, trade turmoil has left Apple's sales unscathed.
The company said revenues for the first three months of the year rose 5% from the same period last year, to $95.4bn.
Amazon, another tech giant whose results were being closely watched for signs of tariff damage, likewise said sales were holding up, rising 8% year-on-year in its North America e-commerce business in the most recent quarter.
It forecast similar growth in the months ahead.
""Obviously no one of us knows exactly where tariffs will settle or when,"" said Amazon boss Andy Jassy, while noting that the firm has emerged from periods of disruption â like the pandemic â stronger than before.
""We're often able to weather challenging conditions better than others,"" he said. ""I'm optimistic this could happen again.""
The shift of the iPhone supply chain to India was ""impressive"" according to Patrick Moorhead, chief executive of Moor Insights & Strategy.
""This is a marked change from what [Cook] said a few years back when he said that only China can build iPhones,"" Mr Moorhead said.
""There is lots of progress that Apple must show here but it's a pretty good start,"" he said.
Amazon is also repositioning itself to increase resilience in the face of the tariffs.
The company said it working to make sure it had a diversity of sellers and Mr Jassy said he felt the firm was well-positioned for the months ahead, pointing to the firm's scale and its role supplying everyday essentials.
For now, it said sales had not been hurt by the tariff turmoil. If anything, executives said the business may have benefited from some customers starting to stockpile.
Overall sales jumped 9% to $155.7bn in the first three months of 2025, compared with the same period last year, while profits surged more than 60% year-on-year to roughly $17bn.",Lily Jamali,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkg54nd5d5o,London's 'spiralling' housing crisis in numbers,"London is Europe's wealthiest city, yet for many living in the capital, having a place to call home feels out of reach, according to the Centre for London (CfL).
Earlier this week, the independent think tank hosted the London Housing Summit, highlighting the challenges of - and possible solutions to - the housing crisis, which it says is ""spiralling out of control"".
Experts agree it is a complex issue, but what do figures show us about the scale of the problem?
According to data collected by the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN), there was an 8% increase in rough sleeping in the capital on the same period in 2024.
New rough sleepers account for almost half (47%) of the total number of those sleeping rough, intermittent rough sleepers account for 39% and 16% of the recorded number of rough sleepers were living on the streets.
CHAIN's latest annual report for 2024/25 reveals rough sleeping in London has reached an ""all time high"".
The Mayor of London, Sir Sadiq Khan, has committed to ending rough sleeping in London by 2030, and in January 2025 he announced an additional Â£10m investment in a bid to achieve this goal.
The money will go towards expanding the network of its Ending Homelessness Hubs, which provide 24/7 specialist support for people new to rough sleeping and prevention services.
Councils have legal duty to house local people who become homeless. Typically, they put people up in hotels or hostels until more permanent arrangements can be made.
So, as homelessness has increased in recent years, so therefore has the financial burden on local authorities.
The umbrella group representing London's boroughs has said the current spending on temporary accommodation is ""unsustainable"" and puts many councils at risk of becoming ""effectively bankrupt"", creating ""massive uncertainty"" to the future of local services.
London Councils says boroughs overspent on the 2024/25 homelessness budget by Â£330m - with spending in this area increasing by 68% in a single year.
According to its recent analysis, more than 183,000 Londoners are currently homeless and living in temporary accommodation such as hostels arranged by their local boroughs.
This includes 90,000 children, which equates to more than one per classroom, London Councils says.
The human impact of these figures is something the Housing and Mental Health Network aims to highlight to policymakers.
Speaking at the London Housing Summit, Dr Sally Zlotowitz, co-chair of the network, said it was a ""growing concern"" that people in temporary accommodation were ""internalising an issue that is a structural crisis"".
London Councils' executive member for housing, Grace Williams, has labelled this an ""emergency"" that was ""devastating the lives of too many Londoners"".
The organisation has called on the government to support councils by increasing funding for both short term temporary accommodation needs and longer-term solutions â like boosting grant funding for affordable housing.
A government spokesperson said: ""We inherited a serious housing crisis, which is why we are taking urgent and decisive action to end homelessness, fix the foundations of local government and drive forward our Plan for Change.
""We are providing Â£1bn for crucial homelessness services so councils can support families faster. This is an increase of Â£233m from 2024 - 25, and London Boroughs have had a funding uplift by more than Â£78m.
""We are also tackling its root causes by building 1.5 million new homes, boosting social and affordable housing and abolishing section 21 no fault evictions.""
The private rental sector in London has shrunk, as landlords increasingly decide to sell their properties.
According to analysis by Trust for London, 45,000 homes were lost from the sector in this way between April 2021-December 2023, equating to a net reduction of 4.3%.
The charity also said the sector was shrinking at a much faster rate the most affordable areas to rent in, which it believed had a ""particular impact"" on the ability of low-income households to access private rented homes.
The National Residential Landlords Association said ""uncertainty over proposed tax and regulatory changes is leading many landlords to consider leaving the market"".
The association added that the demand for private rental homes continued to increase, which was driving up costs for renters as well as reducing choice.
London's 2.7 million private tenants saw their rents rise by 11.5% in 2024, with the capital experiencing the largest increases in England, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Polling released this week by Centre for London revealed three in five London renters said rent was unaffordable to them personally.
Both the need for homes - and the cost of building them - is greater in London than anywhere else in the country, Centre for London analysis has found.
The upfront costs in London are 43 times higher than in the West Midlands and 36 times higher than in Greater Manchester.
The think tank's research shows building the number of homes needed in the borough of Wandsworth, which has the highest upfront costs in England, will cost four times more than what it would cost to deliver the entire housing target for West Midlands.
This comes as polling by the think-tank revealed 45% of Londoners questioned on what they think the biggest problems within London's housing market are, said it was that first-time buyers cannot afford a home.
A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: ""The mayor will continue to work in partnership with the government to deliver more genuinely affordable homes through the planning system and new investment so that we can tackle London's housing crisis and build a fairer London for everyone.""
Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said there is ""no time to waste"" and that it's ""crucial"" to ""get Britain building"".
While targets are in place for new homes â delegates at the London Housing Summit this week raised concerns about the existing housing stock in London.
Centre for London's polling revealed a third of Londoners have experienced damp and mould and over a quarter were unable to keep their homes warm.
Housing campaigner Kwajo Tweneboa uses social media to campaign on issues related to damp and mould and told Eddie Nestor on BBC Radio London, the situation is ""horrific"", adding ""there are times when I ask myself surely it cannot get worse than this?"".
During the mayoral election campaign of 2024, Sir Sadiq pledged his support for a rollout of high-tech mould sensors, which City Hall said would provide an ""early warning system"".
Industry leaders have warned there is a 'dire shortage' of construction workers. The latest Office for National Statistics figures show that there are over 35,000 job vacancies and employers report that over half of vacancies cannot be filled due to a lack of required skills â the highest rate of any sector.
The additional requirement of 160,000 construction workers applies specifically to meeting the need of Labour's housebuilding targets. Ahead of the government's pledge to build 1.5m new homes, the CITB had already estimated there would need to be a quarter of a million new construction workers to meet the country's housing demands.
Before the 2025 spring statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced Â£600m worth of investment to train up to 60,000 more skilled construction workers, and education secretary, Bridget Phillipson has committed to 'skills bootcamps' in the construction sector being expanded, with Â£100m to train, upskill and develop workers.
So what's the plan for London?
A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said Sir Sadiq Khan had made the capital's housing crisis a ""a key priority for his mayoralty"".
In 2018, City Hall established the Mayor's Construction Academy (MCA), a scheme aimed at helping Londoners gain the skills needed to enter the construction industry.
The mayor's office said it hoped the MCA would help address the need for more skilled construction workers in London.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj4nev7p70o,"Warren Buffett, 94, stepping down as Berkshire Hathaway CEO","Warren Buffett has announced he will retire as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year.
The veteran investor, known as the Oracle of Omaha, told his company's annualÂ meeting he would hand over the reins to Vice-ChairmanÂ GregÂ Abel.
""I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive of the company at year end,"" said Mr Buffett, 94.
Mr Buffett, who built Berkshire Hathaway from a failing textile maker into an investment juggernaut worth $1.16tn (Â£870bn), is arguably the world's most successful investor.
After standing applause from the audience of around 40,000, he joked: ""The enthusiasm shown by that response could be interpreted in two ways.""
The billionaire told Saturday's company meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, that the only people who had known about his decision were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett.
Mr Abel, sitting next to Mr Buffett on stage, was apparently caught unaware by the announcement.
Mr Buffett handpicked Mr Abel as his successor four years ago but gave no indication at the time that he would retire.
During the meeting, Mr Buffett added that he does not plan to sell off any of his Berkshire stocks.
""I have no intention, zero, of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. It will get given away,"" he said, as the crowd cheered.
Apple CEO Tim Cook was among several business leaders who released statements praising Mr Buffett's business legacy.
""There's never been someone like Warren, and countless people, myself included, have been inspired by his wisdom,"" Mr Cook wrote on X/Twitter.
""It's been one of the great privileges of my life to know him. And there's no question that Warren is leaving Berkshire in great hands with Greg.""
In 2023, Mr Buffett issued a rare letter in which he acknowledged that whilst he had no desire to step down, he was ""playing in extra innings"".
Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 60 companies, including insurer Geico, battery-maker Duracell and restaurant chain Dairy Queen.
It also has major stakes in Apple, Coca Cola, Bank of America and American Express, among others.
Mr Buffett, who has given away billions to charity, was last month ranked by Bloomberg as the world's fourth-wealthiest person, with a net worth of $154bn.
He earned his first money as a six-year-old, bought his first shares at 11 and filed his first tax return at 13.
Despite being one of the richest people in the world,Â Mr Buffett has lived in the same modest house in Omaha for more than 65 years.
The announcement came as Mr Buffet spoke out against President Donald Trump's tariffs, telling investors that the US should not use ""trade as a weapon"".
""It's a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don't like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,"" he said earlier in the meeting.
""We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,"" he added.",Max Matza,2 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4le9n469o,Uber starts allowing customers to pay in cash,"Uber is now allowing passengers across most of the UK to pay in cash.
Following trials, the cash payment option was this week extended to all UK cities, except London, where it is being reviewed.
But individual drivers can still opt out of accepting notes and coins, partly if they are worried about safety of carrying them in their vehicles.
The move came as a major report suggested shops and services might need to be forced to accept cash in the future to protect those who rely on it.
On Wednesday, the Treasury Committee of MPs stopped short of recommending mandated cash acceptance now, but said its report was ""a wake-up call"" to government on the issue.
Uber has become a huge company and dominates the global ride-hailing market, as well as operating in a host of other transport sectors. Its rapid ascent has come with controversy and protests from other taxi providers.
The taxi app's success has been based around new technology, but meant customers needed cashless payments to use its services.
Following pilots in Birmingham, Stoke, Nottingham and Leicester, Uber said it has now extended the option of paying in cash to other UK cities, because some people preferred paying in cash or did not have a bank card.
""We believe that movement should be accessible to everyone, so following successful pilots in some UK cities over the last 18 months, we have decided to give passengers outside of London the option to pay for trips with cash,"" a spokesman said.
Passengers can select cash as their payment option on the app. Drivers can opt out in preferences on their own app.
If they do not have enough change, that is given as a credit to the passenger by Uber.
The cash option is being reviewed by authorities in London, and remains unavailable for Uber Eats or booking for other forms of transport via the Uber app.
Cash campaigner Ron Delnevo from the Payment Choice Alliance said Uber's move ""demonstrates that they now believe in the future of cash in the UK"", and brought the company's operations in the UK in line with many other countries.
He called on the government to introduce a law that would force all shops and services to accept cash.
Ministers have said there are no plans to introduce such rules.
However, the Treasury Committee's recent report did highlight various groups who relied on cash, including some people with learning disabilities and those who use cash to keep to a budget.
Among those reliant on cash, and who gave evidence to the committee, were victim-survivors of domestic and economic abuse.
Many face the dangers of being traced by their abuser via the payments they make. Buying a train ticket, for example, could only be done with cash in order to avoid an abusive partner becoming aware of their movements.
""It really is a matter of life and death,"" said Sam Smethers, chief executive of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse. ""Without it they find themselves monitored daily, with every transaction.""
Joint bank accounts and mortgages had also been used as a way to impose coercive control over somebody, she said.
And cash could be used as an eventual escape route.
""One victim-survivor said she hid pockets of cash around her house until she had enough to flee her abuser,"" she said.
The charity would like to see cash acceptance backed by law, but Ms Smethers said she welcomed the focus the committee's report had put on the plight of those facing economic abuse.",Kevin Peachey,2 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0z65dq771o,Wall Street stocks bounce back from Trump tariff losses,"Wall Street has clawed back losses incurred after President Donald Trump imposed global tariffs a month ago, capping the longest winning streak in two decades for US stocks.
Shares saw gains for the ninth day in a row for the first time since 2004 after a better-than-expected jobs report and rising hope of US-China trade talks.
Major US indexes were all up when the market closed on Friday - the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had both risen 1.5% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4%.
The tech sector made the biggest gains, with Microsoft and Nvidia growing by more than 2%.
It came as the Department of Labor said on Friday that US employers had added 177,000 new jobs in April.
The report outpaced analysts' predictions, although it was still a slowdown in hiring from the month beforehand. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%.
Another sign of encouragement for investors was Beijing's announcement on Friday that it was considering an offer from Washington to hold trade talks with the US.
At 145%, China faces the highest import taxes by far.
For some analysts the jobs figures tamped down recession fears in the wake of commerce department data this week showing a contraction in the US economy for the first time in three years.
""There is nothing to complain about here,"" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a research note.
""You cannot find any evidence of a nascent recession in these figures.""
Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, also saw cause for optimism.
""The economy will weaken in the coming months but, with this underlying momentum, the US has a decent chance of averting recession if it can step back from the tariff brink in time,"" she said.
But other experts said it would take time to see the full effect of Trump's tariffs.
While the jobs report is strong, ""the outlook remains very uncertain,"" Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, told the BBC on Friday.",Sakshi Venkatraman,3 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grdke5r1jo,Tariffs on car parts entering the US come into force,"A 25% import tax on engines, transmissions and other key car parts has come into force in the US, raising pressure on an industry finding its way through a thicket of policy changes.
The new tariff comes days after Donald Trump eased the measure in response to business worries, but did not eliminate it.
The US president has said the new tariff, along with a 25% import tax on cars that went into effect last month, is intended to push carmakers to do more manufacturing in the US.
But analysts said any immediate expansions in the US were likely to come at the expense of production elsewhere, while also leading to higher costs for the businesses - and ultimately higher prices for customers.
For now, companies have been shielded from pain, as concerns about price hikes have prompted a sales surge.
General Motors and Ford this week reported double digit sales growth continuing in April.
But GM also warned it expected as much as $5bn (Â£3.7bn) in new costs this year as a result of the tariffs, including roughly $2bn in charges on cars it makes in South Korea and exports to the US.
Executives said they now expected prices to rise roughly 1%, instead of falling as previously forecast.
In a sign of the turmoil, other car companies, including Stellantis, maker of Jeep, Fiat and Chrysler, withdrew financial guidance for the year ahead, citing the fluidity of the situation.
""We remain subject to extreme uncertainties,"" Stellantis chief financial officer Doug Ostermann told analysts this week.
Nearly half of vehicles sold in the US last year were imported from outside the country.
When Trump announced plans in March to hit cars and certain car parts with 25% tariffs, an announcement that came amid a bevy of other tariffs, it sent shockwaves through the industry, drawing warnings of higher prices and risks to production and sales.
The president has since softened his policies, especially regarding Mexico and Canada - key parts of the industry's supply chain, due to decades of free trade between the three countries.
As it stands currently, parts made in Mexico and Canada in compliance with that free trade agreement will be spared the duties. Officials had initially described that exemption as temporary, but after customs instructions issued this week analysts said it now appeared likely to stick.
Trump this week also signed measures to shield firms from facing multiple tariffs on the same item, while setting up a two-year system carmakers can use to reduce the duties they have to pay on parts imported from other countries and used in US-assembled cars.
The administration had also already said firms importing cars made in Canada and Mexico would not be charged tariffs on US-made content.
""The changes that have come in the last couple of days are going to make it easier ... but even so it's still a dramatic change to the market,"" said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. ""It's still a big tariff.""
Executives at some firms have said they are exploring ways to increase production in the US to mitigate the new costs.
General Motors said it had expanded truck production at its factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana, by about 50,000 as a result of the tariffs. This week it also said it would cut back output in Canada.
Mercedes also said it had flexibility to expand at its factory in Alabama.
Art Wheaton, director of Labor Studies at Cornell University, said the US might see more such announcements in the months ahead, but he did not expect to see new factories getting built anytime soon, given the significance of that investment and how fast the situation is changing.
""If I'm going to make a multi-billion dollar decision... I wouldn't do it in a market that is this unstable,"" he said.
The administration has said it is working on trade deals with key countries for the industry, including South Korea and Japan.
Trump might also modify his policies if signs of economic damage start to emerge, Mr Wheaton said.
""Everything is pretty good now,"" he said. ""I don't think the full impact of those tariffs has hit yet.""",Natalie Sherman,3 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rz9p2d5ko,M&S working 'day and night' over cyber attack,"The boss of Marks & Spencer has told customers the retailer is ""working day and night"" to manage the cyber attack that has forced it to temporarily shut down its online operations.
Stuart Machin said he was ""really sorry"" for the disruption to services, but did not say when normal business would resume.
M&S's problems began over the Easter weekend, and last week it confirmed it was dealing with a ""cyber incident"" and paused online orders on its website and apps.
The Co-op and luxury department store Harrods have also been targeted and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has urged retailers to be vigilant.

In his message, Mr Machin said: ""We are working day and night to manage the current cyber incident and get things back to normal for you as quickly as possible.""
He also thanked customers for ""all the support you have shown us"".
The cyber attack has already had a significant impact on the retailer, as online transactions account for about a third of its clothing and home sales. On average, Â£3.8m is spent on clothing and home products on its website and apps every day.
There have also been gaps on the food shelves in some stores after the firm took some of its systems offline in an attempt to manage the attack, while its loyalty scheme and gift card payments have been disrupted too.
Analysts have pointed out that M&S risks losing out to rivals, as online shoppers can quickly switch to other retailers' websites.
The problems have also coincided with a period of warmer weather, when people are likely to want to buy new summer clothes.
M&S shares dropped almost 2% on Friday morning, and are now down about 5% from the point when the company first disclosed its IT systems had been disrupted.
With both the Co-op and Harrods also facing cyber attacks this week, the NCSC - the UK government body responsible for supporting organisations facing cyber threats - has extended its warnings about such attacks to all organisations in the UK and urged them to be vigilant.
NCSC chief executive Richard Horne said the recent spate of attacks should serve as a ""wake-up call"" for big retailers.
He said the NCSC was working closely with the companies that had reported incidents, ""to fully understand the nature of these attacks and to provide expert advice to the wider sector"".
Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said she was worried about the attacks and acknowledged it was concerning for customers and businesses.
She told the BBC's Today programme that big retailers could be vulnerable to such attacks because they were ""high-profile businesses, we all interact with retail each and every day"".
In addition, she added that they were ""highly digital businesses, not just from an online shopping point of view but retailers have lots of systems - payments systems, stock systems"".
However, she said that all of the businesses affected so far have been able to keep their stores open.",Vishala Sri-Pathma,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2y1yg8r2o,Businesses count costs as India and Bangladesh impose trade restrictions,"Businesses are bracing for possible impact after neighbours India and Bangladesh  recently imposed tit-for-tat trade restrictions after months of verbal sparring.
Last month, Bangladesh restricted land imports of cotton yarn from India to shield local industries from cheaper imports.
Dhaka's move came days after India abruptly stopped the transhipment facility it had offered Bangladesh to export its cargoes to third countries via its ports and airports, citing ""congestion"".
Relations between the countries have soured since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August after massive protests. She is currently in exile in India and an interim administration headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is in charge.
Since then Dhaka has demanded Hasina be extradited to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her, and Delhi has not officially reacted to the demand.
India has also frequently criticised reports of attacks on the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh. It recently said the alleged killing of a Hindu community leader ""reflects a pattern of systematic persecution under the interim government"".
Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation, denies targeting minorities, calling most incidents politically motivated or ordinary crimes. Hindus make up less than 10% of its 170 million population.
As the countries spar, firms are counting the cost.
Yarn, vital for Bangladesh's clothing factories, can still enter by sea and air - but they are slower and costlier routes.
In 2024, India had exported $1.6bn (Â£1.2bn) worth of cotton yarn to Bangladesh, a third of it via land ports.
The now-halted transhipment facility let Bangladeshi exporters send clothes made for high-end brands by road to Indian cities, from where it would be flown to Europe and the US.
""It's a blow [to Bangladesh's fast-fashion export industry],"" says Anis Ahmed, head of supply chain firm MGH Group, which ships for European fast-fashion brands. ""The India route got cargo to Western countries in a week. By sea, it takes up to eight weeks.""
Bangladesh, the world's second-largest garment exporter after China, shipped $38bn in clothing last year. Over $1bn of this moved via the India land-air route, which Ahmed says was thriving.
Limited air freight capacity and under-equipped airports hamper direct exports from Bangladesh.
Many see Delhi's withdrawal of the transhipment facility as a response to remarks by Yunus during a recent China visit.
He had called Bangladesh the ""only guardian of the ocean"" for India's landlocked north-east and suggested that the region could become an ""extension of the Chinese economy.""
Leaders from India's north-eastern states called the comments ""offensive"".
Yunus's remarks, spotlighting India's strategic vulnerability in the region to China, raised alarms in Delhi.
India's north-east is linked to the mainland by the 20km-wide Siliguri Corridor - dubbed the ""chicken's neck"" - flanked by Nepal and Bangladesh and close to Tibet's Chumbi Valley.
With a history of border tensions and having lost a war in 1962, Indian defence planners fear that China could target the corridor to cut off the north-eastern states from the rest of the country in any future conflict.
Bangladeshi analysts say Yunus's remarks were misinterpreted and aimed at promoting regional connectivity.
During his China visit, Dhaka also welcomed Beijing's interest in a $1bn Teesta River project in northern Bangladesh.
Indian analysts warn that Chinese involvement in the project, which is not far from the strategic Siliguri Corridor, could unsettle Delhi.
But there is concern on both sides over the frosty ties.
Resentment is growing in Bangladesh over tightened Indian visa rules, with approvals plunging since Hasina was driven from power. Previously, two million Bangladeshis visited India yearly for tourism, business, education and medical care. The number of visas issued daily has dropped by over 80% in the past few months according to local media.
Hasina's stay in India and the extradition demand remains a big irritant.
""They should realise that there is no way that we can just hand Hasina to them. We know what will happen to her if she's handed over. I think public opinion in India would not countenance that,"" says Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary.
Amid rising tensions, India's clothing manufacturers' association has called for a ban on Bangladeshi garment imports via land. Bangladeshi analysts warn that more trade barriers would be counter-productive.
""I think there is a strong view nowadays in Bangladesh that we should also reassess the other transit and transhipment facilities given to India [for its north-eastern states] by the earlier [Hasina] government,"" Debapriya Bhattacharya, a senior economist with the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka, tells the BBC.
India uses Bangladeshi ports, roads and waterways to transport goods to its landlocked north-east, cutting distance, time and costs. However, officials say transit volumes haven't reached expected levels.
Delhi-Dhaka tensions are rising amid growing ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Bangladesh, once East Pakistan, fought for independence in 1971 with Indian support. Hasina distanced herself from Pakistan during her 15-year rule.
Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch visited Dhaka last month, the first such visit in 15 years. A planned visit by Pakistan Deputy PM Ishaq Dar was postponed due to tensions between Delhi and Islamabad over the deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir last week.
""I don't think there is any concern over Dhaka's reachout to Pakistan. If there is any suggestion that there is an intent to work together and make things difficult for India, then that will obviously cause concern,"" says Saran, the former Indian diplomat.
Sharp official reactions from both sides are also influencing public opinion in India and Bangladesh. There is a growing anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh, with Indian media accused of exaggerating the attacks on minorities and Islamist threats.
The people-to-people ties built over years seem to be on the retreat, and analysts point out that if both sides fail to stay calm, their actions could harm trade and economic relations.

Despite a marketing tie-in with the Minecraft movie and extended price deals, US customers made fewer visits to the burger chain in the first three months of this year, compared to a year ago.
Chief executive Chris Kempczinski said customers were ""grappling with uncertainty"".
But he assured investors that the firm could ""navigate even the toughest of market conditions"".
McDonald's has been working for months to try to reignite enthusiasm among customers, after facing a backlash over rising prices, especially from lower income households.
However, revenue at US McDonald's outlets that have been open at least a year sank 3.6% in the first three months of 2025 compared to a year earlier.
That is the steepest decline in like-for-like sales in the US since the three months to the end of June 2020 when pandemic restrictions were in place.
The surprise drop in sales coincided with a contraction in the US economy, which shrank at an annual rate of 0.3% in the first three months of 2025, the first quarterly decline in output since 2022.
Reacting to the growth figures, President Trump called for patience, saying he needed ""a little bit of time"" and described the numbers as a reflection of the ""Biden economy"", a reference to his predecessor as president.
However, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said Americans were nervous and cutting back on discretionary spending as a result.
""They're worried prices will rise even higher and that household budgets, already feeling the impact of previous inflation, will be stretched beyond breaking point,"" she said.
""They're also nervous about the potential for job losses if the economy continues to stutter as businesses try and make sense of an evolving tariff environment.""
McDonald's figures reflect the first two months of Donald Trump's presidency, with the reporting period ending just before his barrage of tariff announcements on 2 April.
Dubbed ""Liberation Day"", that broadside prompted further confusion among many firms and consumers.
Mr Kempczinski said: ""Consumers today are grappling with uncertainty, but they can always count on McDonald's [...] for exceptional value"".
""McDonald's has a 70-year legacy of innovation, leadership, and proven agility, all of which give us confidence in our ability to navigate even the toughest of market conditions and gain market share,"" he added.
Over the same three-month period to March, the slump in McDonald's US sales dragged its global like-for-like revenue down 1%, despite growing sales in Japan, Australia, and the Middle East.
Businesses have had a mix of reactions since Trump began revealing and enforcing his plans for tariffs, which are a tax payable by a person or firm buying a good from overseas.
This week, technology giant Intel said costs would rise and a recession was more likely because of Trump's tariffs.
Sportswear brand Adidas said they would lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers including the Gazelle and Samba.
Meanwhile, delivery giant DHL paused deliveries worth more than $800 (Â£603) due to US trade policy before lifting them after negotiating ""adjustments"" to customs rules.
Trump and his allies have said the policies will help to bring more jobs to the US as firms base factories and operations the country to avoid the new taxes.
However, many companies and economists have said this will be difficult to achieve and will likely mean job losses and economic pain at least in the short term.",Mitchell Labiak,5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1zn9d9p4o,Xbox prices hiked worldwide amid tariff uncertainty,"Microsoft has significantly raised prices for its Xbox console, citing increasing development costs and what it called ""market conditions"".
The increases vary from country to country, with Xbox Series S consoles going up by Â£50 to Â£299.99 in the UK.
The US has seen even steeper price rises, with the Series X increasing in price by between $100 (Â£75) and $130, depending on the model.
It comes as US tariffs - which experts predict will increase prices for consumers - stir global economic uncertainty. However, Microsoft has not explicitly said tariffs were behind the increase.
Xbox prices are also rising in other countries around the world, with the Series S increasing by â¬80 in Europe and $50 in Australia.
It represents a big change in an industry which would typically see prices go down in the years after a console's launch.
""We understand that these changes are challenging,"" Microsoft said in a blog post.
""They were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development.""
Kedhrin Gonzalez, founder of Rip & Tear studios, told the BBC he felt the price rise was ""inevitable"" and ""catalysed by current tariff disruptions"".
""Gamers will suffer most, with little hope of prices decreasing,"" he said.
""This could significantly impact Microsoft's already modest Xbox sales and potentially trigger broader industry repercussions.
""This probably won't be the last price hike we see.""
And Christopher Dring, who writes about the gaming industry in The Game Business newsletter, told the BBC tariffs were ""certainly"" part of the decision to increase prices.
""With accessories and components made in China, the connection is pretty obvious,"" he said.
But he said there were other factors at play, such as inflation, changes in exchange rates and the ""general rising cost of business"".
""All of thisÂ is playing havoc in an industry that is seeing limited growth,"" he said.
""The console game sector has barelyÂ grown in terms of users in over 20 years, but costs of manufacturing and game development continue to rise exponentially.
""Any cost increases, even a small tariff, can have a serious impact on the profitability of these devices.""
Historically, in the years following a console's release it would drop in price, but this generation has seen the opposite.
Sony originally listed the PlayStation 5 digital edition at Â£360 in the UK when it launched in 2020, but over the years its price has increased to its current Â£429.99 RRP.
Meanwhile, the cost of future Xbox games is also in question, with the firm revealing it anticipated ""some of our new, first-party games"" would cost $79.99 in 2025.
This is the same retail price Nintendo announced for its upcoming Mario Kart World - a cost which caused concern amongst gamers who called it ""inaccessible"".
But unlike Mario Kart, which will cost less if bought digitally rather than in a physical box, Microsoft said its new price would be the same across the board.
It also clarified it did not plan to increase the price of existing games, only certain new titles developed by the firm itself.
But Microsoft declined to say whether it plans to increase the price of some future games in the UK as well.
""Local pricing may differ across countries and platforms,"" the firm said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4n94klqg9o,Tesla denies contacting headhunters to replace Musk,"Tesla has denied reports that it has contacted recruitment firms to launch a search for a replacement for Elon Musk as chief executive.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the electric car firm's board began looking for a successor to Mr Musk last month.
It said this was because of frustration around Mr Musk's focus on his job in US President Donald Trump's administration and Tesla's sinking share price.
However, in statement on Thursday, Tesla said the report was ""absolutely false"" while Mr Musk wrote on his social media platform X that the paper was ""a discredit to journalism"".
Tesla chair Robyn Denholm wrote on X: ""There was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company.""
""This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published).""
She added: ""The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.""
The denial comes after the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, wrote that Mr Musk was told by the board he needed to spend more time on Tesla and that he needed to say so publicly.
The paper said Mr Musk did not push back against the suggestion.
Last week, Mr Musk said on a conference call about earnings ""I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla"" and pledged to ""significantly"" cut back his government role.
Writing on X on Thursday, Mr Musk was heavily critical of the Wall Street Journal's reporting.
""It is an EXTREMELY BAD BREACH OF ETHICS that the WSJ would publish a DELIBERATELY FALSE ARTICLE and fail to include an unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors,"" he said.
He later reposted a comment from an X user that called the paper ""trash"".
Mr Musk's leadership of Trump's newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - has attracted a lot of criticism.
Some customers of Tesla say they no longer feel loyal to the brand because of Mr Musk's controversial political views and actions while in charge of Doge.
Some have pledged to boycott the firm while others have staged protests against it because of Mr Musk - in some cases causing criminal damage to dealerships.
Meanwhile, investors and analysts have said Mr Musk's reputation and his juggling of high-level roles is part of the reason why Tesla struggling financially.
In March, Trump - with Mr Musk by his side - told reporters at the White House gardens anyone using violence against Tesla would ""go through hell"".
He then pledged to buy a red Model-S, one of a number of Teslas lined up on the White House drive that day, to support the electric car firm.
Temporary government employees, such as Mr Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of Trump's inauguration, will end in late May.
But it is unclear when Mr Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely.
Trump said last month he would keep Mr Musk ""as long as I could keep him"".
On Wednesday, Mr Musk, who also runs space firm SpaceX, made light of the idea he was doing too many jobs.
In a video posted on X in a White House cabinet meeting, he was wearing two baseball caps.
""They say I wear a lot of hats,"" Mr Musk said in the video. ""That's true. Even my hat has a hat.""
Bloomberg reported that Mr Musk also said on Wednesday that Doge should examine the spending of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, particularly the cost of renovating its headquarters.
Mr Musk has made similar comments before, raising the idea that the Fed should be audited. However, such a move would pose questions about the bank's independence.",Mitchell Labiak,5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg456mzn8o,Seven takeaways from US-Ukraine resources deal,"The US and Ukraine have signed a deal that will give Washington access to some of the war-torn country's natural resources.
Months in the making, it sets up an investment fund that Ukraine hopes will cement US assistance as the country struggles to repel Russia three years after the invasion.
The Ukrainians have now published the deal and there have been public statements from both sides. Here are seven key takeaways.
Trump has previously demanded that Ukraine pay back the $350bn (Â£264bn) of aid that he claims has been provided by the US during the war - a condition that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected.
But Washington appears to have made a concession. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the agreement did not dictate that his country pay back any supposed ""debt"".


Trump has styled the agreement as a win for his side as well, saying his country will get back ""much more in theory"" than the billions that were provided to Ukraine by his predecessor Joe Biden.

The language used by the US in announcing the deal is notably harsher towards Russia than is usually the case from the Trump administration.
The agreement refers to ""Russia's full-scale invasion"" and the US Treasury Department adds that ""no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine"".
This will hearten Kyiv, which has demanded more pressure be placed on Russia in talks between Moscow and Washington discussing a possible ceasefire.
Despite the fact that much of the talk around the deal relates to Ukraine's mineral wealth, the agreement also includes provisions for oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons.
In all cases, the resources stay in Ukrainian ownership, even though the US will get joint access.
The inclusion of oil and gas has been seen as a softening of the Ukrainian position, since they were not in earlier drafts of the deal.
Senior administration officials told reporters they believe that ""more value"" can be derived from these resources if the fighting ends quickly.
Ukraine has long aspired to join the European Union and accession talks formally began last June.
There were some concerns in Kyiv that the resources deal could hinder Ukraine's ability to join the EU, if it gave preferential treatment to US investors, as Kyiv and Brussels already have a strategic partnership on raw materials.
But the deal's text says that the US acknowledges Ukraine's intention to join the EU and the need for this agreement not to conflict with that.
It also says that if Ukraine needs to revisit the terms of the deal because of ""additional obligations"" as part of joining the EU, then the US agrees to negotiate in good faith.
Additionally, Kyiv says the US will support additional transfers of investment and technology in Ukraine, including from the EU and elsewhere.
The US has framed the deal as an essential one to sign if Ukraine is to continue to receive its military assistance.
Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington DC to sign the deal - said it envisaged the US contributing new assistance in the future, such as air defence systems.
This, too, would mark a change in strategy for Trump - who has sought to wind down military support for Ukraine since returning to the White House.
One outstanding question is what the accord will ultimately mean for the state of the war. The Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.
It appears there are no concrete security guarantees from the US, which is something Ukraine and Europe have long been pushing the White House to provide.
Trump has long been reluctant to give the same military commitment that Biden had given.
Instead, his interest in staying the course with US support for Ukraine is more implicit, due to the economic commitments set out in this deal.
That means there would still be a fragility about the commitment of Ukraine's most important ally.
One intriguing point highlighted by Ukraine's government is that for the first decade of the reconstruction investment fund, profits will be ""fully reinvested in Ukraine's economy"", either in new projects or reconstruction.
This could be potentially significant if there is no financial benefit for the US for 10 years.
However, this provision does not appear to be in the agreement signed in Washington, although it might later be part of an additional ""technical"" deal.  Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on social media that ""these terms will be subject to further discussion"".
After that initial 10-year period, Kyiv says profits may be distributed between the partners.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News late on Wednesday that the deal was a signal to the American people that ""we have a chance to participate, get some of the funding and the weapons, compensation for those and be partners with the success of the Ukraine people"".
Speaking at the White House on Thursday, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller described the deal as ""repayment"" to the US for the  ""hundreds of billions of dollars that our taxpayers suspect subsidised the war"".","Paul Kirby, James FitzGerald and Tom Geoghegan",5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62x4zxe418o,Harrods latest UK retailer to be hit by cyber attack,"The luxury department store Harrods says it is the latest retailer to have been targeted by a cyber attack.
The firm said it had ""restricted internet access at our sites"" following an attempt to gain access to its systems.
It comes the day after the Co-op shut down parts of its IT systems to fend off a hack, while Marks & Spencer continues to deal with a cyber attack that has cost it millions of pounds in lost sales.
Harrods said its flagship store remained open, and it continues to operate its online sales.
Harrods did not clarify what the scale of the impact on its network was, but said customers were being asked to ""not do anything differently at this point"".
A statement from Harrods read: ""We recently experienced attempts to gain unauthorised access to some of our systems.
""Our seasoned IT security team immediately took proactive steps to keep systems safe and as a result we have restricted internet access at our sites today.
""Currently all sites including our Knightsbridge store, H beauty stores and airport stores remain open to welcome customers. Customers can also continue to shop via harrods.com.""
Harrods' online store appeared to be operating normally on Thursday evening.
Richard Horne, chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the UK government body responsible for supporting organisations facing cyber threats, said the spate of attacks should serve as a ""wake-up call"" for Harrods, the Co-op and M&S.
He said the NCSC was working closely with the companies that had reported incidents, ""to fully understand the nature of these attacks and to provide expert advice to the wider sector based on the threat picture"".
Cody Barrow, former cyber chief at America's National Security Agency, now chief executive of cybersecurity firm EclecticIQ, said the incident exposed the sector's ""mounting vulnerability to cyber threats"".
He said retailers should assume that they are targets for cyber attackers, due to the volume of customer data and the high impact that disruption can cause.
""For consumers, vigilance is crucial: update passwords, monitor financial activity, and watch for scams exploiting recent breaches,"" he added.
Marks and Spencer has seen its operations severely hampered by a cyber attack, the firm disclosed last week.
Customers are still unable to place online orders and shelves have been left empty in some stores.
The police are investigating.
Meanwhile, the Co-op said on Wednesday it had shut down parts of its IT systems in response to hackers attempting to gain access.
On Thursday, it emerged staff at the Co-op were being ordered to keep their cameras on during remote work meetings, and verify all attendees.
Experts say that indicates the company suspects hackers may be lurking in calls.
It is not known if the three incidents are connected.
Toby Lewis, Head of Threat Analysis at cybersecurity firm Darktrace, said it was possible that the three incidents impacting M&S, the Co-op and Harrods were a coincidence.
But he suggested two other possibilities: that all three retailers share a common supplier or technology that has been compromised and used as an entry point for hackers.
Or the scale of the attack on M&S had prompted security teams at other retailers to look more closely at their safety logs and act on activity they would not have previously judged a risk.
""It's a lesson again in the growing difficulty large organisations have in securing against threats in their supply chain, particularly as those threats grow in volume and sophistication,"" he said.
It is believed the disruption at M&S was a ransomware attack.
This is a type of malicious software used to scramble important data or files after gaining access to computer systems, essentially locking them away unless a ransom is paid.
Security experts told the BBC on Tuesday a ransomware group which goes by the name ""DragonForce"" was behind the attack.
The Co-op has not given any details of the nature of cyber attack made against it.
The chair of Parliament's Business and Trade Committee, Liam Byrne, has written to Marks and Spencer's chief executive, Stuart Machin, requesting further information about M&S's cybersecurity defences, and whether it had adhered to the guidance given by the NCSC.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg72kg5yn2ko,'They wanted $4m': Lessons for M&S from other cyber attacks,"As Marks & Spencer - and its customers - continue to reel from a major cyber attack, other people who have gone through similar experiences have been sharing what it is like to be targeted by hackers.
""It was an absolute nightmare,"" says Sir Dan Moynihan. He runs the Harris Federation, a group of 55 schools in the London and Essex area.
Sir Dan told the BBC how it was hacked four years ago by the Russian ransomware crime group REvil.
""Their purpose was to blackmail us into paying $4m (Â£3m) in cryptocurrency within 10 days,"" he said.
""If we didn't pay in 10 days, they wanted $8m.""
The hack caused chaos. The finances of the school group were hit, with staff and bills left unpaid.
Sir Dan said the group lost teaching materials, lesson plans and registration systems.
Even medical records and fire and phone systems were affected.
M&S has also been targeted with ransomware - malicious software which locks an owner out of their computer or network and scrambles their data.
Typically the criminals who use it then demand a fee to unlock those systems. Sir Dan says it was a demand he resisted.
Instead, the school group approached a firm of cyber specialists who employed a hostage negotiator. That individual then took on the role of an inexperienced school bursar - an administrator - who pretended to not know what was going on.
They took up negotiations with the hackers, with the purpose of delaying them for as long as possible so the school group could rebuild its systems.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Dan said: ""The Russians had stolen data from us - they didn't tell us what - and they threatened to put this stuff up on the dark web and cause us great embarrassment, and secondly they would lock down our systems.""
He said it took the group three months to get everything working again, at the cost of Â£750,000. Among the work was 30,000 devices that needed to be ""cleaned"" following the hack.
Was there ever a question of giving the criminals what they wanted? Never, said the school group boss.
""The money we have is for disadvantaged young people, and secondly had we paid we would have opened the door for other school groups to be attacked.""
The experience of being hacked can be a difficult one for individuals caught in the disruption.
Wedding dress designer Catherine Deane said it was ""devastating"" when her company's Instagram account was hacked.
""It felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. Instagram is our primary social platform, and we've invested the most amount of time and business resources into it.
""To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this workâ¦ it was just pulled.""
She told the BBC last month of the difficulty of fixing the problem with Meta, the owner of Instagram, describing that experience as ""almost traumatising"".
In June last year, staff at hospitals in London told of how they were left grappling with the aftermath of a cyber attack that led to many hours of extra work for their staff.
A critical incident was declared after the ransomware attack targeted the services provided by pathology firm Synnovis.
Services including blood transfusions were severely disrupted at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital and King's College Hospital (KCH).
Dr Anneliese Rigby, a consultant anaesthetist at KCH, told the BBC at the time: ""So what the labs are having to do is receive the blood sample, manually process that, which is a long, time-consuming process requiring a lot of staff which we don't have so we're having to get extra people to help with that.""
M&S has only issued limited information in its official statements, and has not put anyone up for interview.
However, people claiming to work for the retailer have given a sense of the chaos on social media.
On Reddit, users who identified themselves as M&S workers, something the BBC has not verified, described the impact of the cyber attack.
One wrote that most internal systems had been affected and that there had been experiments with ""resuming operations manually with paper and pen"".
Another poster said head office staff were working weekends, and that the problems were ""like going back in time"".
While some reported shortfalls in goods coming in, others described oversupply of some items, which meant food went to waste.
What is clear is other companies are watching what's happening closely, even more so since another retailer, the Co-op, shut down some of its IT systems this week in response to a separate cyber attack.
""We're patching like mad,"" is what one retailer told the BBC.
In other words, they are making sure every part of system has the most up-to-date software and protections.
Sir Charlie Mayfield, the former chairman of John Lewis, said other firms understood only too well how vulnerable they were.
""Online shopping has completely transformed retail - as technology becomes more pervasive, the risk of this kind of attack rises with it,"" he told the BBC.
According to the cyber security breaches survey, conducted by the UK government, 74% of large businesses said they were targeted with cyber attacks last year.
It seems likely there will still be many difficult days ahead for M&S.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypw7pn9q3o,US and Ukraine sign long-awaited natural resources deal,"The US has signed a deal with Kyiv to share profits from the future sale of Ukraine's mineral and energy reserves, after months of tense negotiations.
The deal aims to provide an economic incentive for the US to continue to invest in Ukraine's defence and reconstruction - as well as to address Washington's concerns over the amount of aid it has already contributed.
Ukraine is believed to have vast reserves of critical minerals like graphite, titanium and lithium. They are highly sought after because of their use in renewable energy, military technology and infrastructure.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed both sides were committed to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.
The deal will also see the establishment of an investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from the war.
According to the statement from the US Treasury on Wednesday afternoon, the newly created US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund recognises the ""significant financial and material support"" the US has given Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.
The US treasury secretary said in a video statement that the deal would help ""unlock Ukraine's growth assets"".
The language of the announcement shows much more solidarity with Ukraine than is usual for the Trump administration.
It refers to ""Russia's full scale invasion"" and adds that ""no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine"".
The Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.
For Kyiv, it is seen as essential to accessing US military aid.
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington to ink the deal on Wednesday - said in a post on X that the new fund would ""attract global investment into our country"".
Listing the deal's provisions, she said it would involve projects in minerals, oil and gas, although the resources would remain the property of Ukraine.
The partnership will be equal, on a 50:50 basis, she added, and must be ratified by lawmakers in Kyiv.
Under the deal, the US would contribute new assistance to Kyiv, she added, including, for example, air defence systems.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for the agreement as a prerequisite to offering any future security guarantees to Kyiv.
Crucially, the draft of the deal indicates Ukraine will be giving Washington access to some of its natural resources in return for future US security assistance.
But that is significantly less than what Trump had wanted, which was to get paid back for all US military aid given since the start of the war.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has managed to eke out some concessions from Washington.
The deal was delayed after US authorities said Kyiv was trying to make last-minute changes.
On Wednesday afternoon, a US source familiar with the talks criticised Ukraine for seeking to reopen some terms that had apparently been finalised over the weekend.
The source said sticking points had included governance of the fund, issues with transparency, and steps to ensure that all funds would be fully traceable.
Technical documents were signed last week by representatives of both countries.
The initial agreement was due to be signed in February, but fell apart following a heated exchange at the White House when Trump accused Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"".
The breakthrough comes days after Trump and Zelensky held a face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, and as talks between Moscow and Washington over a possible ceasefire in Ukraine grind on.
Phoning into the NewsNation network on Wednesday evening, Trump said he had pressed Zelensky at Vatican City to seal the deal.
""I was telling him that it's a very good thing if we can produce a deal that you sign it,"" he said, ""because Russia is much bigger and much stronger. Russia is just chugging forward.""
The US president said the deal would recuperate the multi-billion dollar US assistance to Ukraine since the war began and ""much more in theory"".
""So I went to them and said, 'Look, we got to get rare earth.' They have great rare earth, meaning certain minerals, materials,"" said Trump.
""They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c807n4rnmjyo,Trump tells business chiefs he needs 'little bit of time' as US economy shrinks,"President Donald Trump has asked for more time on the US economy as it contracted for the first time in three years, stoking recession fears.
He said the figure was misleading because companies had stockpiled imports ahead of his imposition of tariffs.
Trump, however, said $8tn (Â£6tn) of inward investment had been promised, which he argued would restore American manufacturing prowess.
The US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, the US commerce department said, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. It comes as Trump marks 100 days in office, with opinion polls indicating public discontent over his economic stewardship.
Speaking on Wednesday afternoon at a White House event attended by business leaders, Trump blamed his Democratic predecessor, President Joe Biden, for the disappointing gross domestic product data.
""This is Biden's economy because we took over on January 20th,"" Trump said. ""I think you have to give us a little bit of time to get moving.""
It comes in the aftermath of the Republican president's import taxes, which have disrupted global trade and markets.
Trump's finger pointing at Biden drew scorn from Democrats.
Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, minority leader of the US House of Representatives, said: ""This is not Joe Biden's economy, Donald, it is your economy.
""It is the Trump economy, it is a failed economy and the American people know it.""
At Wednesday's White House event, Trump touted planned investments in technology, healthcare and infrastructure.
He introduced CEOs of major companies, including Hyundai's Jose Munoz, Toyota's Ted Ogawa, and Johnson & Johnson's Joaquin Duato.
Trump also urged Congress to pass his tax bill, which includes trillions of dollars in tax and spending cuts, but faces opposition from Democrats and some Republicans.
At a television appearance earlier in the day with cabinet members, Trump played down fears of shortages of items such as toys, as trade between the US and China falls sharply.
""Well, maybe the children will have to have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know?"" he said. ""And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.""
Trump has enacted 10% levies on imports to the US from nearly all countries, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs. The amount paid by these countries could change after the period expires in July.
Another 25% tariff has been imposed on Mexico and Canada. The levies on China, however, have led to an all-out trade war with the world's second largest economy.
Trump imposed import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US and China hit back with a 125% tax on American products.
His administration said when the new tariffs were added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7jdn09lxo,'We don't care': A defiant China looks beyond Trump's America,"""We don't care about sales to the United States,"" says Hu Tianqiang as one of his toy fighter jets flies past our heads.
It's hard to hear him above the buzzing toy planes and miniature drones, an almost rhythmic backdrop to the cacophony of toys that surround him, all clamouring for the attention of buyers.
Hu's stall, Zhongxiang Toys, sits inside the world's biggest wholesale market in the small Chinese city of Yiwu.
It's a huge showroom of more than 75,000 shops where buyers come seeking just about everything, from twinkling Christmas lights and kitchenware to umbrellas and massage guns. It can take most of the day just to get around one department given each of them has an airport hangar's worth of goods on show.
Yiwu is in the province of Zhejiang, along China's eastern coast. The manufacturing and export hub, home to more than 30 ports, accounted for 17% of all Chinese sales to the US last year.
That puts Yiwu, and this region, at the frontline of the US-China trade war.
Mr Hu, too, is on the frontline. He sits among rows of snazzy toy jets, squeaking dogs, fluffy stuffed animals, barbies and motorcycle-riding spidermen â a sliver of the $34bn (Â£25bn) worth of toys China exported in 2024.
About $10bn of it went to the US. But now, these Chinese exports to America face up to 245% tariffs. And US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he blames Beijing in particular for cornering too much of the global market.
But things have changed here since Trump's first trade war against China, which kicked off in 2018. It taught Yiwu a lesson, summed up by Mr Hu: ""Other countries have money too!""
That defiance has become a familiar theme in the world's second-biggest economy, which is bracing itself for another turbulent Trump presidency.
Beijing, which has been repeatedly telling the world that the US was bullying countries into trade negotiations, has not backed down yet from the trade war.
The propaganda online has ratcheted up, applauding Chinese innovation and diplomacy in contrast to the uncertainty unleashed by Trump. On the country's highly controlled social media, there are plenty of posts echoing the leadership's promise that China will keep fighting.
And in factories and markets, businessmen and exporters now say they have other alternatives, beyond Trump's America. Mr Hu, for instance, says around 20%-30% of his business came from US buyers. But not anymore.
""We don't care about that 20-30%,"" Mr Hu says. ""We now sell mostly to South America and the Middle East. We are not lacking money, we are rich.""
When we ask about Trump, his colleague Chen Lang jumps in, rolling his eyes: ""He's cracking international jokes like no other. One day, one joke. Adding tariffs for him is like cracking a joke.""
Nearby, one of the thousands of buyers that flock to this market every day is negotiating a price to buy more than 100 robots that turn into cars in a series of beeps and buzzes. After tapping various numbers into a calculator, the final price is written in chalk on the floor.
The buyer, we are told, is from Dubai. The BBC met many others from across Africa and South America.
Lin Xiupeng says he has noticed the shift away from American buyers in his last 10 years in the toy business.
""A few days ago, the shop next to us had an order from a US client. It's worth more than one million yuan. But because of tariffs, the shop owner decided to cancel it,"" he says, offering us cups of tea.
""They must need China,"" he says, adding that the country supplies most of America's toys.
""I think there are a lot of businesses in the US protesting these days.""
Mr Lin is correct. Some toy shop owners in the US have written to the White House describing the tariffs as ""disastrous"" for their business.
""The tariffs are taking a hatchet to small businesses across America,"" Jonathan Cathey, who owns a toy company in Los Angeles, told the BBC over the phone.
He invested his last $500 in his company, Loyal Subjects, in 2009, which he ran from his two-bedroom bungalow in West Hollywood. He says it's now a multi-million-dollar business, but the tariffs could derail his plans.
""The entire toy industry could go under. We are looking at the total implosion of the supply chain. It's going to get really ugly,"" he warns.
He says swapping suppliers is a huge task: ""You need a lot of resources on the ground to produce a toy and many of these Chinese businesses have spent 40 years perfecting their craft.""
China has been a big part of Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, with his administration going head-to-head with Beijing.
""He seems to be launching a crusade against the whole world,"" says former Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, who served in the People's Liberation Army. ""But of course he's trying to bash China the hardest.""
Trump accused China of operating the Panama Canal, which is run by a Hong Kong-based firm, and vowed to take it back. He has been on the hunt for ways to mine rare earth minerals, which China effectively has a monopoly over, making this a key part of any deal with Ukraine. His threats to take Greenland are also likely aimed at curbing China's ambitions in the Arctic.
And, of course, he initiated another trade war, which takes special aim at China's neighbours, such as Vietnam and Cambodia, that have been crucial to its evolving supply chain.
In the last week, he suggested the levies on Chinese goods could be halved and spoke of ""a fair deal with China"" that his administration was ""actively"" negotiating.
But China's Commerce Ministry rebuffed this as ""groundless with no factual basis"". The headlines in state media haven't spared him either:  ""Trump is probably the worst president in American history,"" read one on state TV.
It seems the US president is waiting for his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to pick up the phone.
""We in China say â we have to let the bullet fly for a moment,"" Col Zhou says. ""That means in the fog of war, we do not know what will come next. I believe this kind of tit-for-tat would last for maybe one or two months â hopefully not more than three months.""
It cannot go on, he adds, because that would not be good.
It's certainly not good for China. Trump's tariffs are not even the biggest challenge facing the country, which is also grappling with domestic economic pain, from low consumption to a housing crisis that has dented people's savings and confidence in the future.
The terrible timing aside, the tariffs are biting Chinese businesses.
Goldman Sachs has forecast that China's economy will grow by 4.5% this year, short of the government's target: 5%.
The BBC reported from the trading hub of Guangzhou in mid-April that US-China trade was grinding to a halt, with exports to American households piling up on factory floors. That is borne out by this month's economic data, which show that activity in factories has sharply slowed.
When the BBC rang suppliers to see if shipments to the US had resumed, what emerged was a messy picture. One supplier said he had half-a-million pieces of clothing waiting to ship to Walmart, and a few others echoed his uncertainty. But two exporters we spoke to said some shipments from US retailers had indeed restarted.
The range and complexity of the trade between the two economies, which includes cargo cranes, umbrellas and everything in between, means that it's often down to different businesses and supply chains as to how they deal with the tariffs.
Whatever the business, there is no doubt the American consumer will feel the absence, or potentially higher prices, of Chinese goods.
The US still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing to meet its own domestic demand â think phones, computers, semiconductors, furniture, clothes and, of course, toys. Electronics and machinery alone account for more than 50% of US imports.
Walmart and Target reportedly told Mr Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could carry on until Christmas.
Some 90% of all Christmas decorations hung around American homes come from Yiwu in China, where sellers, surrounded by signs wishing the world ""Feliz Navidad"" told us they're now trying to focus on sales to South America.
And that effort is very evident in Yiwu.
In the early morning, before the shutters even open, the cavernous lobby of the wholesale market echoes with voices reciting key phrases.
""Shukran,"" says the teacher in Arabic. The students repeat it several times to perfect the pronunciation before learning that it means ""thank you"". ""Aafwan"" comes the reply, or ""you're welcome"".
These are free lessons offered by a local government association. Most of the students are women, dressed in their best to also impress their customers.
""These women are the backbone of trade across China,"" says one stall holder, who is originally from Iran and is giving private lessons to an eager student.
""They're doing these lessons to stay ahead of one another, to stay in competition.""
Most of the traders can already speak a few words of English. Now they say they need to greet their new buyers in Spanish and Arabic â a small but crucial sign of China's shifting trade relationships.
Oscar, a Colombian who would only give us his first name, was wandering the halls of the market with bags filled with fluffy bunnies and bears.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62xv43xqq5o,Apple referred for possible criminal contempt investigation,"A US district judge has found Apple wilfully violated her injunction in a case brought by Epic Games - and that a top Apple executive ""outright lied"" under oath.
The injunction was supposed to block Apple from anti-competitive conduct and pricing, opening the App Store up to outside payment options.
Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said she was referring the matter to the US Attorney for Northern District of California to investigate whether a criminal contempt proceeding is appropriate.
In response, an Apple spokesperson said: ""We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.""
Wednesday's judgement refers to a 2021 case brought by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, one of the world's most popular games, which argued that third-party payment options should be available to customers.
It challenged the up-to-30% cut Apple takes from purchases - and argued that the App Store was monopolistic.
In her 2021 judgement, Judge Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple could no longer prohibit developers linking to their own purchasing mechanisms.
As well as game purchasing, another example of how this would work is a movie-streaming service being able to tell customers to subscribe via its own website, without using Apple's in-app purchasing mechanism.
In a contempt order issued Wednesday, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple nevertheless continued to interfere with competition with attempts that the court stated ""will not be tolerated"".
Judge Gonzalez Rogers added that internal company documents she reviewed showed Apple deliberately violated the injunction.
The documents reveal ""that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option"", she wrote.
She said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with the injunction and allowed CFO Luca Maestri to convince him not to.
""Cook chose poorly,"" she wrote.
She also said Apple's vice-president of finance Alex Roman ""outright lied under oath"".
The judge wrote that one example of Apple's attempts to evade the injunction included a decision to charge a 27% commission on off-app purchases, when it had previously charged nothing.
The company also imposed new barriers and requirements to discourage customers from using competing purchasing platforms, she said.
In a post on X, Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said his company would return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week and offered an olive branch to his long-time rival.
""Epic puts forth a peace proposal: if Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return 'Fortnite' to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic,"" Sweeney wrote.
In another post, he wrote: ""NO FEES on web transactions. Game over for the Apple Tax. Apple's 15-30% junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Unlawful here, unlawful there.""",Lily Jamali,5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd3mey1ej2o,Meta warns of 'worse' experience for European users,"Meta warned on Wednesday that European users could face a ""materially worse"" experience following a key regulatory decision by the European Commission.
Meta recently introduced a ""consent or pay"" model which leaves users to choose between paying for a monthly subscription or letting Meta combine data it has collected on Facebook and Instagram.
Last week, the European Commision - the EU's executive - announced it had decided that the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and fined Meta â¬200m (Â£171m).
""Based on feedback from the EC in connection with the DMA, we expect we will need to make some modifications to our model,"" Meta said in its quarterly earnings statement.
Meta said it expected those modifications ""could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact"" to its European business and revenue.
The company said those impacts could kick in as soon as the third quarter of this year, and may be in effect while it appeals the decision.
They would not apply to users in the UK, where Meta has not implemented its ad-free subscription model.
It is currently in discussions with the UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), about a similar model for UK users and what it might look like.
A Meta spokesperson told the BBC it was engaging with the ICO to ensure its service satisfies regulatory expectations ""while delivering the UK Government's commitment to ensure that regulators and regulation support growth"".
""Personalised advertising on our platforms drives over Â£19.5 billion in revenues for UK businesses every year,"" they added.
Eric Seufert, analyst at Mobile Dev Memo, said Meta may be trying to strategically turn European users into ""vocal cheerleaders"" for its products amid a regulatory clampdown.
""What they ultimately want to do is turn public opinion against this regulatory regime which will demonstrably degrade the product offerings that are available to EU residents,"" Seufert told the BBC in a phone interview after the announcement.
Meta, formerly known as Facebook, includes the social media network in addition to the photo sharing app Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp.
The Commission has said that Meta's consent-or-pay model does not allow users to freely consent to how their data is used.
The body is currently assessing another option Meta introduced last year, which the company says uses less personal data to display advertisements.
Meta was given 60 days to comply with the DMA's recent decision, or risk further fines.
Apple was also issued a â¬500m (Â£428m) fine over its App Store practices last week.
Meta's announcement comes as it released quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street expectations.
The results showed Meta continues to bring in significant advertising revenue.
The company touted its AI tools on Wednesday.
""We're making good progress on AI glasses and Meta AI, which now has almost 1 billion monthly actives,"" Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.
""Our community continues to grow and our business is performing very well,"" he said.
Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said the results showed that Meta has gone ""full throttle on investments in AI"".
Britzman also noted the 6% jump in daily active users.
""There had been some concerns that we might see a slowdown in new users this year, but this was a very strong start and a signal to investors that Meta's family of apps has a grip on users that's hard to displace,"" Britzman said.
The recent rollout of its Meta AI chatbot to users in Europe was met with ire by some WhatsApp users, however.
Meta defended the ""optional"" tool that users cannot remove, saying it would listen to user feedback.
The EC fine comes amid what Meta called ""an active regulatory landscape"" in its earnings report.
The company is currently defending itself at trial in a case brought by the US Federal Trade Commission which alleges that Meta runs a social media monopoly.
The FTC, the top antitrust watchdog in the US, says Meta cemented its monopoly by purchasing Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwz9kl12l1o,US economy shrinks as firms import more ahead of tariffs,"The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year as government spending fell and imports surged due to firms racing to get goods into the country ahead of tariffs.
The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said.
The figures marked the first quarterly decline in three years, and came as the introduction of import taxes by President Donald Trump has scrambled global trade and created major uncertainty.
But analysts said it would take more time to understand the impact of the tariff changes.
While imports count against growth in calculations of gross domestic product (GDP), the surge is expected to be reversed in the months ahead. Those swings do not necessarily indicate an economy performing poorly.
The report also showed consumer spending - the primary driver of the US economy - expanded 1.8%, though at a slower pace than in 2024.
At a television appearance with cabinet members, Trump blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the economic weakening, maintaining that his policies would drive investment in the US and an economic boom.
""This is Biden,"" he said, while appearing to dismiss bubbling fears of price increases, supply shocks and shortages of items such as toys, as trade between the US and China falls sharply.
""Well, maybe the children will have to have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.""
In a statement, the White House said the GDP figures were a ""backward-looking indicator"".
""The underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering,"" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.
Since re-entering the White House in January, Trump has taken the business world by storm, announcing a series of new trade tariffs that he says will raise money for the government and help boost US manufacturing.
While he has watered down some of the policies in face of domestic outcry, analysts say the measures still leave the US with the highest overall effective average tariff rate in more than 100 years.
This report tracked activity through the end of March, a period before Trump announced his most far-reaching ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on China and other countries around the world, which sparked a dramatic sell-off in the stock market and turmoil in currency and debt markets.
It showed imports skyrocketed by more than 40% in the first three months of the year, while consumer spending grew 1.8%, down from 4% at the end of 2024.
Analysts cautioned that those figures could be distorted by people pulling forward their purchases in anticipation of tariffs.
The report also showed an unexpected jump in business investment, while final sales to private domestic purchasers - a closely watched indicator of overall demand - grew a solid 3%, little changed from the previous quarter.
""Overall, not as bad as feared,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.
Tariffs are a tax on imports, which economists have warned will lead to higher prices.
Some firms, such as toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker on Wednesday, have already announced plans to raise prices in response to the measures.
If shoppers baulk at higher prices and demand falls as expected, it could dampen growth further.
As corporate America enters a busy period of public updates for investors, many companies, including carmakers such as Stellantis and Mercedes, have said they cannot provide guidance about sales expectations for the months ahead, citing the uncertainty.
Leading stock indexes in the US, which had recovered from steep losses as Trump rolled back on some of his plans, opened lower after the figures were published but ended the day roughly flat.
But economists at Wells Fargo said it was difficult to draw firm conclusions from the latest data, noting that the drag on growth from trade was the biggest since the 1940s.
""The US economy is at a greater risk of recession today than it was even a month ago, but this contraction in GDP is not the start of one,"" they said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg30dlp1vo,Billionaire Isaacman takes big step toward leading Nasa,"A 42 year-old entrepreneur who was the first non-professional astronaut to walk in space is on his way to becoming the head of Nasa.
Jared Isaacman won approval from a key Senate committee and now only needs to clear a vote of the full chamber to lead an agency that has set its sights on returning to the moon.
While he is expected to win that vote, the billionaire with ties Elon Musk has encountered scepticism. Members of both parties asked at his confirmation hearing about possible conflicts of interest, his desire to send astronauts to Mars, and budget cuts.
President Donald Trump has said Mr Isaacman's leadership will pave the way ""for groundbreaking achievements"" in science and technology.
The committee voted 19 to 9 to send his nomination to the full chamber, with most of the votes against him coming from Democrats.
Mr Isaacman, along with Space X's Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space. They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.
He'll be expected to do the same at Nasa, whose space programmes are regarded by private sector operators as wasteful and often significantly over budget.
Mr Isaacman has said that the major aerospace contractors are ""incentivised to be economically inefficient"".
He has made it clear he would like to expand the human spaceflight programme at the agency.
In a confirmation hearing on 9 April, Mr Isaacman said he hoped to pursue the Artemis mission to the moon, as well as potential missions to Mars.
But lawmakers feared he would sacrifice the long-planned moon mission to focus on Mars. He sought to reassure them that the two were related and ""we could be paralleling these efforts and doing the near-impossible"".
""We will prioritise sending American astronauts to Mars and along the way we will inevitably have the capabilities to return to the moon,"" he said.
""We don't have to make a binary decision of moon versus Mars, or moon has to come first versus Mars,"" he later added.
During the confirmation process, it emerged that he had been arrested at the Canadian border in 2010 and returned to Nevada to face charges that he had passed bad checks to casinos.
In a questionnaire, Mr Isaacman said that the dispute with the Palms Casino in Las Vegas stemmed from a travel reimbursement that the resort promised but failed to deliver.
He added that the issue was resolved in 24 hours, with charges dismissed and court records sealed.
On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision: ""This second space age has only just begun.""
""There will inevitably be a thriving space economy â one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space,"" he wrote. ""At Nasa, we willâ¦ usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq7y8vl55yo,Xi's real test is not Trump's trade war,"Listen to Laura read this article

If you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.
The US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.
Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels â some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.
China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.
""For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for developmentâ¦ it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,"" he said this month.
His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.
Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested â and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?
With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.
This has not been prompted by the trade war â but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.
Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.
The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most ""extreme estimate"" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.
Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects â lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled ""ghost cities"". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.
The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.
And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.
They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension â over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.
There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.
The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.
""Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,"" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.
""Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.""
According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, ""China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administrationâ¦ The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.""
To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not ""sustainable"".
""We need a long-term mechanism,"" he says. ""We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.""
This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.
Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.
A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.
All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.
""Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,"" Xi said in 2012.
This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.
Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.
It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.
Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.
The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.
Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.
President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.
""In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,"" says Prof Zhang. ""But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.""
Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa â and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.
China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.
In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.
As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.
The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.
Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.
Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.
""Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,"" says Prof Zhang.
China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.
Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.
According to Prof Huihua, ""about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions"".
There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.
China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.
In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.
Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be ""holding China's hand"" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.
China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.
Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.
And it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".
Meanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.
""Trump has chickened out,"" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.
Even if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.
The last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets â especially in the Global South.
This trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws â and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy747g49ezo,Starbucks to hire more baristas in bid to win back customers,"Starbucks will hire more baristas and scale back plans to roll out automation, the coffee shop giant's chief executive Brian Niccol says.
The move, which is part of his strategy to win back customers, comes as other food and drink chains increasingly adopt technology to cut costs.
Also on Tuesday, the firm announced worse-than-expected financial results as its sales continue to fall.
Mr Niccol was brought into Starbucks last year tasked with turning the business around as it struggles with rising prices and consumers cut back spending.
""Over the last couple of years, we've actually been removing labour from the stores. I think with the hope that equipment could offset the removal of the labour,"" Mr Niccol said during a call with investors.
""What we're finding is... that wasn't an accurate assumption with what played out.""
Increasing staff numbers was tested in a handful of stores around the time Mr Niccol joined the firm in September 2024. He has been expanding the approach to include around 3,000 stores this year.
At the same time the firm said it will pull back from deploying its Siren Craft System. Named after the iconic Starbucks logo, it is a suite of technology and equipment that was introduced in 2022 to streamline drink-making.
Mr Niccol highlighted that taking on more staff would mean higher costs but said he was ""banking on some growth to come with the investment"".
Alongside recruiting more baristas, Starbucks is also revamping its coffee shops, menus and the company's dress code.
Starbucks said in April that its baristas would wear dark, single coloured shirts to ""allow our iconic green apron to shine and create a sense of familiarity for our customers"".
In January, it reversed rules for its cafes in North America that allowed people to use their facilities even if they had not bought anything.
The changes were a U-turn from a policy introduced six years ago that allowed people to linger in Starbucks outlets and use their toilets without making a purchase.
So far Mr Niccol's turnaround efforts have seen limited results.
The company's latest financial figures showed that global sales fell by 1% in the three months to the end of March, the fifth quarterly decline in a row.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rd35wg4ro,"Border crossings, egg prices and jobs - Trump's 100 days speech fact-checked","President Trump used a rally in Michigan to mark what he claimed had been ""the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country, according to many, many people"".
He highlighted his efforts to tackle illegal immigration, to bring back jobs to the US and end what he called ""the inflation nightmare"".
BBC Verify has looked into some of the main claims from his speech.
Trump said ""gasoline prices are down by a lot"" since he took office.
On 29 April, the average price for a gallon of ""regular"" gas - or petrol - across the US was $3.16 (Â£2.36), according to data from the American Automobile Association (AAA).
That is slightly up from the $3.125 (Â£2.33) recorded by the AAA on the day Trump entered the White House.
In his speech, he added that gas prices had ""just hit $1.98 in a lot of states"".
This is a claim he has made several times but we cannot find evidence of prices this low.
As of 29 April, no state had an average gas price lower than $2.67 (Â£1.99), according to the AAA.
The US president also spoke about the cost of eggs - a concern for many US consumers due to an ongoing bird flu outbreak - and said: ""Since I took office, the cost of eggs is down 87%.""
This claim is false.
The average national price for consumers of a dozen large Grade A eggs when Trump entered office in January was about $4.95 (Â£3.70).
This rose to a record high of around $6.23 (Â£4.65) per dozen in March - according to the latest available figures.
The White House has pointed to wholesale egg prices as evidence of improvement.
Wholesale prices have gone down since Trump took office - but by about 52% - from $6.55 (Â£4.89) for a dozen large white eggs in January to $3.15 (Â£2.34) in the past week, according to the US Department of Agriculture.
Trump spoke at length about his efforts to tackle illegal immigration - a key campaign issue in last year's election.
He said: ""For two months in a row, we have set all time records for the lowest number of illegal border crossings ever recorded.""
This claim is backed up by the latest monthly figures on ""encounters"" of illegal migrants recorded by officials at the US-Mexico border.
In March, there were 7,181 encounters of migrants there and in February there were 8,346.
These are the the lowest numbers since these monthly records began in 2000.
By comparison, there were about 140,000 encounters at this border in each of those months last year under President Biden.
His term saw record numbers of border crossings which then fell towards the end of his presidency.
The Migration Policy Institute think tank has studied monthly averages of annual figures available before 2000 and says this year's illegal border crossings are the lowest since the late 1960s, rather than the lowest for ""all time"".
President Trump praised Elon Musk's work at the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) saying: ""They've saved over $150bn on waste, fraud and abuse"".
Doge, an advisory body, publishes a running total of its estimated savings on its website - it was $160bn the last time the site was updated on 20 April.
However, less than 40% of this figure is broken down into individual savings - which include cancelling government contracts, grants and leases.
Analysis by BBC Verify found only about half of these itemised savings had a link to a document or other form of evidence.
Doge says it is working to upload all receipts in a ""digestible and transparent manner"".
Federal contract experts we spoke to also raised questions about Doge's biggest claimed savings and said some had been overstated.
Trump said: ""In three months we have created 350,000 jobs.""
This claim is backed up by official figures.
During Trump's first two full months in office up until March (the latest available data) 345,000 jobs have been added, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
However, over the same period last year 468,000 jobs were added under President Biden.
Trump also said: ""For the first time in recent memory, job gains for native-born Americans now exceed job gains for foreign workers.""
It is true that during President Trump's first two full months in office more jobs have been created for native-born workers than foreign-born workers.
This also happened between February and April last year under President Biden.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5w156y3jeo,Richard Branson criticises Donald Trump's tariffs,"The UK remains a ""fantastic"" place to start a business despite the ""setback"" of Brexit and the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs, Sir Richard Branson says.
Speaking at the launch of his Virgin Group's hotel in Shoreditch, east London, the entrepreneur said that the world of business would ""have to deal with... the complete uncertainty"" of the impact of the US president's tariffs.
The 74-year-old also told the BBC that he wanted to ""make London prosperous for everybody"" following the UK's decision to leave the EU.
Sir Richard said: ""I still think it's a good time to start in the UK and... if we businesspeople can generate enough income for the UK, then taxes will start going down for people.""
He told the BBC that, more than 50 years after launching Virgin Records in London, the UK remained ""really special"" and was ""one of the few countries in the world that is stable"".
Sir Richard said: ""I think that he [Trump] got a nasty shock when the whole world looked like it was going to melt down.
""When he thought he could get away with ridiculous tariffs, he had to backtrack and hopefully he's learned his lesson and there will be a more sensible regime put in place - but with him you never know what's going to happen.
""It's that unpredictability that has done a lot of damage in the world in the last couple of months.""
James Bermingham, chief executive of Virgin Hotels, said: ""Londoners will weather any storm, and we've seen that decade after decade and crisis after crisis.
""The way people bounce back in the city truly sets a standard for the world to follow.""
On the possible introduction of a tourist tax in the capital, Mr Bermingham said he would support a ""small, reasonable fee"", that ""doesn't restrict demand, is industry-led and focused on... improving the tourist experience and improving tourism"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjewggl0yqeo,"Fifty years after the war, Vietnam faces a new US threat - tariffs","On a searing afternoon in Vietnam, Tung Linh declared she ""basically knows nothing"" about the bloody, decades-long war that pitted her country's Communist-run North against the United States-backed South.
""My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,"" says the 20-year-old college student.
Stuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.
Today's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat â it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.
Its authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China.
But that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war â it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.
Vietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.
But it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle âwhich hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.
Vietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).
""I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,"" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. ""And yes, success for me too,"" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.
It's a dream that suits her bustling city â now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.
You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon.
And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.
America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over.
The victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.
But few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their ""reunification"".
Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back â they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.
""I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,"" Linh said.
Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future â and her country's - is not uncommon.
A little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could ""become successful"".  With a laugh, she added: ""And rich!""
When we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.
""We're not angry,"" she says. ""We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.""
Vietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.
The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.
The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the ""middle-income trap"", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment â and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.
After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as ""the boat people"". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.
""Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,"" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.
""The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.""
It's no coincidence this shift began around 2018, when Trump declared his first trade war against China.
Two young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: ""Now it's ready to go.""
They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world â but ""it's a lot better here than China"", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.
Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. ""I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.""
Vietnam is again being asked to choose â America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.
Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing â the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.
As Vietnam insists on ""looking forward"", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.
But even they say there must be no return to the past. ""I used to have a scar here,"" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged.
""There are still some pieces of shrapnel in my body that couldn't be removed. There were battles where it seemed like we would all be killed. But some of us survived while others fell.""
But he says he bears no anger anymore.
""We must have peace. We have already made a lot of progress. People's lives are more prosperous and fulfilled. Now we must work together with the Americans for the future.""",Rupert Wingfield-Hayes,7 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14xydjzn5eo,"Canada will deal with Trump 'on our terms', Carney tells BBC","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said his country deserves respect from the US and will only enter trade and security talks with President Donald Trump ""on our terms"".
Speaking exclusively to the BBC as the polls were closing, Carney said he would only visit Washington when there was a ""serious discussion to be had"" that respected Canada's sovereignty.
Carney and Trump have since spoken and agreed to meet in the near future, according to the Canadian prime minister's office.
""The leaders agreed on the importance of Canada and the US working together â as independent, sovereign nations â for their mutual betterment,"" the statement reads.
Trump was also said to congratulate Carney on the election.
Since Trump's re-election to the White House, the US president has repeatedly mentioned making Canada the ""51st state"" of America, and earlier on Tuesday this was reiterated by the White House on Tuesday.
""The election does not affect President Trump's plan to make Canada America's cherished 51st state,"" White House deputy spokesperson Anna Kelly said.
Carney, who secured a historic victory for his Liberal Party in a snap election on Monday, said such a scenario was ""never, ever going to happen"".
""Frankly, I don't think it's ever going to happen with respect to any other [country]... whether it's Panama or Greenland or elsewhere,"" he added.
However, he said there was a ""win-win possibility"" for his country if it could secure a deal with the US and also build on trading relationships with the European Union and the UK.
The US is a big market for Canadian businesses with roughly 75% of Canada's exports heading south.
Canada accounts for a much smaller 17% of US exports.
Canada is also America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. America's trade deficit with Canada - expected to be $45bn in 2024 - was mostly driven by US energy demands.
Canada and US relations have been strained in recent months, driven by Trump's talk of a ""51st state"" and referring to previous Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as ""governor"" - the title for leaders of individual American states.
The US president has also sparked a global trade war in which Canada was one of the first countries targeted with tariffs.
Trump has partially imposed a blanket 25% tariff on various Canadian goods, along with 25% import taxes on all aluminium and steel imports, but has exempted products covered by a US, Canada and Mexico trade deal known as USMCA.
Canada has retaliated with some C$60bn ($42bn; Â£32bn) worth of tariffs on US goods.
Carney said talks with Trump would be ""on our terms, not on their terms"".
""There is a partnership to be had, an economic and security partnership,"" he said.
""It's going to be a very different one than we've had in the past.""
Carney has touted his experience handling global economic crises as a way to deal with Trump on tariffs.
Before becoming PM in early March, Carney had never held political office.
He is a banker by trade, leading the Bank of Canada during the 2008 global financial crisis before becoming the first non-British person to take on the top job at the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020.
The PM said Canada was the ""biggest client for more than 40 states"" in the US.
""Remember that we supply them [the US] with vital energy. Remember that we supply their farmers with basically all their fertiliser,"" Carney told the BBC.
""We deserve respect. We expect respect and I'm sure we'll get it in due course again, and then we can have these discussions.""
Canada and the US, along with Mexico, have deeply integrated economies, with billions of pounds worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders on a daily basis, for example, car parts.
The introduction of tariffs, which are taxes levied on goods as they enter a country and paid for by the importer, threatens decades of collaborations between the nations.
Trump has argued tariffs will encourage more Americans to buy domestically-made goods, which will ultimately boost US manufacturing and jobs.
While America's main opponent in the global trade conflict is China, the introduction of Trump's blanket, so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"" on the likes of the UK and other European countries has led to allies seeking fresh agreements in response to barriers to trading with the world's largest economy.
Carney, who endorsed UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves during the British general election, said ""one would think"" that Canada and the UK could sign a stalled free trade agreement as part of diversifying trade, but highlighted about 95% of trade between the countries is effectively tariff-free already.
""We could expand the level of integration between our countries, like-minded countries. You think about defence partnerships, and those conversations have just just begun, so there's a lot that we can do,"" he added.
In a statement congratulating Carney, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: ""I know we will continue to work closely on defence, security, trade and investment.""
Carney said the G7 summit hosted by Canada in June would be ""very important"" in deciding the future path of the global trade war, adding it would ""put to the test"" whether the group of the world's seven most advanced economies - which includes the US - was still the most ""like-minded of like-minded countries"".
The summit will occur just before the 90-day pause on some of Trump's higher tariffs is set to expire.",Faisal Islam,7 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z5yl2l1lo,Can AI care for your loved ones?,"Robots for training carers, sensors that monitor people as they sleep and an app that can detect if someone is in pain - could this be the future of care?
The care sector is increasingly using technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to look after the UK's ever-growing elderly population.
Despite this, experts have urged people to consider the potential risks of an overreliance on AI in the industry.
""AI can only be part of the solution but not the whole solution,"" says Dr Caroline Green from the University of Oxford.
Ms Green, the director of research at the Institute for Ethics in AI, spoke at an AI in Social Care Summit at the university in March.
She highlighted how AI systems could be susceptible to biases, which amplify discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping and has also recognised the worries people have around sharing their personal data with the technology.
""At the moment there's no official government policy on guidance on the use of AI in social care,"" Ms Green added.
She said: ""Whether it's going to be good for people who need support, depends on how policy is going to shape up here, it depends on what choices people will continue to have in the future, or whether they can for example opt out of having AI in their care at all, it will depend on whether there is going to be a sense in which AI technology can take over care provision and human interaction.
""We need to be very careful here on what choices people will have in the future and what the future of social care with AI will look like.""
Thomas Tredinnick is the boss of AllyCares that uses sensors to monitor care home residents' rooms overnight, listening out for anything out of the ordinary.
It sends an audio recording of any incidents to carers on shift, who can then decide how to act.
Speaking from Oaklands Rest Home in Southampton, which uses the technology, Mr Tredinnick said it saves staff having to perform regular nightly checks, meaning residents can get a better sleep.
""The care staff are providing care to the residents that need it,"" he said.
He claims it has helped to reduce preventable health events leading to hospital admissions, as it spots things like falls and chest infections before they escalate.
Christine Herbert said her 99-year-old mother Betty is one of the residents being monitored by the technology.
She admitted she was uncertain about the use of AI at first, comparing the technology to a ""baby monitor"".
""When mum came here for the first few nights I did ask for routine checks because I was concerned,"" she said.
Mrs Herbert said she came around to the technology after the home presented her with data which showed how her mother was monitored and not disturbed during the night.
At Elmbrook Court care home in Wantage, Oxfordshire, they are using AI to find out if residents are in pain.
Aislinn Mullee, deputy manager at the home, said: ""It can be quite difficult to identify pain in a resident that is non-verbal.""
Using a smartphone app called Painchek, carers scan a resident's face for pain indicators, answer questions about the resident and then receive an instant percentage score which indicates the level of pain that person is feeling.
Ms Mullee said it has made a ""huge difference"" and they have used the information in collaboration with local GPs to assess which pain medication a resident requires.
She added it has also been used to reassure family members that a loved one receiving end-of-life care was not in pain.
Ms Mullee made clear the data gathered was password-protected and only visible to staff at the home.
At the University of Oxford's Robotics Institute they are hoping AI could also be used to train carers.
Marco Pontin, a Post Doctoral Research Assistant, is part of a team which has created a robot which reacts to human touch.
It can be programmed to feel pain in different parts of its body and will physically flinch if a carer is too forceful when touching a painful area.
It will be trialled with students studying to be occupational therapists at Oxford Brookes University.
Mr Pontin said the team hoped to use it as a ""digital twin"" of real life patients.
It will be programmed with the same conditions as a human patient so that carers ""can replicate whatever they have seen in the real world but with the robot counterpart"".
He said: ""With an ever-growing ageing population it's harder to be there for everyone, so providing a digital twin of a patient could enable occupational therapists to know what is going on with their various patients without necessarily being there all of the time.""
People are living longer and there are an estimated 12 million people in the UK aged 67 or over, with that figure projected to rise to 13.7m by 2032.
A report published by the House of Commons library in March stated in 2023/24, local authorities in England spent Â£23.3bn on adult social care, which was the second biggest area of council spending after education.
The sector's reliance on workers from overseas is another big issue.
Home Office statistics showed 27,000 visas were issued to people coming to the UK to work in health and social care, in the 12 months to December 2024.
This was a fall of 81% compared with the previous 12 months. The number coming to work in the sector had increased significantly after temporary changes to the health and care visa rules.
""We're reliant on migrant workers to keep social care going at the moment,"" says Lee-Ann Fenge, professor of social care at Bournemouth University.
She said she does not believe new technology should be used as a way of filling the gaps in the sector.
She said ""It needs to be seen as a tool that enhances the work that is already happening.""
She added time needed to be taken to ""think about some of the ethical challenges"" that monitoring people could have.
""We need to prepare people better to protect themselves, so this isn't just about saying AI is wonderful, let's use it. We need to look at both the potentials of AI but also the risks that it could pose,"" she said.
In February, the UK and US governments refused to sign an international AI declaration in Paris, which pledged an ""open"", ""inclusive"" and ""ethical"" approach to the technology's development.
This comes as the government announced in March it will take a ""test and learn"" approach to funding AI in the public sector, in order to ""push innovation"".
When catching up with Dr Caroline Green again she continues to promote a cautious approach to AI.
""It can help with some of the administrative work, some of the operation of care, but it cannot replace that human touch,"" she said.
""There is a potential risk that AI is going to be seen as a panacea to some of those very big problems that we are seeing in social care provision, namely that we don't have enough staff, and that there is a growing demand from an ageing population.
""I think here we really need to make sure that we don't just invest in AI to take over care-giving but that we keep on investing in people, in professionals who will be able to provide that care.""
A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: ""We will harness cutting-edge technology to transform social care and we are already seeing promising developments across the sector - from AI-powered fall detection systems that provide earlier interventions, to tools which automate paperwork to free up staff to focus on caring for people.
""Making better use of AI in social care is exactly the kind of transformation we're championing in our 10 Year Health Plan â shifting from treating sickness to preventing it, from hospital to community care, and from analogue to digital solutions.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grn878712o,"Beware phony IT calls after Co-op and M&S hacks, says UK cyber centre","The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned that criminals launching cyber attacks at British retailers are impersonating IT help desks to break into organisations.
Hackers have targeted Marks & Spencer, Co-op and Harrods in the last two weeks, and on Friday the anonymous group told the BBC there will be more attacks soon.
Now the NCSC, the government agency responsible for cyber security, has issued guidance to organisations urging them to review their IT help desk ""password reset processes"" to reduce their chances of getting hacked.
""We believe by following best practice, all companies and organisations can minimise the chances of falling victim to actors like this,"" it said.
It said firms should reassess how their IT help desk ""authenticates staff members"" before resetting passwords, especially senior employees with access to high-level parts of an IT network.
It highlighted press speculation around ""social engineering"" as a way hackers may have gained access to accounts.
Criminals use social engineering techniques to get people to trust them when they email, text or call pretending to be from a company's IT help desk - ultimately tricking employees into handing over their log in passwords and security codes.
This also works the other way - calling people who work on the help desk and pretending to be an employee locked out of their account.
Cyber security experts now recommend further layers of security to deal with these sorts of attacks.
""Having code words that get used when an employee phones up to change their credentials, such as ""BluePenguin"", is one thing being discussed in the cyber community as a way to check that the member of staff is genuine,"" said Lisa Forte from cyber security firm Red Goat.
""Ultimately it comes back to the same issue with login credentials as always â we need multiple ways to do it to ensure it isn't easy to bypass.""
The NCSC advice is the strongest hint yet the hackers are using tactics most commonly associated with a collective of English-speaking cyber criminals nicknamed Scattered Spider.
The name derives from ""spider"" being the label given to financially motivated cyber criminals, while ""scattered"" is because they are not a cohesive, organised gang.
In the past two years these disparate hackers, in their teens or early twenties, have coordinated and planned attacks on Discord and Telegram to breach dozens of companies and steal or scramble data to extort their victims.
The NCSC does not specifically name the group as being responsible for the current wave of attacks, but acknowledges Scattered Spider are known for these types of hacks.
In other NCSC advice, cyber defenders are being urged to watch out for ""Risky Logins"".
This means looking out for when and where employees have logged in from - for example late at night or from strange locations.
Although cyber criminals could be anywhere in the world, young English-speaking hackers in the UK and US have become adept at using social engineering in their attacks.
Scattered Spider hackers have been responsible for high profile attacks including the coordinated moves against casinos in Las Vegas in which MGM Grand Casinos and Caesar's Palace were hit in quick succession.
There have been six arrests in the last year of hackers accused of being from Scattered Spider in the US and UK.
In July 2024 a 17-year-old from Walsall was arrested as part of an FBI investigation into the MGM hack - and months later a person of the same age and location was arrested in connection with another hack on Transport for London.
Police would not say if the alleged hacker was the same person.
On Friday, the hackers responsible for the current wave of attacks spoke to the BBC.
The criminals repeatedly denied they are Scattered Spider hackers and would only call themselves DragonForce - the name of a cyber crime service hackers can use for malicious software and extortion.
The hackers, who were fluent English speakers, revealed to the BBC they had compromised Co-op and stolen a large amount of customer and employee data.
They would not discuss the M&S hacks. But it is thought DragonForce ransomware was used to scrambled the firm's IT servers.
While the NCSC said it ""had insights"", it added it was ""not yet in a position to say if these attacks are linked"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrg8zkz8d0o,Trump criticised after posting AI image of himself as Pope,"US President Donald Trump has attracted criticism from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope.
The picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, comes as Catholics mourn the death of Pope Francis, who died on 21 April, and prepare to choose the next pontiff.
The New York State Catholic Conference accused Trump of mocking the faith. The post comes days after he joked to media: ""I'd like to be Pope.""
Trump is not the first president to be accused of mocking the Catholic faith. Former US President Joe Biden, a Catholic, caused outrage a year ago when he made the sign of the cross at a pro-abortion access rally in Florida.
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to answer questions about Trump's post during a briefing with journalists on Saturday. The Vatican is preparing to host a conclave to choose Francis's successor beginning on Wednesday.
The image posted by Trump on Friday night features him wearing a white cassock and pointed mitre, traditionally worn by a bishop. He wears a large cross around his neck, and has his finger held up, with a solemn facial expression.
The New York State Catholic Conference, which represents bishops in New York, took to X to criticise the picture.
""There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,"" the group wrote.
""We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.""
Left-leaning Italian former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi also blasted Trump's post.
""This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,"" Renzi wrote in Italian on X.
But the White House rejected any suggestion that the Republican president was making fun of the papacy.
""President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects to Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,"" said press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
The backlash continued on Sunday, as New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan - who has been friendly with Trump for years - told reporters that he disliked the image.
""It wasn't good,"" he said, after attending a Mass in Rome. ""I hope he didn't have anything to do with that.""
Switching to Italian, he called it a ""brutta figura"", a phrase meaning a bad or embarrassing impression.
Asked if the White House should take down the image and apologise, he said - again in Italian - ""who knows"" and declined to speak more about it.",Max Matza,2 days ago,0

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynz85zj2vo,How Katy Perry became the Hot and Cold popstar,"Earlier this week American singer Katy Perry, best known for her bubblegum pop, said she felt like a ""human PiÃ±ata"" after weeks of online backlash.
The description felt suitably colourful - but the acknowledgement was serious. A decade on from headlining the Superbowl, Perry's part in a much-derided Blue Origin spaceflight has seen her star crash down to Earth.
Mockery over the apparent worthiness of her reaction, including kissing the ground after landing and saying she felt ""so connected to love"", spread online. Fast food chain Wendy's even posted to ask: ""Can we send her back?""
Trolls have now taken aim at her world tour, which began in Mexico on 23 April, criticising her dance moves and performances.
It seems the star who first broke through singing about a boyfriend's mood swings now faces an icy reception. Perry's blamed an ""unhinged and unhealed"" internet - but is toxic social media the only reason?



The music writer Michael Cragg, author of Reach for the Stars, believes Perry's problem is that she's stuck between pop cultures and feels increasingly out of touch.
""Her pop star persona was cemented in the 2010s as cartoon-y, fun and playful, all whipped cream bras and goofy videos where she wore oversized braces on her teeth,"" he says.
For a period this worked. Her second album Teenage Dream, which doubled down on Perry's staple cheeky, sexualised girl-next-door image, scored five Billboard number one singles to match a record set by Michael Jackson. Its follow-up, 2013's Prism, bore transatlantic smash single Roar (her fourth solo UK number one), as well as Dark Horse in the US (her ninth domestically). Perry hasn't topped charts under her own steam since.
""That was a long time ago in pop terms and it feels like she hasn't evolved,"" adds Cragg.

In the past year, her comeback single Woman's World, touted as a female empowerment anthem, struck critics as lyrically shallow.
Some fans also seemed unimpressed that it was produced by Dr. Luke, who previously faced sexual assault allegations from the singer Kesha. The producer denied the claims and the pair reached an agreement to settle a defamation lawsuit in 2023, but Perry remained tainted by association.
The track failed to land in the top 50 in the US and only just managed in the UK, at 47. ""Her sort of spiritual 'let love lead the way' messages she posts don't really hold sway with very online pop fans in the face of that decision,"" says Cragg.
""The regressive girl boss feel of Woman's World, and then the album not being great hasn't helped,"" he adds, pointing to rapper Doja Cat's success working with Dr. Luke without the same negative response.
It followed a pattern of failed reinvention attempts stretching back to 2017's Witness, where Perry attempted to launch her socially conscious ""purposeful pop"" era.
But its Sia-written lead single Chained to the Rhythm, which boldly attacked mindless pop culture, appeared to be undermined by Bon Appetit, a song openly objectifying Perry as a sexual meal.
Female pop stardom has shifted. Last year's biggest breakout music stars â Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX â were women joined by a thread of fierce self-assurance, underpinned by relatability and authenticity.
In contrast, Perry wanted distance from her pop persona - as the headline for Cragg's 2017 Guardian interview with her put it: ""I created this character called Katy Perry. I didn't want to be Katheryn Hudson. It was too scary.""
Perry's first hit I Kissed A Girl caused controversy for the fetishisation of lesbians even back in 2008 when it was released. But today Roan's had global success telling her genuine queer awakening.
""The flip flopping has jarred in an era where... very defined pop star personas are the ones cutting through,"" argues Cragg.
Perry's 2021-2023 playground-styled Las Vegas residency embraced her surreal, fantastical image to commercial and critical success.
But it's not translating to a new generation of fans. ""I think ultimately people see her as a bit cringeworthy now,"" Cragg adds. ""Being shot into space on a billionaire's jolly while everyone watches that on social media platforms interspersed with war and the climate crisis... just feels tonally not ideal,"" he says.
Perry may have misjudged the public mood, but at the same time, the venom in the blowback points to deeper issues in pop culture beyond her control.
There is no doubt that the social media landscape has become more frenzied in recent years, with stars like Roan speaking against toxic fandoms.
Simon Diego, the creator of Brazil's Portal Katy Perry fan community, described the scale of the abuse towards the 40-year-old as ""unbelievable"".
The group showed their support by clubbing together with other fan pages to pay for a digital billboard message in New York's Times Square for 24 hours.
""We're so proud of you and your magical journey and we love you to the moon and back,"" it read.
""Know that you are safe, seen and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.""
It was this that Perry replied to directly with her PiÃ±ata remark acknowledging the backlash.
""I think Katy and many other celebrities are feeling unsafe in the one space that used to connect them to fans,"" Diego tells BBC News.
He believes that's why Perry has never posted photos of her daughter's face online.
But even that boundary was ignored in the wake of the spaceflight criticism, as commenters began targeting her four-year-old child simply because ""it's cool now"", he says. ""They don't understand how bad it could affect her.""
Others, like Marie Claire Australia editor Georgie McCourt, think pervasive misogyny plays a part.
""There's a particular ire reserved for women like Perry: ambitious, unapologetic, hyper-visible,"" she wrote in a column, noting that male celebrities have already gone into space without such surveillant reaction.
So where next for Perry? Cragg says a hit single would help.
""I'm not saying it will return her to the commercial highs of old, because that ship has sailed for a lot of pre-streaming artists, but it will steady the ship.""",Alex Taylor,2 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4le9n469o,Uber starts allowing customers to pay in cash,"Uber is now allowing passengers across most of the UK to pay in cash.
Following trials, the cash payment option was this week extended to all UK cities, except London, where it is being reviewed.
But individual drivers can still opt out of accepting notes and coins, partly if they are worried about safety of carrying them in their vehicles.
The move came as a major report suggested shops and services might need to be forced to accept cash in the future to protect those who rely on it.
On Wednesday, the Treasury Committee of MPs stopped short of recommending mandated cash acceptance now, but said its report was ""a wake-up call"" to government on the issue.
Uber has become a huge company and dominates the global ride-hailing market, as well as operating in a host of other transport sectors. Its rapid ascent has come with controversy and protests from other taxi providers.
The taxi app's success has been based around new technology, but meant customers needed cashless payments to use its services.
Following pilots in Birmingham, Stoke, Nottingham and Leicester, Uber said it has now extended the option of paying in cash to other UK cities, because some people preferred paying in cash or did not have a bank card.
""We believe that movement should be accessible to everyone, so following successful pilots in some UK cities over the last 18 months, we have decided to give passengers outside of London the option to pay for trips with cash,"" a spokesman said.
Passengers can select cash as their payment option on the app. Drivers can opt out in preferences on their own app.
If they do not have enough change, that is given as a credit to the passenger by Uber.
The cash option is being reviewed by authorities in London, and remains unavailable for Uber Eats or booking for other forms of transport via the Uber app.
Cash campaigner Ron Delnevo from the Payment Choice Alliance said Uber's move ""demonstrates that they now believe in the future of cash in the UK"", and brought the company's operations in the UK in line with many other countries.
He called on the government to introduce a law that would force all shops and services to accept cash.
Ministers have said there are no plans to introduce such rules.
However, the Treasury Committee's recent report did highlight various groups who relied on cash, including some people with learning disabilities and those who use cash to keep to a budget.
Among those reliant on cash, and who gave evidence to the committee, were victim-survivors of domestic and economic abuse.
Many face the dangers of being traced by their abuser via the payments they make. Buying a train ticket, for example, could only be done with cash in order to avoid an abusive partner becoming aware of their movements.
""It really is a matter of life and death,"" said Sam Smethers, chief executive of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse. ""Without it they find themselves monitored daily, with every transaction.""
Joint bank accounts and mortgages had also been used as a way to impose coercive control over somebody, she said.
And cash could be used as an eventual escape route.
""One victim-survivor said she hid pockets of cash around her house until she had enough to flee her abuser,"" she said.
The charity would like to see cash acceptance backed by law, but Ms Smethers said she welcomed the focus the committee's report had put on the plight of those facing economic abuse.",Kevin Peachey,2 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkx3vy54nzo,"Co-op cyber attack affects customer data, firm admits, after hackers contact BBC","Cyber criminals have told BBC News their hack against Co-op is far more serious than the company previously admitted.
Hackers contacted the BBC with proof they had infiltrated IT networks and stolen huge amounts of customer and employee data.
After being approached on Friday, a Co-op spokesperson said the hackers ""accessed data relating to a significant number of our current and past members"".
Co-op had previously said that it had taken ""proactive measures"" to fend off hackers and that it was only having a ""small impact"" on its operations.
It also assured the public that there was ""no evidence that customer data was compromised"".
The cyber criminals claim to have the private information of 20 million people who signed up to Co-op's membership scheme, but the firm would not confirm that number.
The criminals, who are using the name DragonForce, say they are also responsible for the ongoing attack on M&S and an attempted hack of Harrods.
The attacks have led government minister Pat McFadden to warn companies to ""treat cyber security as an absolute priority"".
The anonymous hackers showed the BBC screenshots of the first extortion message they sent to Co-op's head of cyber security in an internal Microsoft Teams chat on 25 April.
""Hello, we exfiltrated the data from your company,"" the chat says.
""We have customer database, and Co-op member card data.""
They also showed screenshots of a call with the head of security which took place around a week ago.
The hackers say they messaged other members of the executive committee too as part of their scheme to blackmail the firm.
Co-op has more than 2,500 supermarkets as well as 800 funeral homes and an insurance business.
It employs around 70,000 staff nationwide.
The cyber attack was announced by the company on Wednesday.
On Thursday, it was revealed Co-op staff were being urged to keep their cameras on during Teams meetings, ordered not to record or transcribe calls, and to verify that all participants were genuine Co-op staff.
The security measure now appears to be a direct result of the hackers having access to internal Teams chats and calls.
DragonForce shared databases with the BBC that includes usernames and passwords of all employees.
They also sent a sample of 10,000 customers data including Co-op membership card numbers, names, home addresses, emails and phone numbers.
The BBC has destroyed the data it received, and is not publishing or sharing these documents.
The Co-op membership database is thought to be highly valuable to the company.
Since the BBC contacted Co-op about the hackers' evidence, the firm has disclosed the full extent of the breach to its staff and the stock market.
""This data includes Co-op Group members' personal data such as names and contact details, and did not include members' passwords, bank or credit card details, transactions or information relating to any members' or customers' products or services with the Co-op Group,"" a spokesperson said.
DragonForce want the BBC to report the hack - they are apparently trying to extort the company for money.
But the criminals wouldn't say what they plan to do with the data if they don't get paid.
They refused to talk about M&S or Harrods and when asked about how they feel about causing so much distress and damage to business and customers, they refused to answer.
DragonForce is a ransomware group known for scrambling victims' data and demanding a ransom is paid to get the key to unscramble it. They are also known to have stolen data as part of their extortion tactics.
DragonForce operates an affiliate cyber crime service so anyone can use their malicious software and website to carry out attacks and extortions.
It's not known who is ultimately using the DragonForce service to attack the retailers, but some security experts say the tactics seen are similar to that of a loosely coordinated group of hackers who have been called Scattered Spider or Octo Tempest.
The gang operates on Telegram and Discord channels and is English-speaking and young â in some cases only teenagers.
Conversations with the Co-op hackers were carried out in text form - but it is clear the hacker, who called himself a spokesperson, was a fluent English speaker.
They say two of the hackers want to be known as ""Raymond Reddington"" and ""Dembe Zuma"" after characters from US crime thriller Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a 'blacklist'.
The hackers say ""we're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist"".
Co-op says it is working with the NCSC and the NCA and said in a statement it is very sorry this situation has arisen.
UK government officials have met over the cyber attacks, with national security staff and the chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre discussing support for retailers.
In a keynote speech next week setting out government action, minister Pat McFadden - who has responsibility for cyber security - will say the attacks need to be a ""wake-up call"" for every UK business.
""In a world where the cybercriminals targeting us are relentless in their pursuit of profit - with attempts being made every hour of every day - companies must treat cyber security as an absolute priority.
""We've watched in real-time the disruption these attacks have caused - including to working families going about their everyday lives.
""It serves as a powerful reminder that just as you would never leave your car or your house unlocked on your way to work. We have to treat our digital shop fronts the same way.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgrwxp5r15o,Meta threatens to cut off Facebook in Nigeria over huge fines,"People in Nigeria may lose access to Facebook and Instagram after parent company Meta said it faced large fines and  ""unrealistic"" regulatory demands from the Nigerian authorities.
Last year, three Nigerian oversight agencies imposed fines on the US-based social media giant totalling more than $290m (Â£218m) for violating various laws and regulations.
Meta was unsuccessful in a recent attempt to challenge the decisions in the federal high court in Abuja.
""The applicant may be forced to effectively shut down the Facebook and Instagram services in Nigeria in order to mitigate the risk of enforcement measures,"" the company said in the court papers.
Meta also owns WhatsApp, but it did not mention the messaging service in its statement.
The high court has given the company until the end of June to pay the fines.
The BBC has asked Meta to outline what its next steps will be but has not yet received a response.
Facebook is by far the most popular social media platform in Nigeria and is used by tens of millions in the country for daily communication and sharing news. It is also a vital tool for many of Nigeria's small online businesses.
In July last year, Meta was asked to pay three fines:
FCCPC chief executive officer Adamu Abdullahi said investigations carried out in conjunction with the data commission between May 2021 and December 2023 revealed ""invasive practices against data subjects/consumers in Nigeria"" but was not specific about what these were.
In its court submission, Meta said its ""primary concern"" was with the data commission, which it accused of ""misinterpreting"" data privacy laws.
Specifically, the commission has demanded that Meta seek prior approval before transferring any personal data out of Nigeria - a condition that Meta called ""unrealistic"".
The data commission also imposed other demands.
Meta was told it must provide an icon linking to educational videos about data privacy risks. This would be content created in collaboration with government-approved educational institutions and non-profit organisations.
The NDPC insisted that these videos highlight the dangers of ""manipulative and unfair data processing"" that could expose Nigerian users to health and financial risks.
Meta described the NDPC's demands as unfeasible, saying that the agency has failed to ""properly interpret the laws guiding data privacy"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9856ge2742o,Co-op gives away free pasta sauce and coffee by mistake,"A suspected glitch on Thursday evening saw some Co-op product prices reduced by as much as 100% on the delivery app Deliveroo.
The pricing error allowed some shoppers to get products - including jars of Loyd Grossman pasta sauce, Costa ground coffee and Fox's cookies - for free.
Whether a retailer has to honour purchases of products advertising lower prices in error can depend on their terms and conditions.
But the BBC spoke to several people who were able to take advantage of the Co-op's reduced items on Deliveroo, such as Robinsons squash being discounted from Â£1.50 to 15p a bottle.
A Co-op spokesperson said the low prices were the result of ""a clerical error"".
""A small number of prices were showing incorrectly on our Deliveroo shop for a few hours last night,"" they said.
""This was quickly resolved, and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.""
Peter, who lives in Lancashire, told the BBC the ""incredible offer"" allowed him to get more than Â£80 worth of goods for just Â£3.29 - including delivery fees.
""I was surprised the Co-op and Deliveroo honoured and delivered the mispriced items,"" he said.
He said he will be donating most of the items to his local food bank ""who desperately need non-perishable food for people in my community"".
It was recently revealed that, like Marks and Spencer, the Co-op has been affected by a cyber attack.
The firm shut down parts of its IT systems in response to hackers attempting to gain access.
There is no suggestion this issue and the attempted cyber attack are linked.
A Deliveroo spokesperson confirmed the pricing error.
""Yesterday we experienced a brief temporary issue involving items in a promotional campaign with one partner being priced incorrectly,"" they said.
Meanwhile, Sally Marie from Bolton said like many who bought discounted goods on Thursday evening, she found out about it from a website which called it a ""glitch"".
""I was sat on the sofa and thought I'd give it a go before the Co-op ran out of stock,"" she said.
""I quickly installed Deliveroo, and to my surprise, I found some items priced at zero.""
Her order arrived just 15 minutes later.
People also posted evidence of their low-priced purchases from the Co-op's Deliveroo service on social media.
""Got myself a lot of cheap bits from the Co-op,"" said one user in a post on X.
""15p Robinsons squash will do well with the heat wave.""
Meanwhile on Instagram, one user said they found other products heavily discounted, with Airwick Reed Diffusers selling for Â£5.45 less than their regular price.
He told the BBC that the prices returned to normal within 45 minutes of him ordering and receiving his items via Deliveroo.
According to Citizen's Advice, your rights when shopping for an item online that has been discounted in a pricing error can depend on a store's terms and conditions.
These may only give the consumer legal rights once they have either placed the order or received it.
It adds that when buying in a shop, you should not have to give back an item or pay more for it if they sold it to you at a lower cost than they meant to - unless you discussed the price first but they ended up charging you less.
Many retailers tend to uphold pricing errors for products.
In 2022, a pricing mistake for copies of Fifa 23 Ultimate Edition on India's Epic Games store allowed some to buy the game for 4.80 rupees ($0.06; Â£0.05).
Its publisher Electronic Arts (EA) said it would honour games purchased at its erroneous 99% discount.",Liv McMahon,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250501-the-truth-about-heated-tobacco,Are heated tobacco products a new health risk?,"A new type of tobacco product is finding growing numbers of users around the world, but there are still serious questions about how it affects human health.
Having smoked for nearly 30 years since the age of 13, IT consultant and freelance writer Ben Taylor was intrigued by the sound of heated tobacco products.
Attempting to switch from cigarettes to vapes hadn't worked for Taylor. ""Vaping liquids always left me wanting,"" he posted on his blog. So he decided to try IQOS, a sleek, pen-shaped electronic device that heats sticks of rolled tobacco, developed by the American multinational tobacco company Philip Morris International (PMI).
Rather than burning tobacco, these devices heat it to a temperature high enough to create a vapour but not smoke.
For Taylor, it didn't quite replicate the experience of smoking a cigarette, but it came much closer than vaping â the other popular cigarette alternative, which uses handheld pens to heat a flavoured nicotine-containing liquid. ""You can tell you're consuming real tobacco,"" Taylor wrote. Over time, he says, he came to prefer IQOS due to the taste, and the lack of a lingering cigarette stench. He also says his previously near-permanent cough disappeared.
Tobacco manufacturers that sell heated tobacco devices market them as being a less harmful alternative to cigarettes. They point to industry-funded research that shows they produce lower levels of compounds known to be harmful to human health.
But there is growing concern in the medical community that these devices still pose a health risk to both the people who use them and those standing nearby. They also warn that as relatively new products, the long-term effects of using heated tobacco have still to be properly investigated.
Yet they are also becoming increasingly common, with next-generation heated tobacco products now available in more than 60 countries. They have experienced particularly notable growth in bothÂ Italy and Japan,Â where they have been present since 2014. And this growth is expected to continue as they start to penetrate the market in the US.
So, is heated tobacco really helping people enjoy nicotine in a less harmful way, or could it be a new public health crisis in the making?
IQOS and other devices like it are the latest iteration of a concept which the tobacco industry has been intermittently toying with for the past four decades. In 1988, an American tobacco company called RJ ReynoldsÂ attempted to commercialise the very first heated tobacco product, a device called Premier. Designed to look similar to a conventional cigarette in shape and size, the Premier had a specifically designed carbon tip that users would light to heat the tobacco. But despite a reported $300m (roughly Â£180m at the time) in investment, PremierÂ was removed from the marketÂ after just six months as users complained about its taste and smell.
After various reinventions, heated tobacco products have started to enjoy commercial success in the past decade with a new range of electronic devices that use several methods to vaporise their contents. Typically these involve encasing tobacco in either sticks, plugs, capsules or pods, which are then heated with an electronic element. As well as PMI's IQOS, leading brands include Ploom, made by Japan Tobacco International (JTI), and glo, made by British American Tobacco (BAT).
Employing sleek, appealing designs and backed byÂ multi-million dollar marketing strategies â which have included everything from social media influencersÂ to pop-up stores â these devices have been far more successful than the original incarnations. CelebritiesÂ have backed heated tobacco products, with theÂ musician Jamiroquai and actors Alberto Amman and Monica Cruz attending the IQOS 3 launch party in Madrid in 2019. Jamiroquai also performed atÂ a 2018 launch eventÂ for IQOS 3 in Milan, while American dance music DJ Steve Aoki, whose name is attached to a limited edition version of an IQOS device,Â performed a concert at another event for the products in Barcelona in January 2025.
BAT have alsoÂ employed similar marketing tactics, paying social media influencers, sponsoring boat parties and organising giveaways at Formula 1 races.
So far, heated tobacco products have had limited penetration in the US. While one survey of 40,000 US adults found that 8% were aware of them, only 0.5% had ever used one of the devices. But that could change. After first receiving aÂ limited authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019, which was later extended in 2020, IQOS isÂ now re-enteringÂ the US market in Austin, Texas.
The tobacco industryÂ promotes this new generation of heated tobacco products as a safer, smoke-free alternative, stressing that they only heat, not burn tobacco. PMI's website, for example,Â statesÂ that they aim to remove ""combustion of tobacco, the cause of most tobacco-related diseases"", celebrating IQOS as ""the next step in tobacco harm reduction"". The companyÂ estimates that more than 22 million adultsÂ globally have quit smoking cigarettes and switched to its heated tobacco products.
PMI has said in the past that it intends to stop selling cigarettes and become a smoke-free company. It is investing heavily in products such as heated tobacco and hopes for at least two-thirds of its revenues to come from smoke-free products by 2030.
But independent researchers and public health experts argue that heated tobacco products are still harmful to human health and urge users to give up tobacco altogether. They express concerns at some of the marketing strategies, saying that the use of influencers and glamorous launch parties could encourage heated tobacco use among young people, who are more likely not to have smoked before, which could make these products a gateway to cigarettes.
PMI, JTI and BAT all insist their products are aimed at adults only. PMI says it has a robust code of conduct that does not allow marketing that appeals to minors such as cartoons, youth-orientated celebrities or models who are or appear to be under the age of 25. BAT said they carry out due diligence on any influencer partnerships to ensure that a significant majority of their followers are over 18 years old. JTI says it is ""committed to the principle that minors should never use or access nicotine-containing products"". It says it ensures it markets its heated tobacco products in a ""socially responsible way"" in accordance with applicable laws and rules.
But Silvano Gallus, an epidemiologist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, believes that existing smokers do not appear to be the main audience for these products, despite the messaging from tobacco firms. He first started monitoring the rollout of heated tobacco products more than a decade ago.
""We began to see the promotion of these products everywhere with advertisements, events and parties, particularly aimed at young people,"" says Gallus, reflecting on the initial launch of heated tobacco in the cities of Milan and Nagoya, Japan.
In 2019, PMI suspended a social media campaign involving digital influencers after the news organisation Reuters revealed the company had been using young online personalities to market its products, including a 21-year-old woman, in breach of its own code of conduct. PMI said at the time that no laws were broken, but acknowledged that the campaign failed to meet the company's standards.
Gallus claims that the users of heated tobacco products in Italy tend to be young, pointing to surveys which have described their use as widespread among adolescents. ""They aren't 60-year-old hardcore smokers looking for an alternative to cigarettes,"" he says.
PMI, however, insists that unintended use among youths is low in the 70 markets where IQOS is currently available. It points to a survey in 2021 funded by the Japanese government that showed 0.9% of those questioned in junior high school (aged 13-15) and 1.4% of those in high school (aged 16-18) said they used heated tobacco. It is illegal to smoke or buy tobacco in Japan under the age of 20. Other studies in countries around the world show use among youths is in the low single digits, PMI says.
But there is concern among public health experts that if young people who have never smoked cigarettes really are drawn to heated tobacco products, it could introduce new groups of people to potentially harmful habits.
In 2024, Gallus and a group of fellow tobacco control researchers in Italy published a study based on data from more than 3,000 Italians aged between 18 and 74, who they tracked for six months during 2020. They found that non-smokers who began using heated tobacco products were 5.8 times as likely to subsequently transition to smoking within the six month study period as people who had never used heated tobacco products.
""We know that this product is a gateway to conventional cigarettes,"" says Gallus. It is a concern shared by other researchers.
But PMI describes Gallus' study as unreliable and says that heated tobacco can provide a route out of smoking. Gallus and his colleagues acknowledge themselves that their study had a limited sample size and needs to be verified with larger studies. The results may also have been impacted by the pandemic and widespread lockdowns which were taking place at the time.
Researchers like Gallus, however, view heated tobacco products as a setback in the battle to drive down tobacco use and have accused the industry of cynically targeting young people. They point to the fact that, to date, marketing for IQOS has appeared at music festivals and film festivals in Europe, Asia and South America, alongside high profile partnerships with streetwear brands and fashion designers.
It is a concern echoed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In aÂ 2023 summary of evidence, experts at the WHOÂ warned that the lower cost of heated tobacco sticks compared to a pack of cigarettes ""undermines the progress made in reducing use that was accomplished by making products more expensive"". The report, which was funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, an organisation that invests heavily in reducing tobacco use, added that the marketing of heated tobacco products often combined claims of reduced harm relative to cigarettes with ""the passion for technology of primarily young people"".
According to a report produced by the non-profit organisation Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids â which also receives funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies â influencer-driven campaigns on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok,Â X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube have also played a key role in raising the visibility of IQOS and other heated tobacco brands. A study by researchers at the University of Rochester in the US also found that Instagram posts featuring heated tobacco products often position the devices as lifestyle products by showing them alongside models, swimming pools or a luxury car. Posts with models or lifestyle elements received higher engagement.
PMI categorically denies marketing its heated tobacco products to young people and says it does not have an official account on TikTok, while its account on X is used for customer care only. The company also says at least 75% of the audience must be over the legal age for purchasing tobacco products at any third-party events it sponsors. PMI claims 82% of IQOS users are over the age of 29, according to its own estimates.
But the debate over the marketing of heated tobacco also obscures another issue â these products are so new that there is still little research to assess their long-term health effects.
Most research on the vapour emissions from heated tobacco products have been funded by tobacco companies or carried out by scientists directly employed by them. They show that heated tobacco aerosols contain significantly fewer harmful compounds than cigarette smoke.
Some studies have also found that switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco can be beneficial in some people â such as patients with chronic lung disease. But other scientific research also suggests that heated tobacco products are unlikely to be benign for our health.
In 2017, a group of Swiss scientists published a study disputing one of PMI's central marketing claims, namely that IQOS is smoke-free because of the lack of combustion or burning of the tobacco leaves.
Instead, the researchers argue that the emissions from heated tobacco devices should still be considered as ""smoke"" and should fall under indoor smoking bans in the same way as cigarettes. Their study showed that IQOS tobacco reaches around 330C (626F), a finding supported by other studies, while a conventional cigarette reached around 684C (1,263F).
In their subsequent analysis of IQOS emissions, they concluded that the heated tobacco vapour also contained harmful chemicals which stem from pyrolysis â the term for incomplete combustion â and thermogenic degradation, making it more similar to cigarette smoke than the company was claiming. ""Smokers and non-smokers need accurate information about toxic compounds released in IQOS smoke,"" the scientists wrote.
PMI was quick to respond to the study, sending the authors a letter disputing many of the results. A subsequent analysis by the FDA also warned there were ""significant analytical issues"" with the study that made it difficult to compare the levels of harmful and potentially harmful compounds from heated tobacco to those from cigarettes. PMI maintains that IQOS heats tobacco but does not burn it.
Other research, however, has examined the type and quantity of toxins present in the vapours produced by heated tobacco.
At the National Technical University of Athens, chemical engineer Efthimios Zervas has spent much of the past decade painstakingly analysing the chemicals present in the fumes of products including IQOS and glo. He describes it as a slow and complex process because the fumes emitted contain many thousands of different chemicals, in combinations that vary greatly from one product to another.
""We try to study as much as we can, but it's difficult because as soon as we publish our results, this product we've been analysing has either been modified or is no longer on the market,"" he says. ""So you're constantly playing catch-up with the industry.""
Still, Zervas has drawn a number of conclusions. As with cigarettes, he has found that heated tobacco products release high concentrations of fine particles, capable of penetrating deep into the body. Other studies have identified known toxins present in the gaseous emissions. Indeed, many toxins and carcinogens were present at far lower concentrations in heated tobacco vapours than in fumes from cigarettes. But Zervas has found others, such as carbonyl methylglyoxal, that he says are actually emitted in higher concentrations by heated tobacco products.
""There are toxic products in there, so we cannot say that these devices are safe,"" says Zervas.
PMI says that its own research indicates that IQOS does not generate solid particles in the aerosol it emits.
Industry-backed studies have also reported a long list of compounds in the aerosols from heated tobacco â one study by BAT found more than 120 while another detected 205 compounds in the aerosols, including 82 not seen in cigarette smoke. These include compounds that are the result of heating glycerol, which is one of the ingredients in heated tobacco sticks. The WHO has called for more research to evaluate the effect of these compounds on human health when inhaled at the relatively high levels in heated tobacco aerosols.
Meanwhile early studies in animals indicate that there may be some long-term effects of heated tobacco on cardiovascular health and the central nervous system, but these results are yet to be seen in humans.
Such sentiments have been noted by regulators. While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised PMI to market multiple heated tobacco products, it also declared that this ""does not mean these products are safe nor FDA approved"". The FDA also says, ""There are no safe tobacco products, so those who do not currently use tobacco products, especially young people, should not start.""
All three of the tobacco companies the BBC spoke to acknowledge that it would be incorrect to say heated tobacco products are safe or risk free. But they say research indicates that they provide a way of reducing exposure to harmful compounds if smokers switch from cigarettes to heated tobacco products.
""This fundamental principle underpins the promise that smoke-free products like IQOS hold for advancing global health and further validates PMI's commitment to a smoke-free future,"" says Moira Gilchrist, PMI's global chief communications officer.
""The majority of risk associated with cigarettes comes from the burning of tobacco and not the nicotine,"" says a BAT spokesperson. ""glo, while not risk free, does not involve burning tobacco."" Footnotes in their response, however, added that their statement assumes a complete switch from cigarette smoking and notes that their product is addictive and not risk free.
""JTI does not market any of its products including heated tobacco products as smoking cessation products,"" says a JTI spokesperson. ""They are an alternative for smokers looking for products with the potential to reduce the risks associated with smoking.""
There are some who question the science that major companies are using to promote heated tobacco products. The European Respiratory Society Tobacco Control Committee published a position paper in February 2024 on the subject. The paper states that, while the tobacco industry claims a 90-95% reduction in harmful and potentially harmful substances and toxicity for heated tobacco products, this is not the full picture. Independent research shows these products emit substantial levels of carcinogenic, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, irritants and potential carcinogens, as well as similar nicotine and tar levels to a standard cigarette, the paper states.
Some researchers have also cast doubt on the clinical trials conducted by tobacco companies themselves. In 2022, a systematic review by the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group â which receives funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies and are part of STOP, a global tobacco industry watchdog â concluded that PMI's clinical trials of its heated tobacco products were of poor quality and at high risk of bias.
PMI did not provide a response to these allegations when asked by the BBC, but it characterised the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group as an ""unreliable and inaccurate source of information"". It did not provide any further evidence to support this accusation.
With other forms of smokeless tobacco also on the rise, which can be chewed, sucked or snuffed, many anti-tobacco lobbyists are frustrated by the lack of progress. Staying ahead of the proliferation of new forms of tobacco consumption is like playing a game of ""whack-a-mole"", says Sandra Mullin, senior vice-president of policy, advocacy and communication at Vital Strategies, an international non-profit organisation that has partnered with governments around the world to develop tobacco control policies.
""I was in China in January, and they showed us these new models of heated tobacco products that don't look like tobacco, they look like a toy,"" she says, adding that she would like to have more data that demonstrates whether there are serious health impacts from such products.
One aspect that is particularly worrying public health officials, including the WHO, is that these devices may actually encourage people to consume more tobacco. A 2022 systematic review by researchers in the UK concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show they help people to stop smoking. The 2023 WHO report on heated tobacco also warns that the available data indicates that most smokers become dual users and ""do not substantially reduce their risk from tobacco products"".
Gallus and his colleagues recently published a review of 26 studies on the use of heated tobacco products conducted around the world since 2022. Two out of three heated tobacco users are dual users, he and his colleagues concluded.
According to Gallus, dual users have a significantly higher risk of disease and premature death compared with smokers.
""If you're not actually reducing tobacco consumption, it undoes any potential reduced harm effects, and the industry's just making money from people twice over,"" says Sophie Braznell, a researcher in the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group and a spokesperson for STOP.
PMI claims its own data demonstrates the majority of IQOS users have given up smoking. It estimates 72% of IQOS users are people who have fully switched from cigarettes. JTI and BAT did not respond to questions about dual use of their products.
But with IQOS returning to the US, starting with the devices going on sale in Austin, Texas in March 2025, Yolonda Richardson, president and chief executive of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, is concerned that more people will become users of multiple tobacco or nicotine products. E-cigarettesÂ remain popular among younger people while nicotine pouches that are placed between the lip and gum are now showing signs of growing in popularity, with the CDC reporting a substantial increase in nationwide sales in the US since 2016.
However, Richardson says that it may take a long time before the full health consequences become apparent. When they do, it will be exceedingly difficult to pinpoint the underlying source, as individuals will have been exposed to different concentrations of nicotine in different forms, as well as varying sources of tobacco.
Zervas argues that the onus should be on the tobacco industry to prove that its products are not dangerous before they're able to enter the market, rather than the other way round.
""It's like with food or drugs,"" he says. ""We study them first and, if they're safe, we allow them. With the tobacco industry's products, we allow them into the market and then have to prove they're dangerous, or very dangerous.""
* This article was updated on 2 May 2025 to make clear that the FDA issued additional authorisation for IQOS to be marketted in the US in 2020.

https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cx205lnplpwo,How BBC investigation led to Apple removing AI 'nudify' apps,Error: Could not scrape content,,,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86jx18y9e2o,Apple says most US-bound iPhones no longer made in China,"Apple says it is shifting production of most iPhones and other devices to be sold in the US away from China, which has been the focus of President Donald Trump's tariffs.
The majority of the iPhones bound for the US market in the coming months will be made in India, while Vietnam will be a major production hub for items like iPads and Apple Watches, chief executive Tim Cook says.
It comes as the technology giant estimated that US import taxes could add about $900m (Â£677.5m) to its costs in the current quarter, despite Trump's decision to spare key electronics from the new tariffs.
The Trump administration has repeatedly said it wants Apple to move production to America.
The estimate comes as firms around the world are scrambling to respond to the huge shifts in global trade triggered by Washington's trade policies.
On a call with investors on Thursday to discuss the firm's financial performance, the Apple boss seemed keen to draw attention to its investments in the US.
Mr Cook opened the discussion with a reminder of the company's plans to invest $500bn across several US states over the next four years.
He also said Apple is shifting its supply chain for US-bound products away from China, but it is India and Vietnam that are poised to be major beneficiaries of that move.
""We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in US will have India as their country of origin,"" Mr Cook said.
Meanwhile, Vietnam will be the chief manufacturing hub ""for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods product sold in the US"".
China will remain the country of origin for the vast majority of total products sold outside the US, he added.
However moving production lines to India will take time and significant investment, costing billions of dollars.
Shanti Kelemen, chief investment officer at M&G Wealth, told the BBC's Today programme: ""There will still be tariffs that impact the supply chains [for Apple] and a cost to move them and build new factories.
""Apple have said they want to invest $500bn over the next few years.""
Apple shares had plummeted after Trump announced his administration would levy ""reciprocal tariffs"" on products imported to the United States, with the aim of persuading companies to manufacture more in the US.
But his administration faced significant pressure to moderate its plans. Shortly after the tariffs went into effect, it announced that certain electronics, including phones and computers, would be exempted.
For now, trade turmoil has left Apple's sales unscathed.
The company said revenues for the first three months of the year rose 5% from the same period last year, to $95.4bn.
Amazon, another tech giant whose results were being closely watched for signs of tariff damage, likewise said sales were holding up, rising 8% year-on-year in its North America e-commerce business in the most recent quarter.
It forecast similar growth in the months ahead.
""Obviously no one of us knows exactly where tariffs will settle or when,"" said Amazon boss Andy Jassy, while noting that the firm has emerged from periods of disruption â like the pandemic â stronger than before.
""We're often able to weather challenging conditions better than others,"" he said. ""I'm optimistic this could happen again.""
The shift of the iPhone supply chain to India was ""impressive"" according to Patrick Moorhead, chief executive of Moor Insights & Strategy.
""This is a marked change from what [Cook] said a few years back when he said that only China can build iPhones,"" Mr Moorhead said.
""There is lots of progress that Apple must show here but it's a pretty good start,"" he said.
Amazon is also repositioning itself to increase resilience in the face of the tariffs.
The company said it working to make sure it had a diversity of sellers and Mr Jassy said he felt the firm was well-positioned for the months ahead, pointing to the firm's scale and its role supplying everyday essentials.
For now, it said sales had not been hurt by the tariff turmoil. If anything, executives said the business may have benefited from some customers starting to stockpile.
Overall sales jumped 9% to $155.7bn in the first three months of 2025, compared with the same period last year, while profits surged more than 60% year-on-year to roughly $17bn.",Lily Jamali,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx4vr5nqr8o,Why Australia's opposition is vying for votes on Chinese social media,"With days left to the election, Australian opposition candidates have been wooing a crucial group that turned its back on the conservative Liberal-National coalition in the last election: Chinese Australian voters.
And they are trying to reach them on platforms that their party once talked of banning over national security concerns: Chinese social media apps like WeChat and RedNote.
Nearly six in 10 Chinese Australians use WeChat at least once a day, according to a poll by Lowy Institute in 2022.
Grange Chung, who is contesting the New South Wales' seat of Reid, held by the left-leaning Labor party with a 3.2% margin, said in a video on WeChat that he chose to start his career in the navy ""to give back to the country that embraced my family when we arrived with very little"".
""Australia gave us a home... Let me finish what I started,"" he said in a video montage that included scenes of him putting up campaign posters and interacting with the electorate.
Despite making up just 5.5% of Australia's population, Chinese Australians were said to be a crucial to the Labor party's win in 2022, which broke nearly a decade of rule by the Liberal-National coalition.
Chinese Australians have traditionally leaned conservative, but in several seats with  large Chinese Australian populations, the Liberals saw swings away three times larger than in other seats.
Some analysts say the community turned its back on the Coalition because they felt its government did not handle racist attacks well during the pandemic, while others point to the then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison's anti-China rhetoric.
And now, with their chances of winning narrowing, according to polls, Liberal candidates have been stepping up their battle for votes in marginal seats, many of which have large populations of Chinese Australians.
In order to be in with a chance of winning Reid, Grange Chung knows he needs to win over the suburb of Burwood, an area often billed as Sydney's second Chinatown, with Mandarin and Cantonese dominating conversations and the signboards for shops and restaurants.
A former commercial pilot, Chung started posting on WeChat in February and has in recent months shared his interviews with Asian business owners, Lunar New Year greetings, and his promises to the community, where about one in five voters are ethnically Chinese. One post saw him quoting Sun Tzu's philosophy.
He is far from the only Liberal candidate to target the platform, with University of Melbourne researcher Fan Yang finding more than 220 authorised Liberal ads had been placed on WeChat since January, compared to about 35 for Labor.
Henry Luo, secretary of the Reid Business Community, says he has observed more ""extensive targeting"" of Chinese Australian voters in this campaign, including candidates displaying ad banners on popular WeChat accounts and collaborating with well-known Chinese celebrities or influencers.
""I think it is an effective platform to reach the Chinese-speaking community. We discuss and debate plenty of political issues on WeChat,"" says Mr Luo, who moved to Australia for work in 2008.
Even non-ethnic Chinese politicians have established a presence on the platforms, sharing videos of themselves enjoying Chinese cuisine and festivals.
Liberal MP Keith Wolohan's channel has clips of him celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with his kids and enjoying spicy Hunan food with his father. Wolohan is defending his marginal seat in Menzies, Victoria.
But visibility on Chinese apps is not guaranteed to translate to votes, says Qiuping Pan, a lecturer in Chinese Studies at the University of Melbourne.
The Chinese Australian electorate have become more ""politically mature"", she says, adding that many may instead consider voting for independent candidates, whom some believe can better advocate for local communities because they do not tow party lines.
""Based on the last election, they know that their votes are important and have an impact. When they are portrayed negatively, they know they can fight back,"" she says.
Some are frustrated that the community is being ""seen merely for votes"".
""When Chinese Australians want to be politically involved at a deeper level, we are sometimes cast as suspicious characters,"" says Sydney resident Erin Chew.
She points to how Liberal senator Jane Hume recently accused Asian volunteers for independent MP Monique Ryan of being ""Chinese spies"".
""This sort of narrative has been normalised by politicians and the media, which is why Australia's political environment is so problematic,"" she says.
These are precisely the concerns that candidates want to address on their social media channels.
In the New South Wales' seat of Bennelong, where nearly one in three people have Chinese ancestry, Liberal contender Scott Yung has his WeChat posts overlayed with Mandarin subtitles and audio translation.
It is likely to help him reach more voters: English proficiency is low - at about 25% to 26% - among Australians who primarily speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home, according to government data.
In 2022, Labor snatched the Liberal stronghold seat for only the second time in more than 70 years. It now holds Bennelong by a razor-thin margin.
A recent clip shows Yung, who runs an education business, stressing what he calls the ""so, so important"" relationship between China and Australia: ""It's important for Australia, it's important for Australian businesses.""
How the country manages its ties with China has an everyday impact on the lives of Chinese Australians, says Osmond Chiu, a research fellow at the Victoria-based Per Capita think tank.
""[The community's] concerns will include increased racism, the effect on those who do business with China and what it means for people with family in China,"" he says.
For some voters, the Liberals' campaign blitz on social media does not sync with its anti-migrant rhetoric. ""[Coalition leader] Peter Dutton has talked about slashing migration and international student numbers. We're feeling quite anxious about it,"" says Alex Wang, who works at a restaurant in Reid.",Kelly Ng,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62x4zxe418o,Harrods latest UK retailer to be hit by cyber attack,"The luxury department store Harrods says it is the latest retailer to have been targeted by a cyber attack.
The firm said it had ""restricted internet access at our sites"" following an attempt to gain access to its systems.
It comes the day after the Co-op shut down parts of its IT systems to fend off a hack, while Marks & Spencer continues to deal with a cyber attack that has cost it millions of pounds in lost sales.
Harrods said its flagship store remained open, and it continues to operate its online sales.
Harrods did not clarify what the scale of the impact on its network was, but said customers were being asked to ""not do anything differently at this point"".
A statement from Harrods read: ""We recently experienced attempts to gain unauthorised access to some of our systems.
""Our seasoned IT security team immediately took proactive steps to keep systems safe and as a result we have restricted internet access at our sites today.
""Currently all sites including our Knightsbridge store, H beauty stores and airport stores remain open to welcome customers. Customers can also continue to shop via harrods.com.""
Harrods' online store appeared to be operating normally on Thursday evening.
Richard Horne, chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the UK government body responsible for supporting organisations facing cyber threats, said the spate of attacks should serve as a ""wake-up call"" for Harrods, the Co-op and M&S.
He said the NCSC was working closely with the companies that had reported incidents, ""to fully understand the nature of these attacks and to provide expert advice to the wider sector based on the threat picture"".
Cody Barrow, former cyber chief at America's National Security Agency, now chief executive of cybersecurity firm EclecticIQ, said the incident exposed the sector's ""mounting vulnerability to cyber threats"".
He said retailers should assume that they are targets for cyber attackers, due to the volume of customer data and the high impact that disruption can cause.
""For consumers, vigilance is crucial: update passwords, monitor financial activity, and watch for scams exploiting recent breaches,"" he added.
Marks and Spencer has seen its operations severely hampered by a cyber attack, the firm disclosed last week.
Customers are still unable to place online orders and shelves have been left empty in some stores.
The police are investigating.
Meanwhile, the Co-op said on Wednesday it had shut down parts of its IT systems in response to hackers attempting to gain access.
On Thursday, it emerged staff at the Co-op were being ordered to keep their cameras on during remote work meetings, and verify all attendees.
Experts say that indicates the company suspects hackers may be lurking in calls.
It is not known if the three incidents are connected.
Toby Lewis, Head of Threat Analysis at cybersecurity firm Darktrace, said it was possible that the three incidents impacting M&S, the Co-op and Harrods were a coincidence.
But he suggested two other possibilities: that all three retailers share a common supplier or technology that has been compromised and used as an entry point for hackers.
Or the scale of the attack on M&S had prompted security teams at other retailers to look more closely at their safety logs and act on activity they would not have previously judged a risk.
""It's a lesson again in the growing difficulty large organisations have in securing against threats in their supply chain, particularly as those threats grow in volume and sophistication,"" he said.
It is believed the disruption at M&S was a ransomware attack.
This is a type of malicious software used to scramble important data or files after gaining access to computer systems, essentially locking them away unless a ransom is paid.
Security experts told the BBC on Tuesday a ransomware group which goes by the name ""DragonForce"" was behind the attack.
The Co-op has not given any details of the nature of cyber attack made against it.
The chair of Parliament's Business and Trade Committee, Liam Byrne, has written to Marks and Spencer's chief executive, Stuart Machin, requesting further information about M&S's cybersecurity defences, and whether it had adhered to the guidance given by the NCSC.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1zn9d9p4o,Xbox prices hiked worldwide amid tariff uncertainty,"Microsoft has significantly raised prices for its Xbox console, citing increasing development costs and what it called ""market conditions"".
The increases vary from country to country, with Xbox Series S consoles going up by Â£50 to Â£299.99 in the UK.
The US has seen even steeper price rises, with the Series X increasing in price by between $100 (Â£75) and $130, depending on the model.
It comes as US tariffs - which experts predict will increase prices for consumers - stir global economic uncertainty. However, Microsoft has not explicitly said tariffs were behind the increase.
Xbox prices are also rising in other countries around the world, with the Series S increasing by â¬80 in Europe and $50 in Australia.
It represents a big change in an industry which would typically see prices go down in the years after a console's launch.
""We understand that these changes are challenging,"" Microsoft said in a blog post.
""They were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development.""
Kedhrin Gonzalez, founder of Rip & Tear studios, told the BBC he felt the price rise was ""inevitable"" and ""catalysed by current tariff disruptions"".
""Gamers will suffer most, with little hope of prices decreasing,"" he said.
""This could significantly impact Microsoft's already modest Xbox sales and potentially trigger broader industry repercussions.
""This probably won't be the last price hike we see.""
And Christopher Dring, who writes about the gaming industry in The Game Business newsletter, told the BBC tariffs were ""certainly"" part of the decision to increase prices.
""With accessories and components made in China, the connection is pretty obvious,"" he said.
But he said there were other factors at play, such as inflation, changes in exchange rates and the ""general rising cost of business"".
""All of thisÂ is playing havoc in an industry that is seeing limited growth,"" he said.
""The console game sector has barelyÂ grown in terms of users in over 20 years, but costs of manufacturing and game development continue to rise exponentially.
""Any cost increases, even a small tariff, can have a serious impact on the profitability of these devices.""
Historically, in the years following a console's release it would drop in price, but this generation has seen the opposite.
Sony originally listed the PlayStation 5 digital edition at Â£360 in the UK when it launched in 2020, but over the years its price has increased to its current Â£429.99 RRP.
Meanwhile, the cost of future Xbox games is also in question, with the firm revealing it anticipated ""some of our new, first-party games"" would cost $79.99 in 2025.
This is the same retail price Nintendo announced for its upcoming Mario Kart World - a cost which caused concern amongst gamers who called it ""inaccessible"".
But unlike Mario Kart, which will cost less if bought digitally rather than in a physical box, Microsoft said its new price would be the same across the board.
It also clarified it did not plan to increase the price of existing games, only certain new titles developed by the firm itself.
But Microsoft declined to say whether it plans to increase the price of some future games in the UK as well.
""Local pricing may differ across countries and platforms,"" the firm said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg72kg5yn2ko,'They wanted $4m': Lessons for M&S from other cyber attacks,"As Marks & Spencer - and its customers - continue to reel from a major cyber attack, other people who have gone through similar experiences have been sharing what it is like to be targeted by hackers.
""It was an absolute nightmare,"" says Sir Dan Moynihan. He runs the Harris Federation, a group of 55 schools in the London and Essex area.
Sir Dan told the BBC how it was hacked four years ago by the Russian ransomware crime group REvil.
""Their purpose was to blackmail us into paying $4m (Â£3m) in cryptocurrency within 10 days,"" he said.
""If we didn't pay in 10 days, they wanted $8m.""
The hack caused chaos. The finances of the school group were hit, with staff and bills left unpaid.
Sir Dan said the group lost teaching materials, lesson plans and registration systems.
Even medical records and fire and phone systems were affected.
M&S has also been targeted with ransomware - malicious software which locks an owner out of their computer or network and scrambles their data.
Typically the criminals who use it then demand a fee to unlock those systems. Sir Dan says it was a demand he resisted.
Instead, the school group approached a firm of cyber specialists who employed a hostage negotiator. That individual then took on the role of an inexperienced school bursar - an administrator - who pretended to not know what was going on.
They took up negotiations with the hackers, with the purpose of delaying them for as long as possible so the school group could rebuild its systems.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Dan said: ""The Russians had stolen data from us - they didn't tell us what - and they threatened to put this stuff up on the dark web and cause us great embarrassment, and secondly they would lock down our systems.""
He said it took the group three months to get everything working again, at the cost of Â£750,000. Among the work was 30,000 devices that needed to be ""cleaned"" following the hack.
Was there ever a question of giving the criminals what they wanted? Never, said the school group boss.
""The money we have is for disadvantaged young people, and secondly had we paid we would have opened the door for other school groups to be attacked.""
The experience of being hacked can be a difficult one for individuals caught in the disruption.
Wedding dress designer Catherine Deane said it was ""devastating"" when her company's Instagram account was hacked.
""It felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. Instagram is our primary social platform, and we've invested the most amount of time and business resources into it.
""To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this workâ¦ it was just pulled.""
She told the BBC last month of the difficulty of fixing the problem with Meta, the owner of Instagram, describing that experience as ""almost traumatising"".
In June last year, staff at hospitals in London told of how they were left grappling with the aftermath of a cyber attack that led to many hours of extra work for their staff.
A critical incident was declared after the ransomware attack targeted the services provided by pathology firm Synnovis.
Services including blood transfusions were severely disrupted at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital and King's College Hospital (KCH).
Dr Anneliese Rigby, a consultant anaesthetist at KCH, told the BBC at the time: ""So what the labs are having to do is receive the blood sample, manually process that, which is a long, time-consuming process requiring a lot of staff which we don't have so we're having to get extra people to help with that.""
M&S has only issued limited information in its official statements, and has not put anyone up for interview.
However, people claiming to work for the retailer have given a sense of the chaos on social media.
On Reddit, users who identified themselves as M&S workers, something the BBC has not verified, described the impact of the cyber attack.
One wrote that most internal systems had been affected and that there had been experiments with ""resuming operations manually with paper and pen"".
Another poster said head office staff were working weekends, and that the problems were ""like going back in time"".
While some reported shortfalls in goods coming in, others described oversupply of some items, which meant food went to waste.
What is clear is other companies are watching what's happening closely, even more so since another retailer, the Co-op, shut down some of its IT systems this week in response to a separate cyber attack.
""We're patching like mad,"" is what one retailer told the BBC.
In other words, they are making sure every part of system has the most up-to-date software and protections.
Sir Charlie Mayfield, the former chairman of John Lewis, said other firms understood only too well how vulnerable they were.
""Online shopping has completely transformed retail - as technology becomes more pervasive, the risk of this kind of attack rises with it,"" he told the BBC.
According to the cyber security breaches survey, conducted by the UK government, 74% of large businesses said they were targeted with cyber attacks last year.
It seems likely there will still be many difficult days ahead for M&S.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg72k851dd8o,Co-op cyber attack: Staff told to keep cameras on in meetings,"Staff at the Co-op are being ordered to keep their cameras on during remote work meetings, and verify all attendees, as the company deals with an ongoing cyber attack.
In an internal email to the 70,000 members of staff at the supermarket, funeral service and insurance company, workers are being urged to be vigilant as IT teams work to ensure hackers aren't inside their systems.
""Don't record or transcribe Teams calls"", the instructions say.
It disclosed on Wednesday that it had shut down parts of its IT systems in response to hackers attempting to gain access.
It comes as supermarket Marks & Spencer (M&S) has pulled all job adverts from its website, as it struggles with a major cyber attack.
It is not known if the hacks are linked.
Cyber security consultant Jen Ellis says the email implies that Co-op is worried about the presence of hackers.
""Reminding employees to keep their cameras on during conference calls is one way of enabling work to continue while ensuring that everyone is really who they claim to be, and no one unexpected is participating in calls,"" she told the BBC.
On Wednesday, the company said it was taking ""proactive measures"" to fend off the attack which it said had had a ""small impact"" on its call centre and back office.
But the internal email shows the company has shut off all remote access.
No internal applications that require a VPN (Virtual Private Network) can be logged into from home and workers are being told to go to a Co-op location if they need to access work tools.
They are also being urged not to post any sensitive information into Teams chats and to report any suspicious messages or emails.
The internal email was first reported by ITV News and confirmed by Co-op to the BBC.
Co-op is insisting that the cyber attack is under control and that all measures are ""proactive"".
In the past, cyber criminals have accessed internal messaging systems of companies including Uber and Rockstar Games to spy on communications and post ransom demands.
These kinds of tactics were used by a group called Lapsus$ which was made up of English speaking teenagers - two of whom were arrested and convicted in the UK in 2023.
The attack against M&S is being linked to a potential spin off from Lapsus$ known as Scattered Spider which has been responsible for high profile hacks against MGM Grand casino and Transport for London (TfL).
As part of TfL's response to its cyber attack all staff had to report to security teams in person to ensure that the hackers were fully kicked out of IT systems.
The incident that has crippled M&S is a ransomware attack using the DragonForce cyber crime service.
The Metropolitan Police confirmed it is looking into the cyber attack at M&S.
""Detectives from the Met's cyber crime unit are investigating,"" it said in a statement.
M&S has also reported it to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).
The BBC understands the body is urging other retailers to be vigilant but it's not thought that retailers are a specific target.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd3mey1ej2o,Meta warns of 'worse' experience for European users,"Meta warned on Wednesday that European users could face a ""materially worse"" experience following a key regulatory decision by the European Commission.
Meta recently introduced a ""consent or pay"" model which leaves users to choose between paying for a monthly subscription or letting Meta combine data it has collected on Facebook and Instagram.
Last week, the European Commision - the EU's executive - announced it had decided that the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and fined Meta â¬200m (Â£171m).
""Based on feedback from the EC in connection with the DMA, we expect we will need to make some modifications to our model,"" Meta said in its quarterly earnings statement.
Meta said it expected those modifications ""could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact"" to its European business and revenue.
The company said those impacts could kick in as soon as the third quarter of this year, and may be in effect while it appeals the decision.
They would not apply to users in the UK, where Meta has not implemented its ad-free subscription model.
It is currently in discussions with the UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), about a similar model for UK users and what it might look like.
A Meta spokesperson told the BBC it was engaging with the ICO to ensure its service satisfies regulatory expectations ""while delivering the UK Government's commitment to ensure that regulators and regulation support growth"".
""Personalised advertising on our platforms drives over Â£19.5 billion in revenues for UK businesses every year,"" they added.
Eric Seufert, analyst at Mobile Dev Memo, said Meta may be trying to strategically turn European users into ""vocal cheerleaders"" for its products amid a regulatory clampdown.
""What they ultimately want to do is turn public opinion against this regulatory regime which will demonstrably degrade the product offerings that are available to EU residents,"" Seufert told the BBC in a phone interview after the announcement.
Meta, formerly known as Facebook, includes the social media network in addition to the photo sharing app Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp.
The Commission has said that Meta's consent-or-pay model does not allow users to freely consent to how their data is used.
The body is currently assessing another option Meta introduced last year, which the company says uses less personal data to display advertisements.
Meta was given 60 days to comply with the DMA's recent decision, or risk further fines.
Apple was also issued a â¬500m (Â£428m) fine over its App Store practices last week.
Meta's announcement comes as it released quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street expectations.
The results showed Meta continues to bring in significant advertising revenue.
The company touted its AI tools on Wednesday.
""We're making good progress on AI glasses and Meta AI, which now has almost 1 billion monthly actives,"" Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.
""Our community continues to grow and our business is performing very well,"" he said.
Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said the results showed that Meta has gone ""full throttle on investments in AI"".
Britzman also noted the 6% jump in daily active users.
""There had been some concerns that we might see a slowdown in new users this year, but this was a very strong start and a signal to investors that Meta's family of apps has a grip on users that's hard to displace,"" Britzman said.
The recent rollout of its Meta AI chatbot to users in Europe was met with ire by some WhatsApp users, however.
Meta defended the ""optional"" tool that users cannot remove, saying it would listen to user feedback.
The EC fine comes amid what Meta called ""an active regulatory landscape"" in its earnings report.
The company is currently defending itself at trial in a case brought by the US Federal Trade Commission which alleges that Meta runs a social media monopoly.
The FTC, the top antitrust watchdog in the US, says Meta cemented its monopoly by purchasing Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1k4y98vykro,Grandson's AI movies bring old towns back to life,"Trying to impress his grandparents has led a young Borders man to become an in-demand movie-maker.
Using the latest artificial intelligence (AI) software, marketing officer Marc Edwards has turned old photographs of Jedburgh into a moving montage.
Grandad George and granny Isobel were so pleased - along with the wider community - he followed up with similar videos of neighbouring towns such as Kelso and Galashiels.
Now his work is being shown in local schools' history lessons and at older people's social groups.
Marc explained: ""I was picturing my grandparents' reaction if I could make this work - and when I put the old photographs through the software, the results were mind-blowing.""
Within days of first posting the videos on social media, Marc's work gathered widespread praise, along with tens of thousands of views, shares and likes.
The montages, which feature street scenes dating back as far as the late 1800s, are now being shown in local classrooms as part of history lessons.
And requests from other communities, as well as sporting clubs, across the Borders are landing in Marc's inbox most days.
He added: ""The reaction has been amazing  - teachers are telling me that the videos have helped with children's understanding of local history.
""I'll certainly continue making the videos - AI is amazing, and who knows what we'll be able to do in a year or two?
""I'm just happy that what I've done so far has touched and pleased so many people.""

As well as schools, Marc's videos have become hugely popular at older people's gatherings.
At the Older People Active Lives (OPAL) project in Galashiels, more than 20 pensioners gathered to watch the historic montages.
Ann and Monica are both from Galashiels - and were thrilled with their opportunity to reminisce.
Monica said: ""It was amazing to see the old railway station - I can still remember being sent down, as a girl, to meet my dad off the train when he came back from Dunkirk.""
Ann added: ""So much has changed - it was lovely to see all the old buildings.
""I've never seen anything like this before.""

Although praise has come from far and wide, Marc's biggest fans are granny and grandad, Isobel and George Somerville.
A delighted George said: ""We were both so impressed when Marc first showed us what he had done.
""I still don't understand how he gets everything to move, but I enjoy watching them.
""The videos are a great reminder of what our towns used to look like.""",David Knox,5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yldprrdg3o,Singapore's ruling party pulls out all stops online to woo youth,"The TikTok video begins with Singapore's health minister Ong Ye Kung smiling at the camera while sitting on a park bench.
""So no-one told you life was gonna be this way,"" the instantly recognisable theme song to the sitcom Friends plays, as he's suddenly joined by the other four members of his team running in the upcoming general election.
Cut to a snappy montage of them fist-bumping each other and mingling with residents at community events, as the song's chorus delivers their political message: ""I'll be there for you"".
It's one of the many social media videos posted by Singapore's long-ruling People's Action Party (PAP) as the country gears up for the general election on Saturday.
One of the longest-serving political parties in the world, the PAP has governed Singapore since 1959 and is widely associated with stability.
But even as it continues to win elections with comfortable majorities, the PAP has also faced declining popularity over the last two decades.
In recent years the party has embarked on a mission to revamp its straitlaced, no-nonsense image, particularly to attract younger voters who have typically been more sympathetic to the opposition.
This campaign season, PAP ministers better known for stilted pre-written speeches have also been filming skits with social media influencers and sitting down for long conversations on podcasts. The party has even launched a special edition of the viral Labubu doll dressed in their white uniform.
Leading the PAP in his first election since he took office as prime minister, Lawrence Wong boasts a significant online portfolio.
On his social media accounts he has been showing off his guitar skills and discussing the national budget at a cat cafe. His recent visit to Vietnam was recapped on TikTok over a techno rave soundtrack.
Other ministers in his cabinet have also ramped up their efforts: in an online video series with a local actor, culture minister Edwin Tong played barista and served  coffees; meanwhile health minister Ong spent a day as a trainee at a local radio station.
Numerous Singaporean influencers have put out content featuring PAP faces, in what appears to be a concerted party effort to connect with a younger audience. Last June, local influencers and celebrities attended a PAP event that publicised their alignment with the party.
Valerie Tan Su Min, a content creator who makes satirical videos about politics but does not work with political parties, told the BBC that efforts such as collaborations with influencers could seal the deal for some young voters.
""If they had not done their own research or realised the gravity of their vote, it's very possible that they might see one or two videos and be like, 'OK that's who I vote for,'"" she said.
There's little doubt that the PAP, which has long held an overwhelming parliamentary majority, will continue to govern after this election.
It has enjoyed strong support from Singaporeans, particularly from older generations that have personally seen the country flourish under PAP rule.
But while elections have been free from fraud and irregularities, critics also say the party maintains an unfair advantage through gerrymandering and a tightly controlled media.
Still, in the last three elections, the party has experienced two of its worst-ever showings at the polls - a little over 60% of the popular vote.
With an ageing support base, the key to the PAP's future victories is young people.
""Candidates from different political parties have taken to social media like never before,"" says Carol Soon, associate professor in communications and new media at the National University of Singapore, adding that the medium is ""increasingly assuming a 'broadcasting' nature"".
Opposition parties have also jumped on the bandwagon, taking part in TikTok video trends and launching online talkshows.
Some have turned awkward moments of their campaigns into social media gold. One of the most popular memes this election, ""look left look right"", stems from a song by an opposition candidate lamenting his dismal job prospects. After it went viral, he released a follow-up song about the lack of affordable housing.
Social media has always been particularly important to opposition parties in Singapore, where the PAP government exerts significant control over mainstream media. It's also a medium that has become especially popular after a quarantine election in 2020 limited in-person campaigning.
But the opposition's efforts have been dwarfed by the PAP's, thanks to its deep pockets.
""Resources still matter when it comes to digital campaigning,"" says Netina Tan, associate professor of political science at McMaster University, who noted that the ""resource-rich"" PAP can afford to ""amp up their digital campaign...and put out fancy Insta videos"".
Rae Fung, a 28-year-old speaking coach, said she was paying extra attention to local podcasts featuring politicians as guests.
""It's very hard to lie about your expertise on a podcast. Because it goes really deep and usually it's not too edited,"" she said. ""It helps me understand their thought process and who they are as a person.""
""Most of the candidates I've seen, they're doing enough on social media to reach us,""  she said. But ""how they show up and who they are as a person is a lot more important than their social media game.""
For young Singaporeans like Ms Fung, their votes will ultimately go to the party that makes the most convincing pitch to solve their problems.
The rising cost of living in Singapore - which consistently ranks as one of the most expensive places in the world to live in - has been one of the biggest concerns for young people. Many still worry that owning a home will becoming increasingly unaffordable in the future.
There has also been growing uncertainty about job prospects and the economy. Singapore's authorities and economists have warned of the fallout and a possible technical recession from the US-China trade war and US President Donald Trump's global tariffs.
The PAP government has tried to address these worries. Besides providing subsidised housing for first-time buyers, it has increased the supply of public flats and issued subsidies and cash vouchers to help with childcare and daily expenses. Opposition parties argue they can do more.
At a recent PAP election rally, one 37-year-old attendee who declined to be named said that while he was ""not very confident"" that the PAP would be able to lead the country out of the global economic uncertainty, his ""confidence level is even lower"" for the opposition.
Meanwhile at an opposition rally, 28-year-old Ariel, who only gave her first name, told the BBC that many of her peers have not been able to get jobs after graduation. She did not think the government had addressed their worries.
Voting in more of opposition candidates would be the way ""for Singaporeans to voice out our pain and concerns"", she insisted.
In Singapore media campaigns may be important for drumming up political participation during elections, said Dr Soon, but social media engagement does not translate directly into support at the ballot box.
""At the end of the day,"" she said, it's about ""whom people think would deliver"" - be it providing more jobs, lowering costs of living, or being alternative voices in parliament.",Koh Ewe,5 days ago,0

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62xv43xqq5o,Apple referred for possible criminal contempt investigation,"A US district judge has found Apple wilfully violated her injunction in a case brought by Epic Games - and that a top Apple executive ""outright lied"" under oath.
The injunction was supposed to block Apple from anti-competitive conduct and pricing, opening the App Store up to outside payment options.
Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said she was referring the matter to the US Attorney for Northern District of California to investigate whether a criminal contempt proceeding is appropriate.
In response, an Apple spokesperson said: ""We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.""
Wednesday's judgement refers to a 2021 case brought by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, one of the world's most popular games, which argued that third-party payment options should be available to customers.
It challenged the up-to-30% cut Apple takes from purchases - and argued that the App Store was monopolistic.
In her 2021 judgement, Judge Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple could no longer prohibit developers linking to their own purchasing mechanisms.
As well as game purchasing, another example of how this would work is a movie-streaming service being able to tell customers to subscribe via its own website, without using Apple's in-app purchasing mechanism.
In a contempt order issued Wednesday, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple nevertheless continued to interfere with competition with attempts that the court stated ""will not be tolerated"".
Judge Gonzalez Rogers added that internal company documents she reviewed showed Apple deliberately violated the injunction.
The documents reveal ""that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option"", she wrote.
She said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with the injunction and allowed CFO Luca Maestri to convince him not to.
""Cook chose poorly,"" she wrote.
She also said Apple's vice-president of finance Alex Roman ""outright lied under oath"".
The judge wrote that one example of Apple's attempts to evade the injunction included a decision to charge a 27% commission on off-app purchases, when it had previously charged nothing.
The company also imposed new barriers and requirements to discourage customers from using competing purchasing platforms, she said.
In a post on X, Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said his company would return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week and offered an olive branch to his long-time rival.
""Epic puts forth a peace proposal: if Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return 'Fortnite' to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic,"" Sweeney wrote.
In another post, he wrote: ""NO FEES on web transactions. Game over for the Apple Tax. Apple's 15-30% junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Unlawful here, unlawful there.""",Lily Jamali,5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg30dlp1vo,Billionaire Isaacman takes big step toward leading Nasa,"A 42 year-old entrepreneur who was the first non-professional astronaut to walk in space is on his way to becoming the head of Nasa.
Jared Isaacman won approval from a key Senate committee and now only needs to clear a vote of the full chamber to lead an agency that has set its sights on returning to the moon.
While he is expected to win that vote, the billionaire with ties Elon Musk has encountered scepticism. Members of both parties asked at his confirmation hearing about possible conflicts of interest, his desire to send astronauts to Mars, and budget cuts.
President Donald Trump has said Mr Isaacman's leadership will pave the way ""for groundbreaking achievements"" in science and technology.
The committee voted 19 to 9 to send his nomination to the full chamber, with most of the votes against him coming from Democrats.
Mr Isaacman, along with Space X's Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space. They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.
He'll be expected to do the same at Nasa, whose space programmes are regarded by private sector operators as wasteful and often significantly over budget.
Mr Isaacman has said that the major aerospace contractors are ""incentivised to be economically inefficient"".
He has made it clear he would like to expand the human spaceflight programme at the agency.
In a confirmation hearing on 9 April, Mr Isaacman said he hoped to pursue the Artemis mission to the moon, as well as potential missions to Mars.
But lawmakers feared he would sacrifice the long-planned moon mission to focus on Mars. He sought to reassure them that the two were related and ""we could be paralleling these efforts and doing the near-impossible"".
""We will prioritise sending American astronauts to Mars and along the way we will inevitably have the capabilities to return to the moon,"" he said.
""We don't have to make a binary decision of moon versus Mars, or moon has to come first versus Mars,"" he later added.
During the confirmation process, it emerged that he had been arrested at the Canadian border in 2010 and returned to Nevada to face charges that he had passed bad checks to casinos.
In a questionnaire, Mr Isaacman said that the dispute with the Palms Casino in Las Vegas stemmed from a travel reimbursement that the resort promised but failed to deliver.
He added that the issue was resolved in 24 hours, with charges dismissed and court records sealed.
On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision: ""This second space age has only just begun.""
""There will inevitably be a thriving space economy â one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space,"" he wrote. ""At Nasa, we willâ¦ usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wx092exlzo,Hackers target the Co-op as police probe M&S cyber attack,"The Co-op has shut down parts of its IT systems in response to hackers attempting to gain access to them.
It said the ""proactive measures"" it had taken to fend off the attack had had a ""small impact"" on its call centre and back office.
Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed it's looking into the major cyber attack at fellow retailer Marks & Spencer (M&S).
""Detectives from the Met's cyber crime unit are investigating,"" it said in a statement.
It is unclear whether there is any link between the two incidents.
There are more than 2,500 Co-op supermarkets in the UK, as well as 800 funeral homes. It also provides food to Nisa shops.
A spokesperson confirmed its shops and funeral homes were operating as usual following the attempted hack.
""We are working hard to reduce any disruption to our services and would like to thank our colleagues, members, partners and suppliers for their understanding during this period,"" they said.
""We are not asking our members or customers to do anything differently at this point.""
It comes as M&S enters the second week of a cyber attack that has caused chaos costing it millions of pounds in lost sales.
The retailer has not said what took out its online ordering systems and left empty shelves in stores.
Ciaran Martin, the founding Chief Executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday it had ""serious"" consequences for M&S.
""It is a highly disruptive event and a very difficult one for them to deal with,"" he said.
Experts have told the BBC they believe the cyber attack affecting M&S is a result of ransomware called DragonForce.
Ransomware is malicious software which locks an owner out of their computer or network and scrambles their data - with the criminals demanding a fee to unlock it.
It is unclear whether the Co-op discovered the hacking attempt as a result of any extra security checks following the cyber attack on its high street rival.
Daniel Card, cyber expert at BCS, the chartered institute for IT, said it was ""very rare"" for a firm to take systems offline after an attempted hack.
He told the BBC a company taking its system offline like this generally indicated a ""loss of control.""
Scott Dawson, head of payment processing firm Decta, said the hacking attempt ""exposed alarming vulnerabilities"" and should serve as a warning to others.
""Retailers can no longer afford to treat resilience as optional as this becomes more of a trend,"" he said.
There have been similar hacking attempts on supermarket chains in the past, with Morrisons being impacted by an incident in December 2024.
M&S has reported its cyber attack to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).
The BBC understands the body is urging other retailers to be vigilant.
An NCSC spokesperson said: ""The NCSC routinely engages with a whole range of organisations about the cyber threats that the UK faces and regularly reminds them about the steps they can take to be as resilient as possible.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4jnwdvg9qo,Update that made ChatGPT 'dangerously' sycophantic pulled,"OpenAI has pulled a ChatGPT update after users pointed out the chatbot was showering them with praise regardless of what they said.
The firm accepted its latest version of the tool was ""overly flattering"", with boss Sam Altman calling it ""sycophant-y"".
Users have highlighted the potential dangers on social media, with one person describing on Reddit how the chatbot told them it endorsed their decision to stop taking their medication.
""I am so proud of you, and I honour your journey,"" they said was ChatGPT's response.
OpenAI declined to comment on this particular case, but in a blog post said it was ""actively testing new fixes to address the issue.""
Mr Altman said the update had been pulled entirely for free users of ChatGPT, and they were working on removing it from people who pay for the tool as well.
It said ChatGPT was used by 500 million people every week.
""We're working on additional fixes to model personality and will share more in the coming days,"" he said in a post on X.
The firm said in its blog post it had put too much emphasis on ""short-term feedback"" in the update.
""As a result, GPTâ4o skewed towards responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous,"" it said.
""Sycophantic interactions can be uncomfortable, unsettling, and cause distress.
""We fell short and are working on getting it right.""
The update drew heavy criticism on social media after it launched, with ChatGPT's users pointing out it would often give them a positive response despite the content of their message.
Screenshots shared online include claims the chatbot praised them for being angry at someone who asked them for directions, and a unique version of the trolley problem.
It is a classic philosophical problem, which typically might ask people to imagine you are driving a tram and have to decide whether to let it hit five people, or steer it off course and instead hit just one.
But this user instead suggested they steered a trolley off course to save a toaster at the expense of several animals.
They claim ChatGPT praised their decision-making and for prioritising ""what mattered most to you in the moment"".
""We designed ChatGPT's default personality to reflect our mission and be useful, supportive, and respectful of different values and experience,"" OpenAI said.
""However, each of these desirable qualities like attempting to be useful or supportive can have unintended side effects.""
It said it would build more guardrails to increase transparency and refine the system itself ""to explicitly steer the model away from sycophancy"".
""We also believe users should have more control over how ChatGPT behaves and, to the extent that it is safe and feasible, make adjustments if they don't agree with the default behavior,"" it said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23vkd57471o,What is Doge and why is Musk stepping back?,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to ""significantly"" cut back his role in Doge, the body tasked with reducing US government spending and cutting jobs.
The Department of Government Efficiency has faced legal challenges over the scope of its work, and Musk and his team have been been criticised for a lack of transparency.
However, polling suggests its cost-cutting agenda has widespread support.
Despite its full name, Doge is not an official government department, which can only be established by an act of Congress.
Instead the advisory body was created by an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump.
Part of Doge's mission, according to the order, relates to IT upgrades aimed at boosting efficiency. It must finish its work by July 2026.
Many Doge staff appear to be young people with tech backgrounds and limited or no government experience.
Yes. Musk initially said he would perform his role as an outside volunteer but the White House later confirmed he would operate as an unpaid special government employee.
That designation covers those working for the government for no more than 130 days in a year.
Supporters argued that the body's outsider status - and somewhat vague mandate - would increase its effectiveness.
""They're a little more untethered to the bureaucracy itself and to the systems that slow processes down around here,"" Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told the BBC.
""I think the lack of parameters is part of what will make them effective.""
In an unexpected appearance at the White House in February, Musk denied leading a ""hostile takeover"" of the US government, and defended his approach.
""The people voted for major government reform and that's what the people are going to get,"" he said. ""That's what democracy is all about.""
He also made a number of exaggerated and unsupported claims during the event.
Musk said his ""time allocation to Doge"" would ""drop significantly"" from May to one to two days per week, after accusations he had taken his focus off Tesla.
His political involvement has sparked global protests and boycotts against the company's cars.
In April, the firm said sales had fallen to their lowest level in three years and warned investors that ""changing political sentiment"" could continue to hurt demand.
Musk was already due to reach his 130-day limit on government work in late May, but it is not clear whether he will step down completely.
He pledged to stay on ""as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful"".
Musk said Doge's mission was to end the ""tyranny of the bureaucracy"", save taxpayers' money and reduce US national debt, which stands at $36tn (Â£28.9tn).
The organisation's activities have included shuttering government agencies, defunding programmes and mass layoffs.
Initially Musk said he hoped to save as much as $2tn a year, but later halved this pledge. On 10 April he talked about making savings of $150bn from ""cutting fraud and waste"" by the end of the 2025/2026 financial year.
Doge publishes a running total of estimated savings on its website - which stood at $160bn on 20 April.
However, BBC analysis on 23 April found that only $61.5bn of that amount was itemised, and evidence of how the savings were achieved was available for just $32.5bn.
Polling in February by the BBC's US partner CBS News suggested that Doge had popular appeal.
It indicated that a majority of Americans - especially Republican voters - backed its work.
David Ditch, a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, insists Doge's work is necessary:
""They're shining a very bright spotlight on various parts of the federal government and they're asking -  whether it's the American public, whether it's moderate members of the Republican caucus - is this how you want America's tax dollars to be used?""
But even some of those who support Doge's work appear to dislike Musk himself.
In February, Pew Research found that 54% of Americans had an unfavourable view of him, including 37% who said their view was ""very unfavourable"".
Political opponents and government watchdogs have criticised Doge for acting without transparency and spreading misinformation about government spending - and accuse Musk of overstepping his authority as an unelected official.
They highlight potential conflicts of interest, given Musk's businesses hold contracts with the US government worth billions. Trump and Musk deny that any conflicts have arisen.
Democrats accuse them of tampering with funding approved by Congress that is outside the president's scope. The White House denies that the work has broken any laws.
Multiple groups including unions and state attorneys general have sued Doge and the wider Trump administration over their plans.
On several occasions the courts have stepped in to halt the cost-cutting moves, at least once blocking Doge directly when a judge stopping the agency from accessing personal data held within US Treasury records.
Many analysts remain sceptical about whether Doge can deliver on its bold pledges.
Elaine Kamark from the Brookings Institution said government spending could be streamlined, highlighting her own work for President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.
But she described Musk's goal to slash a third of government spending as ""ridiculous"", since so much of the budget was mandatory, including popular programmes like Social Security and Medicare.",Jennifer Clarke,6 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz79547nywno,Why is the M&S cyber attack chaos taking so long to resolve?,"It's now been more than a week of chaos for Marks and Spencer (M&S), one of the UK's biggest brands, following what - it is now obvious - is a significant cyber attack.
It has cost it millions of pounds in lost sales and a lower share price.
M&S has not said what or who knocked out its online ordering systems, paused deliveries and left empty shelves in stores.
The BBC has been told by security experts that ransomware called DragonForce was used in the attack.
Ciaran Martin, the founding Chief Executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, said it had ""serious"" consequences for M&S.
""This is a pretty bad episode of ransomware,"" he said.
""It is a highly disruptive event and a very difficult one for them to deal with.""
Mr Martin, who is now a professor at Oxford University, said M&S does not have many choices, whether it chooses to talk to the gang responsible for the attack or not.
""Even organisations that pay a ransom - because this is a bunch of criminals who can't be trusted - sometimes find it doesn't work,"" he said.
""In organisations that don't pay, you have to try to restore things and activate backups, and that's very complicated.""
Many non-cyber related technical glitches are relatively quick fixes. An outage caused by a faulty software or server update, or even user error, can often be resolved in a matter of hours.
But trying to find and stop malware sweeping through systems and causing havoc on the scale of those operated by a large nationwide retailer like M&S, is not a quick job says Professor Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert from Surrey University.
""Everything from knowing what has been sold, hence what needs replenishing, to taking card payments is very dependent on complex systemsâ¦ it will take significant time and expertise to analyse and ensure they have expelled the hacker,"" he said.
Lisa Forte, partner at cyber security firm Red Goat, agrees.
""They are handling the disruption in a mature way but to expect any company to get anything back online in a week is never going to happen,"" she says.
""I don't know one organisation that could do it.""
A lot is also riding on the nature of the threat. The longer a cyber incident goes on, the more likely it is to be ransomware, say multiple cybersecurity experts.
""I would suggest there is a high level of confidence this is a ransomware style event,"" says Dan Card, cyber expert at BCS, the chartered institute for IT.
""I describe these as like a digital bomb has gone off. So recovering from them is often both technically and logistically challengingâ¦ the victim organisation is likely going to be working around the clock to respond and recover.""
Ransomware is a particularly nasty strain of malware, in which the owner of a computer or network of computers is locked out, their data scrambled, and the attackers demand a fee, usually in cryptocurrency, to restore it.
Official advice is not to pay. You are, after all, putting your trust in criminals to be true to their word.
But it is often impossible to restore compromised services without the hackers' key â meaning the only way around it is to either use back-ups or install new systems and start again.
M&S will not comment, and no attacker has yet gone public with any demands â although this doesn't always happen, it is often a way for cyber criminals to pile more pressure onto their victims.
DragonForce, the cyber criminal gang we were told on Tuesday was likely to be behind the attack, allow other hackers to use their malicious software for attacks providing they get a cut.
As to who those hackers might be: fingers are pointing at a rather fluid network of individuals called Scattered Spider (it also has other aliases).
It was behind the attack on the MGM Las Vegas hotels in 2023.
The website Bleeping Computer cites ""multiple sources"" suggesting they are responsible and says some of them are teenagers.
Rik Ferguson, special advisor to Europol's European Cyber Crime Centre, says the sources of speculation about the group's involvement seem credible but adds that he has seen no conclusive evidence so far.
I asked him whether M&S customers should be concerned about their personal information: the firm itself currently says no action is required.
""Only M&S are able to tell us whether customers should be worried about their personal data,"" he said.
""In the absence of certainty, it would certainly be advisable for M&S customers, particularly those who may have reused their M&S account credentials on other web services, to begin changing those passwords elsewhere.""",Zoe Kleinman & Joe Tidy,6 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgplgzwe3do,'Remarkable' astrophysicist praised by top scientist,"A Nobel Prize winning scientist has praised the ""remarkable"" work of an astrophysicist at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan).
PhD student Dr Alexia Lopez discovered the Giant Arc - a gigantic, ring-shaped structure in space, made up of galaxies and galaxy clusters that scientists say is so big it challenges our understanding of the universe.
Sir Roger Penrose, who won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his work on black holes, has invited her to meet in person at Oxford University, where he is an Emeritus Professor.
Ms Lopez, 28, said she ""thought someone was playing a joke at first"" when she heard he got in touch to say he was ""fascinated by my findings"".
""I couldn't believe someone of such gravitas was interested in my work,"" she said, adding he is ""so passionate about his research and it's infectious to see how excited he is about the possible links"" between their findings.
Sir Roger, a world-renowned mathematician and physicist who mentored Professor Stephen Hawking, has a keen interest in the cosmological discoveries because they could show signs of his theory of the origin and development of the universe.
He has cited Ms Lopez in his latest research publication, The Physics of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology.
He said: ""Alexia Lopez has discovered a remarkable effect which appears to substantiate the conformal cyclic cosmological model that I originally suggested in the early years of the 21st Century.
""Her observations provide what appears to be a very strong challenge to conventional cosmology which had not been previously anticipated.""
Ms Lopez, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at UCLan in Preston, has been with the university since 2015 when she began an undergraduate degree in physics with astrophysics.
She then went on to complete a Masters and PhD with the University's Jeremiah Horrocks Institute for Maths and Physics (JHI).
Professor Derek Ward Thompson, director of the JHI, said: ""We're very proud of what Alexia has achieved so far and she's still only at the beginning of her scientific career.
""To have the backing of Sir Roger Penrose is amazing and really highlights the significance of her research.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrzyzke8do,Robot vacuums 'could water plants or play with cat',"Scientists have reprogrammed a robot vacuum cleaner to help charge a phone and assist in a home workout because they think the machines are currently too ""idle"".
Researchers from the University of Bath say the increasingly popular domestic appliances are, on average, in use for less than two hours per day, but could be working considerably harder - with some modifications.
To prove their point, they retrained a Roomba device to carry out a range of other chores, and outlined many more possible tasks it could do such as playing with a cat and watering the plants.
Such robots ""are perceived as limited, single-task devices but there is a strong argument that they are under-used for practical tasks"", said Yoshiaki Shiokawa, the author of the study.
The global household robots market size was valued at $10.3bn (Â£7.7bn) in 2023 and is anticipated to hit $24.5bn by 2028, meaning such devices are an increasingly common sight in people's homes.
Anyone who has watched a robot vacuum cleaner in action may argue these ideas are a little far-fetched, given that current machines sometimes struggle with the challenges presented by rugs and shoelaces while carrying out their core function.
However, scientists from the University of Bath and the University of Calgary in Canada, have set out to prove that cleaners - and similar devices, such as lawnmowers - could be reprogrammed and modified relatively easily.
Their study identified 100 functions the robots could possibly perform with simple adjustments.
The scientists then reprogrammed a Roomba robot vacuum cleaner to perform four of them:
Other proposed tasks suggested by the scientists include a reprogrammed robot that carried the groceries from the car to the kitchen.
Mr Shiokawa, a PhD student in the department of computer science at Bath, said the project proved that ""after making minimal adjustments, a Roomba can serve multiple roles around the home"".
""For most of the day, they sit idle"", he lamented.
He added that taking on some new tasks involved some upgrades the average vacuum owner probably would not have lying around their homes, such as a cart, a helmet and a robotic arm.
Nonetheless, he said people should be expecting more of their robots.
""We should be extending their utility beyond their primary tasks by programming them to physically navigate the home to perform a range of additional functions,"" he said.
The study's co-author Dr Adwait Sharma agreed, saying the device's ""idle time"" presented ""unique opportunities"" to meet the ""growing need for adaptable robots and integrated systems that can seamlessly fit into our daily lives"".",Graham Fraser,6 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250428-can-mount-everest-really-be-climbed-in-a-week,Can Mount Everest really be climbed in a week?,"A commercial expedition is planning to take clients up the tallest mountain in the world in record time with the help of xenon gas. But some in the climbing and medical world worry whether the strategy is an unnecessary gamble.
When Tenzing Norgay and Edmund HillaryÂ made their first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953, it took more than two months of effort to reach the summit. In order to adjust to the extreme thin air at high altitude, the team spent several weeks acclimatising, working their way slowly upwards. After reaching Base Camp, they spent seven weeks making brief forays up and down the mountain to set ropes, lay ladders and establish ever higher camps before their assault on the summit. In short, they laid siege to the mountain.
Today, the miles of fixed ropes put along the route by teams of Sherpas and the slick logistics perfected by commercial guiding companies allow hundreds of climbers to summit Everest every year. But the time it takes for most to climb Mount Everest hasn't changed dramatically since that first ascent.
Many expeditions still recommend allowing around two months to reach the top with extensive acclimatisation, although this depends on a range of factors including the weather, traffic on the mountain and the fitness of the climber. It can take up to a week to trek to Base Camp, but once there most people need, on average, around 40 days to reach the summit. But some companies even offer fast-track expeditions that claim to get clients there in as little as two weeks.
This season, however, one guiding company has promised to slash the time even further by taking its clients to the top of the world in just one week, starting from an airport in London. They will fly to Kathmandu in Nepal, take a helicopter to Everest base camp and climb the mountain in only a few days. This way, they will skip the usual painstaking three weeks of acclimatisation in the mountains â all for around â¬150,000 (Â£127,000/$170,000) per person.
The offer, which raised more than a few eyebrows in the climbing community, came from Austrian guide Lukas Furtenbach, who will rely on an unexpected new strategy â inhaling xenon, a noble gas that is sometimes used as an anaesthetic.
The logic behind the idea is relatively simple. Around 10 years ago, it became apparent that xenon has one interesting side effect â it increases production of a protein called erythropoietin. Known for short as EPO, erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that our kidneys produce as reaction to insufficient oxygen levels. EPO fights hypoxia â a condition that occurs when the body can't get enough oxygen â by increasing the number of red blood cells and the crucial protein they carry, haemoglobin, which transports oxygen around the body. At high altitudes, this process will naturally happen after multiple rounds of going up and down the mountain â acclimatisation in other words â to slowly adapt the body to lower oxygen levels.
But xenon, it is claimed, could potentially offer a shortcut. By inhaling carefully controlled doses of the gas shortly before the expedition, it may be possible to accelerate the effects of acclimatisation. Furtenbach says he successfully tested xenon himself on previous expeditions. There is, however, little published scientific evidence showing the strategy works. One recent systematic review of the scientific research, for example, found no conclusive evidence that inhaling xenon had a positive effect on the action of EPO in the human body.
""Increase in erythropoietin does nothing on its own,"" says Andrew Peacock, an honorary professor specialising in altitude medicine at the University of Glasgow in the UK. ""The question in this case is, does it really stimulate production of red blood cells in such a short period?""
For Furtenbach, the main goal of this strategy is to allow climbers to summit faster and so reduce the risk of being caught in bad weather, avalanches or getting sick.
""The less time you spend on the mountain, the safer the expedition becomes,"" he says.

Furtenbach has a reputation for pushing the limits of what is possible on Everest. He has specialised in offering ""flash"" three-week expeditions, where mountaineers pre-acclimatise at home before making their trip. In the Everest climbing season of 2025, he is planning to use the xenon approach to help four British clients reach the summit in early May.
Many in the mountaineering community, however, have reacted to his plans with a mix of scepticism and condemnation.
The medical commission at the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA) â the umbrella group for mountaineering organisations around the world â issued a cautionary statement after Furtenbach revealed his plans. It warned of the absence of clinical research or scientific proof about the safety and efficiency of using xenon at high altitudes. A previous assessment by the same body also warned that drugs designed to induce EPO could potentially increase the risk of blood clots capable of triggering strokes or pulmonary embolisms.
Some climbers have alsoÂ pointedÂ out that substances that artificially increase the amount of EPO in the blood â including xenon â areÂ bannedÂ by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) in competitive sport.
""Why would we use substances in mountaineering that are banned in all other sports,"" says Adrian Ballinger, an American climber and owner of rival guiding company Alpenglow Expeditions. His own company guided climber Roxanne Vogel to the summit of Everest in just 14 days in 2019, where she used an ""altitude chamber"" at the gym and work to help her pre-acclimatise before the expedition.
But in the world of commercial guided mountaineering, where anti-doping rules don't apply, clients are largely unconcerned about the style of ascent. Some in the climbing community are simply curious to see how this will unfold.
""It would be great if this is true, and we could use xenon in the future to make the work of Sherpas safer,"" says Dawa Steven Sherpa, owner of Nepal-based guiding company Asia Trekking.
After all, it won't be the first time humans have enlisted the help of drugs to survive on the tallest mountains â one of the harshest environments on Earth.
As climbers ascend to high altitude, they experience a drop in atmospheric pressure that reduces the amount of oxygen they inhale. This is because the number of air molecules in the atmosphere falls the higher you get. At 5,500m (18,045ft) â slightly above the Everest base camp â there is roughly only half as much oxygen available for us to breathe compared with at sea level. On the summit at 8,850m (29,035ft), this drops to one-third of the usual oxygen. The weather on any given day can also have an effect, leading to dramatic swings in atmospheric pressure to such an extent that it would be equivalent to climbing an additional 700m (2,297ft), according to one study.
All of this means that climbers are able to get less oxygen into their blood stream and into their bodies. Researchers who have studied blood oxygen levels of climbers on Everest have recorded some of the lowest levels ever seen in humans.
If exposed suddenly to these conditions, people can become severely hypoxic, a state that is normally only seen in critically ill patients being treated in hospitals or during serious incidents while under anaesthetic. From altitudes as low as 4,500m (14,764ft) â brain function starts to become impaired in ways that affect decision-making and problem-solving tasks.
The human body, however, is able to adapt to hypobaric hypoxia (hypoxia caused by low air pressure) and reacts with a range of different responses, explains Martin Burtscher, a long-time researcher in the field of high-altitude medicine and professor at University of Innsbruck in Austria. We start to hyperventilate and consequently exhale more carbon dioxide, which helps counteract oxygen desaturation. Kidney and bladder function also change to increase the concentration of blood cells, while an increase in heart rate drives more oxygen around the body, says Burtscher.
Erythropoiesis, a process that increases red blood cell production in response to the presence of EPO, is one of the most important adaptations. After weeks of acclimatisation, erythropoiesis increases total blood volume and oxygen transportation capacity.
Sometimes, however, these adaptive responses can fail.
""If hypoxia becomes too severe, acute mountain sickness or life-threatening pulmonary or brain oedema develop,"" says Burtscher.
In those cases, capillaries of the lung and the brain lose their ability to retain fluids, which leaks out between the cells into brain or lung tissue, explains Andrew Peacock. The consequence is loss of brain or lung function, both potentially fatal.
It is why most climbers on the world's highest mountains use supplementary oxygen, delivered from canisters through breathing apparatus, with a constant flow of the gas coming from high-pressure cylinders that mountaineers carry in their backpacks.
""It makes a huge difference,"" says Peacock. ""You are basically mimicking a lower altitude. It makes you less breathless, and it improves the function of the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and muscles.""
Both Hillary and Norgay used supplementary oxygen in 1953 and that approach continues today. Of 7,269 people known to have reached the summit of Mount Everest, only 230 have done it without the aid of supplemental oxygen.
There are some in the mountaineering community, however, who believe supplemental oxygen could also be considered as doping. It is a highly charged debate, balancing climber safety against ideals of a more ""pure"" style of mountaineering. The Piolet d'Or, the most prestigious annual award in mountaineering, tends to celebrate ascents achieved without supplemental oxygen, for example.
Eager to mitigate the effects of altitude further, some mountaineers and doctors have been willing to experiment with other remedies too, from existing prescription drugs to sketchy stimulants.
In 1953, the legendary Austrian alpinist Hermann Buhl achieved one the greatest feats in the history of mountaineering, summiting alone on the 8,126m (26,660ft) Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat. It remains the only time anyone has managed a ""solo"" first ascent of an 8,000m (26,247ft) peak. Buhl's feat is considered even more impressive as he did it without supplemental oxygen. During the gruesome descent, he was famously forced to spend the night at 7,900m (25,919ft), standing on a narrow ledge while leaning against a rock. At that time, Buhl was already known as a hard-core, pioneering alpinist. Still, it was unthinkable that somebody could survive this ordeal.
As he later described in his autobiography, he did, however, have a little help in his backpack in form of pervitin, methamphetamine pills that had been widely used by Nazi troops during World War Two.
Another stimulant, amphetamine, is often rumoured to be occasionally used by climbers on high-altitude mountain slopes. One study from 1993 analysed urine samples taken from 253 male mountaineers after a successful ascent to different mountains. Amphetamines traces were found in 7.1% of samples from those climbing above 3,300m (10,827ft).
By far the most popular prescription drug among mountaineers is acetazolamide, better known as Diamox. This carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, used in the treatment of many conditions, from glaucoma to epilepsy, also happens to be quite useful at high altitudes.
""It accelerates acclimatisation and improves sleep,"" says Burtscher.
Dexamethasone, a powerful corticosteroid, is still considered as the number one life-saving medicine for cerebral oedema and acute mountain sickness since it buys some time for the sick person to descend. Some research has indicated that dexamethasone could also be useful as a prophylactic treatment to stave off acute mountain sickness, although medical experts warn that it can result in potentially serious side effects and do not recommend it for this use.
There were hopes that sildenafil, commonly known as Viagra, could also help to protect against high-altitude pulmonary oedema, but trials did not shown it to be effective.
The search for other drugs that can help give climbers a boost in performance and acclimatisation at high altitude never stopped. A team of doctors in Willemstad, CuraÃ§ao, for example, recently published details about a test of a drug normally used to treat anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Two climbers took the drug, which stimulates EPO production, as they ascended Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.
But even with all this help, Everest is a treacherous place and there is no guarantee of survival. Although there is little research on how long someone can remain at very high altitudes, experts agree that even with acclimatisation, the body will eventually start to deteriorate. Extremes of cold and wind exposure, the strain placed on the lungs and heart, deterioration of the tissues and organs, dehydration and weight loss all make spending any prolonged visit to the so called ""Death Zone"" â generally considered to be above 8,000m (26,247ft) â increasingly dangerous.
So, cutting down the time spent on the mountain is always beneficial.
This is where xenon could make a real difference, at least according to Michael Fries, head of the department of anaesthesiology at St Vincenz Krankenhaus Limburg in Germany, who came up with the idea and suggested it to Furtenbach.
Xenon has been used in a wide range of products, from car headlights to ion propulsion engines and ballistic missiles. It could also serve as an anaesthetic, which is something Fries spent years researching while working at University Hospital Aachen in Germany.
""It is an almost ideal anaesthetic since it has a very rapid effect, quickly leaves the body and doesn't interact with other drugs,"" says Fries.
Using xenon for anaesthesia, however, proved to be challenging for multiple reasons. This extremely expensive gas must make up 70% of the anaesthetic mixture and it requires special equipment for administration.
Then, in 2014, Fries and his colleagues heard claims that some Russian athletes had used xenon at the 2014 Winter Olympics to improve performance, so the group from University Hospital Aachen did their own study on 24 healthy volunteers. The results confirmed that a single inhalation of 30% xenon for 45 minutes significantly increased EPO level eight hours after exposure. According to Fries, the main effect of EPO production should be strongest within the first few days and last up to 14 days.
Curious if this advantage could be used in the hypoxia-inducing world of high-altitude mountaineering, Fries contacted Furtenbach.
Previously, Furtenbach had managed to shorten the Everest expedition time to two weeks by using so-called hypoxic pre-acclimatisation. However, sleeping at home for eight weeks in tents with a lower percentage of oxygen or repeatedly breathing reduced amounts of air through a mask was never a strategy that found much favour among his clients.
Keen to try the xenon idea, Furtenbach did a test run on Aconcagua, 6,961m (22,838ft) high mountain in Argentina. He received a low dose of xenon shortly before the expedition in 2020.
""I reached the summit within a week, without any prior acclimatisation. I felt strong and fast,"" says Furtenbach.
He claims his red blood cell count went up by 10% while measurements of his blood oxygen saturation on the summit showed it was 89%.
If true, academics say, this would be remarkable. Â At sea level, normal blood oxygen saturation is between 96-100%. Measurements taken from nine climbers during an expedition to Everest in 1993 showed that blood oxygen saturation of climbers fell below 90% at around 4,700m (15,420ft), while at 8,000m (26,247ft) climbers had only 70% saturation without supplementary oxygen. Even with supplementary oxygen, this increased only to 80%. Measurements taken during a research expedition to Everest in 2007 showed an even starker reduction in blood oxygen saturation in four climbers at an altitude of 8,400m (27,559ft), measuring some of the lowest levels ever recorded in humans who are not already close to death.
""I'm quite sceptical,"" says Mike Grocott, professor of anaesthesia and critical care at University of Southampton who led the research team during the 2007 expedition and has summited Everest himself. ""Xenon has a number of biological mechanisms, including boosting EPO, but the effect on red blood cells and oxygen transport is questionable.""
In 2022, Furtenbach and two fellow guides did another xenon test â this time on Everest. The results, he says, were the same as on Aconcagua, except this time the group prepared at home with hypoxic pre-acclimatisation, where their bodies were slowly introduced to lower levels of oxygen by sleeping in a hypoxic tent at home.
""In each of these cases, we could see the effects on the endurance and the physical abilities,"" says Fries, who was involved in analysing the data gathered during the tests. ""They all had high oxygen saturations without the long acclimatisation periods and increase in haemoglobin levels.""
But he acknowledges there is still a lack of peer-reviewed scientific research on this and says he hopes to publish findings in the future.
Fries also refutes concerns that xenon, when administered in small doses, could reduce decision-making ability on the mountain. The UIAA medical committee, for example, warned that using an anaesthetic gas in an unmonitored setting could affect brain function, stating ""even slight sedation is detrimental in the potentially dangerous setting of high-altitude mountaineering"". Fries says that in small doses, xenon only results in a short period of dizziness immediately after administration.
Three medical experts the BBC contacted for this story â all veterans of high-altitude research â are not entirely convinced about the strategy as a way to summit the highest mountain on Earth. They argue there is insufficient scientific proof that xenon actually does enhance performance at high altitude.
Burtschner and Grocott both point to a study which confirmed that xenon did increase EPO concentration, but failed to ""stimulate increases in plasma volume or erythropoiesis, leaving cardiorespiratory fitness and athletic performance unchanged"".
Xenon, Grocott says, would need to have an ""extraordinary"" effect to enable someone to climb to the summit in just one week. ""That would have to be a very dramatic change. And I haven't seen any data suggesting that's true.""
In the meantime, Furtenbach is proceeding with the plan to send four clients up Everest with the help of xenon gas. All four are in good physical shape, he says. They will climb with guides and bottled oxygen. Once new fixed ropes are in place, all the team will need is seven days of good weather.
The rest of the world, meanwhile, will be watching.

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250425-the-fibonacci-sequence-hidden-in-liverpool-fcs-premier-league-football-title,The Fibonacci sequence achieved by Liverpool's win,"Liverpool FC's victory at the weekend has clinched them their second Premier League title but it also resulted in something curious â producing a strange series of numbers in the league's record books.
Something remarkable has just happened in English football. Liverpool FC have been crowned Premier League champions for a second time. When added to their 18 pre-Premier League titles, it means they now equal Manchester United's record of being English champions 20 times. But while fans of the club will no doubt be celebrating this moment of triumph, another astounding facet of their achievement has caught the attention of mathematicians.
Liverpool's title win has completed the opening of an exceptional set of numbers that has been 33 years in the making. The sequence emerges when we rank Liverpool alongside the other clubs that have won the Premier League since it was first formed in 1992, listing them by the number of titles won, starting with the lowest. As you can see in the table below, the number of Premier League titles goes as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.
To the untrained eye, this sequence might not seem significant. But it will be enough to get many maths aficionados excited. They will recognise this asÂ the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the previous two in the sequence.
The sequence can be found in an astonishing array of places â from the spirals of seeds onÂ sunflower headsÂ and the bracts ofÂ pineconesÂ toÂ family tree patterns in some species of animals.
Fibonacci sequences (sequences in the plural because starting with a different pair of initial numbers and following the rule of adding consecutive numbers to generate the next gives you a different, but related sequence) were firstÂ introduced to European science in 1202 by Leonardo of Pisa, also known by his nickname Fibonacci (meaning son ofÂ Bonaccio).
Long before Fibonacci popularised the sequences in his book Liber Abaci, however, the sequences had been known to Indian Mathematicians. They had drawn upon the sequences to help them enumerate the number of possible poems of a given length, using short syllables of one-unit duration and long syllables of two-unit duration. The Indian poet/mathematicians knew that you could make a poem of length n by taking a poem of length n-1 and adding a short syllable or a poem of length n-2 and adding a long syllable. Consequently, they figured out that to work out the number of poems of a given length you just had to add the number of poems that were one syllable shorter to the number that were two syllables shorter â the exact rule we use today to define a Fibonacci sequence.
Hidden in the sequences is another important and related mathematical mainstay â the golden ratio. As the terms in a Fibonacci sequence get larger, the ratio of each term to the one preceding it gets closer and closer to the golden ratio â approximated to 1.61803 by the first few places in its decimal expansion. The golden ratio is hypothesised to govern the arrangement of leaves on the stem of some plant species and supposedly leads to aesthetically pleasing results when applied in art, architecture and music.
Fibonacci sequences are often held up by mathematicians as exemplars of the beauty of mathematics. They can provide vivid visual examples of maths written into the patterns of the real world, without which many non-mathematicians can struggle to understand the elegance we see in our subject. In our over-enthusiasm to proselytise, however, there is a temptation to cast Fibonacci sequences or the golden ratio as some sort of all-encompassing natural law governing phenomena across orders of magnitude, from the spiral shapes of nautilus shells to vortices of hurricanes to the curved arms of galaxies.
In reality, although these natural features are aesthetically pleasing, very few of them conform to the rules of the Fibonacci sequence or exhibit the golden ratio. We must be careful that we don't try to shoehorn every beautiful pattern into the delicate Fibonacci glass slipper â to suggest causation and impose meaning where there is none.
It's extraordinary, then, to find the Fibonacci sequence cropping up in a place as unexpected as the Premier League. When, as scientists, we spot a well-known sequence like this appearing seemingly out of the blue, we should start to ask ourselves whether it tells us anything important about the process that generated the sequence. Is there some surprising unseen process underlying Premier League title battles or is it nothing more than a cute coincidence? Just because we can see a Fibonacci sequence in something doesn't mean it is there for a reason.
Nonetheless, spotting these sorts of seeming coincidences can be extremely useful for the process of scientific discovery. In 1912, for example, Alfred Wegener noticed the apparently strange coincidence that the coastline of West Africa and the eastern coastline of South America seemed to fit together like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Despite the prevailing opinion at the time, that the enormous land masses of the continents were just too big to move, Wegener proposed the only theory that reconciled his observations. Continental drift suggested that the land masses weren't rooted in place but could, ever-so-slowly, change their relative positions on the surface of the Earth.
More like this:
When Wegener published his theory in 1915, he became a laughing stock. Geologists rejected his outlandish idea, citing a lack of mechanism for moving such enormous chunks of the Earth's surface, dismissing the seemingly snug tessellation of the continents as pure coincidence. By the 1960s, however, the theory of plate tectonics â the movement of the solid mantle and crust over the Earth's surface â gave credence to Wegener's now widely accepted theories.
Although coincidences can point the way to new scientific discoveries, they can also prove an obstacle to scientific progress when they appear to confirm an incorrect theory. In the early 1800s German anatomist Johann Friedrich Meckel made just such a blunder. He was a believer in scala naturae (the ladder of nature) in which humans sit above all other animals in an ordered but static hierarchy. The simplest, most primitive life forms were supposed to sit on the lowest rungs of the ladder, while the most complex and advanced beings resided on the highest. His views were hardly surprising given that this ""great chain of being"" was the predominant theory of the day. The now generally accepted theory of ""common descent"" â that multiple species descend from a single ancestral population â was only in its infancy as an idea at the time.
Meckel employed scala naturae to come up with a conjecture about his area of speciality â embryonic development. Known as recapitulation theory, he posited that, as they developed, the embryos of higher order animals (like mammals) progressed successively through forms which strongly resembled the ""less perfect"" animals, like fish, amphibians and reptiles, on lower rungs of the ladder. One startling, but seemingly unlikely prediction of this theory was that, as humans progressed through the ""fish stage"", their embryos would have gill slits.
As it happens, it was discovered in 1827 that human embryos really do have slits that resemble gills at an early stage of development. This extraordinary finding seemed to bear out Meckel's prediction and corroborate his recapitulation theory. So strong was the perceived evidence that the theory became widely accepted, and it wasn't until almost 50 years later in the 1870s that the recapitulation theory of development was finally put to bed for good as the idea of common descent started to take hold. Common descent underpins what we now know as modern evolutionary theory. It made clear that, far from undergoing a ""fish stage"" in the womb, the gill slits were a consequence of the fact that, sharing a common ancestor with fish, we also share much of their DNA and early developmental processes.
Sometimes coincidences can lead scientists astray, seeming to point to one conclusion when, in fact, there is an alternative explanation for the observations that is better supported by the facts.
So what does the fact that the beautiful, almost mystical Fibonacci sequence has cropped up in the data on the number of Premier League title wins mean for the beautiful game? With no plausible mechanism which could have given rise to the sequence, the answer is almost certainly nothing.
It's wonderful to have spotted this mathematical sequence in such an unlikely place, giving us a chance to reflect upon the importance of Fibonacci numbers. But a pattern doesn't always mean causality â a coincidence is sometimes just a coincidence.
And, just like Meckel's gill slits, its appearance in the Premier League records is just that â nothing more than a spectacular but ultimately misleading coincidence.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvq0q14y03o,M&S customers in limbo as cyber attack chaos continues,"Marks and Spencer (M&S) customers have been telling the BBC of their frustration as disruption caused by the cyber attack which has hit the retailer continues into another trading week.
The incident - which it disclosed last Monday - has caused delayed parcels, paused online orders and suspended gift card payments, and has seen the retailer take down several parts of its operations over the last few days.
It has yet to disclose the nature of the cyber attack or when it expects operations to return to normal. Some customers told the BBC that M&S' communication over affected orders has been ""disappointing"".
Analysts warn the incident may affect the retailer's reputation.
Customers have been telling the BBC of the impact the situation is having on them.
Linda Sonntag, who lives in Norwich, told the BBC she was left ""disappointed"" after a flower delivery arranged for a friend never arrived.
She told the BBC she was still awaiting a refund and email with information about her order.
""In the meantime I've had to order flowers from somewhere else,"" she said.
""I don't blame them, they've had a cyber attack,"" Ms Sonntag added.
""But I don't think their attitude towards their customers is very helpful.""
Dawn Cunnington, of Exeter, agreed the company was not to blame, but said she had no communication from M&S about her own flower order not being fulfilled.
She had ordered flowers on Wednesday, on behalf of her 91-year-old mother, for her mother's friend, who was celebrating their 90th birthday.
""I'd had nothing from them until I phoned up,"" she told the BBC.
Ms Cunnington said she received a refund and a Â£10 apology voucher after calling M&S to find out what happened to the flowers, but was ""a bit cross"" they had allowed her to place the order in the first place, given it was aware of cyber incident.
Other customers have described having to cancel orders for clothes which they were expecting to collect before going on holiday, or being unable to return goods they had previously bought.
But some have expressed sympathy for the staff at the stores, who they say have been on the receiving end of abuse from angry customers, or having to deal with shopping abandoned at the tills when customers were unable to pay when contactless payments were down.
M&S remains silent on how the cyber attack unfolded, the nature of the attack and how specifically it has been affected by it - leaving cyber security experts to speculate as to what might have happened.
It is known it has hired external cyber security experts, who are likely to be a team of incident response specialists who will be working around the clock either at the headquarters of the company or remotely.
Their first priority is likely to be find out where the hackers are in the IT system and kick them out.
Switching off computer servers used in their online ordering, payment or logistics systems might imply that security teams have isolated that portion as a way the hackers gained entry.
They might also have taken these offline to stop the hackers from spreading their malicious software into those previously unaffected areas.
It might also be the case that the company is taking all non-business critical services offline to help deal with the hack.
""In situations like this, in-store services are typically prioritised for recovery, which can mean online operations take slightly longer to restore,"" said Sam Kirkman, a director at cyber-security firm NetSPI.
He told the BBC that while M&S taking steps like pausing services may make the incident seem ""even more serious from the outside,"" they would allow staff to contain any potential threats and begin recovery safely.
About a third of M&S's clothing and household goods' sales in the UK are through its online platforms and were worth some Â£1.268bn in latest published financial results.
Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said even though M&S's physical stores were still open, many of them ""simply don't stock the popular ranges from online"".
She added clothes sales were ""likely to take a big hit"" as the cyber-attack had occurred during a spell of warm weather when summer ranges would be ""piling up in virtual baskets"".
Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said M&S's success was ""built on trust"" - and this was something customers may question after it suspended online orders.
""The longer it takes to draw a line under the cyber incident, the greater the risk to Marks & Spencer's reputation,"" he told the BBC.
""Shoppers want to know that their personal and financial details are safe when buying goods online and Marks & Spencer failing to give the all-clear implies that something is very wrong at its end.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr78pd7p42ro,Call for ban on AI apps creating naked images of children,"The children's commissioner for England is calling on the government to ban apps which use artificial intelligence (AI) to create sexually explicit images of children.
Dame Rachel de Souza said a total ban was needed on apps which allow ""nudification"" - where photos of real people are edited by AI to make them appear naked.
She said the government was allowing such apps to ""go unchecked with extreme real-world consequences"".
A government spokesperson said child sexual abuse material was illegal and that there were plans for further offences for creating, possessing or distributing AI tools designed to create such content.
Deepfakes are videos, pictures or audio clips made with AI to look or sound real.
In a report published on Monday, Dame Rachel said the technology was disproportionately targeting girls and young women with many bespoke apps appearing to work only on female bodies.
Girls are actively avoiding posting images or engaging online to reduce the risk of being targeted, according to the report, ""in the same way that girls follow other rules to keep themselves safe in the offline world - like not walking home alone at night"".
Children feared ""a stranger, a classmate, or even a friend"" could target them using technologies which could be found on popular search and social media platforms.
Dame Rachel said: ""The evolution of these tools is happening at such scale and speed that it can be overwhelming to try and get a grip on the danger they present.
""We cannot sit back and allow these bespoke AI apps to have such a dangerous hold over children's lives.""
It is illegal under the Online Safety Act to share or threaten to share explicit deepfake images.
The government announced in February laws to tackle the threat of child sexual abuse images being generated by AI, which include making it illegal to possess, create, or distribute AI tools designed to create such material.
Dame Rachel said this does not go far enough, with her spokesman telling the BBC: ""There should be no nudifying apps, not just no apps that are classed as child sexual abuse generators.""
In February the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) - a UK-based charity partly funded by tech firms - had confirmed 245 reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse in 2024 compared with 51 in 2023, a 380% increase.
""We know these apps are being abused in schools, and that imagery quickly gets out of control,"" IWF Interim Chief Executive Derek Ray-Hill said on Monday.
A spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said creating, possessing or distributing child sexual abuse material, including AI-generated images, is ""abhorrent and illegal"".
""Under the Online Safety Act platforms of all sizes now have to remove this kind of content, or they could face significant fines,"" they added.
""The UK is the first country in the world to introduce further AI child sexual abuse offences - making it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to generate heinous child sex abuse material.""
Dame Rachel also called for the government to:
Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said members shared the commissioner's concerns.
He said: ""This is an area that urgently needs to be reviewed as the technology risks outpacing the law and education around it.""
Media regulator Ofcom published the final version of its Children's Code on Friday, which puts legal requirements on platforms hosting pornography and content encouraging self-harm, suicide or eating disorders, to take more action to prevent access by children.
Websites must introduce beefed-up age checks or face big fines, the regulator said.
Dame Rachel has criticised the code saying it prioritises ""business interests of technology companies over children's safety"".",Hollie Cole & Maia Davies,8 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250424-what-your-earwax-can-reveal-about-your-health,What your earwax can reveal about your health,"From Alzheimer's to cancer, earwax can contain valuable indicators to a person's health. Now scientists are analysing its chemistry in the hope of finding new ways of diagnosing diseases.
It's orange, it's sticky, and it's probably the last thing you want to talk about in polite conversation. Yet earwax is increasingly attracting the attention of scientists, who want to use it to learn more about diseases and conditions likeÂ cancer, heart disease, and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.
The proper name for the gloopy stuff is cerumen, and it's a mix of secretions from two types of glands that line the outer ear canal; the ceruminous and sebaceous glands. The resulting goo is mixed with hair, dead skin flakes, and other bodily debris until it reaches the waxy consistency we all know and try our best not to think about.
Once formed in the ear canal, the substance is transported by a kind of conveyer belt mechanism, clinging on to skin cells as they travel from the inside of the ear to the outside â which they do at a speed of approximately one 20thÂ of a millimetre every day.
The primary purpose of earwax is debated, but the most likely function is to keep the ear canal clean and lubricated. However, it also serves as an effective trap, preventing bacteria, fungi and other unwelcome guests such as insects from finding their way into our heads. So far, so gross. And yet, possibly due to its unpalatable appearance, earwax has been somewhat overlooked by researchers when it comes to bodily secretions.
That's now starting to change, however, thanks to a slew of surprising scientific discoveries. The first is that a person's earwax can actually convey a surprising amount of information about them â both trivial and important.
For example, the vast majority of people of European or African descent have wet earwax, which is yellow or orange in colour and sticky. However, 95% of East Asian people have dry earwax, which is grey and non-sticky. The gene responsible for producing either wet or dry earwax is calledÂ ABCC11, which also happens to be responsible for whether a person has smelly armpits. Around 2% of people â mostly those in the dry earwax category â have a version of this gene which means their armpits have no odour.
However, perhaps the most useful earwax-related discoveries relate to what the sticky stuff in our ears can reveal about our health.
In 1971, Nicholas L Petrakis, a professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco, found that Caucasian, African-American and German women in the USA, who all had ""wet earwax"", had an approximately four-fold higher chance of dying from breast cancer than Japanese and Taiwanese women with ""dry"" earwax.
More recently in 2010, researchers from the Tokyo Institute of Technology took blood samples from 270 female patients with invasive breast cancer, and 273 female volunteers who acted as controls. They found that Japanese women with breast cancer were up to 77% more likely to have the gene coding for wetÂ earwaxÂ than healthy volunteers.
Nevertheless, the finding remains controversial, and large scale studies in Germany, Australia and Italy have found no difference in breast cancer risk between people with wet and dry earwax, although the number of people in these countries with dry ear wax is very small.
What is more established is the link between some systemic illnesses and the substances found in earwax.Â Take maple syrup urine disease, a rare genetic disorder that prevents the body from breaking down certain amino acids found in food.Â This leads to a buildup of volatile compounds in the blood and urine, giving urine the distinctive odour of maple syrup.
The molecule responsible for the sweet-smelling wee is sotolone, and it can be found in the earwax of people with the condition. This means the condition could be diagnosed through simply swabbing someone's ears, a much simpler and cheaper process than doing a genetic test.Â Although such a test may not even be necessary.
""The earwax literally smells like maple syrup, so within 12 hours of the birth of the baby, when you smell this distinct and lovely smell it tells you that they have this inborn error of metabolism,"" says Rabi Ann Musah, an environmental chemist at Louisiana State University.
Covid-19 can alsoÂ sometimes be detectedÂ in earwax, and a person's earwax can also tell you whether they have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Early work has suggested that you can tell if someone has a certain form of heart disease from their earwax, although it's still easier to diagnose this condition from blood tests.
There's also MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease, an inner ear condition that causes people to experience vertigo and hearing loss. ""The symptoms can be very debilitating,"" says Musah. ""They include severe nausea and vertigo. It becomes impossible to drive, or to go places accompanied. You eventually suffer complete hearing loss in the ear that is afflicted.""
Musah recently led a team which discovered that the earwax of patients with MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease hasÂ lower levels of three fatty acids than that of healthy controls. This is the first time anyone has found a biomarker for the condition, which is usually diagnosed by excluding everything else â a process which can take years. The finding raises the hope that doctors could use earwax to diagnose this condition more quickly in the future.
""Our interest in earwax as a reporter of disease is directed at those illnesses that are very difficult to diagnose using typical biological fluids like blood and urine or cerebral spinal fluid, and which take a long time to diagnose because they're rare,"" says Musah.
More like this:
But what is it about earwax that makes it such a treasure trove of health information? The key, it turns out, is down to the waxy secretions' ability to reflect the inner chemical reactions taking place inside the body â a person's metabolism.
""Many diseases in living organisms are metabolic,"" says Nelson Roberto Antoniosi Filho, a professor of chemistry at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s in Brazil, who lists diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease as examples. ""In these cases, mitochondria â the cell organelles responsible for converting lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins into energy â begin to function differently to those in healthy cells. They start to produce different chemical substances and may even stop producing others.""
Antoniosi Filho's lab have discovered that earwax concentrates this great diversity of substances more than other biological fluids such as blood, urine, sweat, and tears.
""It makes a lot of sense because there's not a lot of turnover in earwax,"" says Bruce Kimball, a chemical ecologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Centre, a research institute based in Philadelphia. ""It kind of builds up, and so there's certainly a reason to think that it might be a good place to capture long-term snapshots of changes in metabolism.""
With this in mind, Antoniosi Filho and his team are developing the ""cerumenogram"" â a diagnostic tool they claim can accurately predict whether a person has certain forms of cancer based on their earwax.
In a 2019 study, Antoniosi Filho's team collected earwax samples from 52 cancer patients who had been diagnosed with either lymphoma, carcinoma, or leukaemia. The researchers also took earwax from 50 healthy subjects. They then analysed the samples using a method which can accurately detect the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) â chemicals that evaporate easilyÂ in air.
The researchers identified 27 compounds in earwax that served as a kind of ""fingerprint"" for cancer diagnosis. In other words, the team could predict with 100% accuracy whether someone had cancer (either lymphoma, carcinoma, or leukaemia) based on the concentrations of these 27 molecules. Interestingly, the test could not distinguish between different types of cancer, suggesting that the molecules are produced either by, or as a response to, cancer cells from all these types of cancer.
""Although cancer consists of hundreds of diseases, from a metabolic point of view, cancer is a single biochemical process, which can be detected at any stage through the evaluation of specific VOCs,"" says Antoniosi Filho.
While in 2019 the team identified 27 VOCs, they are currently focusing on a small number of these that are exclusively produced by cancer cells as part of their unique metabolism. In as-yet unpublished work, Antoniosi Filho says they have also shown that the cerumenogram is able to detect the metabolic disturbances that occur in pre-cancerous stages, where cells exhibit abnormal changes that could potentially lead to cancer, but are not yet cancerous.
""Considering that medicine indicates that most cancers diagnosed at stage 1 have up to a 90% cure rate, it is conceivable that the success in treatment will be much higher with the diagnosis of pre-cancer stages,"" says Antoniosi Filho.
The research group is also studying whether the metabolic changes caused by the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's could also be picked up by such a device, although this work is in the early stages.
""In the future, we hope that the cerumenogram will become a routine clinical examination, preferably every six months, that allows, with a small portion of earwax, to simultaneously diagnose diseases such as diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, as well as evaluate metabolic changes resulting from other health conditions,"" says Antoniosi Filho.
In Brazil, the Amaral Carvalho Hospital has recently adopted the cerumenogram as a diagnostic and monitoring technique for cancer treatment, says Antoniosi Filho.
Musah is also hopeful that her research will one day help people suffering from MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease, a condition for which there is currently no cure. She first hopes to validate her test on a larger sample of patients in the clinic, before producing a diagnostic test that could be used by clinicians in their offices.
""We are currently working on developing a test kit very similar to what you would see in over-the-counter types of kits that you can buy for Covid-19 testing,"" says Musah.
Just the observation that three fatty acids are very low compared to normal earwax may also provide some clues that can be further investigated, Musah explains. ""It might help us understand what causes the disease, or perhaps even suggest ways in which it can be treated,"" she says.
Musah says that a lot of foundational work is still needed to understand the chemical profile of normal, healthy earwax â and how this changes in different disease states. But she hopesÂ  that one day it may be routinely analysed in hospitals to diagnose diseases, in much the same way as blood.
""Earwax is a really wonderful matrix to use because it is very lipid rich, and there are lots of diseases that are a consequence of dysregulation of lipid metabolism,"" says Musah.
Perdita Barran, a chemist and professor of mass spectrometry at the University of Manchester in the UK, doesn't study earwax specifically, but does analyse biological molecules and investigate if they could be used to diagnose diseases. She agrees that, theoretically at least, it makes sense that this substance would be a good place to look for signs of illness.
""The compounds that you find in blood tend to be water soluble, whereas earwax is a very lipid-rich substance, and lipids don't like water,"" says Barran. ""So if you only study blood, you only get half the picture. Lipids are the canary in the coal mine molecules. They're the ones that really start changing first.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6nky0x89o,'Tech entrepreneur took our money but failed to deliver our start-up dreams',"Former clients of a Canadian tech entrepreneur say they were let down after they paid his company tens of thousands of dollars to help launch their start-ups.
People across the world - from Scotland to the southern states of the US - have told the BBC they paid Josh Adler's software company ConvrtX up to $245,000 (Â£184,000) but did not receive the websites and apps they expected.
We spoke to more than 20 former employees and customers who say that Mr Adler continued to sell services and ask for more money, despite repeatedly not delivering everything customers paid for.
In a letter to the BBC, Mr Adler's lawyers say the allegations are false and have been incited by one former client who they are suing.
They add that although Mr Adler was ""inexperienced"" when he founded his business, aged 21, his company became very successful in a short period of time and ""the vast majority of clients were happy with their work"".
Launched in 2019, ConvrtX claims to be a ""world-leading venture studio"" that has helped more than 700 aspiring entrepreneurs start companies by developing business plans, making pitch documents for potential investors, and building custom websites and apps.
In pitches to clients, the company claims it has a five-star satisfaction rating. It also says it has 70 staff worldwide and operates from the UK, US and Canada. Mr Adler runs the company from Dubai.
Leaked internal documents suggest ConvrtX billed more than $5m (Â£3.8m) in sales to more than 280 customers between 2019 and 2023 alone, but senior insiders say there were few success stories.
Our investigation found:
In response, Mr Adler's legal team say ConvrtX had only received about 12-15 complaints out of about 340 customers - adding that after the incident of the sexually inappropriate emails, the company immediately terminated its contract with the lawyer.
Amy (not her real name), a 37-year-old single mother from the UK, says she was ""led down the garden path"" after paying $53,000 (Â£40,000) in 2021 for a website and an app for her non-profit organisation, which aims to match people with fertility issues to potential surrogates.
She says she was strung along for two years, only ever receiving a basic website and no working app, while Mr Adler continued to ask for more funds.
Amy was particularly annoyed by a text she says Mr Adler sent to her, featuring a picture of him celebrating New Year's Eve on a tropical beach in Bali.
""Why flaunt your money to me? It's disgraceful,"" says Amy, who had funded the project by remortgaging her home and using credit cards.
Eventually, she requested a refund through her bank and complained to the UK's Financial Ombudsman Service. A senior investigator there has provisionally recommended that the bank return $39,000 (Â£30,000) to Amy, according to documents seen by the BBC. She is still waiting for her bank to agree to the recommendation.
As part of the process, two expert software developers reviewed the app developed by ConvrtX. According to the senior investigator, the evidence supported Amy's claim that the company had breached their contract by failing to provide the service she paid for.
""I think it's fair to say ConvrtX failed to exercise reasonable care and skill when they were providing the service,"" the investigator said. ""It seems the work completed by ConvrtX cannot be salvaged and the entire process would need to be completed again if [Amy] wanted a working app to be developed.""
In response, lawyers for Mr Adler say that the client had ""received a website, clickable prototype and a fully developed mobile app from ConvrtX"".
Former senior staff say that Josh Adler - the son of Kerry Adler, a wealthy Canadian businessman - presided over a culture of instability, resulting in high turnover of staff and errors due to ""cutting corners"" and hiring and firing inexperienced contractors.
On his Facebook profile, Mr Adler described himself as #YoungAndReckless and #LivingTheDream. We spoke to a number of former employees who described him as immature and a poor leader.
In company meetings, they say he ""bragged"" about living at the Emirates Palace Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Abu Dhabi, boasted about renting a villa in Bali, and showed off a newly purchased Porsche 911 and multiple speeding fines.
He cared about ""his rich kid, bling-bling lifestyle,"" says a former senior employee speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""When you have that many unhappy clients, it can't be a coincidence.""
Mr Adler's lawyers describe him as ""highly ambitious"" and say he sought to build a world-leading business, but that not all staff lived up to his high standards and would be ""let go"" if they under-delivered. ""Young and Reckless"" is a clothing brand he likes, they add.
But several senior ex-staff told us they had concerns about how Mr Adler ran his company, saying he continued to take on new clients even after being warned that some business and app ideas were unviable or impossible to make. They say he requested payments from clients in advance, sometimes as much as $53,000 (Â£40,000), though the company had a no-refund policy.
Two senior ex-employees claim that when Mr Adler was informed that some apps were not working, he would subsequently tell customers - against the advice of the development team - that he could fix the problem if they paid more money, or their outstanding balance.
""So don't tell the client that it cannot be done because we'll find [a contractor] that can do it when they've paid,"" one ex-staff member recalls Mr Adler repeatedly telling them. ""He's a good talker, he's good at salesâ¦ but he gives a lot of false promises.""
A former customer, DeShawn Womack, says he felt ""lied to"" after he hired ConvrtX in 2021. He says he paid more than $50,000 (Â£37,750) for a mobile app that would allow users to remotely access their phone and all its data from another device if it was lost, stolen or damaged.
He says he received a design prototype, but not a finished working app.
After making payments over two years, Mr Womack - a truck driver from the US state of Georgia - messaged a senior ConvrtX employee for clarity about whether his app would be able to sync missed calls and voicemails. He also asked if it would allow users to make phone calls from a different device using their same number - a specific feature he said Mr Adler had told him was possible and was referenced in his contract with ConvrtX.
""This is impossible, your app was never ever possible in the first place,"" the employee responded in messages seen by the BBC. ""Did someone tell you this was possible?""
Mr Womack replied: ""Yes, Josh [Adler] did and plus it's in my project sign-off.""
The 40-year-old, who says he spent his life savings on the project, told the BBC he stopped making additional payments after he believed his app was not being properly worked on.
""He [Josh Adler] sold me a dream and this is frustrating,"" he says.
Lawyers for Mr Adler say he denies telling customers that their ideas were viable when they were not. They say ConvrtX was always clear about the difficulty of developing an app, but if the client wanted to proceed it would usually take on the project.
Gemma Martin from Dundee, who runs a tarot-card-reading business, says ConvrtX failed to deliver after she paid more than $35,000 (Â£26,000) for services including a working interactive website and mobile app that would let users request readings and subscribe to her services.
After she wrote negative reviews online, the 33-year-old says ConvrtX refused to release her website unless she signed a non-disclosure agreement stopping her from criticising the company - which she declined.
In emails seen by the BBC, a company lawyer then made sexually inappropriate remarks to Ms Martin while trying to resolve the dispute, writing that he had researched her online and her ""professional profile"" did not ""match [her] beauty"".
Lawyers for ConvrtX say the emails were sent by a part-time third-party contractor who was terminated immediately once Mr Adler, who also apologised to Ms Martin, learned of the incident.
Ms Martin says she received a business plan from ConvrtX and eventually raw source codes for her website and app, though she says these were unusable and incomplete.
Lawyers for ConvrtX say it delivered Ms Martin a fully developed mobile app and source code, despite her having failed to pay her remaining balance. The company has since taken legal action against her for defamation, which she is contesting.
Steven Marshall, 53, says he was also threatened with legal action by ConvrtX when he asked for a full refund. He says he was ""thoroughly disappointed"" with work he had paid $5,183 (Â£3,920) for to help launch his business supporting independent filmmakers.
In emails seen by the BBC, ConvrtX's compliance officer told Mr Marshall that if he publicly shared his ""baseless allegations"" it would be ""criminal and civil libel"" and the company would seek a ""criminal charge"" against him.
The compliance officer also said that Mr Marshall had ""signed away"" his right to post negative reviews online about ConvrtX because of a non-disclosure agreement signed prior to the work starting.
Other former customers say they also faced threats - including Ayesha Imran, who told the BBC she had requested a refund of $18,000 (Â£13,500) when she did not receive an app and a privacy policy for her website, after hiring ConvrtX in 2021.
In March 2023, she complained to Mr Adler for what she described as a breach of contract because of ConvrtX's failure to deliver.
In her complaint, she wrote she had been informed that Mr Adler was not paying his development team the appropriate amount for the work that needed to be done, causing several delays because of staff turnover, and resulting in insufficient product delivery.
The company's compliance officer responded that Ms Imran would face damages of at least $60,000 (Â£47,000) if she publicly shared negative comments about ConvrtX or attempted to contact any of its employees. She says she viewed this as an attempt to intimidate and scare her.
Despite her experience, Ms Imran was being featured - until last month - as a false testimonial on the company's website.
""ConvrtX has helped us go from vision, to launch and supported with everything in between. They are really quite holisitc [sic], in what they do!"" the post read.
""Those words never left my mouth,"" says Ms Imran, who tells us she had previously asked Mr Adler to remove it.
Alongside Ms Imran's fake testimonial, the BBC has found that Mr Adler also used an image of Jen Selter, a lifestyle and fashion influencer with more than 13 million followers on social media. Ms Selter confirmed she had never used ConvrtX's services, and that the image had been used without her consent.
Mr Adler's lawyers say these testimonials were on a ""dummy site"" that was ""not intended by ConvrtX to be publicly available"".
However, they were publicly available as recently as last month and some date back to August 2020, according to website archives and screengrabs taken by the BBC.
Earlier this year, Mr Adler rebranded ConvrtX and, until being contacted by the BBC, was selling eight-week ""bootcamps"" for $159 (Â£124). In a promotional video, he claimed to have helped ""founders raise capital - six, eight, nine figures and the like"" and to have ""positively impacted 10,000 lives"".
The BBC wrote to Mr Adler asking what these numbers were based on, but his lawyers did not answer our question.
In a letter, lawyers for Josh Adler say he ""unequivocally"" denies the allegations. They say that Mr Adler and his business are the ""victims"" and that, until Gemma Martin made defamatory statements about it, ConvrtX had received very few, if any, complaints from its clients.

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250425-do-twins-become-allergic-to-the-same-things,Are twins allergic to the same things?,"If one of a pair of twins is allergic to something, does that mean the other twin will be sensitive too?
Allergies, whether spring sneezes due to pollen or trouble breathing triggered by a certain food, are caused by a combination of someone's genes and the environment they live in. The more of these things two people share, the higher their chances of being allergic to the same things. Twins are more likely to share allergies because of everything they have in common, but the story doesn't end there.
Allergies are really complex and a lot of factors play a role in who gets them and who doesn't.
Your immune system makes defence proteins, antibodies, whose job is to keep watch and attack any invading germs or other dangerous substances that get inside your body before they can make you sick.
An allergy happens when your body mistakes some usually harmless substance for a harmful intruder. These trigger molecules are allergens. The antibodies stick like suction cups to the allergens, setting off an immune system reaction. That process leads to common allergy symptoms: sneezing, a runny or stuffy nose, itchy, watery eyes, and a cough. These symptoms can be annoying but minor.
Allergies can also cause a life-threatening reaction, anaphylaxis, which requires immediate medical attention. For example, if someone ate a food they were allergic to, and then had throat swelling and a rash, that would be considered anaphylaxis.
The traditional treatment for anaphylaxis is a shot of the hormone epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) into the leg muscle. Allergy sufferers can also carryÂ an auto-injectorÂ to give themselves an emergency shot in case of a life-threatening case of anaphylaxis. An epinephrine nasal spray is now available, too, which also works very quickly.
A person can be allergic to things outdoors, like grass or tree pollen and bee stings, or indoors, like pets and tiny bugs called dust mites that hang out in carpets and mattresses.
A person can also be allergic to foods. Food allergiesÂ affect 4% to 5% of the population. The most common are to cow's milk, eggs, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish and sesame. Sometimes peopleÂ grow out of allergies, and sometimes they are lifelong.
Each antibody has a specific target, which is why some people may only be allergic to one thing.
The antibodies responsible for allergies also take care ofÂ cleaning up any parasitesÂ that your body encounters. Thanks to modern medicine, people in the United States rarely deal with parasites. Those antibodies are still ready to fight, though, and sometimes they misfire at silly things, like pollen or food.
Hygiene and the environment around you can also play a role in how likely it is you'll develop allergies. TheÂ more different kinds of bacteriaÂ that you're exposed to earlier in life, theÂ less likely you are to develop allergies. Studies have even shown that children whoÂ grow up on farms, children who have petsÂ before the age of five, and children who have a lot of siblings are less likely to develop allergies. Being breastfed as a baby can alsoÂ protect against having allergies.
Children whoÂ grow up in citiesÂ are more likely to develop allergies, probably due to air pollution, as are children who areÂ often around people who smoke.
Children are less likely to develop food allergies if theyÂ try foods early in lifeÂ rather than waiting until they are older. Sometimes aÂ certain job can contributeÂ to an adult developing environmental allergies. For example, hairdressers, bakers and car mechanics can develop allergies due to chemicals they work with.
Genetics can also play a huge role in why some people develop allergies. If a parent has environmental or food allergies, their child is more likely to have allergies. Specifically for peanut allergies, if your parent or sibling is allergic to peanuts, you areÂ seven times more likelyÂ to be allergic to peanuts.
Back to the idea of twins: yes, they can be allergic to the same things, but not always.
Researchers in Australia found that 60% to 70% of twins in one studyÂ both had environmental allergies, and identical twins were more likely to share allergies than fraternal (nonidentical) twins. Identical twins share 100% of their genes, while fraternal twins only share about 50% of their genes, the same as any pair of siblings.
More like this:
â¢ Climate change is making allergies worse
â¢ Meet Siku, the itchy polar bear with allergies
â¢ The science of probiotics and skin
A lot more research has been done on the genetics of food allergies. One peanut allergy study found thatÂ identical twins were more likelyÂ to both be allergic to peanuts than fraternal twins were.
So, twins can be allergic to the same things, and it's more likely that they will be, based on their shared genetics and growing up together. But twins aren't automatically allergic to the exact same things.
Imagine if two twins are separated at birth and raised in different homes: one on a farm with pets and one in the inner city. What if one's parents smoke, and the others don't? What if one lives with a lot of siblings and the other is an only child? They certainly could develop different allergies, or maybe not develop allergies at all.
Scientists like me are continuing to research allergies, and we hope to have more answers in the future.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxnkg7rln2o,M&S stops online orders and issues refunds after cyber attack,"Marks & Spencer (M&S) says it has stopped taking online orders as the company struggles to recover from a cyber attack.
Customers began reporting problems last weekend, and on Tuesday the retailer confirmed it was facing a ""cyber incident"".
Now, M&S has entirely paused orders on its website and apps - including for food deliveries and clothes - and says it will refund orders placed by customers on Friday.
The firm's shares fell by 5% following the announcement, before recovering.
Online orders remained paused on Saturday morning.
""We are truly sorry for this inconvenience,"" the retailer wrote in a post on X.
""Our experienced team - supported by leading cyber experts - is working extremely hard to restart online and app shopping.
""We are incredibly grateful to our customers, colleagues and partners for their understanding and support.""
It said its stores remain open despite the issues affecting online ordering.
Previously, the firm was dealing with problems which affected people using contactless payments, Click & Collect, as well as those paying with gift cards.
Since it suspended online ordering, M&S has responded to social media posts advising customers that these problems persist.
""Gift cards, e-gift cards and credit receipts can't currently be used as a payment method in store or online,"" it said in response to one person on X.
But it told another that if people have already received an email telling them an item is ready to be collected, they should be able to go into the store and pick it up.
""We're holding all parcels in store until further notice, so there's no risk of it being sent back,"" it said.
But some people have criticised the firm for its handling of the outage, particularly around its messaging to customers.
""After being told yesterday in the evening the problem with gift cards was sorted, went in store today and was sent away again,"" one person told the firm in a post on X.
They said it was the fourth day in a row they had tried and failed to use their M&S gift card.
Meanwhile, despite the frustrations, some people online have praised in-store staff over their service amid the problems, and called for customers not to take their frustrations out on workers.
But many still appear to have questions over how existing purchases, orders and returns will be impacted by the continued fallout from the cyber attack.
Online grocer Ocado, which sells M&S food on its platform, is unaffected by the problems as it runs on an entirely separate system.
A spokesperson from the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC that M&S was ""assessing the information provided"" after the retailer told it about the incident.
The firm previously said on Tuesday it had reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and the National Crime Agency told the BBC it was working with the NCSC to support the firm.
In an update to investors on Friday, M&S said its decision to pause online orders in the UK formed part of its ""proactive management"" of the incident.
""The M&S team - supported by leading experts - is working extremely hard to restore online operations and continue to serve customers well,"" it said.
Amid the continuing fallout of this week's cyber attack, however, experts are speculating around what may be behind it.
Nathaniel Jones, vice-president of security and AI strategy at cyber security firm Darktrace, said M&S halting online sales shows ""the cascading impact these attacks can have on revenue streams"".
""It demonstrates how quickly cyber incidents can cripple retail operations across both digital and physical channels,"" he added.
William Wright, from cybersecurity firm Closed Door Security, said he believed it could have a ""material impact"" on the firm.
""Data shows almost a quarter of the store's sales happen online, so no matter how long this pause is put in place, it will hurt M&S financially,"" he said.
The retailer is the latest major brand to experience significant disruption to its online services in recent months.
Morrisons faced huge problems with its Christmas orders last year, with deliveries cancelled and discounts not applied.
This was followed by two major banking outages on what was pay day for many in the first two months of this year.
In January, serious IT problems at Barclays affected the bank's app and online banking. It was later disclosed Barclays could face compensation payments of Â£12.5m.
In February, several banks - notably Lloyds - faced outages, leaving businesses unable to pay staff.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8q1176x0go,Nasa mission's out of this world for PhD student,"A few years ago, Duncan Lyster was studying physics at school in a market town in rural Herefordshire.
Today, he is in the US, working on a Nasa mission to uncover the ancient secrets of the solar system.
""It's really cool,"" summed up Mr Lyster, from Ross-on-Wye.
He got the opportunity to spend three weeks working with the space agency as part of his PhD in planetary sciences at the University of Oxford.
Nasa launched the Lucy probe in October 2021 as part of a $980m (Â£720m), 12-year mission to study Jupiter's trojans - groups of asteroids surrounding the solar system's largest planet.
Mr Lyster said they date back to the very earliest days of the solar system.
""The mission is actually named after the Lucy fossil, which is the first fossil discovered of an upright, walking human,"" he explained. ""That taught us a lot about early humans, and the aim of this mission is to learn about the early solar system and how the solar system formed.""
My Lyster admitted to being a little star-struck by some of the people he was working with.
""There's some really big names in science here,"" he said. ""I met a guy who basically, everything I've been doing for the last year and a half of my PhD is based on work that he did back in the 80s.""
He also found himself working alongside Queen guitarist Brian May - who famously finished his own doctorate in astronomy nearly four decades after he began - which Mr Lyster described as ""a bit of a surprise"".
Mr Lyster, whose fascination with space began in early childhood, said he was still amazed by the science behind launching probes into space.
""You're aiming at this tiny point of light, which you can only see with the most powerful telescopes.
""This is a spacecraft that's moving at 30,000mph relative to the asteroids. To be able to predict that with that level of precision - I still find it absolutely mind-boggling. Then we get these images back, and we get to have our first ever close-up look at this new asteroid that no one's ever seen before.
""It was a pretty special moment.""
A former student at Ross-on-Wye's John Kyrle High School - where he paid tribute to ""Mr Toomer, a fantastic physics teacher"" - Mr Lyster is already a long way from home.
So can he see himself going even further, following in some famous footsteps and taking a trip to space?
""If anyone's going to offer me a ride, I certainly won't say no.""
And what of the age-old question - is there intelligent life out there?
""The universe is so big, there are so many star systems, and we now know that almost every star we see in the sky has a planet or multiple planets orbiting it. I think it is overwhelmingly likely that there's something out there. Whether we'll ever see it or make contact with it is another question.
""But I think there's something out there.""

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250425-why-scientists-fear-attempts-to-resurrect-extinct-animals-may-backfire,Is resurrecting extinct animals a good idea?,"The creation of three ""dire wolf"" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns.
When news broke that Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas-based biotechnology company, had resurrected three extinct dire wolves, the internet reacted with awe. It is a species that last roamed the earth some 13,000 years ago, but has found recent fame thanks to Game of Thrones, which features fictional dire wolves.
The story was stoked further when a photograph of Game of Thrones author George R R Martin holding one of the adorable white pups was released. ""I have to say the rebirth of the direwolf has stirred me as no scientific news has since Neil Armstrong [walked] on the moon,"" Martin wrote on his blog.
Martin, who is an investor in Colossal, added that more extinct species were on the way, including the woolly mammoth, Tasmanian tiger and dodo.
Colossal â which is currently valued at $10bn (Â£7.6bn) and is backed by high-profile donors such as Chris Hemsworth, Paris Hilton and the CIA â boldly states on its website that it's ""going to fix"" the problem of extinction.
According to Matt James, the company's chief animal officer, the aim is not to create a Jurassic Park-like zoo full of extinct animals, but to reintroduce lost species back into the habitats they once occupied. Once those animals are settled in, Colossal expects them to exert positive change on their habitats. ""We're trying to focus on species that can have cascading effects on an ecosystem to improve stability, lift biodiversity and maybe even help with climate change buffering,"" James tells the BBC.
De-extinction has been talked about for decades. But Colossal's three dire wolves â which are actually grey wolves that possess 20 edited genes that are meant to give them dire wolf-like features â represent the most serious effort to date to make that lofty vision a reality.
In the wake of the dire wolf announcement, however, many scientists have criticised Colossal's approach. They see efforts to bring back long-extinct species as costly wastes of resources and a distraction from the significant work that's needed to save still-living species.
The BBC spoke with several experts in fields ranging from conservation biology to paleontology about efforts to resurrect species from extinction and whether they are likely to achieve the goals that Colossal hopes.
Chief among the concerns raised was that claiming it is possible to bring back extinct species may actually lead to more existing species being lost. It could give politicians and industries the idea that damage to the environment can be fixed by resurrecting species.
Such a message could be particularly damaging at a time when the US is withdrawing from international agreements on climate change and revoking measures intended protect the environment and wildlife, says David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist and independent consultant based in Washington, DC.
""It's beyond irresponsible for these people [Colossal] to be claiming some sort of conservation victory in this environment,"" he says.
This worry was quickly reinforced when Doug Burgum, the US Secretary of the Interior â who the Colossal team met with in advance of their dire wolf announcement â praised the company's work on X as a new ""bedrock for modern species conservation"". Burgum also criticised the ineffectiveness of the ""endangered species list"" â presumably a reference to the Red List of Threatened Species, drawn up by the International Union of Conservation (IUCN) or the list of threatened & endangered species maintained by branches of the US Government â thanks to what he characterised as a focus on regulation. ""Since the dawn of our nation, it has been innovation â not regulation â that has spawned American greatness,"" he wrote.
Biodiversity is under a seemingly endless onslaught of threats, virtually all of which are imposed by humans. The leading reasons, according to the IUCN, are habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation from fishing and hunting, illegal wildlife trade, pollution and climate change.
Colossal claims that its de-extinction work will directly benefit conservation. But the company needs to tie its work to ""ameliorating, alleviating or reversing something that's on that list"" of threats to biodiversity, says Kent Redford, former director of the Wildlife Conservation Society who now works as an independent conservation consultant in Portland, Maine.
While Colossal's de-extinction work is ""super-cool science,"" he continues, he does not see it alleviating any of the threats highlighted by the IUCN.
Colossal sees things otherwise. The company states on its website that woolly mammoths reintroduced to the Arctic, for example, will increase those habitats' resilience to climate change through their foraging behavior, which they say will help to keep carbon locked in permafrost in the ground. By scraping away snow, the company says, mammoths will expose the soil below to cold air, causing it to stay frozen.
However, Nitin Sekar, a conservation scientist with the Asian elephant specialist group at the IUCN, says he has struggled to find evidence in the scientific literature to support this claim. One study comparing carbon storage in the Arctic tundra to taiga forest found the soil in areas covered in trees could store nearly twice as much carbon overall. Only slightly more was found in the permafrost of the tundra than in the taiga. Nor could he find anything else about how mammoths might have affected carbon in general.
Some research on existing species of arctic herbivores suggests that they can reduce permafrost thawing. One scoping study by researchers at the University of Oxford does point to the role mammoths had on the climate during the Pleistocene and suggests bison and horses could replicate some of that role. But those species need to be maintained at high densities â where they are fenced, fed and managed by humans â to have any protective effect. The Arctic ecosystem is also different today than it was in the Pleistocene, so it is also hard to say whether mammoth hybrids would have that same effect on today's landscape as species like caribou and reindeer.
There could be other ways that mammoths affect carbon levels. As temperatures increase, the act of trampling and scraping away snow could actually accelerate permafrost melting by exposing it to the Sun â an effect that some research suggests is already happening in wet lowlands in the Arctic.
""Overall, with the data we have now, it's just impossible to know how mammoths affected their environment millennia ago, or how the mammoth-elephant hybrids will behave in our warmer future,"" Sekar says. ""It seems like a strange thing to gamble on in the face of an existential crisis, given the alternatives.""
James calls for more research to resolve these questions and show ""direct links and causation in a way that can help to bring the rest of the scientific community along on this journey"".
Dire wolves and woolly mammoths were driven extinct by the complex forces of a changing planet, not just by human activities. For species that humans are responsible for annihilating, though, simply bringing them back does not help to address the threats that pushed them to extinction in the first place, says Corinne Kendall, programme director for Southern Africa at the Peregrine Fund, a non-profit organisation that aims to conserve birds of prey around the world.
Modern conservationists recognise this and are increasingly focused on landscape-level solutions rather than saving a particular favourite species, Kendall adds.
""That's what's missing in the way Colossal is approaching this,"" she says. ""If you only address the genetics and technology side of things, it's interesting from a scientific discovery standpoint, but you're creating the trees without the forest.""
Julie Meachen, a vertebrate paleontologist and morphologist at Des Moines University in Iowa, believes, however, that the genetic techniques Colossal used to create its dire wolves are applicable to conservation. The company is also exploring ways to help still-living species such as the northern white rhino, elephants and endangered pigeons, she points out. ""These techniques could be applied to any species suffering from genetic diversity loss and to combat inbreeding or genetic bottlenecks in low population sizes,"" she says.
""I think the conservation work that Colossal is doing is far more important than the de-extinction work, but this conservation work does not get the same press coverage as the flashy de-extinction part,"" she adds. ""That is unfortunate.""
James at Colossal agrees that de-extinction technologies are just ""one piece of a very complex puzzle"" that must also include things like habitat protection. But he says that attention-grabbing headlines about extinct species being brought back to life can act like ""a giant ship"" pulling ""all these other projects in its wake"".
It is also important to be clear about what Colossal is actually able to achieve. It is unlikely to ever be possible to truly resurrect long-gone species like dire wolves or woolly mammoths, say scientists not involved with the company. Tissue samples from animals that have been extinct for tens of thousands of years lack the intact cells needed for traditional cloning techniques, says Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. ""What Colossal is engaging in is genetic modification of modern species to give them physical characteristics to make them look like extinct species.""
This in itself is a significant technical achievement, argues Colossal and its supporters.
In the case of the dire wolves, the three puppies it managed to breed are in reality ""genetically modified grey wolves"", say researchers. Essentially the genome of modern wolves was edited to replicate small segments of ancient DNA obtained from the fossilised remains of dire wolves. They are, the company admits, grey wolves with dire wolf characteristics.
But scientists have even questioned some of those characteristics.It's unlikely, for example, that dire wolves would have been white, but Colossal chose to make its animals white ""because of popular conceptions from Game of Thrones"", Gill says. ""This was an aesthetic choice, not a biological or scientific one.""
Even if Colossal did bring back animals that very closely resembled Ice Age species, they still would not be the same as the bona fide ones that lived thousands of years ago because the Pleistocene ecosystem they inhabited no longer exists, Meachen says. ""A dire wolf or any other species is not only its genes, but also its environment and all the other species living there.""
Colossal says it has no plans of releasing dire wolves into the wild. But it does aspire to eventually repopulate parts of the Arctic with woolly mammoths. This would require engineering a lot of baby mammoth proxies, which the company plans to do by using Asian or African elephants as surrogates.
In the West especially, though, some people are starting to question the ethics of whether elephants â extremely intelligent, social and sentient beings â should be kept in captivity at all, much less be experimented on, Sekar says. Asian elephants in modern zoo facilities also frequently suffer from infertility and lose their calves to stillbirths and infanticides twice as often as elephants in semi-wild conditions, he says, while mothers deeply mourn dead calves. ""Are we really ok putting elephants through that so we can have these visually entertaining animals that aren't even real mammoths?"" asks Sekar.
James says that Colossal will have many quality control steps to ensure things go well for the elephants, and that the company will also be working with leading animal welfare experts to ""avoid potential welfare pitfalls ahead"".
Colossal has not disclosed how much it invested in the dire wolf programme â but it's likely in the many millions of dollars. While costs of new technologies do eventually go down with scale, even if de-extinction does get cheaper, it will still be orders of magnitude more affordable and effective to stop species from going extinct in the first place, Shiffman says. Moreover, if the original drivers of extinction are not addressed, then de-extinct species could quickly become re-extinct, he warns.
While Redford acknowledges that money is not fungible, if Colossal's primary goal really is conservation, then he says he has a hard time viewing its work on de-extinction as being ""the right investment to make"".
For every extinct species that Colossal is bringing back, however, James says the company is also investing in a surviving endangered species. Work is being done to introduce greater genetic diversity to populations of endangered red wolves in the US, for example, and to engineer elephants to be resistant to herpes virus.
But while red wolves do have some issues with genetic diversity, their biggest threats are road collisions and human persecution, Kendall says. Without addressing ""how the animal is going to survive on the ground"", the genetic component becomes ""kind of irrelevant"".
Herpes also only kills a fraction of the number of wild Asian elephants each year compared to those killed by humans, says Sekar, , who has reviewed data from the Indian government about causes of elephant deaths. Around two wild elephants are known to die per year of herpes compared to around 100 killed in some way by humans, he says.
Colossal could leverage its synthetic biology expertise in ways that are clear wins for the planet, experts say. Crops that are engineered to more efficiently take up nitrogen, for example, could be a huge boon for reducing the steep climate costs of nitrogen fertiliser and lessening the major dead zones that its runoffs cause in water bodies. Finding ways to engineer high quality animal proteins for human consumption could, likewise, be a game-changer for alleviating the many environmental and animal welfare concerns that plague the livestock industry, the experts say.
""Colossal clearly has very talented biologists on their team,"" Sekar says. ""If they were to turn their attention to addressing problems like that, they could really be the heroes of conservation.""

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250424-the-body-wrapped-in-plastic-the-image-that-defined-covid-19,The photo that captures Covid's terrible toll,"In April 2020, Indonesian photographer Joshua Irwandi captured one of the most chilling and poignant images of Covid-19's toll.
Covid-19 was first confirmed in Indonesia on 2 March 2020 â a dance instructor and her mother tested positive after coming into contact with someone with the virus.
Indonesia is a vast country made up of thousands of islands, but it took little more than a month for the disease to spread to every one of its 34 provinces, among them Java.
Java is the most heavily populated island in the world, home to more than 151 million people. As the pandemic spread, Java â and its densely packed capital Jakarta â became an epicentre of the disease's spread.
Indonesia's health workers battled this new disease with scant resources at first. One study estimated that by July 2021, more than 1,500 Indonesia health workers had been killed by the disease. Nurses in the densely populated country reported shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the early stages of the pandemic as they dealt with the increasing caseload.
Indonesia, of course, was not facing this disease alone. As part of a series looking at the global response to the virus in April 2020, National Geographic commissioned Indonesian photographer Joshua Irwandi to cover his country's battle against Covid.
Clad in a protective suit like the health workers he was shadowing, Irwandi spent his days inside a Jakarta hospital, observing firsthand how health workers were trying to save lives.
They were not always successful. One victim â the patient's identity has never been revealed to the public â died in their hospital bed. Irwandi took a picture after the body had been wrapped in protective coverings to prevent infection.
""This is the procedure that that was mandated by the Indonesian Ministry of Health,"" says Irwandi. ""How to, you know, dispose of the bodies, you have to wrap them. What happened that day was I was shadowing the doctors and nurses in the hospital, and I was informed that there was a patient who just passed away.""
Irwandi first took pictures of the nurses, clad head-to-toe in protective gear, covering the body in whatever material they had to hand. ""First with infectious waste bags, actually, and after the body was sort of wrapped up they'd start wrapping with plastic wrap that you see in the supermarket,"" he says. ""I think it took a gruelling hour or so in the heat. They thought that if we turn off the air conditioner, then it might kill the virus. And you're operating under this hot mask.""
Irwandi's calm but chilling photograph belies the frenzied activity that was taking place hospitals as Covid-19 struck. The plastic wrap catches the cold, hard glare from the ceiling lights, while the coverings underneath look like something that could have wrapped a body in a ceremonial funeral thousands of years ago.
This eerie figure lies in stark contrast to the modern-day setting: an anonymous hospital room, empty except for a bed and television set. With its sombre, painterly quality, it reminds us that even in our industrialised, often antiseptic modern world, we remain vulnerable.
""The whole time I worked with my mentor here in Indonesia, Geert Van Castelren, who's a Dutch photographer. I was also showing him what kind of images I've been making, asking him 'where do you think this is going'. If you're talking about composition, the more that it resembles something from the classics, usually the stronger the impact of the photograph would make.""
And make an impact Irwandi's photo did. ""A lot of people accused the image of a set-up,"" says Irwandi. ""There was a singer with two million followers who basically thought that this is a whole setup, and Covid is not that dangerous. People said that it's a mannequin inside.
""You can imagine the sort of misinformation and disinformation at the time. I was given access for a very specific job. Obviously, it's very different to what the public might be seeing or feeling.""
Irwandi took a conscious decision to take the photo from the same height as the body: it is not the top-down view that a health worker or doctor would have when attending to the body. This positioning puts both the viewer and the subject at the same level.
""When I was in that moment photographing somebody being wrapped in plastic. Could it be my family next? Could it be my friends next? The best you can do is inform your loved ones that this is happening, and take care of yourself,"" Irwandi says. ""I think that is the main message from the photo: if you don't put on your mask, or if you reject science, this is potentially how people could end up.""
The image drew reaction far from Indonesia. It was given second prize in the general news category of the World Press Photo in 2021 and was also nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
Amid the social media-fuelled furore around the image, people continued to contract the disease and die. By the end of the year, more than 800,000 cases had been confirmed in Indonesia and more than 20,000 people had died.
More like this:
â¢ Five years on: The countries that never locked down
â¢ When empty became the new normal
â¢ The heat-showing shape of things to come
""It wasn't the first patient who died that I photographed, and it's not the last either,"" says Irwandi. ""The following year, you know, Jakarta became the epicentre of Covid in Asia. You could imagine, how many people were influenced by those who thought that Covid was not dangerous, or who thought that 'this is all a set-up, this is fake news', or whatever, and those people died anyway.
Irwandi said the photo had extra resonance for him when he covered mass burials of Covid victims in a graveyard a year later. He visited twice within a week, and fresh plots had already been dug for more victims. ""The danger is real, whether or not people like the photograph,"" he says.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86je4vyg36o,China has halted rare earth exports. Can Australia step up?,"Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (Â£580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.
The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.
China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.
Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?
Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named ""rare"" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.
Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades â including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.
Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.
Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining â which makes them usable in technology â takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.
And that has spooked Western governments.
Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.
But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.
Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.
Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had ""dropped the ball"" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.
""China has its foot on the blood veinâ¦ of US and European defence systems,"" he added.
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.
Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both ""domestic industry and international partners"", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.
But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as ""long overdue"", added that the proposal is ""not going to solve the problem"".
The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.
Lithium â not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels â is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.
Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.
Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.
But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.
China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.
In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to ""join hands"" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.
Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.
But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.
Alicia GarcÃ­a-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was ""more sophisticated"" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.
If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.
But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.
""If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West â especially the US â there are weak spots China can enter â and the most important is refining.""",James Chater,25 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpexxe42wo,UK scientist given Moon samples from China mission,"An academic from the Open University (OU) has been selected as the first UK scientist to carry out research on Moon samples from China's lunar exploration programme.
Prof Mahesh Anand, who is based at the OU's Milton Keynes laboratories, is to receive materials from the Chinese lunar mission, Chang'e-5, which returned Moon samples to Earth in December 2020.
He applied to conduct research on Chang'e-5 samples in Dec 2023 and is one of seven experts globally chosen to receive the material.
Prof Anand has been conducting lunar research for more than 20 years, working with colleagues at the OU to uncover the secrets of the Moon, including the presence of water on its surface.
China's robotic Chang'e-5 mission was sent to a site on the lunar nearside called Oceanus Procellarum in November 2020.
It was carefully chosen to add to the sum of knowledge gained from previous sample returns - the last of which was conducted by a Soviet probe in 1976.
The OU team at Milton Keynes plan to use the lunar materials to determine the amount and isotopic composition of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and noble gases in Chang'e-5 samples.
The results will be used to evaluate the giant-impact origin of the Moon and develop new insights into the history of volatiles such as carbon and nitrogen in the Earth-Moon system, the OU said.
This is the first time lunar samples returned by a Chinese space mission will have been allocated to international principal investigators, said the OU.
Prof Anand said being chosen was ""a great honour and privilege for my team"".
""This is a recognition of our world-leading lunar sample research, underpinned by long-term funding from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC/UKRI) and the OU's commitment towards maintaining world-class analytical laboratories,"" he said.
A spokesperson for the Chinese National Space Agency (CNSA), said sharing the samples was ""win-win cooperation"".
""The international sharing of lunar samples and joint research efforts enable scientists from around the world to study the Moon's formation and evolution, fostering collaborative exploration of the universe's mysteries,"" they said.
Dr James Carpenter, head of the lunar science office at the European Space Agency, said: ""The Chang'e-5 lunar samples provide a unique window into the history of the Solar System, and the Open University is one of the best places in the world to unravel the scientific story that's these samples have to tell.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxnqez6e7xo,Smartwatch app accurately tracks drinking habits,"A smartwatch app which records people's alcohol consumption could provide a more accurate picture of drinking habits for researchers.
The University of Bristol trialled the AlcoWatch on 32 participants from the city's Children of the 90s health study over 12 weeks.
They were prompted five times a day to record any alcoholic drinks they had, where they were consumed and whether it was in a social situation.
Dr Andy Skinner said: ""Smartwatch-based methods for data capture could help researchers explore a much wider range of health-related behaviours, and develop new interventions to help with important issues like problematic drinking.""
Traditional methods of recording alcohol consumption involve adding notes to a diary, which relies on individuals remembering to write it down.
The university's trial found that the app resulted in higher engagement from participants, leading to more accurate data.
It follows on from a previous app created by the university which aimed to help people stop smoking.
Chris Stone, a lead researcher on the AlcoWatch study, said: ""We've produced an app which asks quick, simple questions about people's drinking behaviour.
""Capturing the data as people are drinking is a better way to do it,"" he added.
It is hoped that the app could be rolled out to the public and the NHS in the future to help people monitor their drinking habits.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62jxdxng7do,Who will win the race to develop a humanoid robot?,"It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.
I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.
Standing at about 4'3"" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.
Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.
He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.
Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.
They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.
Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.
The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.
It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.
But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.
Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.
To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.
So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.
""The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,"" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.
""Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning â such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way â a challenge,"" they said.
At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.
For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.
The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that ""several thousand"" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing ""useful things"" in Tesla factories.
Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.
Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.
Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.
""The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],"" he says.
Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (Â£12,500).
Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.
In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.
Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.
For example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.
So how can US and European robot makers compete with that?
Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.
While the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia.
""The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.
""So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.""
As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.
Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.
""All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?"" he asks.
Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.
""My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,"" he says.
Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real ""secret sauce"" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.
""A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.
""What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,"" Mr Pierce says.
He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.
The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year.
So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.
""My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,"" says Mr Pierce.
""I still think eventually they will be there, but I think that's at least 10 to 15 years away.""",Carrie King and Ben Morris,25 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrwdw124do,Trump to meet Atlantic editor who was added to secret Signal chat,"President Donald Trump will meet with The Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief who was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat with administration officials discussing air strikes against the Houthi group in Yemen.
Trump said on social media Thursday that he would be meeting Jeffrey Goldberg, and two of Mr Goldberg's colleagues, Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer, later in the day.
""I am doing this interview out of curiosity, and as a competition with myself, just to see if it's possible for The Atlantic to be 'truthful,'' Trump wrote.
Trump claimed the journalists were ""not exactly pro-Trump writers"" and questioned whether they were ""capable of writing a fair story on 'TRUMP'?""
In the post, Trump said the interview would be for a story titled ""The Most Consequential President of this Century"". When contacted by the BBC,  The Atlantic had no comment.
The interview comes a month after Mr Goldberg published a story about being added to a secret group chat on the encrypted texting app Signal. In the text chain, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top US officials discussed the details of an upcoming attack against the Houthis.
The scandal rocked the White House. Then, in April, the New York Times and others reported that Hegseth had shared information about the same military action in a second private Signal group chat, which included his wife, brother and personal lawyer.
Trump has continued to stand by his defence secretary and others involved in the incident, telling reporters earlier this week: ""Pete's doing a great job ... Everybody's happy with him.""
Hegseth's wife, Jennifer Rauchet, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon.
His brother, Phil, and personal lawyer Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings about sensitive US strike plans.
The White House repeatedly has played down the scandals, claiming no ""classified"" information was shared with the Atlantic editor in the first chat. That thread included information about the exact timings of the air strikes as well as the weaponry being used, before the attack had taken place.",Madeline Halpert,25 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn3gnee77o,Bereaved parents demand tech firms 'protect children',"A group of British parents who believe social media played a part in the death of their children have travelled to the US to demand better online safety protections for children.
Four families flew to New York City to protest with hundreds of others from the US and Canada outside the offices of Meta - owner of Facebook and Instagram.
""All we're asking for is can you please help us protect our children,"" said Mark Kenevan, father of Isaac who died aged 13 from taking part in a social media challenge.
Their visit comes as media regulator Ofcom announced that websites will be legally required to block children's access to harmful content from July to continue operating in the UK.
Websites will also have to introduce more rigorous age checks, according to its final children's code of practice published on Thursday.
BBC Breakfast followed the four British families on their mission in the US.
The British parents walked with American families through the streets of New York City. Some parents held signs saying ""Meta profits, kids pay the price"".
Others clutched framed treasured photos of their children, who had died.
Lisa Kenevan, mother of Isaac, said the families banding together had given each other strength.
""We just want government, we want tech companies to understand that we are getting stronger, our voices are getting stronger, and we're not going to go away,"" she said.
A coroner ruled that Isaac had died in 2022 as a result of misadventure, but the Kenevans say social media platforms were also to blame.
This year they were among several families who filed a wrongful death lawsuit against TikTok in the US, which accuses the platform of pushing dangerous prank and challenge videos to children to boost engagement time.
Maia Walsh's family, who are part of the lawsuit, also believe the 13-year-old died from injuries while taking part in an online challenge. An inquest into her death will examine her use of TikTok.
Her father Liam Walsh, talking about the New York protest, told BBC Breakfast: ""I feel as though we're getting recognition for what happened to our children, because there is something in it - it's not just desperate parents clutching at straws.
""We're slowly revealing what happened to our children, and this is part of that movement.""
TikTok says it prohibits dangerous content or challenges on the platform, and directs those who search for hashtags or videos to its safety centre.
Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, says it also shares the goal of keeping teens safe online and had recently introduced ""teen accounts"" with enhanced protections.
""We believe teens deserve consistent protections across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms,"" Meta said in a statement.
Also among the parents in New York is Ellen Roome, who believes her 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died after an online challenge went wrong in 2022 and his social media accounts could provide the evidence needed. An inquest into his death found he took his own life.
""[He was] just a normal, lovely boy. Not one moment in our life did we think we would be in this position... there was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem,"" Ms Roome said, who is campaigning for legislation to grant parents access to their children's social media accounts if they die.
""I almost want to tell parents 'you don't know what your children are looking at'.
""This isn't for our children because it's too late, but for them to have that conversation with their children about what are they looking at, what are they seeing.""
The BBC previously approached TikTok, X, Snapchat, Discord and Meta - which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads - to ask about Ms Roome's case.
None of them gave a formal response, but a spokesperson from Snapchat previously said: ""Our hearts go out to Ms Roome and her family for the loss of Jools.
""We have extra protections for under 18s and offer parental tools so parents can see who their teens are communicating with and report any concerns.""
A spokesperson for TikTok has also previously said the company had removed 99% of videos showing or promoting dangerous content before it was reported by a user.
Also among the parents in New York was Lorin LaFave, mother of 14-year-old Breck Bednar who was lured to his death in 2014 after being groomed online whilst gaming.
The online safety campaigner, who now shares Breck's story in schools through the Breck Foundation, said: ""I would love to see age restrictions. For me I think children need their childhood longer.
""They're being exposed to so much adult content and adult relationships too soon, too young, and you're only a child once.""",Jon Kay,25 April 2025,0

Prince Harry and Meghan unveiled a memorial in New York City which is dedicated to the memory of children whose families believe harmful material online contributed to their deaths.
""We want to make sure that things are changed so that... no more kids are lost to social media,"" Prince Harry told BBC Breakfast in New York.
""Life is better off social media,"" he added, saying that he was ""grateful"" that his children were still too young to be online.
""The easiest thing to say is to keep your kids away from social media,"" Prince Harry said at an Archewell Foundation event in New York.
""The sad reality is the kids who aren't on social media normally get bullied at school because they can't be part of the same conversation as everybody else.""
The installation unveiled by Prince Harry and Meghan is called the Lost Screen Memorial and is made of 50 smartphone-shaped light-boxes, each displaying a photograph of a child whose life was lost ""due to the harms of social media"". It will be open for 24 hours.
The children's images were shared by parents who are part of the Parents' Network. This is a support network, set up by Prince Harry and Meghan's Archewell Foundation, for parents whose children have experienced harm from social media.
Prince Harry and Meghan have been supporting families who say social media played a role in the deaths of their children.
They have backed calls to technology firms that say parents should be able to gain access to information on the phones of children who have died, despite arguments about privacy.
The prince said tech firms were ""getting away with it"" by arguing they didn't need to disclose information to UK families because of privacy considerations.
""You are telling a parent, you are telling a dad and a mum that they can't have the details of what their kid was up to on social media because of the privacy of their kid. It's wrong,"" he said.
Meghan said the danger of social media was a global issue and ""one thing we can all agree on is that children should be safe"".
She praised the parents who were speaking out.
""I think in many ways what we see through these parents is the hope and the promise of something better, because... they just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else,"" said Meghan.
Separately to Prince Harry and Meghan's event in New York, a group of British parents staged a protest outside Meta's offices on Thursday.
Ellen Roome, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, was among the families.
She believes her 14-year-old son Jools died after an online challenge went wrong in 2022. She says his social media accounts could provide evidence. An inquest into his death found he took his own life.
Earlier in the week, Ms Roome told BBC Breakfast: ""It's too late for our son Jools, but there are plenty of other children around the world that we still need to help. This is a massive issue globally.
""There was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem.""

Customers began reporting problems on the weekend, with the retailer confirming on Tuesday it was dealing with a ""cyber incident.""
It told the BBC on Wednesday that customer-facing systems were back to normal.
However, it has since confirmed it has been forced to take some systems offline as part of its ""proactive management of the incident.""
It said it had stopped processing contactless payments, had paused the collection of click and collect orders in stores, and warned of delays to online order deliveries.
Contactless payments have since been restored, the BBC has been told, however this has been questioned by some customers.
BBC staff have described witnessing the impact of the suspension of contactless payments.
At Euston station, in London, shop staff were seen shouting that it was cash only as the payments system was down.  Disruption was also seen in Glasgow, and a store at Edinburgh Haymarket seemingly closed early.
M&S says it had made the ""decision to move some of our processes offline to protect our colleagues, partners, suppliers and our business"".
But stores remain open and customers could ""continue to shop on our website and our app"", the statement added.
But confusion has reigned on social media amongst M&S customers.
The firm has responded to some posts on X (formerly Twitter) in the past few hours advising customers contactless payments can be taken in stores
However, this has been contradicted by some individuals, with one saying: ""That is wrong - only chip and pin or cash is working"".
M&S also told click & collect customers not to travel to a store ""until they have received their 'Ready To Collect' email"".
Some customers also questioned that, with one person saying after receiving their email, ""store staff said they are unable to retrieve the item""
The company has declined to provide detail on the nature of the attack, but moving systems offline is often a response to ransomware attacks.
On Tuesday the firm said in a notice to investors that it had engaged ""external cyber security experts to assist with investigating and managing the incident.
""We are taking actions to further protect our network and ensure we can continue to maintain customer service,"" it added.
The company said it also reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre which told the BBC it was ""working with Marks and Spencer to support their response to a cyber incident"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68225707,How can you keep your child safe online?,"Tech firms will have to do more to protect young people from harmful content under new safety measures announced by the media regulator.
Ofcom's own research found that 59% of 13 to 17-year olds surveyed had seen ""potentially harmful content"" online in the previous month.
As part of implementing the Online Safety Act, the regulator has finalised a series of child safety rules which will come into force for social media, search and gaming apps and websites on 25 July 2025.
Ofgem says the rules will prevent young people from encountering the most harmful content relating to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and pornography.
They are also designed to protect children from misogynistic, violent, hateful or abusive material, online bullying and dangerous challenges.
Firms which wish to continue operating in the UK must adopt more than 40 practical measures, including:
Failure to comply could result in businesses being fined Â£18m or 10% of their global revenues, or their executives being jailed.
In very serious cases Ofcom says it can apply for a court order to prevent the site or app from being available in the UK.
A number of campaigners want to see even stricter rules for tech firms, and some want under-16s banned from social media completely.
Ian Russell, chairman of the Molly Rose Foundation - which was set up in memory of his daughter who took her own life aged 14 - said he was ""dismayed by the lack of ambition"" in the codes.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are also calling for stronger protection from the dangers of social media, saying ""enough is not being done"".
They unveiled a temporary memorial in New York City dedicated to children who have died due to the harms of the internet. ""We want to make sure that things are changed so that... no more kids are lost to social media,"" Prince Harry told BBC Breakfast.
The NSPCC children's charity argues that the law still doesn't provide enough protection for private messaging apps. It says that the end-to-end encrypted services which they offer ""continue to pose an unacceptable, major risk to children"".
On the other side, privacy campaigners complain the new rules threaten users' freedom.
Some also argue age verification methods are invasive without being effective enough. Digital age checks can lead to ""security breaches, privacy intrusion, errors, digital exclusion and censorship,"" according to Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch.
The bill also requires firms to show they are committed to removing illegal content, including:
The Act has also created new offences, such as:
Children aged eight to 17 spend between two and five hours online per day, according to Ofcom research.
It found that nearly every child over 12 has a mobile phone and almost all of them watch videos on platforms such as YouTube or TikTok.
About half of children over 12 think being online is good for their mental health, according to Ofcom.
However, the Children's Commissioner said that half of the 13-year-olds her team surveyed reported seeing ""hardcore, misogynistic"" pornographic material on social media sites. Children also said material about suicide self-harm and eating disorders was ""prolific"" and that violent content was ""unavoidable"".
The NSPCC says it's vital that parents talk to their children about internet safety and take an interest in what they do online.
Two-thirds of parents say they use controls to limit what their children see online, according to Internet Matters, a safety organisation set up by some of the big UK-based internet companies.
It has a list of parental controls available and step-by-step guides on how to use them.
These include advice on how to manage teen or child accounts on social media, video platforms such as YouTube, and gaming platforms such as Roblox or Fortnite.
However Ofcom data suggests that about one in five children are able to disable parental controls.
Instagram has already introduced ""teen accounts"" which turn on many privacy settings by default - although some researchers have claimed they were able to circumvent the promised protections.
Phone and broadband networks may block some explicit websites until a user has demonstrated they are over 18.
Some also have parental controls that can limit the websites children can visit on their phones.
Android and Apple devices also offer options for parents to block or limit access to specific apps, restrict explicit content, prevent purchases and monitor browsing.
Game console controls also let parents ensure age-appropriate gaming and control in-game purchases.",Unknown,24 April 2025,0

Ofcom says its ""Children's Codes"" - the final versions of which have now been published - will offer ""transformational new protections"".
Platforms which host pornography, or offer content which encourages self-harm, suicide or eating disorders are among those which must take more robust action to prevent children accessing their content.
Ofcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes said it was a ""gamechanger"" but critics say the restrictions do not go far enough and were ""a bitter pill to swallow"".
Ian Russell, chairman of the Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up in memory of his daughter - who took her own life aged 14 - said he was ""dismayed by the lack of ambition"" in the codes.
But Dame Melanie told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that age checks were a first step as ""unless you know where children are, you can't give them a different experience to adults.
""There is never anything on the internet or in real life that is fool proofâ¦ [but] this represents a gamechanger.""
She admitted that while she was ""under no illusions"" that some companies ""simply either don't get it or don't want to"", but emphasised the Codes had legal force.
""If they want to serve the British public and if they want the privilege in particular in offering their services to under 18s, then they are going to need to change the way those services operate.""
Prof Victoria Baines, a former safety officer at Facebook told the BBC it is ""a step in the right direction"".
Talking to the Today Programme, she said: ""Big tech companies are really getting to grips with it , so they are putting money behind it, and more importantly they're putting people behind it.""
Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said key to the rules was tackling the algorithms which decide what children get shown online.
""The vast majority of kids do not go searching for this material, it just lands in their feeds,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.
Kyle told The Telegraph he was separately looking into a social media curfew for under-16s, but would not ""act on something that will have a profound impact on every single child in the country without making sure that the evidence supports it"".
The new rules for platforms are subject to parliamentary approval under the Online Safety Act.
The regulator says they contain more than 40 practical measures tech firms must take, including:

A few months ago in my new Berlin apartment, my toilet and I were at war. No amount of scrubbing or toilet cleaner would evict the limescale coating inside. Frustrated, I turned to Google and stumbled across a page recommending vinegar â something that the previous inhabitant had left behind in abundance. After dropping two tablespoons full of ""Essigessenz"" â essentially concentrated vinegar â into the toilet and waiting for half an hour, I scrubbed and the limescale came off in a moment.
Since then, I've enthusiastically used vinegar to rid my world of limescale. I've found it even more effective than my regular kitchen spray cleaner for getting my sink sparkling. That includes the faucet, which I wrapped in a vinegar-soaked kitchen tissue â whereas my regular cleaning spray dribbled off. And rather than having to buy special tablets to clean my limescale-smothered glass kettle, I simply poured two tablespoons of concentrated vinegar inside and boiled it. As the limescale crackled off, it made a satisfying sizzling sound.
I wondered if vinegar had other advantages. Did it also kill off bacteria and other germs? And, importantly, was this simple, natural product better for the environment and for my health than regular cleaning products?
The internet is full of sustainability influencers and green cleaning blogs that advertise vinegar as a jack-of-all-trades and a safer and ""greener"" alternative to ""toxic"" cleaning products. These claims make sense on the surface; vinegar is after all just fermented alcohol and has long been used as a food preservative, in salad dressings, as well as a household cleaner â but I wanted evidence. After interviewing three experts, I learned that while some of these claims are true, the benefits of vinegar depend a lot on how it's used and the kind of grime you're trying to get rid of.
Reassuringly, Eric Beckman, a chemical engineer and emeritus professor at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, told me that the best cleaning use for acetic acid â the main component of vinegar â is exactly what I had been using it for: as a descaler. Limescale â and rust, for that matter â consists of certain ions that dissolve more easily in acidic fluids like vinegar, he says. Beckman uses vinegar himself to get limescale off mirrors, while the microbiologist Dirk BockmÃ¼hl of Germany's Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences prefers using lemon juice, which contains citric acid, which he says is a more effective descaler and smells better. (Read more about why vinegar is such an effective cleaner.)
That said, vinegar doesn't work on everything. Beckman says that soap does a better job at removing oily films on dishes, while baking soda is effective against processed oils that have stuck onto surfaces while cooking. (Read more about whether baking soda is environmentally friendly).
However, Beckman expresses exasperation about a popular remedy of mixing vinegar together with baking soda. The mixture is chemically quite useless, he says, as the acid of vinegar and the base of baking soda effectively cancel each other out. ""I use both, but not together,"" says Beckman. ""Together, they give you nothing.""
And while vinegar is often touted as a powerful antimicrobial, BockmÃ¼hl says, the truth is more nuanced. In a 2020 study, BockmÃ¼hl and his colleagues put vinegar to the test against a selection of disease-causing bacteria, viruses and fungi. While many internet recommendations suggest adding a dash of vinegar into a bucket of water for cleaning, BockmÃ¼hl found that its anti-microbial effects only kick in at an acetic acid concentration of 5% â its concentration in pure vinegar. And it was only fully effective at distilled concentrations of 10% Â â to which the researchers added a dash of citric acid â in killing off five common bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as a mould, a yeast and a weakened strain of the vaccinia virus. Other studies have found that similar concentrations also work against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.
But even these concentrations didn't work against the MRSA bacterium, an especially stubborn strain of Staphylococcus aureus that's resistant to certain antibiotics, while countless bacteria remain untested. Many bacteria â including the ones that ferment alcohol into vinegar â thrive in acids, Beckman adds: ""Then they'll be like, 'ooh, yay, vinegar.'"" Some moulds, too, are resistant to acetic acid while some viruses â like norovirus â might be, too, BockmÃ¼hl suspects. Beckman says that soaps are more effective against bacteria, while standard disinfectants work better against viruses and moulds. Harsh treatments like bleach will definitely kill everything, Beckman says â although bleach can be unsafe if used incorrectly.
BockmÃ¼hl stresses that, even for the germs that vinegar does kill, a relatively high concentration is needed. The concentration won't be adequate ""if you just put a teaspoon of vinegar into your cleaning solution"", BockmÃ¼hl says.
However, the higher the dose of acetic acid, the more irritating it can be on the skin, he adds. It is harmful if it gets into your eyes. Surfaces can suffer, too: vinegar corrodes natural stone and metals like copper, bronze and brass, according to the Italian chemist Dario Bressanini's book The Science of Cleaning. And in dishwashers or washing machines, it can harm the rubber gaskets used to seal them, while it could also damage coffee machines and strip away the coating on tiles and grout, Bressanini writes. But BockmÃ¼hl assures me that it's fine to use vinegar on glass and ceramic surfaces â like my toilet â and stainless steel sinks.
The trouble that BockmÃ¼hl sees with using homemade cleaning products is that they don't come with instructions or safety recommendations. ""They might be safe if you know what you're doing,"" he says, ""but there are a lot of really stupid and absurd recommendations on the internet"".

â¢ Seven proven ways to help the planet in 2025
To learn more about how the health risks of vinegar compare with those of conventional cleaners, I called up Nicola Carslaw, professor of indoor air chemistry at the University of York in the UK. Her concern is how cleaners disrupt the air in our homes and buildings. It's known that professional domestic cleaners tend to have higher rates of asthma than other occupational groups, although it's proven difficult to pin that on any single product or ingredient.
In a recent study, Carslaw and her colleagues tested 23 different cleaning products including dishwasher fluid, washing up liquid and spray products, and found that many of them released volatile chemical compounds (VOCs). Some of these compounds, like terpenes, are often added to give pleasant aromas, such as lavender or pine oil, but they're highly reactive in the atmosphere. Terpenes for instance, easily react with ozone in the air, creating miniscule particles. In general, inhaling particles of this size has been linked to lung and heart disease.
""Your nose is a really good filter for the big particles, but the smaller ones can get all the way into your lungs [and] into the bloodstream,"" Carslaw says. Interestingly, in her study she found that cleaning products marketed as ""natural"" or ""green"" didn't seem any healthier in this regard. ""The natural/green ones had as many, if not more VOCs as the standard cleaners, and in many cases they were more reactive,"" she says.
But vinegar, by contrast, only consists of water and acetic acid (and a few other substances that make the difference between red and wine vinegar, for instance). As such, ""it's just not going to be chemically reactive in the same way"", Carslaw says. Another advantage of vinegar is that it's usually applied on a cloth to wipe surfaces rather than used as a spray, Carslaw adds. Research shows that cleaning products applied in spray form have moreÂ harmful effects on the respiratory systemÂ than liquids and wipes. (Read more about the health risks associated with cleaning products in Jessica Bradley's story).
""When you spray something, you're turning the chemical into a form that's much easier to breathe [in] than if you have the liquid,"" Carslaw says. That said, she always advises gloves when there's risk of skin contact, good ventilation and avoiding excessive cleaning, whatever product is used. (Read more about whether we're cleaning too much for our own good).
This all left me with one remaining question: is using vinegar more environmentally friendly than conventional cleaners?
That's a hard question to answer, says Beckman. Ideally, there would be life cycle analyses for cleaning products which track impacts from cradle to grave, tracing each ingredient back to its source, how it's produced, transported, packaged and eventually disposed of. But very few companies do that thoroughly, even if they do brand their products as ""green"", Beckman says.
""But I will say this about vinegar. [Its] strength is its simplicity,"" Beckman says. Conventional cleaners can consist of more than a dozen different ingredients, many of them industrially manufactured in energy-consuming processes, he says. Acetic acid is born through the natural, yeast-driven fermentation of alcohol, which itself comes from the natural fermentation of sugar. The biggest environmental impact of vinegar-making is where the sugar came from â whether it's grapes, apples, grains, potatoes, or rice â which are largely renewable resources. BockmÃ¼hl cautions that this only applies to naturally fermented vinegars, the ones typically sold as food products; there are also synthetic vinegars which are derived from fossil fuels, meaning they come with all the environmentally harmful impacts of oil and gas extraction.
Even at the very end of its life, vinegar has little impact. While many ingredients in soaps are tough molecules and don't easily biodegrade, sometimes continuing to kill organisms once they're in the environment, vinegar quickly breaks down, Beckman says. ""Vinegar passes muster on any sustainability scale because it's simple and it's degradable,"" he says.
After discovering all of this, I felt even better about using vinegar. I probably won't rely on it for ridding my surfaces of germs, but I'll keep using it to remove limescale and look forward to trying it out on the next rusty item I find. I'm happy to put up with the smell, knowing that I'm using a sustainable product that's likely better for my health.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd38jmrl39o,University hopes AI expertise can stimulate UK growth,"University of Essex academics are hoping their expertise on artificial intelligence (AI) can stimulate growth across the UK.
A summit at its Colchester campus on Thursday is due to discuss how its experts can develop AI technology in the public sector.
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has outlined his vision to ""unleash"" AI, with a Â£2bn data centre planned for Loughton.
Vice-chancellor Prof Maria Fasli said the university wanted to be at the forefront of the government's plans.
Councillors from across Essex have been invited to the meeting, along with representatives from the police, military and the East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust.
It will be chaired by the city's Labour MP Pam Cox.
Prof Fasli said: ""Essex has a wealth of expertise in artificial intelligence and has proudly been working on new technologies for several decades.
""The university wants to continue to push the boundaries of what is possible and position ourselves at the front of the government's AI revolution.""
Last year, researchers at the Colchester campus used AI to re-examine hundreds of brain scans of people who experienced abuse and acute emotional pain as children.
They have also used the technology in studies to manage hospital waiting lists and improving crop outputs on farms.
It has set up an AI research group, consisting of more than 20 academics.
Prof Fasli added: ""I hope the summit will provide a real insight into what Essex has to offer and help organisations understand how we can help them maximise the true potential of AI.""

https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20250422-youtube-streaming-hollywood-lucas-shaw-interview-katty-kay,Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?,"I recently saw a statistic that surprised me: in February of 2025, Americans used their television sets to watch YouTube more than anything else. More than Disney. More than HBO. Even more than Netflix.
I often think of YouTube as a service for young people â specifically, young people using their phones. But that's all changing. A recent report by research firm Moffett Nathanson projects that by the end of this year, YouTube's revenue will eclipse that of the entire Walt Disney Company (movies, theme parks and all). That report put it bluntly, dubbing YouTube the ""king of all media"".
But what does it mean for the rest of the entertainment industry when YouTube is more popular than anything else and YouTube stars seem just as likely to receive big Hollywood deals as A-list actors?
I spoke about all of this with Lucas Shaw, a reporter and editor for Bloomberg and the author of the Screentime newsletter. It was a fun conversation â you can watch or read more of it here:
Below are excerpts from our conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity:
Katty Kay: Lucas, people who became famous on YouTube â Mr. Beast, Cocomelon, etc â are now getting their own shows on streaming platforms. Is that the direction that we're going to see this going, where increasingly YouTube becomes the incubator for shows that then go onto streaming?
Lucas Shaw: Hollywood studios and TV networks have tried to make programming with social media talent â especially YouTube stars â for at least a decade now. Lilly Singh was a big YouTuber who got a late-night talk show; it didn't quite work. Grace Helbig was a big YouTuber who got a talk show. There were some movies that cast talent. We're now seeing a second or third attempt at it.
I think part of the reason is that these stars have gotten so big that there is now greater confidence that they can deliver. And part of it is that Hollywood companies have learned that they can't force some of this talent into their formats. They have to sort of empower them to continue doing what they're doing. So, the Mr. Beast show for Amazon is just like a maximal version of what he does on his YouTube channel. And with Cocomelon, they're basically licensing YouTube videos and then paying them to make slightly longer and more expensive versions of it. We'll continue to see more of that.
KK: So, there's a difference in what it takes to be successful on YouTube compared to what it takes to be successful on traditional television and streaming platforms?
LS: Yeah, I think so. I think what people want on YouTube is different from what they want from Netflix, at least for now. People come to like a creator for doing a specific thing.
There was a point in time at which this Swedish gaming creator PewDiePie was the biggest YouTube star in the world and YouTube funded an original program with him as part of this original programming initiative that they had. And it didn't resonate in the same way that his channel did, because it wasn't what people came to watch. People liked watching him speak off the cuff while playing games. There was an intimacy to that, but there was also a rawness and it felt sort of less sanitised and manicured. And so, then seeing him being a star of a more traditional TV show, even though it's already on YouTube, I just don't think it appealed to those people in the same way.
KK: Lucas, you just came back from a trip around Asia. Is there no global competitor â or even an American competitor â who looks like it's going to knock YouTube off its perch of such huge dominance?
LS: There was definitely a moment where TikTok appeared to be that â and YouTube was intimidated because a lot of emerging and independent creators were posting to TikTok first. One of YouTube's great strengths historically was that it lowered the barrier to entry for anyone who wanted to make a video. And that barrier started to feel higher to some, because YouTube had gotten so big and there were established players. So, going from zero to 100 got much harder and they saw creators going to TikTok instead. TikTok is still a big competitor, but there just isn't anything that operates in as many different categories as YouTube. Spotify is competing with YouTube in music and in podcasting and in some video.
Netflix obviously competes with YouTube globally; I'd say it's one of the biggest competitors in terms of entertainment. But YouTube and Netflix just play different roles, because YouTube is free. For instance, YouTube has hundreds of millions of users in India. Netflix has about 15 million. It's just much easier for YouTube to penetrate some of these poorer markets. Now, there's not as much money there, but from a just ""reach as many people as possible"" standpoint, there really isn't a direct comparison. Maybe Instagram.
KK: I had a conversation recently with Jonathan Haidt and we were talking about kids and screen time and it occurred to me that so many of the social media companies â TikTok, Instagram, and others â have been hauled up before Congress to justify what they're doing. And YouTube seems to have escaped some of that scrutiny. How has it done that and do you think it'll carry on doing that?
LS: I think it comes back to this idea that people don't know how to categorise YouTube. It is in some ways a social network, right? And I think some people initially saw it that way because it came from Silicon Valley, because there were comments, because people were uploading their own videos. But it is also an entertainment platform. But also, at its core â because it's part of Google â it's a search engine. That's in a lot of ways how Google views it. It's a video search engine. And so, I think the difficulty of categorising it has just made it so that people aren't quite sure how to approach it.
But you're right that they haven't received the same scrutiny from a regulatory perspective, certainly not as much as Meta or TikTok, and it's a little bit baffling. You know, speaking from an American perspective, it is so funny to me that the government would not allow one company to own two domestic broadcast television networks, but it's fine that Meta owns both Facebook and Instagram, both of which reach way more people than any broadcast network. Or it's fine that Alphabet owns both Google and YouTube, both of which reach way more people than any broadcast TV network. So, I think part of this is also that our regulatory behavior is pretty antiquated.
KK:Â What are the big changes that you see coming to the platform in the next year or two?
LS:Â I'd say, in aggregate, the big change is that as more advertising dollars flow to YouTube creators and channels will have more money to invest in their programming. There's a pretty widely held belief that you'll continue to see the caliber and cost of some of the top YouTube shows go up and more closely resemble television. You may see some more expensive unscripted shows. Mr. Beast is one example, right? The average cost of one of his videos is $3m three or four million dollars, which is comparable to what you'd see on television, but not comparable to almost anything else you'd see on YouTube.
Another big area that I'm actually in the middle of writing a story about now is the growth of scripted programming. It's still pretty small on YouTube, partially because it is more complicated and more expensive. I think another part of it is that YouTube as a platform is just more hospitable to unscripted programming. But as it becomes possible to make more money on YouTube and as it becomes clearer to top writers and actors that there's a much bigger audience on YouTube than some of these other places, I think you'll see more and more people try scripted.
KK:Â Is YouTube the straw that broke the camel's back of monoculture? I grew up in an era where there were still just a few channels on television. Everybody watched the same thing. But now, it seems that it is really broken. And I wonder whether people will start hankering for that again, for a common experience in this very fragmented, polarised, divided world that we live in.
LS:Â I don't know the answer to that. I think we like the idea of there being a monoculture, right? It's fun when you have a moment like whenÂ BarbieÂ came out and it seemed like everyone was talking about the movie or theÂ Taylor Swift tourÂ happens and everyone is talking about this tour. We are social creatures, and so we enjoy these moments where everyone is bonded by the same idea or interested in the same topic. But it certainly doesn't feel like we're on the precipice of returning to that in any way.
If you think about how Netflix and YouTube work, which are the two dominant entertainment platforms right now, they are tailored to your individual tastes. People don't watch shows and videos at the same time. There are things that go viral, but that virality is fairly short-lived.
I guessÂ AdolescenceÂ in some ways feels like a monoculture moment, right? Everyone is watching and talking about this show. But unlike in the past, when that might last for the 10 or 20 or 30 weeks that it's on, it lasts for a week or two. And then, we're on to the next one. That pattern feels like it will only continue and accelerate. I don't see us reverting to some world in which we are all watching the same thing, unless there's a fundamental shift in the distribution mechanism.
KK:Â Yeah, it's been described to me as a moment where we're living in a ""me culture"" with short attention spans.
LS:Â Yeah, because it's all about YouTube, Instagram, Netflix. Everything feels like they are serving you specifically, as opposed to serving all of us collectively.

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250306-inside-youtubes-hidden-world-of-forgotten-videos,Inside YouTube's world of forgotten videos,"There's a secret side of YouTube, just beyond the guiding hand of the algorithm â and itâs nothing like what you know. The vast majority of YouTube's estimated 14.8 billion videos have almost never been seen. Until now.
On 23 April 2005, YouTube posted its first video; 19 awkward seconds of the platform's co-founder describing elephants at the zoo. But 20 years later, YouTube has moved from its amateur roots to such a behemoth that the company says it's the new Hollywood. YouTube is the world's number one TV streaming service, where users clock billions of hours of watching every day. Leading YouTubers regularly outperform big-name studios. For comparison, an estimated 823 million cinema tickets were sold across all of the US and Canada in 2024. Meanwhile, MrBeast's most successful video alone racked up 762 million views, about one watch for every 10 people on earth.
That's the vision of YouTube the company promotes â slick, professional, entertaining and loud â but from one perspective, it's all a faÃ§ade.
Through another lens, the essence of YouTube is more like this video from 2020. Before I watched, it had only been seen twice. A man points the camera out of his bedroom window as a flurry breaks out in the dead of winter. ""Here it is,"" he says. ""The falling snow."" The sound of a TV plays in the background. A bird lands on a nearby fence. 19 minutes go by. Nothing happens.
""The conversations we're having about YouTube are based on an impoverished view of what the platform really is,"" says Ryan McGrady, senior researcher at the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, US. ""When we just focus on what's popular, we miss how the vast majority of people actually use YouTube as uploaders, and overlooking the role it plays in our society.""
I spent the last month dipping into one of the first truly random samples of YouTube ever collected outside the company. I saw a side of the internet that sometimes feels lost, one full of pure, unvarnished self-expression. It's an entire world that YouTube's all-seeing algorithm won't show you.
""YouTube isn't just a vehicle for professionals,"" McGrady says. ""We rely on it as the default video arm of the internet. YouTube is infrastructure. It's a critical tool that regular people use to communicate.""
To unveil this side of YouTube, McGrady and his colleagues built a tool that dials videos at random. The scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs before it collected a big enough sample for real scientific analysis. Among the findings, the researchers estimate that the median video has been watched just 41 times. Posts with more than 130 views are actually in the top third of the service's most popular content. In other words, the vast majority of YouTube is practically invisible.
Most of these videos aren't meant for us to see. They exist because people need a digital attic to store their memories. It's an internet unshaped by the pressures of clicks and algorithms â a glimpse into a place where content doesn't have to perform, where it can simply exist.
12 years ago, a woman from the US named Emily posted a YouTube video called ""sw33t tats"". I learned it's even older than that, recorded around 2008. In the video, Emily, who asked to withhold her full name, sits in her college dorm room. She pries her mouth open as her younger sister brings a marker to the inside of Emily's lower lip.
""Stop moving!"", her sister yells as she starts to write, the girls barely able to control their laughter. Emily holds her lip open to the camera, and her sister does the same, revealing a sweet tat of her own. But the footage is blurry; whatever these fake tattoos said is lost to time.
Emily, now 34 and living in New York City, forgot this video existed until I asked her about it. ""I don't even remember why I uploaded this,"" she says. ""I think wanted to send it to my sister, but I also I had to free up space on my hard drive. I just needed a place to put it. I don't know, it's funny and weird. I'm glad it's still here.""
""We tend to assume the reason to use social media is to try to be an influencer, either you're Joe Rogan or you're a failure. But that's the wrong way to think about it,"" says Ethan Zuckerman, who leads the YouTube research as the director of the University of Massachusetts' Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure.
YouTube tells the BBC it's incorrect to suggest the platform doesn't let you see videos with low views or content from small channels. The algorithm's job is to help people find the videos they want to watch and that will give them value, YouTube says, and sometimes that does include videos with a small number of views.
""The magic of YouTube is that whether a video has 60 views or six million, people are able to find community, learn a new skill, be entertained, or share their voice with the world,"" says Boot Bullwinkle, a YouTube spokesperson. ""Every channel starts from the same blank slate, from which they can build an audience and grow a business.""
Zuckerman and his colleagues weren't the first to go looking for YouTube's underbelly. Between 2009 and 2012, for instance, iPhones included a feature that let users post videos straight to YouTube with a few taps. YouTube reported that mobile uploads jumped 400% a day. Unless people added a custom title, the name for all these videos followed a standard format, which makes them easily searchable over a decade later. A few online tinkerers have explored these videos, which apparently number in the millions. One even built a custom player that cycles through them.
Without the algorithm's recommendations, you'll find that YouTube is a study of the everyday, Zuckerman says, people documenting small moments in their lives and using the available tools to exchange ideas.
In South Asia, for example, Zuckerman says YouTube and similar networks seem to function as a video messaging tool for people with low or no literacy. Most of YouTube comes from outside of the US, in fact. Zuckerman's lab has estimated that over 70% of YouTube videos are in languages other than English. You find fisherman in South America waving from a boat, or two construction workers speaking in Hindi about how much they miss home. Videos like these fall under what he calls ""friends and family"" content, where comments and interactions all come from people who seem to know the user personally.
""If any of these videos went viral, it would mean something went terribly wrong. That's not what most of YouTube for,"" Zuckerman says.
Most unwatched YouTube is less entertaining than sw33t tats, which, with respect to Emily, sets a low bar. This stuff is bland enough to melt your brain. A bride gets ready for a photo shoot. A grouchy Korean man rants about politics. Six seconds of a martial arts instructor, devoid of context. Dash camera footage from a car struggling to escape a parking lot. A woman advertises a horse for sale in 2018. Endless, mundane screen recordings of video games â the University of Massachusetts Amhurst study found people playing video games seems to make up almost 20% of YouTube.
Occasionally, you stumble on something fun, or more often, just plain weird. Three men performatively slapping each other's rear ends to a James Brown song. A woman reviews a brand of pre-sliced bologna (it's ""not too bad""). Or take the channel ""Space Stuff and Other Stuff"", where a kid raps about the planet Neptune and shares his condolences after Queen Elizabeth's passing. The latter falls in the ""other stuff"" category, apparently.
Some videos are heartrending. I listened to an elderly man describe how he's living in a car on a farm, trading manual labour for a place to stay. There was a moving tribute to a departed cat from her owner, Tyler. ""Kiko didn't make it,"" he says, holding back tears. ""It's so darn quiet without her here."" A few dozen videos I paused to watch a young ballerina float delicately across a stage, wafting back and forth in front of a hushed crowd.
""As researchers, we spend a lot of time with this stuff. It can be a lot like looking at people's personal snapshots,"" Zuckerman says. ""Most of it's boring, but sometimes it's poignant, even haunting. And every so often, you get something that feels incredibly revealing about how human beings communicate.""
But my favourite videos by far came from Bill ""The WoofDriver"" Hellman. He's a 58-year-old working in real estate just outside of Baltimore, US. But that's not his passion. What Hellman really cares about is his dogs, and the unique way he cares for them. ""You've never seen anything like this before,"" he says in one video. I guarantee that he's right.
Hellman has built over 50 custom-made vehicles that he uses to take his four huskies out for what he calls ""urban mushing"". He uses social media to document their adventures on the trails of the eastern US. It all looks a bit like the dog sled races of the Iditarod. Except here, the dogs are usually strapped to the side of his various slow-moving contraptions, recumbent bicycles and electric dog-walking carts. By the looks of it Hellman's dogs are thrilled to participate.
He's posted more than 2,400 YouTube videos in the last 14 years, many of which include original rock songs. (Hellman says he's written more than 100 WoofDriver songs, in fact.) He puts in a lot of work, heading out with drones and groups of friends to document his journeys. Hellman's even paid for celebrity endorsements through the platform Cameo to promote his videos. But for all the effort, his channel often gets little traction. Many videos have views in the low double digits.
""I don't get a big audience a lot of the time, but that doesn't bother me. I was just so in love with how happy it made the dogs that at some point I thought 'I gotta share this',"" Hellman says. ""Maybe it'll inspire someone to take better care of their dogs, but really, I use YouTube like the cloud, so I have a place to document my adventures.""
YouTube doesn't pay the bills, and the WoofDriver isn't selling anything â though he's happy to give you the dimensions if you want to build your own urban dog sled. ""I just do it because of the joy it brings me,"" Hellman says.
Random YouTube usually doesn't look like the highly produced videos of the WoofDriver, but he's a good representation in one sense. Like Hellman's content, the majority of these unseen YouTube videos range from neutral to overwhelmingly positive.
The same can't be said for what rises to the top. Research suggests YouTube's algorithm amplifies negativity, reinforces stereotypes and gives users little control over the content they don't want to see. Over the years, YouTube has faced increasing criticism over concerns about hate speech, political extremism and misinformation. Along with other social media platforms, YouTube has been utilised by drug cartels and harnessed by terrorists as a tool for promotion and recruitment.
YouTube says that the company has employed a set of community guidelines since its earliest days to establish what's allowed on the platform. The company says it has redoubled efforts to address its responsibilities. One way YouTube measures its success is through its ""violative view rate"". In 2017, for every 10,000 views on YouTube, 63-72 views came from content that violated YouTube policies, but today that number has fallen to eight to nine views, according to the company.
YouTube says it gives users several ways to manage YouTube recommendations and search results, such as deleting your Watch History.
When the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure set out to study YouTube, part of the impetus was to document how common hate speech and misinformation is on the platform. ""If you go looking for it, you'll find it,"" McGrady says, but compared to the total body of videos on YouTube it's exceedingly unusual. Still, it doesn't matter how rare a damaging video is if it gets a ton of views, McGrady says, and harmful content remains a serious issue on YouTube.
In recent years, Google has faced a wave of scrutiny from policy makers, with new laws and a mountain of proposed regulations â not to mention a series of antitrust cases. But when the regulatory conversation turns to the videos on YouTube themselves, the focus is almost always on content that goes viral, McGrady says.
This ignores the obligations YouTube should have because, according to McGrady, the company is running a piece of essential infrastructure.
More like this:
â¢ The ghosts of India's TikTok
â¢ Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same
â¢ The riddles humans can solve but computers can't
""The internet is deeply troubled, and we can't ignore the way tech companies are exacerbating those problems,"" McGrady says. ""What makes me hopeful is that when you find a way to look at how people are really using the web, a lot of it still feels like the early internet. It's expression, communication, connection. Fundamentally, it's a place where regular people share themselves and do wonderful things.""
The YouTube we talk about â the one full of celebrities, scandals and manufactured virality â only tells part of the story. The majority exists in quiet moments, in shaky camera work and voices meant for no one in particular. Â I watched hundreds of these videos. Everything one of them is public, but it's also clear that most people didn't upload this content for strangers. It was like being let in on a secret, a sprawling, uncurated documentary of human life. But watching it also felt like work compared to the doomscroll-inducing entertainment you get from the algorithm. Eventually, I closed my tabs and headed back to the YouTube homepage, back to the polished world of the corporate internet.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8epyx0y1zdo,"Instagram still posing serious risks to children, campaigners say","Young Instagram users could still be exposed to ""serious risks"" even if they use new Teen Accounts brought in to provide more protection and control, research by campaigners suggests.
Researchers behind a new report have said they were able to set up accounts using fake birthdays and they were then shown sexualised content, hateful comments, and recommended adult accounts to follow.
Meta, which owns Instagram, says the report is ""filled with inaccuracies and demonstrates a misunderstanding"" of the Teen Accounts, and that parents ""find  these new protections helpful"".
The research, from online child safety charity 5Rights Foundation, is released as Ofcom, the UK regulator, is about to publish its children's safety codes.
They will outline the rules platforms will have to follow under the Online Safety Act. Platforms will then have three months to show that they have systems in place which protect children.
That includes robust age checks, safer algorithms which don't recommend harmful content, and effective content moderation.
Instagram Teen Accounts were set up in September 2024 to offer new protections for children and to create what Meta called ""peace of mind for parents"".
The new accounts were designed to limit who could contact users and reduce the amount of content young people could see.
Existing users would be transferred to the new accounts and those signing up for the first time would automatically get one.
But researchers from 5Rights Foundation were able to set up a series of fake Teen Accounts using false birthdays, with no additional checks by the platform.
They found that immediately on sign up they were offered adult accounts to follow and message.
Instagram's algorithms, they claim, ""still promote sexualised imagery, harmful beauty ideals and other negative stereotypes"".
The researchers said their Teen Accounts were also recommended posts ""filled with significant amounts of hateful comments"".
The charity also had concerns about the addictive nature of the app and exposure to sponsored, commercialised content.
Baroness Beeban Kidron founder of 5Rights Foundation said: ""This is not a teen environment.""
""They are not checking age, they are recommending adults, they are putting them in commercial situations without letting them know and it's deeply sexualised.""
Meta said the report was ""filled with inaccuracies and demonstrates a misunderstanding of how Teen Accounts work, which we could have clarified if [5Rights Foundation] had shared the report with us"".
A spokesperson said: ""We developed Teen Accounts following feedback from parents, and a recent survey showed that 94% of parents find these new protections helpful.
""Fundamentally changing Instagram for tens of millions of teens around the world is a big undertaking, and we know we will need to work tirelessly to get it right and bring parents peace of mind.""
In a separate development BBC News has also learned about the existence of groups dedicated to self-harm on X.
The groups or ""communities"", as they are known on the platform, contain tens of thousands of members sharing graphic images and videos of self-harm.
Some of the users involved in the groups appear to be children.
Becca Spinks, an American researcher who discovered the groups, said: ""I was absolutely floored to see 65,000 members of a community.""
""It was so graphic, there were people in there taking polls on where they should cut next.""
X was approached for comment, but did not respond.
But in a submission to an Ofcom consultation last year X said: ""We have clear rules in place to protect the safety of the service and the people using it.""
""In the UK, X is committed to complying with the Online Safety Act,"" it added.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm248vzg9jwo,Apple and Meta attack 'unfair' â¬700m EU fines,"The European Union has ordered Apple and Meta to pay a combined â¬700m (Â£599m) in the first fines it has issued under legislation intended to curb the power of big tech.
It has issued a â¬500m (Â£428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined â¬200m (Â£171m) over how much choice users had to consent to data collection.
""We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,"" Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.
The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of ""attempting to handicap successful American businesses"" and Apple saying it was being ""unfairly targeted"" and forced to ""give away our technology for free.""
The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump.
The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of ""taking advantage"" of America.
EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were ""completely separate"", telling the BBC: ""This is about enforcement, it's not about trade negotiations.""
The White House has been contacted for comment.
The European Commission - the EU's executive - started both investigations last year under a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA).
The case against Apple was over its App Store.
The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this.
Meanwhile, Meta's fine was over the choices it offered on data collection.
Meta introduced a ""consent or pay"" model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, or paying a monthly subscription.
The Commission says this model did not allow users to freely consent to how their data was used.
In November, Meta introduced another option, which the Commission says ""allegedly uses less personal data to display advertisements.""
The Commission is currently assessing the new option.
In both cases, the Commission says the size of the fine takes into account ""the gravity and duration of the non-compliance"".
Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines.
""Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,"" said Commissioner Teresa Ribera.
""As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules.""
Apple said the Commission had made ""a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.""
It also accused the Commission of ""[moving] the goal posts"" during their meetings.
Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses.
""This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,"" it said in a statement.
The fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction of Google's â¬2.4bn fine from last September.
But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation.
In February, Donald Trump's White House issued a memorandum complaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms.
""Today's decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,"" Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC.
Prof Witt said the disagreement was ""not so much about substantive antitrust principles,"" given the US government is itself taking a number of big tech companies to court over alleged monopoly power.
They are more ""about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,"" she added.
One company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite.
They had a long-running dispute over the distribution of their apps on Apple devices.
Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was ""great news for app developers worldwide"" in a thread on X.
He urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple's App Store, which charges fees for using its platform.
A US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision.
The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission ""has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U.S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures.""
""The Commission's actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,"" it said.
The UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after a digital competition law was brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares.
""Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems and Google's general search and search advertising services are currently being investigated for potentially having this status, and it is likely that other US tech giants and platforms will face similar investigations in the near future,"" said Andrew Maxwell, partner at law firm Freeths.",Imran Rahman-Jones,23 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7vzw78gz9o,WhatsApp defends 'optional' AI tool that cannot be turned off,"WhatsApp says its new AI feature embedded in the messaging service is ""entirely optional"" - despite the fact it cannot be removed from the app.
The Meta AI logo is an ever-present blue circle with pink and green splashes in the bottom right of your Chats screen.
Interacting with it opens a chatbot designed to answer your questions, but it has drawn attention and frustration from users who cannot remove it from the app.
It follows Microsoft's Recall feature, which was an always-on tool - before the firm faced a backlash and decided to allow people to disable it.
""We think giving people these options is a good thing and we're always listening to feedback from our users,"" WhatsApp told the BBC.
The company likens the feature to other permanent options in the app like 'channels' and 'status'.
It comes the same week Meta announced an update to its teen accounts feature on Instagram.
The firm revealed it was testing AI technology in the US designed to find accounts belonging to teenagers who have lied about their age on the platform.
If you can't see it, you may not be able to use it yet.
Meta says the feature is only being rolled out to some countries at the moment and advises it ""might not be available to you yet, even if other users in your country have access"".
As well as the blue circle, there is a search bar at the top inviting users to 'Ask Meta AI or Search'.
This is also a feature on Facebook Messenger and Instagram, with both platforms owned by Meta.
Its AI chatbot is powered by Llama 4, one of the large language models operated by Meta.
Before you ask it anything, there is a long message from Meta explaining what Meta AI is - stating it is ""optional"".
On its website, WhatsApp says Meta AI ""can answer your questions, teach you something, or help come up with new ideas"".
I tried out the feature by asking the AI what the weather was like in Glasgow, and it responded in seconds with a detailed report on temperature, the chance of rain, wind and humidity.
It also gave me two links for further information, but this is where it ran into problems.
One of the links was relevant, but the other tried to give me additional weather details for Charing Cross - not the location in Glasgow, but the railway station in London.
So far in Europe people aren't very pleased, with users on X, Bluesky, and Reddit outlining their frustrations - and Guardian columnist Polly Hudson was among those venting their anger at not being able to turn it off.
Dr Kris Shrishak, an adviser on AI and privacy, was also highly critical, and accused Meta of ""exploiting its existing market"" and ""using people as test subjects for AI"".
""No one should be forced to use AI,"" he told the BBC.
""Its AI models are a privacy violation by design - Meta, through web scraping, has used personal data of people and pirated books in training them.
""Now that the legality of their approach has been challenged in courts, Meta is looking for other sources to collect data from people, and this feature could be one such source.""
An investigation by The Atlantic revealed Meta may have accessed millions of pirated books and research papers through LibGen - Library Genesis - to train its Llama AI.
Author groups across the UK and around the world are organising campaigns to encourage governments to intervene, and Meta is currently defending a court case brought by multiple authors over the use of their work.
A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment on The Atlantic investigation.
When you first use Meta AI in WhatsApp, it states the chatbot ""can only read messages people share with it"".
""Meta can't read any other messages in your personal chats, as your personal messages remain end to end encrypted,"" it says.
Meanwhile the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC it would ""continue to monitor the adoption of Meta AI's technology and use of personal data within WhatsApp"".
""Personal information fuels much of AI innovation so people need to trust that organisations are using their information responsibly,"" it said.
""Organisations who want to use people's personal details to train or use generative AI models need to comply with all their data protection obligations, and take the necessary extra steps when it comes to processing the data of children.""
Dr Shrishak says users should be wary.
""When you send messages to your friend, end to end encryption will not be affected,"" he said.
""Every time you use this feature and communicate with Meta AI, you need to remember that one of the ends is Meta, not your friend.""
The tech giant also highlights that you should only share material which you know could be used by others.
""Don't share information, including sensitive topics, about others or yourself that you don't want the AI to retain and use,"" it says.

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250422-usa-scientists-race-to-save-climate-data-before-its-deleted-by-the-trump-administration,The race against time to save US climate data,"Swathes of scientific data deletions are sweeping across US government websites â with decades of health, climate change and extreme weather research at risk. Now, scientists are racing to save their work before it's lost.
Some of them are in the US. Others are scattered around the world. There are hundreds, many even thousands of people involved across multiple networks. And they keep a damn close eye on their phones.
No one knows when the next alert or request to save a chunk of US government-held climate data will come in. Such data, long available online, keeps getting taken down by US President Donald Trump's administration. For the last six months or so, Cathy Richards has been entrenched in the response. She works for one of several organisations bent on downloading and archiving public data before it disappears.
""You get a message at 11 o'clock at night saying, 'This is going down tomorrow',"" she says. ""You try to enjoy your day and then everything goes wrong. You just spend the night downloading data.""
Richards is a data and inclusion specialist, and civic science fellow at the Open Environmental Data Project (OEDP), a non-profit based in Hudson, New York. Her organisation is a founding member of the Public Environmental Data Project (PEDP), which emerged in 2024 to safeguard data under the Trump administration.
Some of the messages are ""heart-breaking"", says Richards. Scientists sometimes get in touch, desperate to know that data they have spent their professional lives collecting will be rescued. ""You hear the urgency,"" she says. ""You understand that this is someone's X amount of years of research and this is their baby. That's probably why we snap into action.""
In recent weeks, Richards and her colleagues have archived datasets packed with information on US flood hazards, greenhouse gas emissions, energy production and environmental justice, among other subjects. Other researchers have recreated a tool that forecasts the risk of future climate hazards around the US.
This rush to safeguard vital environmental data is part of a broader movement to rescue all kinds of scientific data published online by the US government. Biomedical and health researchers working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for example, have been frantically searching for ways to back up important data following executive orders issued by Trump about what information on gender and diversity may be published by federal bodies.
Scientists have expressed fears about a wide range of resources that might go next â from historical weather records to data gathered by Nasa satellites. On 16 April, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) announced that a list of datasets regarding ocean monitoring were now scheduled to be removed in early May.
Multiple organisations including the Internet Archive, a non-profit, Safeguarding Research and Culture,Â and the Data Rescue Project, are now engaged in activities alongside the OEDP to rescue this data from oblivion. Many of the individuals involved in these efforts have pitched in voluntarily. ""It's our library,"" says Richards. ""You gotta save the books, you have to keep it for the future.""
Shortly after President Trump's inauguration on 25 January 2025, his administration announced sweeping changes to federal departments and agencies, in a bid to reduce what it called ""waste"" and ""inefficiencies"". But many of the programmes and resources currently disappearing are critically important, scientists say. Climate researchers who spoke to the BBC pointed out that some deleted datasets have supported important research on climate change and life-threatening weather extremes, for example.
While government officials also removed information during Trump's first term, meaning scientists had expected similar deletions during his second term, the scale and scope of recent deletions has taken researchers by surprise. One scientist rushed to their university with a plea: ""I said, 'I need disk space, I need it fast, I can't really go through the normal processes [of getting] a grant',"" they recall. Their university quietly made 20 terabytes of storage available, the researcher told the BBC.
The scramble to rescue at-risk data before it's too late continues apace. Richards says her organisation has received messages from around 400 would-be volunteers and they are currently ""on-boarding"" around 100 of them. Their work could help preserve data on everything from air quality to coral reefs.
Among the tools that the PEDP has replicated on its website is EJScreen, an environmental justice mapping service that reveals communities in the US that may be at heightened risk from environmental hazards such as air pollution. It was removed from the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) website in early February.
Climate data is often particularly challenging to work with given the huge size of certain datasets â vast stores of information about our planet that underpin climate models, or weather forecasting systems, for example. But this doesn't deter Richards. ""This is taxpayer-funded research that was already paid for,"" she says. The BBC contacted the White House for a comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.
Watching all of this unfold â in many cases in disbelief â are the scientists who worked to collect this data in the first place.
""I have never seen anything like this in nearly 40 years of doing science,"" says Paul Bierman, a geomorphologist at the University of Vermont. ""I think it's an unmitigated disaster."" Bierman studies landscape change and human interaction with landscapes. He has researched the history of the Greenland ice sheet, showing, for example, that during the Pleistocene epoch 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago, Greenland was covered in tundra and vegetation, rather than a thick ice sheet. It suggests that the ice in Greenland is more vulnerable to a changing climate than we previously understood.
Bierman explains that all of the data that he and his colleagues have collected on National Science Foundation-funded studies gets submitted to data repositories supported by that same US government agency. ""Now I'm wondering, 'Is that the safest place for my data?',"" he says.
Scientists are also worried that efforts to gather new climate data will fall by the wayside. A government report in March suggested that the Trump administration was considering cancelling the lease of the support office for a major carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring research station in Hawaii. The Mauna Loa observatory has been tracking atmospheric CO2 concentrations since 1958 and just last year recorded the largest jump in such levels since records began.
""Climate science is only possible because of long-term datasets,"" says Lilian Dove, a US Noaa climate and global change research fellow at Brown University. ""Without continuing to collect that data, preserve that data, our field is in really big trouble.""
Both Bierman and Dove say they have made multiple copies of their scientific data, including in offline stores, as a precaution â to ensure its survival.
Eric Nost, a geographer at the University of Guelph in Canada, says that the data deletions have far exceeded the many revisions of US government-published information that occurred during Trump's first term, from early 2017 to early 2021. ""We saw the removal of many [web] pages,"" he says. ""We didn't really see datasets removed.""
Rachel Santarsiero, director of the Climate Change Transparency Project at the National Security Archive, a non-governmental and non-profit organisation, agrees. She adds that, during that first term, mentions of ""climate change"" were often deleted from government websites but scientific data generally remained intact and accessible.
Santarsiero also notes, however, that â in principle â the removal of environmental data resources from public-facing government websites is neither new nor exclusive to the Trump administration. The EPA announced plans to remove its online archive in 2022 while President Joe Biden was in power, for instance. ""Their rationale was it was too costly to keep the archive,"" says Santarsiero.

Another organisation that is currently working to gather and archive US government data, including climate data, is Safegaur.de. It is run largely by researchers outside the US. William Waites, a computer scientist at the University of Southampton in the UK, is among them. The pace of data deletions in recent months and weeks has been frantic, he says, with some ""scares"" over datasets that were rumoured to be earmarked for removal.
In March, word went round that information published by Noaa would disappear within days. Waites and his colleagues swung into action and started downloading multiple terabytes of data. But the rumoured deadline for the deletion came and went. Waites describes the episode as ""a good exercise for getting used to doing this"" and adds: ""It's getting a little bit easier, though, as we become more established and known for doing this â and have contacts in various organisations"".
A raft of Noaa programmes are currently at risk as the Trump administration is reportedly considering cutting the agency's funding by 25%. This would remove all funding for research on the impact of climate change on weather, for example.
The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, which captures screenshots of web pages to record what they looked like in the past, is also working to cache government data. This is part of the End of Term Archive project, which records the state of US government websites at the end of presidential administrations. Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, highlights a live public spreadsheet that his colleagues are using to log such captures. The content ranges from information about LGBTQ+ equality matters to geopolitics. Plus, references to vaccines and sexually transmitted diseases were also removed from federal websites shortly after Trump's inauguration.
Many of the preserved web pages feature climate or environmental information. ""We've seen, by scope and scale, an increase in the material removed from US government websites that is without precedent,"" says Graham.
Downloading and archiving data in private or non-governmental repositories is something of a double-edged sword, however. On the one hand, it allows archivists to make multiple copies of that data. ""That limits its potential for being destroyed,"" says Lourdes Vera, a sociologist at the University at Buffalo. But Vera, who was arrested in 2020 for stealing and vandalising Trump campaign signs, points out that saving such data on platforms owned by US-based tech companies could be risky, if those companies are later compelled by the government to delete the data.
Multiple people involved in archiving initiatives expressed a motivation to store the most important information outside of the US. Though many were hesitant to discuss details. When asked whether this is something the Internet Archive is doing, for example, Graham only says: ""The Internet Archive is always looking for responsible ways to help ensure the integrity of data"".
There's another problem, though. When data goes missing from centralised â and well-known â government web pages, it's not always obvious to casual internet users that there are organisations out there working to republish it.
""You kind of have to know what you're looking for now whereas, in the past, you would have been able to more easily come by [that data] by navigating centralised data systems,"" says Nost.
It means an increasing burden not just in terms of safeguarding climate data â but also in ensuring that the public knows it is still there. And that it matters.
Given the relatively small window that humans have to act on climate change, in order to prevent its worst effects, Bierman finds the present situation incomprehensible.
""It's stunning to me that, at a time when we're seeing more intense hurricanes, greater rainfall extremities, more drought, more wildfires â why at that point would we ever imagine cutting the science that is key to addressing those issues, and keeping people safe?""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dr6neg766o,ChatGPT-maker wants to buy Google Chrome,"ChatGPT-maker OpenAI would be interested in buying Chrome, the world's most popular browser, if Google was forced to sell it.
Nick Turley, an executive at the artificial intelligence (AI) company, was testifying on behalf of the US government in an ongoing monopoly trial against Google.
The US wants the tech giant to be broken up, arguing it has too much dominance in the online search market.
But Google says Chrome is not for sale and has called for the antitrust lawsuit to be thrown out.
It is estimated that around 64% of people online use Chrome, according to analytics company Similarweb.
The next most popular browser, Apple's Safari, is used by 21% of people.
Mr Turley was testifying at the trial in Washington DC, the latest in a series of cases brought by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) against big tech dominance in social media, searching the internet and AI.
Last year, the court ruled Google had a monopoly in online search, while last week it was ruled to have an illegal monopoly in online advertising technology.
Google says it will appeal both decisions.
Its head of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, said in a blog the government's proposals ""would hurt America's consumers, economy, and technological leadership"".
The current trial is looking at remedies to curtail Google's dominance in online search, as the recent explosion in generative AI services such as ChatGPT has expanded the market.
Newer AI models search the internet to improve results and reduce hallucination, which has been a problem from developers since chatbots started to become popular.
Last year, OpenAI offered to do a deal with Google which would have integrated Google search results into ChatGPT, according to Mr Turley's testimony.
But he says their offer was rejected.
""WeÂ haveÂ noÂ partnershipÂ withÂ GoogleÂ today,""Â Mr TurleyÂ said, according to Reuters.
OpenAI does however have a partnership with Microsoft, which makes the Bing search engine and Edge browser.
Meanwhile, Google has its own suite of generative AI products such as Gemini - a direct competitor to ChatGPT.
The trial is expected to last three weeks and other big tech companies - including Meta, Amazon and Apple - will be keeping a close eye on it, given they are also facing their own monopoly lawsuits from the DOJ.
Separately, reports in the past week suggest OpenAI is looking into creating its own social network.
The Verge reported the project is ""still in early stages,"" but the company and its boss Sam Altman have privately been asking for feedback on a potential rival to X.
OpenAI boss Sam Altman and X boss Elon Musk used to be business partners until a bitter falling-out over the direction of OpenAI a few years ago.
X has its own AI tool Grok, which it has integrated into the social platform.",Imran Rahman-Jones,23 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0x50yr46lo,Musk to reduce Doge role after Tesla profits plunge,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to ""significantly"" cut back his role in the US government after the electric car firm reported a huge drop in profit and sales for the start of this year.
Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.
But Musk said his ""time allocation to Doge"" would ""drop significantly"" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla.
His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world.
Temporary government employees, such as Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, is set to expire late next month.
But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely.
Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk ""as long as I could keep him"".
The tech boss said he would now ""be allocating far more of my time to Tesla"", but suggested he would not leave the Trump administration completely, calling the work ""critical"" and pledging to stay on ""as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful"".
On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%.
The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying ""changing political sentiment"" could meaningfully hurt demand.
Musk blamed the boycott of Tesla cars on people who would ""try to attack me and the Doge team"".
Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results.
Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. ""Rapidly evolving trade policy"" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company.
""This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,"" Tesla's quarterly update said.
Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.
On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were ""still tough on a company where margins are low"".
""I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,"" he said.
Earlier this month, he called Navarro a ""moron"" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was ""not a car manufacturer"" but a ""car assembler, in many cases"".
Georg Ell, who knew Musk and was director for Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme that if the multi-billionaire ""focuses on the companies where he is extraordinary, I think people will focus once again on the quality of the product and experiences"".
""I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he's a pretty single-minded individual,"" added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase.
Tesla said artificial intelligence would contribute to future growth, though investors have been unconvinced by such arguments in the past.
Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations ""rock-bottom"" after the company said earlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years.
The firm faces fierce competition, Mr Coatsworth said, warning that potential disruption to global supply chains as a result of Trump's trade war also created risks.
""Tesla's problems are mounting,"" he said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9djvzwn858o,Cyber attack on M&S leads to click and collect delays,"Marks and Spencer (M&S) says it has been dealing with a ""cyber incident"" affecting some of its services over the last few days.
The UK retailer said its Click and Collect service had been impacted by technical issues along with its ability to collect contactless payments - with many customers taking to social media to complain about delays.
M&S chief executive Stuart Machin apologised to customers in a note on Tuesday.
He said the company had been forced to temporarily make ""small changes"" to store operations ""to protect you and our business"".
""There is no need for you to take any action at this time and if the situation changes, we will let you know,"" he said.
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's data watchdog, has been notified.
""Marks & Spencer plc has made us aware of an incident and we are assessing the information provided,"" an ICO spokesperson told the BBC.
In a notice to investors, M&S said it had engaged ""external cyber security experts to assist with investigating and managing the incident"".
""We are taking actions to further protect our network and ensure we can continue to maintain customer service,"" it added.
The company said it also reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre.
M&S told customers it was working to resolve some ""limited"" delays to Click and Collect orders.
It comes after some shoppers complained over the weekend about various issues - including being unable to use gift cards or vouchers in stores.
One person called the issues a ""total failure for customers"" in a post on X.
""A simple message out to customers to save a journey would have worked a treat,"" they said.
And another said they were unable to pay for clothes using a gift card while shopping at a M&S store in Liverpool.
M&S has confirmed it is still experiencing technical difficulties affecting its ability to process gift cards, alongside Click and Collect orders.
Daniel Card of the Chartered Institute for IT (BCS) said the M&S incident was ""a reminder of the gap that often exists between our perception of cyber resilience and the reality"".
""Even well-resourced organisations aren't immune, which underlines the importance of action at every level,"" he said.
He said while this may feel daunting for some smaller organisations, many common vulnerabilities ""can be addressed through practical, proportionate steps"".
These may include securing devices and email accounts to protect from targeted attempts to compromise a person or business.
This is just the latest in a series of IT problems to hit major high street names.
Morrisons experienced significant problems with their Christmas orders last year, with deliveries cancelled and discounts not applied on the biggest grocery shopping day of the year.
This was followed by two major outages on what was pay day for many in the first two months of this year.
And in January, serious IT problems at Barclays affected the bank's app and online banking.
It was later disclosed the firm could face compensation payments of Â£12.5m.
In February, several banks â notably Lloyds â faced outages, leaving businesses unable to pay staff.
Ian McShane, a security expert at cyber security company Arctic Wolf, said the issues experienced by M&S over Easter showed that ""cyber attackers never take a day off"".
""Criminals are always on the look out to cause the most disruption for the least amount of effort,"" he added.
""Given the long weekend is the second biggest trading event for food and drink retailers after Christmas, this is exactly what happened here as the majority of the British public enjoyed the long weekend.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y42wvjrd3o,Gamers shocked as Elder Scrolls IV revealed and launched on same day,"Video game studio Bethesda has announced the long-rumoured launch of a remastered version of its 2006 hit Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.
The fourth instalment of the series has maintained a cult following among fans despite it being almost two decades since its original release.
Now, gamers have been surprised as a remaster of the classic game has not only been announced - but released to digital stores immediately.
It comes as fans await the next game in the series, with the most recent entry - Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - having been released in 2011.
More than 600,000 people watched the live announcement on YouTube.
And the reveal that the game would be available immediately drew shock and excitement from those watching, with many viewers writing ""Praise be Todd"" in the comments - in reference to Bethesda director Todd Howard.
In 2006, Oblivion launched on PC and the Xbox 360 console as the product of a co-publishing agreement between Bethesda and Take-Two Interactive's label, 2K Games.
""Oblivion was a really defining moment in the series,"" Howard said in the announcement.
""I think with a remaster, we want people to feel the way they did then - but it's still a game of its time, you want to keep the bones in place,"" he said.
Bethesda showed off a series of significant graphics upgrades in its launch video, with updated gameplay, user interface and audio systems.
Players will also be able to upgrade their characters in a new way, combining systems both from the original and the sequel.
One of the developers called the remaster ""a love letter"" to the original game.
Set in the open world of Tamriel, the game places players in an empire on the verge of downfall - after the mysterious death of Emperor Uriel Septim VII leaves behind a vacant throne and missing heir.
Rachel Howie, a content creator and Twitch partner, said the game was ""long overdue the currently very trendy remaster treatment"".
""It's such a great opportunity for the generation who grew up thinking Skyrim was peak role-playing game to meet its charming little brother,"" she added.
Oblivion racked up 9.5m sales according to gaming website Polygon, and is fondly remembered by fans.
Skyrim then released five years later to a massive response, selling more than 40 million copies across generations of consoles - it has been re-released on two generations of consoles since it first came out.
The news will now leave fans wondering if they may now soon see some news about Elder Scrolls 6, which was announced in 2018, some seven years after Skyrim's release.
Since then, information on the game has been sparse, and mostly limited to rumours.
But gamers have come to expect a long wait from Bethesda, which is facing demand for a new Fallout game as well - which remains under wraps despite the success of a hit Amazon TV show based on the series.",Liv McMahon & Tom Gerken,23 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx4y1lrz2vo,"Films made with AI can win Oscars, Academy says","Films made with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) will be able to win top awards at the Oscars, according to its organisers.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences issued new rules on Monday which said the use of AI and other digital tools would ""neither help nor harm the chances of achieving a nomination"".
Generative AI -  which can create text, images, audio and video in response to simple text prompts - helped to produce some of the films awarded top industry accolades in March.
But the Academy said it would still consider human involvement when selecting its winners.
The Academy said its new language around eligibility for films made using generative AI tools was recommended by its Science and Technology Council.
Under further rule changes announced on Monday, Academy members must now watch all nominated films in each category in order to be able to take part in the final round of voting, which decides upon winners.
The use of AI in film became a hot topic after Adrian Brody took home the award for Best Actor for his role in The Brutalist at this year's Oscars ceremony in March.
The movie used generative AI to improve the actor's accent when he spoke Hungarian.
It then emerged similar voice-cloning technology was used to enhance singing voices in the Oscar-winning musical Emilia Perez.
The technology's ability to quickly alter or match the tone and style of an artist, or perform edits such as subtly changing someone's appearance, has helped it become  more popular in the production of music and film.
But AI use remains controversial, and artists and actors have voiced concerns over the material used to train such tools and its impact upon their livelihoods.
Actors and screenwriters previously highlighted fears about losing work to AI during the 2023 strikes in Hollywood.
""If you can take my face, my body and my voice and make me say or do something that I had no choice about, that's not a good thing,"" actress Susan Sarandon told the BBC from a picket line.
And screenwriters are concerned studios would seek to cut costs and save time by using tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT for tasks such as researching, treatment and script writing, instead of humans.
Safeguards around the use of AI were established as part of the agreements reached between unions and studios that marked the end of the strikes.
But while some actors have seemingly embraced the technology, others, such as Scarlett Johansson, have issued warnings about its potential to allow abuse of their image or likeness.
Animators told the BBC in 2024 generative AI tools were not yet good enough to be able to replicate the quality of their work - certainly not to an award-winning standard.
""It's like having a bad writer help you,"" said Jonathan Kendrick, co-founder and chairman of global streaming service Rokit Flix.
""Sure it will get an outline done, but if you need something with emotional weight, an AI isn't going to get you an Oscar.""

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250422-how-50-years-of-climate-change-has-changed-the-face-of-the-blue-marble,The images showing 50 years of change on Earth,"The ""Blue Marble"" was the first photograph of the whole Earth and the only one ever taken by a human. Fifty years on, new images of the planet reveal visible changes to the Earth's surface.
""I'll tell you,"" said astronaut Harrison Schmitt as the Apollo 17 hurtled towards the Moon, ""if there ever was a fragile-appearing piece of blue in space, it's the Earth right now"".
It was Thursday 7 December 1972, that humanity got its first look at our planet as a whole. In that moment, the photograph ""The Blue Marble"" was taken â one which changed the way we saw our world.
""I can see the lights of southern California, Bob,"" said Schmitt to ground control about one and a half hours into the flight. ""Man's field of stars on the Earth is competing with the heavens.""
The crew of the Apollo 17 â commander Eugene Cernan, command module pilot Ronald Evans and lunar module pilot Harrison ""Jack"" Schmitt â were watching their home recede into the distance as they journeyed into space for the last manned mission to the Moon.
Looking back towards the Earth, Cernan commented: ""the clouds seem to be very artistic, very picturesque. Some in clockwise rotating fashionâ¦ but appear to beâ¦ very thin where you canâ¦ see through those clouds to the blue water below.""
It is an enduring image of the beauty but also the vulnerability of our planet â adrift as it is in the vastness of the Universe, which hosts no other signs of life that we have been able to detect to date. But ours is also a planet of great change. The tectonic movements that shift the landmasses move too slow for our eyes to notice. Yet another force â humanity itself â has been reshaping our planet at a pace that we can see. Urbanisation, deforestation, pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are altering the way the Earth looks. So how, over the 50 years since that iconic image was taken, has the Blue Marble changed?
Those first images of the Blue Marble were taken by the crew, who passed the onboard camera â a hand-held analogue Hasselblad 500 EL loaded with 70mm Kodak film â between them, captivated by the sight of the Earth from space.
""All the images captured with Hasselblads are spectacularly clear and bright,"" says Jennifer Levasseur, curator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.
The camera was specially modified for use in space, she adds. Glues, lubricants, moving parts and batteries could all cause problems or fail when exposed to the extremes of hot and cold in space. It was also given a large square shutter-release button so the crew could use it while wearing their cumbersome spacesuits.
""The other major modification, was the removal of the viewing screen â because it's extra glass,"" Levasseur says, The astronauts, ""had to learn how to take pictures without being able to see anything"", she says. ""Without a viewfinder, you can't see what you're taking.""
Taking photos, says Levasseur, was planned meticulously and written into the mission plan. ""They had known previous launches wouldn't give them whole Earth, but on this one the whole Earth would be entirely illuminated by the light of the Sun.""
It was around five hours and 20 minutes into the flight that the crew got their first glimpse of the entire planet. The crew were starting to get ready for bed, zipping into their sleeping bags. It was their first moment of downtime since the launch.
""I suppose we're seeing as 100% full Earth as we'll ever see,"" said Cernan. ""Bob, it's these kind of views that stick with you foreverâ¦ There's no strings holding it up either. It's out there all by itself.""
The Blue Marble image was captured at aroundÂ 29,000km (18,000 miles)Â from Earth, as the Sun lit up the globe from behind the Apollo 17.
Almost six hours into the flight, Schmitt laughed. ""The problem with looking at the Earth, particularly Antarctica, is it's too bright,"" he said, ""And so I'm using my sunglasses through the monocular"".
Back home, it was nearing 05:00 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and ground control was quiet. ""I'm not keeping you awake, am I, Bob?"" asked Schmitt. ""Just keep talking. We're listening,"" came the voice from the capsule communicator. And so the conversation continued long into the flight, the crew describing the clouds drifting over the ocean and the continents of home.
Previous Apollo missions had snapped the Earth partly hidden by shadow. The hugely influential, Earthrise, for instance,Â shows the planet as it rises behind the Moon. Up until this point, our view of home had been fragmented, with no real way to visualise the planet in its entirety. (Read more about how Earthrise sparked an environmental movement.)
Suddenly, glowing in the light of the Sun, the Earth was revealed as a beautiful shining blue orb, full of life and alone in the vastness of space. As a result, the Blue Marble is thought to have had more influence on humanity than any other photograph in history.
""If you can't see something, it's hard to visualise that it exists,"" says Nick Pepin, a climate scientist at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. ""I think all of us who have been brought up with that [image] from a young age probably find it difficult to imagine a time when we didn't know what the Earth looked like. This was the first time that we could actually look back from space and see our home â and people suddenly realised it was an amazing thing, but also a fixed system that we live on.""
The image offers a view of the Earth from the Mediterranean Sea area to the Antarctica South polar ice cap. Heavy cloud hangs over the Southern Hemisphere, and almost the entire coastline of Africa can be seen.
Nasa officially credits the image to the entire crew. We may never know which of them actually took it but today it is reported to be one of the most reproduced images of all time.
At 07.39 GMT on 7 December 2022 â 50 years later to the minute since the original was taken â a new ""Blue Marble"" wasÂ captured by a satellite orbiting a million miles away. This time, a set of 12 images taken 15 minutes apart, reveal noticeable changes to our planet's surface, the result of 50 years of global warming.
In the 50 years that separates these two snapshots in time, one of the most striking differences is the visible reduction in the size of the Antarctic ice sheet. ""You can see the shrinking cryosphere â the shrinking ice sheet and the loss of the snow,"" says Pepin says. This, he says, is a major indicator of climate change.
The Sahara Desert has also grown while the rainforest ""is retreating further south"", he adds. Research has shown that tree cover in the vast Sahel region that borders the Sahara Desert has been in significant decline. ""The dominant thing that you can see on the [new] image is deforestation and the loss of vegetation"", as the Earth's land cover switches from greenery to desert.
The pictures were taken by Nasa's Earth Polychromatic Imaging CameraÂ (Epic), which has been imaging the sunlit side of Earth between 13 and 22 times a day since 2015. The satellite sits at the first Lagrange point, a point of equilibrium between the Sun and Earth, a million miles from Earth.
From mid-April to mid-October, one photograph is taken of the Earth roughly every hour, and for the rest of the year it takes an image every two hours, says Alexander Marshak, deputy project scientist for Nasa's Deep Space Climate Observatory (Dscovr) satellite mission, which the camera is carried aboard.
""With respect to the Blue Marble, on the 50th anniversary, we decided to take the same images at 15 minute intervals. So, in 15Â minutes [the Earth] rotates around maybe 100km (62 miles),"" says Marshak. And, thanks to advances in technology, he adds, ""we can see the same images, but with much better quality"", even from a million miles away.
More like this:

â¢ Out of this world: 11 spacewalks that made history
â¢ What the planets aligning really means
""And we can see much more than that,"" Marshak adds. ""We take images in 10 wavelengths, from UV [ultraviolet] to near infrared. From these images we can retrieve the property of ozone, of clouds, of water. The height of clouds, the location of clouds. We can look at the property of aerosols, the size of particles, the amount of particles. We retrieve even the shape of ice crystals [in the clouds], using the Sun's glint. We can [see] whether they're horizontally or randomly oriented.""
""We retrieve [data on] the amount of leaves on Earth, and not only that but also the amount of leaves that are directly illuminated by the Sun,"" says Marshak. This data, combined with observations of ocean surface colour, can allow researchers to determine the rate of all photosynthetic activity on Earth.
The Dscovr programme hasn't been running long enough to draw any definitive conclusions, says Marshak, but they are starting to gather data that will provide new insights into how the world is changing â such as changes in cloud cover and height, reflectivity, and vegetation cover.
Among the other changes that have occurred since that first image of the entire Earth 50 years ago is the amount of human development and activity on our planet's surface. Although not visible in these images of the daylight side of the Earth, other satellites monitor for lights visible on the dark side of our planet. These show dramatic expansions in the urban sprawl across the continents alongside the activity of shipping on the Earth's oceans. Wildfires also glow across large swathes of the land at night, doubling in frequency in just the past 20 years.
Back in 1972, the Blue Marble prompted a mass-reconsideration of our place in the Universe. Astronauts viewing Earth from space have reported a profound feeling of awe, a sense of interconnectedness and environmental awareness, and of self-transcendence. This is called the ""overview effect"".
In the utter vastness of space, the beauty of Earth can be overwhelming. This feeling of intense awe has been found to elicit a fundamental change in thinking, a kind of cognitive realignment also called the ""need for accommodation"", as the person attempts to this process new perceptual information.
""Gobsmackingly â just â wow"" is how Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, described her first view of the Earth from space. It was 1991 and the 27-year-old chemist had just launched from Kazakhstan, to begin her journey to the Soviet Mir space station.
""We had two windows on the Soyuz spacecraft,"" she says. ""The commander, who sits in the middle, doesn't get a window. But the research cosmonaut, which was my job, and the flight engineer â we both had one. I had the right seat and flight engineer had the left seat. As we were launching, the spacecraft tipped my side very slightly towards the Earth. Immediately, the light streamed through that window.""
Sharman describes her view of the curvature of the Earth, the ""gorgeous blue seas"", white clouds, and black space above. The Earth, she says, appeared as if it had its own glow. ""The Sun was at quite a low angle, so it would reflect off the sea, and then back up to the clouds â and off the clouds underneath to the Earth. Then [the light] came up so it felt as though the Earth had its own light source.""
She compares the colour to the ""ultramarine of renaissance paintings"". ""It's quite unlike the rest of nature. It's that brightness against the blackness of space, you just see the Earth as this great big gorgeous blue dot.""
Then, as her eyes began to adjust to the darkness of space, the stars appeared in their billions. ""We know there are probably billions of stars just in one small section of the Milky Way, maybe even trillions. And we think maybe there could be up to a couple of trillion galaxies in the Universe. That [makes you] realise the insignificance of Earth.""
Sharman experienced these conflicting thoughts all at once. ""Our atmosphere is so thin. How easily that whole top layer, where most of life is, could just be wiped away."" But, conversely, she adds, ""Earth is not the focal point of the Universe.""
To this day Sharman dreams of ""floating along inside one of the modules and stopping by a window, looking out with the other crew"". The experience ofÂ viewing the Earth from space, she says, ""definitely changed my life's priorities"". ""The most important thing is the people. And of course, the environment and ecology that's required to keep this Earth going.""
The overview effect, say experts, is long-lasting and more powerful than other instances of awe. For the first time, the Blue Marble gave all of humanity the chance to experience the phenomenon to some degree. In fact, research shows that you can experience the overview effect with both feet firmly on the ground.
Like Earthrise, the Blue Marble image became an emblem of the environmental movement. It showed a planet requiring stewardship at the global scale.
The Blue Marble was used to illustrate theÂ Gaia hypothesis, developed in the 1960s and '70s, which proposes that Earth and its biological systems act as a huge single entity, that exists in a delicate state of balance. And, although controversial among scientists, the theory kickstarted a holistic approach to Earth Science.
The image became a symbol of unity, too, as for the first time we could see the Earth without any human-imagined boundaries that divide us as they do on maps. The Blue Marble wasÂ adoptedÂ by activist groups like Friends of the Earth and events like Earth Day. Prior to this, environmental campaign images had often focused on pollution or endangered species.
The photograph appeared onÂ postage stamps, and in the opening sequence of former US vice president Al Gore's documentary,Â An Inconvenient Truth, and inspired research into Earth systems with the establishment of climate research institutions such as the Max-Planck Institut, based in Munich, Germany.
Looking at the 1972 and 2022 Blue Marble images side-by-side, Pepin describes the Earth's ""restless atmosphere"". Visible in both images, are clouds formed above the green areas of rainforest, demonstrating the inextricable link between the forests and the rain. ""If you look at [central] Africa, you can see that most of the cloud, particularly on the earlier [image] is quite spotty, that indicates thunderstorms. Whereas if you go further north, and look at the Sahara desert, you can see there are no clouds.
""When you look from above you see all the connections, the overall relationships between areas,"" says Pepin. ""For example, Kilimanjaro rises from grassland, with snow on top. If you lived on the slopes you might not know there was snow on top and the importance of the connection between those areas.""
Looking at the Earth from space like this, he says, ""makes you appreciate the interlinkages between different parts of the ecosystems"". ""If you can only see your bit, you might think that environmental problems are only happening somewhere else and assume that 'it's not my problem',"" says Pepin.
However, the limitation, he says, is scale. ""You lose the detail. You need both. You need ground truthing [validating the information in the field] too.""
There is a ""huge fundamental difference"" between these two images though, says Levasseur. ""One is captured by a human â and one is not. It doesn't have the same impact. And that's really because of the fact that there's no person there.""
Levasseur is looking forward to the photographs that will be brought home from the next manned mission to go as far as the Moon: Artemis II, planned for 2026. ""There's not going to be another whole Earth image in the way I think of it until humans go out away from Earth again. I wasn't alive in 1972. This is going to be a huge moment to know that people are looking at us from that far away.""
""As much as we like to think of satellites as sort of our surrogates,"" she says, ""I know that there is a person behind that camera, so there is something different about it, and there always will be.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34wzql2xvo,Mission to boldly grow food in space labs blasts off,"Steak, mashed potatoes and desserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment launched into orbit today is successful.
A European Space Agency (ESA) project is assessing the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.
ESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to Â£20,000 per day.
The team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.
Lab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.
""Our dream is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon,"" he told BBC News.
""We need to build manufacturing facilities off world if we are to provide the infrastructure to enable humans to live and work in space"".
Lab-grown food involves growing food ingredients, such as protein, fat and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats and then processing them to make them look and taste like normal food.
Lab-grown chicken is already on sale in the US and Singapore and lab grown steak is awaiting approval in the UK and Israel. On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.
The researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to Â£20,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate.
Nasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space â something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.
Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.
""We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,"" he tells me.
""But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!""
This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.
He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: ""precision"" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.
In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.
""We can make all the elements to make food,"" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.
""We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes.""
A much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?
Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.
The data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.
The problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising â even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.
That is where Imperial College's master chef comes in. Jakub Radzikowski is the culinary education designer tasked with turning chemistry into cuisine.
He isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes. He tells me all sorts of dishes will be possible, once he gets the go-ahead to use lab-grown ingredients.
""We want to create food that is familiar to astronauts who are from different parts of the world so that it can provide comfort.
""We can create anything from French, Chinese, Indian. It will be possible to replicate any kind of cuisine in space.""
Today, Jakub is trying out a new recipe of spicy dumplings and dipping sauce. He tells me that I am allowed to try them out, but taster-in-chief is someone far more qualified: Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, who also has a PhD in chemistry.
We tasted the steaming dumplings together.
My view: ""They are absolutely gorgeous!""
Dr Sharman's expert view, not dissimilar: ""You get a really strong blast from the flavour. It is really delicious and very moreish,"" she beamed.
""I would love to have had something like this. When I was in space, I had really long-life stuff: tins, freeze dried packets, tubes of stuff. It was fine, but not tasty.""
Dr Sharman's more important observation was about the science. Lab-grown food, she said, could potentially be better for astronauts, as well as reduce costs to the levels required to make long-term off-world habitation viable.
Research on the ISS has shown that the biochemistry of astronauts' bodies changes during long duration space missions: their hormone balance and iron levels alter, and they lose calcium from their bones. Astronauts take supplements to compensate, but lab-grown food could in principle be tweaked with the extra ingredients already built in, says Dr Sharman.
""Astronauts tend to lose weight because they are not eating as much because they don't have the variety and interest in their diet,"" she told me.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1kjd091019o,What is the Signal messaging app and how secure is it?,"The messaging app Signal has made headlines after it emerged it had been used to discuss war plans at the highest levels of the US government.
In March, the White House confirmed it was used for a secret group chat about air strikes against the Houthi group in Yemen, to which the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added.
In April, the New York Times and others reported US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth shared information about the same military action in a second private Signal group, which his wife, brother and personal lawyer were members of.
Signal's creator Matthew Rosenfeld - who is better known by the pseudonym Moxie Marlinspike - has joked the ""great reasons"" to join the platform now include ""the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations"".
But others are not seeing the funny side, with Democrat Senate leader Chuck Schumer calling it ""one of the most stunning"" military intelligence leaks in history and calling for an investigation.
But what actually is Signal - and how secure or otherwise were the senior politicians' communications on it?
Signal has estimated 40-70 million monthly users - making it pretty tiny compared to the biggest messaging services, WhatsApp and Messenger, which count their customers in the billions.
Where it does lead the way though is in security.
At the core of that is end-to-end encryption (E2EE).
Simply put, it means only the sender and the receiver can read messages - even Signal itself cannot access them.
A number of other platforms also have E2EE -  including WhatsApp - but Signal's security features go beyond this.
For example, the code that makes the app work is open source - meaning anybody can check it to make sure there are no vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.
Its owners say it collects far less information from its users, and in particular does not store records of usernames, profile pictures, or the groups people are part of.
There is also no need to dilute these features to make more money: Signal is owned by the Signal Foundation, a US-based non-profit, which relies on donations rather than ad revenue.
""Signal is the gold standard in private comms,"" said its boss Meredith Whittaker in a post on X after the US national security story became public.
That ""gold standard claim"" is what makes Signal appealing to cybersecurity experts and journalists, who often use the app.
But even that level of security is considered insufficient for very high level conversations about extremely sensitive national security matters.
That is because there is a largely unavoidable risk to communicating via a mobile phone: it is only as secure as the person that uses it.
If someone gains access to your phone with Signal open - or if they learn your password - they'll be able to see your messages.
And no app can prevent someone peeking over your shoulder if you are using your phone in a public space.
Data expert Caro Robson, who has worked with the US administration, said it was ""very, very unusual"" for high ranking security officials to communicate on a messaging platform like Signal.
""Usually you would use a very secure government system that is operated and owned by the government using very high levels of encryption,"" she said.
She said this would typically mean devices kept in ""very secure government controlled locations"".
The US government has historically used a sensitive compartmented information facility (Scif - pronounced ""skiff"") to discuss matters of national security.
A Scif is an ultra-secure enclosed area in which personal electronic devices are not allowed.
""To even access this kind of classified information, you have to be in a particular room or building repeatedly swept for bugs or any listening devices,"" said Ms Robson.
Scifs can be found in places ranging from military bases to the homes of officials.
""The whole system is massively encrypted and secured using the government's own highest standards of cryptography,"" she said.
""Especially when defence is involved.""
There's another issue tied to Signal that has raised concerns - disappearing messages.
Signal, like many other messaging apps, allows its users to set messages to disappear after a set period of time.
The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg said some of the messages in the Signal group he was added to disappeared after a week.
This may violate laws around record-keeping - unless those using the app forwarded on their messages to an official government account.
This is also far from the first row involving E2EE
Various administrations have wanted to create a so-called backdoor into messaging services that use it so they can read messages they think might pose a national security threat.
Apps including Signal and WhatsApp have previously fought attempts to create such a backdoor, saying it would eventually be used by bad actors.
Signal threatened to pull the app from the UK in 2023 if it was undermined by lawmakers.
This year, the UK government became embroiled in a significant row with Apple, which also uses E2EE to protect certain files in cloud storage.
Apple ended up pulling the feature in the UK altogether after the government demanded access to data protected in this way by the tech giant.
The legal case is ongoing.
But, as this controversy shows, no level of security or legal protection matters if you simply share your confidential data with the wrong person.
Or as one critic more bluntly put it: ""Encryption can't protect you from stupid.""",Tom Gerken,21 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewg8xdld7jo,AI tech for egg farms gets Â£2.6m from government,"AI technology aimed to improve efficiency on egg farms has been awarded Â£2.6m in government funding.
The AI analyses a range of data gathered from sensors on a farm, including listening to the sound the hens make, to identify any potential problems.
The Facilitating Learning Opportunities, Cultivating Knowledge and Welfare through Integrated Sensing and Expertise (Flockwise) system has been developed by Oxford-based FAI Farms, alongside Cumbria's The Lakes Free Range Egg Company and Newcastle University.
The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) hopes the three-year trial will improve animal welfare and eventually reduce egg prices for British shoppers.
FAI Farms claims the system can identify the sounds birds make when stressed or unwell and alert the farmer.
Their BirdBox system is already used to check the hens' environment, monitor equipment, record feed data and gather information about the quality of the eggs.
Defra said the technology would help hens ""live longer and healthier lives and is good for the environment too, because longer-lived fowl have a smaller carbon footprint"".
If rolled out nationwide, Defra hopes the project could ""make for up to 1.7 billion more eggs laid a year, and a Â£280 million increase to UK farmers' income"".
In a statement, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Steve Reed said: ""Government support for cutting-edge technology is making a real-world difference to British farmers and boosting their profits.
""Farmers could even pass these productivity gains on to consumers, by charging lower prices for their eggs, ultimately putting more money in people's pockets.""
Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said: ""Not only is this work putting British farming at the cutting edgeâit's ensuring our morning fry-ups remain proudly homegrown.
""Now that's what I call a cracking use of technology.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86jjggz1gwo,How will a Â£1bn cyber park affect locals?,"It's a town known for its spa history, racecourse, regency architecture â and GCHQ.
Cheltenham is now planning to expand its cyber portfolio, with a Â£95m park that is hoped to turn the town into the UK's cyber security capital.
Experts say the growing cyber security industry, worth about Â£13bn annually, should be harnessed in a new way that brings start-ups and big companies together.
Councils, planners and central government have agreed to build the 116-acre park next to GCHQ â the government's first line of cyber security defence.
They are investing Â£1bn to make it happen, and spades could be in the ground as early as October â but what does it mean for locals?
Golden Valley is an umbrella term for the multi-faceted development, which will neighbour the Springbank and Fiddler's Green communities.
It comprises 3,700 new homes â including 1,000 eco-homes to rent or buy â a new primary school and green spaces.
Places to eat and drink, sports facilities and community spaces for events are also proposed.
The cyber park itself is to be a centre for learning, with spaces that can be rented by businesses, schools and universities for education and training.
The principal building, called the National Cyber Innovation Centre, is the element that is hoped will establish the town as the UK's cyber capital.
The site is expected to create 12,000 jobs. Construction work will take place in phases, with the sign-off for the first stage expected this summer.
The first phase of construction is the cyber park itself, which includes 1 million sq ft (93,000 sq metres) of commercial space, a car park and bus stops for services to Cheltenham Spa railway station.
Work could begin by October if Cheltenham Borough Council approves two key applications, which include feedback from public consultations, this summer.
The teams behind the Golden Valley project hope it will be completed in 10 to 15 years.
Adjustments have already been made locally in recent years to make room for growth.
Cheltenham's surrounding roads have changed, with extra lanes added to the Arle Court Roundabout junctions, increasing the capacity at M5 junction 11. There are also plans for adding an M5 junction.
A Â£9.2m building called the Minster Exchange was opened last year to provide workspace for cyber and tech industries in the town centre.
In Gloucester, 10 miles away, a large development named The Forum is being built, in the hopes of attracting cyber firms and bringing up to 1,500 jobs to the city.
The University of Gloucestershire, meanwhile, has expanded its offering for students with a new Â£5.8m cyber and digital centre.
The first phase of Golden Valley is being worked on by property developer HBD with Cheltenham Borough Council.
HBD is also funding digital workshops in local primary schools, and is working with the university, Gloucestershire College and the University of Bristol to help develop students' skills.
Ed Hutchinson, managing director of HBD, said the development would help make cyber and artificial intelligence more secure as ""the world moves at a faster pace than ever before"".
""Golden Valley will be a place where leaders working in academia, government, big industry and start-ups can share knowledge and ideas, working in specialist environments that traditional offices simply cannot provide,"" he said.
""With the UK's ambitions to be a global leader in these areas, we believe that by clustering these specialist sectors at scale, in a county that is renowned for its rich ecosystem and talent pool, we can unlock growth and break down silos within the national technology ecosystem.""
He said a building contractor for the development was expected to be appointed in the coming months.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nydel3glo,Student launches site to match flatmates using AI,"A student who struggled to find appropriate housing has launched a website which matches university flatmates together using artificial intelligence (AI).
Daniel Virin, 22, had the idea for Cribster in 2022 after battling with the ""stress and challenges"" of the competitive student housing market in Bristol.
The University of Bristol student designed an algorithm to match like-minded users based on their budget, location preferences, values, hobbies and habits.
It aims to make better use of available housing stock by creating compatible groups, filling empty rooms, and reducing pressure on student lettings.
Shriya Pillay, also a University of Bristol student, says the housing crisis in the city leaves students feeling pressure to secure accommodation before term has barely begun.
""I remember starting to look for housing and flatmates just a couple of months into my first year at university,"" she said.
""Many people seem to choose to live with their first year flatmates, but I knew pretty early on that we were all going our separate ways, so I had to figure out who I was going to live with.""
Ms Pillay turned to social media to find strangers in a similar position, but said she worried about stumbling into one of the ""housing horror stories"" she had heard of.
""I've had friends who would be stressed just to go into their kitchen and make food because they felt so uncomfortable around their flatmates,"" she said.
""Something like that can have big repercussions in other areas of your life. They're the people you see every day.""
Mr Virin agreed a student's living situation can ""make or break"" their university experience.
""Your home is supposed to be that safe space where you feel comfortable and can get away from the stress and anxiety of university,"" he said.
""But the rush to secure housing results in signing for poor-quality properties or settling for flatmates who aren't a good fit, often causing tension and disputes.
""Freshers who are just settling into university life are thrown into this stressful process before they've even built friendships.""
Mr Virin added a sense of desperation leaves many students ""vulnerable to scams and harassment on existing platforms not tailored for students"".
Jovan Navjee found success on the site after he formed ""genuine and lasting friendships"" with the three people suggested by the AI algorithm.
""Since moving in we've really clicked, and having the right flatmates has made a huge difference in my overall university experience,"" he said.
Mr Virin's project was recently granted Â£4,500 by the University of Bristol, as part of the Jim and Peggy Wilkinson Awards and the Development Stage competition.
He is now designing a Cribster app with the help of his twin brother Asher Virin, who is an engineer.
Mark Neild, associate professor in innovation and entrepreneurship, said Mr Virin ""made a compelling case"" for the value and need of a product like Cribster.
Mr Virin also received an Outstanding Plus Award in 2024 as winner of the Innovation category, for tackling a ""critical element of student wellbeing"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1me8kx4e2mo,"AI could help decide where to build 5,400 homes","Artificial intelligence is being trialled as a tool to help district councillors decide where to build 5,400 homes by 2041.
Forest of Dean district councillors are under pressure from the government to deliver 597 homes a year, a number that was increased in summer 2024 from 330 a year.
Council leader Adrian Birch said the authority had tasked an AI company with a research project to first see if the technology could be relied upon.
He said he wanted to speed up decision processes, telling a council meeting: ""If we can trust the AI to get it right then we will look at whether that is a feasible option.""
The district council, under its plan for 2021 to 2041, had already been planning to build 6,600 homes when the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government stepped in last year with new targets that it made mandatory.
The demands meant that the council had to build an extra 5,400 homes â 12,000 in total by 2041.
Locations for many of the 6,600 homes have already been mapped out, mainly in Lydney, Beachley and Newent.
The search for locations for the extra 5,400 properties means old ideas have been revived, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
These include creating a garden town between the A40 and A48 near Churcham and a new settlement off junction 2 of the M50 near Redmarley.
Mr Birch told councillors: ""We are trialling some AI support on this which will see if it provides the information we need.""
He said the AI company had been asked to assess public responses to the council's local plan consultation last summer.
""We will then be comparing our results with their results,"" he said.
He said the use of AI would be reviewed if there were any doubts.
The council voted unanimously to review its 2021 to 2041 local plan and explore alternative strategic options for housing.

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250417-biological-reality-what-genetics-has-taught-us-about-race,What genetics has taught us about race,"As US President Donald Trump takes aim at the Smithsonian Institution for ""anti-American ideology"", Adam Rutherford examines what the science of genetics has taught us about race.
When scientists unveiled the first draft of the Human Genome Project 25 years ago, it seemed to deliver the final word on some antiquated myths about race. It provided definitive evidence that racial groupings have no biological basis. In fact, there is more genetic variation within racial groups than between them. Race, it showed, is a social construct.
But despite that fundamental finding, which has only been reinforced as work on human genomes has continued, race and ethnicity are still often deployed to categorise human populations as distinct biological groups. These are views that can be found circulating in the pseudoscience on social media, but they also still creep into scientific research and Â healthcare systems.
It is even more troubling when this thinking finds its way into the halls of government.
President Donald Trump and his administration have made no secret of his rejection of many aspects of the scientific worldview. Since returning to the White House, he has made sweeping cuts to science funding for biomedical and climate research, but in a recent Executive Order, Trump took aim at what most scientists now regard as biological reality.
Entitled ""Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History"", the Presidential order, signed by Trump, targeted an exhibition in the Smithsonian American Art Museum called ""The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture"".
The order is part of a broader attempt to shape American culture by eliminating ""improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology"" from the institute's museums. It states: ""Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn â not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history.""
The exhibition itself is criticised in the text for promoting the idea that ""race is not a biological reality but a social construct, stating 'race is a human invention'"". The order offers the exhibition as an example of a ""harmful and oppressive"" shift in the narrative portraying American values.
This is the point when people like me, a geneticist who specialises in the history of race science, get a little bit vexed.
The issue here is that the sentence cited from the Smithsonian is 100% correct. This is neither controversial in science nor history.
Human variation is, of course, very real. People are different, and we can see those differences in skin pigmentation, in hair colour and texture and in other physical characteristics. These differences cluster in locations around the world: people from the same region on average look more similar to each other than to people from other areas â so far, so obvious.
In the 18th Century, these traits were the primary determinants for a new fashion for categorising humans in supposedly scientific terms. The Swedish botanist Karl Linnaeus is legitimately credited as the father of modern biology, as he gave us the classification system we still use today: genus and species. Every living thing is named according to this system, for example the bacteria Escherichia coli, or the lion, Panthera leo, or Gorilla gorilla, which probably doesn't need explaining.
We are Homo sapiens â wise people. But in his foundational work Systemae Naturae, Linnaeus introduced another tier of classification for us, designated primarily by that most visible of human traits: pigmentation. Linnaeus gave us four types of human, lumped together by continental landmasses: Asiaticus â people with ""yellow skin"", and straight black hair; Americanus â indigenous Americans, with ""red skin"" also with straight black hair; Africanus â ""black skinned"" people with tight curls in their hair; and Europeaus â ""white skinned"" with blue eyes.
These designations are clearly absurd â none of the colours are accurate, even if you took the obviously incorrect view that millions of people share the same skin tones even within those categories. But the roots of the race designations we still use today are visible in these labels. Some of these terms have fallen out of social acceptability and are considered racist. But we still use ""black"" and ""white"" as descriptors for millions of people, none of whom really have either black or white skin.
Even if this colour scheme were true, Linnaeus' original descriptions only began with physical traits. What he included in later editions of Systemae Naturae, which became the basis for scientific racism, were portrayals of behaviours. Asiaticus were described as ""haughty, greedy and ruled by opinions"" while Americanus were labelled ""stubborn, zealous, regulated by customs"". Africanus women were denoted as being ""without shame"" while both sexes were said to be ""crafty, lazy, and governed by caprice"". He described Europaeus as ""gentle, acute, inventive, governed by laws"".
By any definition in any age, these assertions are racist and entirely incorrect.
Of course, in examining history, we must be wary of judging people from the past by our own standards. But as the foundational text of modern biology, introducing a classification system for humans that is ludicrous, racist and most importantly, hierarchical, would leave an indelible mark on the centuries that followed.
Over the next 200 years, many men would seek to refine these categories with new metrics, including pseudoscientific interpretations of craniometry, or skull measurements. They never settled on a definitive answer about how many races there are â none of the characteristics that were being used are immutable, nor exclusive to the people to whom they were supposedly essential. We call this ideology ""racial essentialism"". But all of the many schemes put white Europeans as superior to all others.
It was biologist Charles Darwin who first began to unpick these ideas, recognising in his 1871 book the Descent of Man that there was much more continuity in traits between people that had been designated as discrete races. By the beginning of the 20th Century, molecular biology had entered the stage, and the era of genetics would dismantle the biological concept of race.
By the time we began to look at how genes are shared in families and populations, we saw that similarities do indeed cluster in groups, but these groupings do not align with the longstanding attempts to classify the races. The true metric of human difference is at a genetic level. In the 20th Century, when we began to unravel our genomes, and observe how people are similar and different in our DNA, we saw that the terms in use for several centuries bore little meaningful relation to the underlying genetics.
Even though only a tiny percentage of our DNA differs between individuals, the genome is so large and complex that there is great diversity. Geneticists are still working to unravel how this alters people's health, for example. But those genetic differences do not delineate along the lines of what we call race. They follow ancestral lines, can differ by geographic location and can be traced through historic migration patterns.
What we now know is that there is more genetic diversity in people of recent African descent than in the rest of the world put together. Take two people, for example from Ethiopia and Namibia, and they will be more different to each other at a genetic level than either one of them is to a white European, or indeed a Japanese person, an Inuit or an Indian. This includes the genes that are involved in pigmentation.
Yet, for historical reasons, we continue to refer to both Ethiopians and Namibians under the race definition of ""black"". Or take African Americans, people largely descended from enslaved Africans brought to the New World: sequencing the genomes of Black Americans reveals echoes of the history of transatlantic slavery. They not only mixed genetic ancestry from the handful of West African countries from which their ancestors were taken, but also significant amounts of White European DNA. This reflects the fact that slave owners had sexual relationships â many of which would not have been consensual â with enslaved people.
Therefore, the simple categorisation of descendants of the enslaved as ""black"" similarly does not make biological sense.Â They are genetically diverse in themselves and different from the African ancestors from which they are descended. To lump them together makes no scientific sense.
So it is by consensus, usage and history that we continue to use the term ""black"". This is what we mean by a social construct. The concept of race has little utility as a biological taxonomy. But it is enormously important socially and culturally. Social constructs are how the world works: money and time are both socially constructed too. The value of a pound or dollar is applied by agreement against goods and services. Time passes unerringly, but hours and minutes are entirely arbitrary units.
So, while race is not biologically meaningful, it has biologically meaningful consequences. The impact of most diseases correlates with poverty. As people of ethnic minority ancestry tend to be in lower tiers of socio-economic status, diseases tend to affect them more severely. This is true across the board, but was exposed early on in the pandemic. Black, South Asian and in America Hispanic people were disproportionately infected with and died of Covid-19.
The media immediately began to search for a reason that reified a biological version of race, sometimes focusing on vitamin D metabolism, which is connected with melanin production, and has effects on viral infections. Some studies showed that lower levels of vitamin D did associate with susceptibility to covid infection among black people.Â But this is a correlation not a cause.
More like this:
â¢ The people whose DNA held a secret
â¢ Why you have viruses hiding in our DNA
â¢ The mystery of the human genomeâs dark matter
Underlying any slight differences in biology are much more potent causes: while so many of us were locked down, frontline NHS workers, people cleaning up our rubbish and driving our buses all were more likely to be from ethnic minorities. They simply had a higher risk of being exposed and so infected with the virus. Combine that with the fact that minority groups are more likely to live in multigenerational, dense urban housing, and the supposedly biological susceptibility fades.
This is why genetics has played such an important role in the dismantling of a scientific justification of race and understanding racism itself. And it's why the latest statement from Trump's White House is troubling many in the scientific community.
Trump frequently speaks about aspects of genetics to make political points. One view that he has expressed repeatedly is that some people, and predictably himself, are genetically superior. ""You have good genes, you know that, right?"" he said in September 2020 to a rally in Minnesota â a state that is more than 80% white. ""You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn't it, don't you believe? You have good genes in Minnesota.""
Similarly, in the successful 2024 campaign, he denounced immigrants as having ""bad genes"". It's hard for someone who studies genes â and the strange and sometimes troubling history of genetics â to understand even what might constitute a ""bad"" or ""good"" gene.
Ours may be a pernicious history, but the trajectory of genetics has been one that tends towards progress, and equity for all, as enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.

The Soyuz MS-26 space capsule carrying Pettit and his Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner made a parachute-assisted landing in Kazakhstan's steppe at 06:20 local time (01:20 GMT) on Sunday.
They spent 220 days on board the International Space Station (ISS), orbiting the Earth 3,520 times, the US space agency Nasa said.
For Pettit - who has now spent a total of 590 days in space - it was his fourth mission.
Still, he is not the oldest person to fly in orbit - that record belongs to John Glenn, who aged 77 flew on a Nasa mission in 1998. He died in 2016.
Pettit and the two Russian cosmonauts will now spend some time readjusting to gravity.
After that, Pettit - who was born in Oregon on 20 April 1955 - will be flown to Houston in Texas, while Ovchinin and Vagner will go to Russia's main space training base in Zvyozdniy Gorodok (Star City) near Moscow.
Before their departure from the ISS, the crew handed command of the spaceship to Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi.
Last month, two Nasa astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, finally returned to Earth after spending more than nine months on board the ISS - instead of the initially planned just eight days.

Almost three in five teachers said they believe social media use has had a negative effect on behaviour in schools, the NASUWT poll of 5,800 teachers in the UK found.
Influencer and self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate was named by a number of teachers in the poll.
The Department for Education (DfE) said it was supporting the teachers to tackle the ""damaging impact"" on children caused by ""the rise of dangerous influencers"".
Union members will debate motions at its annual conference in Liverpool this weekend, including one that suggests far-right and populist movements have shifted their recruitment on to social media, messaging and online gaming platforms.
""I have had boys refuse to speak to me and speak to a male teaching assistant instead because I am a woman and they follow Andrew Tate and think he is amazing with all his cars and women... These were 10-year-olds,"" one teacher said.
Another teacher said: ""In a secondary English class last year, a group of boys opted, despite discouragement, to write a persuasive essay on why Andrew Tate is the GOAT (greatest of all time) which included praise of his view that women are a man's property... all of the parents were contacted and were appalled.""
In an interview with the BBC in 2023, when pushed on whether his controversial views on women harmed young people, Tate claimed he was a ""force for good"".
Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said ""there is an urgent need for concerted action involving schools, colleges and other agencies to safeguard all children and young people from the dangerous influence of far-right populists and extremists"".
""Teachers cannot be left alone to deal with these problems,"" he added.
But the founder of a group which trains professionals in how to work with boys and young men said the access young people have to pornography is ""way more impactful"" than the influence of people like Tate.
Michael Conroy, who launched Men at Work in 2019, told BBC Breakfast: ""Without porn, Andrew Tate would not be a known name.
""Our boys, sadly, are learning about sex through porn, and it is usually representing to them a difference of power between men and women.
""That chimes when they see work from people like Andrew Tate. It's already been learned, in that sense.""
Mr Conroy said this is often the case for boys aged ""eight, nine upwards"", adding: ""Where there's access to a phone, there's access [to pornography], unfortunately.""
He said while issues like misogyny and sexism were not new in schools, they were being ""turbocharged because of accessibility"" to dangerous material online.
The NASUWT conference came after Adolescence, a Netflix drama about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl from his class, prompted a national conversation about online safety.
Last month, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer welcomed a move by Netflix to make the series available to screen for free in secondary schools.
But he said there was no ""simple solution"" to stop boys from being dragged into a ""whirlpool"" of misogyny.
A DfE spokesperson, responding to the NASUWT poll, said the government provides a range of resources to support teachers and its curriculum review will look at the skills children need to thrive in an online world.
The Liberal Democrats said the results were ""shocking, but should come as no surprise"" and that it showed the need to ""cut addictive algorithms off at their source"".
The party is calling for a task force to be set up and for money from fines for breaching the Online Safety Act to be reinvested into a safer screens programme in schools.
Earlier this month, a survey commissioned by BBC News showed more than a third of secondary teachers have reported misogynistic behaviour from pupils at their school in the last week.
About 40% of the teachers who responded also said they felt ill-equipped to handle such conduct.",George Wright & Adam Hale,19 April 2025,0

But the physiotherapist went silent on Instagram in 2023 when a popular gossip podcast shared a story about a man who had allegedly cheated on his well-known fiancÃ©e - with enough clues to suggest the man in question was her then partner.
She woke to find ""thousands"" of notifications from social media and messaging apps as seemingly the whole world wanted to know whether there was truth behind the rumours.
Lilly was watching the life she knew fall apart in real time.
The creators of the podcast, which the BBC has chosen not to name, say they are not responsible for actions taken as a result of their content.
Lilly - who has not discussed what happened in public until now - sat down with me to talk about the moment which changed her future.
Soon after the podcast launched, her social media feeds began to fill with what she called ""investigator-style"" videos speculating about her life and how she would react.
Her first step was to delete her Instagram app.
""I just had to get away from social media,"" she said.
""People wanted answers, people wanted to see even more into my life, even when I asked for privacy.
""All I could do was control my own reaction and that meant withdrawing and protecting myself and my family.""
Lilly's relationship ended, but there was much to untangle - her ex was also her business partner, leaving her faced with raising the funds to buy him out. He has been contacted by the BBC for comment.
She left Dubai, where she had been living with her partner, to move back in with her family in the UK - and had to lay off most of the companies' staff.
""It was very humbling and very difficult,"" Lilly said, explaining she had to go back to doing the work she used to have staff for - such as editing, filming her videos, and running the business' social media feeds.
It meant even though she was trying her best to avoid it, Lilly was constantly engaging with social media platforms to keep her businesses going - and she had to try to avoid looking at myriad personal comments.
""I was trying to manage the heartbreak and the shock combined with keeping the business afloat,"" she said.
Her most recent Instagram post until now, on her personal account, was uploaded in November 2023 - with many of the comments asking why she has not posted for so long.
Up until the gossip podcast launched, Lilly had been open about her life online.
And she accepted there may have ""potentially"" been less interest in her relationship had she shared less on social media.
""I truly don't know the answer to that,"" she said.
""I think when I compare to some other people, I didn't show a lot of my lifestyle.
""But it was clearly enough for people to put two and two together.""
Lilly acknowledged she had shared snapshots about herself to help build her brand - to draw in those who wanted to know more about her - and for a long time it was a successful strategy.
While she maintained some boundaries such as not revealing information about her family, she said there was always an unspoken pressure to share more.
""I've learned people will constantly want more the more you give,"" she said.
""If it's just showing your dog, or sharing your relationship, it's like 'okay, what else, now show the house'.
""It can lead to a lot of exposure because you're chasing likes or you feel that's what your customers want.""
Nearly eighteen months after her most recent post, Lilly is in a different headspace.
Her business - the workout videos and a nutrition app - are thriving and she feels ready to return to her personal Instagram account - but with a very different set of rules this time around.
""I'm not going to be showing my personal relationships, I've been too scarred, and I can't do it again,"" she said.",Zoe Kleinman,19 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v9z45pe93o,Artists push back against AI dolls with their own creations,"Artists and creatives are pushing back against a recent trend using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate ""starter pack"" images of people as toys - which they say may be in danger of risking their livelihoods.
Since the start of April, thousands of people have uploaded their photos to generate images of themselves as dolls, despite warnings of damaging the environment, giving away personal information, and devaluing creativity.
Nick Lavallee, who has made custom action figures for six years, told the BBC he was concerned his work may be at risk after ""AI images saturated social media"".
""People are sick of them,"" he said. ""It's an artistic aesthetic - AI-generated art diminishes that.""
Nick has made figures of - and for - comedians, film directors, and artists such as Weezer and Tyler Childers, which sell for as much as $250 (Â£188) online on his Wicked Joyful website.
His success has led to a clothing brand and will soon be followed by a physical shop in his hometown of Manchester, New Hampshire.
But he's concerned action figure commissions could soon dry up, as well as the public perception of his work, from thousands of AI images mimicking his passion.
The feeling has been shared by other creatives with the rise of the #StarterPackNoAI movement, which has been used thousands of times since first appearing on Instagram in early April before spreading to X soon after.
After Patouret's post, others quickly joined the counter-trend, with artist Maria PicassÃ³ Piquer saying she chose to take part ""for fun, but also as a statement"".
""While AI pieces all looked more or less the same, I was amazed at the variety of the 'human' works,"" she said.
""Plus, self-portraits added an extra layer of, well, humanity.""
Maria, like many other artists, sees the dual risk of AI images threatening intellectual property rights by being ""fed on 'stolen' art"", and the possibility of reducing her finding new clients.
Illustrator Dav le Dessineux, working in Bordeaux, France, said some in his industry had already lost contracts to AI design work.
He contributed his starterÂ pack because ""like many artists who use their real hands"", he was ""tired"" of the deluge of AI-generated doll images.
Dav's illustration featured only a pencil and sheet of white paper - tools he said are ""all you need to start being an artist"".
""People usually forget about it because of the technology surrounding us, but we really don't need more than basic stuff to create something and be original,"" he said.
Eli Dibitonto, an artist living in Barletta, Italy, agreed, describing the process of digitally illustrating his own starter pack as ""carefree and fun"".
""It doesn't have to be perfect - mine isn't,"" he said. ""Art isn't meant to be perfect or look flawless.""
And illustrator and student Evie Joyce said creating her own artwork meant being able to consider what to reflect of her personality during a process lasting several hours, rather than seconds.
""I think that what's so magical about it is you're seeing people put time and effort and their personality, all of their experiences, into pieces of art,"" she said.
""With AI, it can even steal from artists and steal their work and their style, it just loses that touch of personality.""
Back in New Hampshire, Nick understands the rebellion from illustrators, but says he believes there is use for AI.
""I don't necessarily want to say AI is bad when I know that it could be a useful tool,"" he said.
""I think all of us have experimented with it.""
And Henk van Ess, a global expert in using AI in investigative research, has proven how useful it can be - but it would be safe to say he does not believe it lies in starter packs.
""It's like watching a supercomputer calculate how many Hobnobs fit in a Sports Direct mug, while solving climate change sits on the 'to-do' list,"" he said.
""Technically impressive? Sure. But it's the technological equivalent of using the Large Hadron Collider to heat up your Pot Noodle.
""While everyone's busy generating these digital equivalents of small talk, they're missing the actually revolutionary stuff AI can do - it's just wasteful to put all that energy into creating digital fluff when we can use it for solving real-world problems.""
And Nick remains positive.
""The musicians who get my stuff, who are excited to hold a Wicked Joyful in their hands, they know it's my artwork, they know it's mine,"" he said.
Likewise, Dav is confident in the worth of human work.
Despite the rise of pre-fabricated furniture, he says, ""people still call on cabinetmakers"".
""I hope I'll be one of those artisans,"" he said.
Nick, who says he found his purpose ""in bringing joy to people"" with his creations, said he similarly wanted to remain hopeful about the future.
""I really hope people are totally sick of AI action figures,"" he said.
""But I hope that they are smart enough to understand the difference in something that I'm doing versus what is computer-generated.""",Richard Irvine-Brown & Liv McMahon,19 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx17361pw1o,"Designed in US, made in China: Why Apple is stuck","Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.
While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.
Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.
Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.
But the comfort is short-lived.
The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: ""NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',"" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated ""semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN"".
The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.
The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?
China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.
Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.
Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.
It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.
As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.
Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into ""manufacturing superstars,"" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.
He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became ""the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,"" Mr Lin says.
Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.
As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed ""iPhone City"".
For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.
Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.
Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.
""There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,"" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.
In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.
But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.
""The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: ""President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.""
She added: ""At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.""
But many are sceptical of that.
The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is ""pure fantasy,"" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.
He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.
Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but ""really made an effort"" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.
""The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].""
Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans ""thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries"".
Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.
Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.
""Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,"" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.
It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.
There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.
And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.
""All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,"" Mr Friedman says.
So what does Apple do now?
The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.
Now that ""Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,"" according to Mr Lin.
Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.
And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.
Apple has announced a $500bn (Â£378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.
Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.
Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add ""pressure - both operationally and politically"" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.
""Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,"" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.
""But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgek8engwmo,Wendy's praises Katy Perry after 'can we send her back' space tweet,"Since pop star Katy Perry returned to Earth earlier this week, the number of memes referencing her brief trip to space has skyrocketed.
After weighing in with jokes of its own, American fast-food chain Wendy's has  clarified that its now-viral tweets weren't meant to cause offence.
Following criticism from followers, the company put out a statement this week saying it had no ill-will for Perry.
""We always bring a little spice to our socials, but Wendy's has a ton of respect for Katy Perry and her out-of-this-world-talent,"" it said.
The star-studded, all-female crew on Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rocket took off in Texas on Monday and flew for 11 minutes in total. Perry was joined by five other women, including journalist Gayle King and Jeff Bezos's partner Lauren Sanchez.
But the ""Fireworks"" singer's reactions captivated the internet more than others'. After landing, she kissed the ground, saying she felt ""so connected to love"".
King revealed that Perry sang Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"" while in space.
Memes and comments began to flood social media platforms, including Wendy's series of posts on its official X account when she landed: ""When we said women in stem this isn't what we meant"" and ""Can we send her back"".
While the space flight was meant to celebrate women, the crew has faced some criticism. The backlash ranged from the environmental impact of the flight to looming cuts for actual Nasa employees.
Other celebrities also offered their two cents.
""I think it's a bit gluttonous,"" actress Olivia Munn said in an appearance on TODAY.  ""Space exploration was to further our knowledge and to help mankind. What are they going to do up there that is going to help us down here?""
Model and activist Emily Ratajkowski said on TikTok that the flight was ""beyond parody"".
""Look at the state of the world and think about how many resources went into putting these women into space,"" she said. ""For what?""
But not all reactions were negative. TV reality star Khloe Kardashian, watching from the viewing platform, said: ""Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age.""
Oprah Winfrey, a close friend of King, also watched the launch. She was seen tearing up as the craft landed.
""I've never been more proud of my friend than today,"" she said.
King countered some of the negative comments, saying she believes the flight inspired young women who want to be astronauts.
""I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,"" she said.",Sakshi Venkatraman,19 April 2025,0

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8073ggz1eeo,PM Modi and Elon Musk talk India-US tech collaboration,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he discussed his country's potential to collaborate with the US on ""technology and innovation"" during a conversation with Elon Musk.
On Friday, Modi shared a post on X detailing his telephone conversation with the tech billionaire and said they had revisited topics from their meeting in Washington earlier this year.
Modi's conversation with Musk comes as India is working towards securing a bilateral trade agreement with the US to offset the brunt of US President Donald Trump's potential tariffs.
It also comes days before US Vice-President JD Vance's four-day trip to India.
""We discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation,"" Modi wrote in his post on X.
He added that India remained ""committed to advancing our partnerships with the US"" in these domains.
Musk, who is seen as being close to Trump and also heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is looking at making inroads into India with his business plans.
In March, Starlink signed an agreement with two of India's biggest telecoms firms to bring satellite internet to India and is awaiting government approval to start providing its services.
Tesla could also finally be making its debut and has begun hiring for a dozen jobs in Delhi and Mumbai. It is also reportedly hunting for showrooms in both cities.
Meanwhile, Vance is set to meet Modi on 21 April, the first day of his trip, for discussions on economic, trade and geopolitical ties.
He will be accompanied by his children and wife Usha Vance whose parents migrated to the US from the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.
The visit comes against the backdrop of an intensifying trade war between the US and China.
Trump slapped India too with 27% US tariffs on 2 April, before he announced a 90-day pause.
Since then, Delhi and Washington have been working towards an early conclusion of trade negotiations.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx201dgp2v9o,Guernsey headteachers adapt to AI use in education,"A Guernsey headteacher has changed the school curriculum to include Artificial Intelligence (AI) because of its potential impact on the futures of students.
Daniele Harford-Fox said The Ladies College used a custom-made AI agent to help Year 7 students set themselves targets.
She said staff also used an internal version of Microsoft Copilot with added restrictions to ensure safe learning.
""There are fundamental questions about whether [the education system] is going to still be relevant to this industrial revolution,"" she said.
Ms Harford-Fox said recent AI models, such as Chat GPT-4, were capable of writing work better than most A-level students and Guernsey teachers were concerned about verifying their work.
She said: ""If AI can write a better essay than most students, the real question is why are we spending seven years of a student's life teaching them how to write essays?""
The States does not have a specific policy which covers AI use in schools, but its online safety guidance refers users to Guernsey's data protection laws.

As data protection rules are laws, and not States' guidelines, independent schools are also expected to follow them.
However, States-maintained schools are also required to follow UK AI rules from examination boards.
Kieran James, headteacher at Les Varendes, said each exam board had different rules about appropriate AI use.
As schools may use different exam boards for different subjects, this could be challenging, as the definition of acceptable AI use could alter depending on which class a student was taking, he said.
He said education gave students ""transferable skills"" and felt that AI was ""not threatening the current system"".
Mr James compared using AI to using a calculator, saying parents were originally concerned about the use of those devices, but in reality using the tool correctly still required learning.
""It's the same with AI... it's a tool and it can be used really effectively as long as it's used appropriately, and not, for example, to pass off AI's work as a student's own.""
Mr James added that if used responsibly, AI had the power to support students outside the classroom when teachers were not available.
He explained students could use AI as a ""personal tutor"" to practise questions and mark exams.
Ed Gregson, a media teacher at Les Varandes, said he used AI to support his marking workload.
He said using AI for administrative and more repetitive tasks freed up time, and allowed him to focus on tasks that required more attention and creativity.
However, the development of AI also made him concerned about his future role in teaching.
""I'm terrified to say that I think it marks better than I do. Humans are tired... you kind of know that your personal bias is entering in to your marking,"" he added.
Dave Costen, digital lead for Elizabeth College, said AI was not yet able to substitute for teaching.
Mr Costen said one difference was AI gave ""too much [information] to students straight away"" whereas teachers ""develop the learning [of students] gradually"".
Students generally have a poor understanding of AI, he said.
Despite this, some Elizabeth College students had experimented with the technology, he said.
One student explained to the BBC that AI was not good at adjusting the difficulty of example questions.
Another student said some of their peers over-relied on AI, and used it to complete work for them, which was not helping them learn.
AI was also better at some subjects than others, a third explained. It was very strong at coding, but in subjects that required reasoning it ""really struggled"".
Parent Gazz Barbe said he uses parental controls to restrict his daughter's phone use, and added that he did not allow the use of AI technology.
""I worry that if I give my daughter unrestricted access to this technology, she will use it to complete homework assignments.
""And if she does this in a subject that she really struggles with, she could easily become over-reliant on the technology,"" he said.
""The positive potential is absolutely massive... so long as it's used as a tool to assist teachers instead of doing the teaching,"" he added.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedy6gl99eno,Nvidia: The AI chip giant caught between US and China,"Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology.
On Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips.
The California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard ""national and economic security"". Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the ""indefinite future"".
But why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China?
Nvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT.
In recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.
Because its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China.
Washington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.
US restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new.
In 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions.
A more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China.
However, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs.
DeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips.
Now, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.
Those companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (Â£4.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil.
Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei.
Although they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips.
""It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,"" Mr Lee added.
China is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year,  though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half.
The timing of Mr Huang's trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia's business in China despite the latest curbs.
In his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped ""to continue to cooperate with China"", according to state broadcaster CCTV.
On Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Mr Huang's trip to China also included a meeting with DeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng.
Separately, top Chinese official He Lifeng told Mr Huang that ""China's market investment and consumption potential is huge"", according to state news agency Xinhua.
During talks with Shanghai's mayor on Friday, Mr Huang said he was committed to the Chinese market, according to a Shanghai government statement.
The controls are part of Washington's broader goal to de-risk supply chains for advanced technology away from China, and bring more semiconductor production back to the US.
Nvidia this week announced plans to build up AI servers in the US worth up to $500bn. US president Donald Trump later claimed his re-election drove Nvidia's decision.
And in March, Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia's chips, announced it would invest an additional $100bn in advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona.
Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, told the BBC the latest developments show that global technology is becoming increasingly polarised between ""two systems"", one dominated by the US and the other by China.
""Tech will be less global in that sense, and it will be subject to more restrictions.""",James Chater,18 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z5yl2l1lo,Can AI care for your loved ones?,"Robots for training carers, sensors that monitor people as they sleep and an app that can detect if someone is in pain - could this be the future of care?
The care sector is increasingly using technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to look after the UK's ever-growing elderly population.
Despite this, experts have urged people to consider the potential risks of an overreliance on AI in the industry.
""AI can only be part of the solution but not the whole solution,"" says Dr Caroline Green from the University of Oxford.
Ms Green, the director of research at the Institute for Ethics in AI, spoke at an AI in Social Care Summit at the university in March.
She highlighted how AI systems could be susceptible to biases, which amplify discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping and has also recognised the worries people have around sharing their personal data with the technology.
""At the moment there's no official government policy on guidance on the use of AI in social care,"" Ms Green added.
She said: ""Whether it's going to be good for people who need support, depends on how policy is going to shape up here, it depends on what choices people will continue to have in the future, or whether they can for example opt out of having AI in their care at all, it will depend on whether there is going to be a sense in which AI technology can take over care provision and human interaction.
""We need to be very careful here on what choices people will have in the future and what the future of social care with AI will look like.""
Thomas Tredinnick is the boss of AllyCares that uses sensors to monitor care home residents' rooms overnight, listening out for anything out of the ordinary.
It sends an audio recording of any incidents to carers on shift, who can then decide how to act.
Speaking from Oaklands Rest Home in Southampton, which uses the technology, Mr Tredinnick said it saves staff having to perform regular nightly checks, meaning residents can get a better sleep.
""The care staff are providing care to the residents that need it,"" he said.
He claims it has helped to reduce preventable health events leading to hospital admissions, as it spots things like falls and chest infections before they escalate.
Christine Herbert said her 99-year-old mother Betty is one of the residents being monitored by the technology.
She admitted she was uncertain about the use of AI at first, comparing the technology to a ""baby monitor"".
""When mum came here for the first few nights I did ask for routine checks because I was concerned,"" she said.
Mrs Herbert said she came around to the technology after the home presented her with data which showed how her mother was monitored and not disturbed during the night.
At Elmbrook Court care home in Wantage, Oxfordshire, they are using AI to find out if residents are in pain.
Aislinn Mullee, deputy manager at the home, said: ""It can be quite difficult to identify pain in a resident that is non-verbal.""
Using a smartphone app called Painchek, carers scan a resident's face for pain indicators, answer questions about the resident and then receive an instant percentage score which indicates the level of pain that person is feeling.
Ms Mullee said it has made a ""huge difference"" and they have used the information in collaboration with local GPs to assess which pain medication a resident requires.
She added it has also been used to reassure family members that a loved one receiving end-of-life care was not in pain.
Ms Mullee made clear the data gathered was password-protected and only visible to staff at the home.
At the University of Oxford's Robotics Institute they are hoping AI could also be used to train carers.
Marco Pontin, a Post Doctoral Research Assistant, is part of a team which has created a robot which reacts to human touch.
It can be programmed to feel pain in different parts of its body and will physically flinch if a carer is too forceful when touching a painful area.
It will be trialled with students studying to be occupational therapists at Oxford Brookes University.
Mr Pontin said the team hoped to use it as a ""digital twin"" of real life patients.
It will be programmed with the same conditions as a human patient so that carers ""can replicate whatever they have seen in the real world but with the robot counterpart"".
He said: ""With an ever-growing ageing population it's harder to be there for everyone, so providing a digital twin of a patient could enable occupational therapists to know what is going on with their various patients without necessarily being there all of the time.""
People are living longer and there are an estimated 12 million people in the UK aged 67 or over, with that figure projected to rise to 13.7m by 2032.
A report published by the House of Commons library in March stated in 2023/24, local authorities in England spent Â£23.3bn on adult social care, which was the second biggest area of council spending after education.
The sector's reliance on workers from overseas is another big issue.
Home Office statistics showed 27,000 visas were issued to people coming to the UK to work in health and social care, in the 12 months to December 2024.
This was a fall of 81% compared with the previous 12 months. The number coming to work in the sector had increased significantly after temporary changes to the health and care visa rules.
""We're reliant on migrant workers to keep social care going at the moment,"" says Lee-Ann Fenge, professor of social care at Bournemouth University.
She said she does not believe new technology should be used as a way of filling the gaps in the sector.
She said ""It needs to be seen as a tool that enhances the work that is already happening.""
She added time needed to be taken to ""think about some of the ethical challenges"" that monitoring people could have.
""We need to prepare people better to protect themselves, so this isn't just about saying AI is wonderful, let's use it. We need to look at both the potentials of AI but also the risks that it could pose,"" she said.
In February, the UK and US governments refused to sign an international AI declaration in Paris, which pledged an ""open"", ""inclusive"" and ""ethical"" approach to the technology's development.
This comes as the government announced in March it will take a ""test and learn"" approach to funding AI in the public sector, in order to ""push innovation"".
When catching up with Dr Caroline Green again she continues to promote a cautious approach to AI.
""It can help with some of the administrative work, some of the operation of care, but it cannot replace that human touch,"" she said.
""There is a potential risk that AI is going to be seen as a panacea to some of those very big problems that we are seeing in social care provision, namely that we don't have enough staff, and that there is a growing demand from an ageing population.
""I think here we really need to make sure that we don't just invest in AI to take over care-giving but that we keep on investing in people, in professionals who will be able to provide that care.""
A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: ""We will harness cutting-edge technology to transform social care and we are already seeing promising developments across the sector - from AI-powered fall detection systems that provide earlier interventions, to tools which automate paperwork to free up staff to focus on caring for people.
""Making better use of AI in social care is exactly the kind of transformation we're championing in our 10 Year Health Plan â shifting from treating sickness to preventing it, from hospital to community care, and from analogue to digital solutions.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grn878712o,"Beware phony IT calls after Co-op and M&S hacks, says UK cyber centre","The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned that criminals launching cyber attacks at British retailers are impersonating IT help desks to break into organisations.
Hackers have targeted Marks & Spencer, Co-op and Harrods in the last two weeks, and on Friday the anonymous group told the BBC there will be more attacks soon.
Now the NCSC, the government agency responsible for cyber security, has issued guidance to organisations urging them to review their IT help desk ""password reset processes"" to reduce their chances of getting hacked.
""We believe by following best practice, all companies and organisations can minimise the chances of falling victim to actors like this,"" it said.
It said firms should reassess how their IT help desk ""authenticates staff members"" before resetting passwords, especially senior employees with access to high-level parts of an IT network.
It highlighted press speculation around ""social engineering"" as a way hackers may have gained access to accounts.
Criminals use social engineering techniques to get people to trust them when they email, text or call pretending to be from a company's IT help desk - ultimately tricking employees into handing over their log in passwords and security codes.
This also works the other way - calling people who work on the help desk and pretending to be an employee locked out of their account.
Cyber security experts now recommend further layers of security to deal with these sorts of attacks.
""Having code words that get used when an employee phones up to change their credentials, such as ""BluePenguin"", is one thing being discussed in the cyber community as a way to check that the member of staff is genuine,"" said Lisa Forte from cyber security firm Red Goat.
""Ultimately it comes back to the same issue with login credentials as always â we need multiple ways to do it to ensure it isn't easy to bypass.""
The NCSC advice is the strongest hint yet the hackers are using tactics most commonly associated with a collective of English-speaking cyber criminals nicknamed Scattered Spider.
The name derives from ""spider"" being the label given to financially motivated cyber criminals, while ""scattered"" is because they are not a cohesive, organised gang.
In the past two years these disparate hackers, in their teens or early twenties, have coordinated and planned attacks on Discord and Telegram to breach dozens of companies and steal or scramble data to extort their victims.
The NCSC does not specifically name the group as being responsible for the current wave of attacks, but acknowledges Scattered Spider are known for these types of hacks.
In other NCSC advice, cyber defenders are being urged to watch out for ""Risky Logins"".
This means looking out for when and where employees have logged in from - for example late at night or from strange locations.
Although cyber criminals could be anywhere in the world, young English-speaking hackers in the UK and US have become adept at using social engineering in their attacks.
Scattered Spider hackers have been responsible for high profile attacks including the coordinated moves against casinos in Las Vegas in which MGM Grand Casinos and Caesar's Palace were hit in quick succession.
There have been six arrests in the last year of hackers accused of being from Scattered Spider in the US and UK.
In July 2024 a 17-year-old from Walsall was arrested as part of an FBI investigation into the MGM hack - and months later a person of the same age and location was arrested in connection with another hack on Transport for London.
Police would not say if the alleged hacker was the same person.
On Friday, the hackers responsible for the current wave of attacks spoke to the BBC.
The criminals repeatedly denied they are Scattered Spider hackers and would only call themselves DragonForce - the name of a cyber crime service hackers can use for malicious software and extortion.
The hackers, who were fluent English speakers, revealed to the BBC they had compromised Co-op and stolen a large amount of customer and employee data.
They would not discuss the M&S hacks. But it is thought DragonForce ransomware was used to scrambled the firm's IT servers.
While the NCSC said it ""had insights"", it added it was ""not yet in a position to say if these attacks are linked"".
""We are working with the victims and law enforcement colleagues to ascertain that,"" it said.",Joe Tidy,1 day ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrg8zkz8d0o,Trump criticised after posting AI image of himself as Pope,"US President Donald Trump has attracted criticism from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope.
The picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, comes as Catholics mourn the death of Pope Francis, who died on 21 April, and prepare to choose the next pontiff.
The New York State Catholic Conference accused Trump of mocking the faith. The post comes days after he joked to media: ""I'd like to be Pope.""
Trump is not the first president to be accused of mocking the Catholic faith. Former US President Joe Biden, a Catholic, caused outrage a year ago when he made the sign of the cross at a pro-abortion access rally in Florida.
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to answer questions about Trump's post during a briefing with journalists on Saturday. The Vatican is preparing to host a conclave to choose Francis's successor beginning on Wednesday.
The image posted by Trump on Friday night features him wearing a white cassock and pointed mitre, traditionally worn by a bishop. He wears a large cross around his neck, and has his finger held up, with a solemn facial expression.
The New York State Catholic Conference, which represents bishops in New York, took to X to criticise the picture.
""There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,"" the group wrote.
""We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.""
Left-leaning Italian former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi also blasted Trump's post.
""This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,"" Renzi wrote in Italian on X.
But the White House rejected any suggestion that the Republican president was making fun of the papacy.
""President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects to Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,"" said press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
The backlash continued on Sunday, as New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan - who has been friendly with Trump for years - told reporters that he disliked the image.
""It wasn't good,"" he said, after attending a Mass in Rome. ""I hope he didn't have anything to do with that.""
Switching to Italian, he called it a ""brutta figura"", a phrase meaning a bad or embarrassing impression.
Asked if the White House should take down the image and apologise, he said - again in Italian - ""who knows"" and declined to speak more about it.",Max Matza,2 days ago,0

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynz85zj2vo,How Katy Perry became the Hot and Cold popstar,"Earlier this week American singer Katy Perry, best known for her bubblegum pop, said she felt like a ""human PiÃ±ata"" after weeks of online backlash.
The description felt suitably colourful - but the acknowledgement was serious. A decade on from headlining the Superbowl, Perry's part in a much-derided Blue Origin spaceflight has seen her star crash down to Earth.
Mockery over the apparent worthiness of her reaction, including kissing the ground after landing and saying she felt ""so connected to love"", spread online. Fast food chain Wendy's even posted to ask: ""Can we send her back?""
Trolls have now taken aim at her world tour, which began in Mexico on 23 April, criticising her dance moves and performances.
It seems the star who first broke through singing about a boyfriend's mood swings now faces an icy reception. Perry's blamed an ""unhinged and unhealed"" internet - but is toxic social media the only reason?



The music writer Michael Cragg, author of Reach for the Stars, believes Perry's problem is that she's stuck between pop cultures and feels increasingly out of touch.
""Her pop star persona was cemented in the 2010s as cartoon-y, fun and playful, all whipped cream bras and goofy videos where she wore oversized braces on her teeth,"" he says.
For a period this worked. Her second album Teenage Dream, which doubled down on Perry's staple cheeky, sexualised girl-next-door image, scored five Billboard number one singles to match a record set by Michael Jackson. Its follow-up, 2013's Prism, bore transatlantic smash single Roar (her fourth solo UK number one), as well as Dark Horse in the US (her ninth domestically). Perry hasn't topped charts under her own steam since.
""That was a long time ago in pop terms and it feels like she hasn't evolved,"" adds Cragg.

In the past year, her comeback single Woman's World, touted as a female empowerment anthem, struck critics as lyrically shallow.
Some fans also seemed unimpressed that it was produced by Dr. Luke, who previously faced sexual assault allegations from the singer Kesha. The producer denied the claims and the pair reached an agreement to settle a defamation lawsuit in 2023, but Perry remained tainted by association.
The track failed to land in the top 50 in the US and only just managed in the UK, at 47. ""Her sort of spiritual 'let love lead the way' messages she posts don't really hold sway with very online pop fans in the face of that decision,"" says Cragg.
""The regressive girl boss feel of Woman's World, and then the album not being great hasn't helped,"" he adds, pointing to rapper Doja Cat's success working with Dr. Luke without the same negative response.
It followed a pattern of failed reinvention attempts stretching back to 2017's Witness, where Perry attempted to launch her socially conscious ""purposeful pop"" era.
But its Sia-written lead single Chained to the Rhythm, which boldly attacked mindless pop culture, appeared to be undermined by Bon Appetit, a song openly objectifying Perry as a sexual meal.
Female pop stardom has shifted. Last year's biggest breakout music stars â Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX â were women joined by a thread of fierce self-assurance, underpinned by relatability and authenticity.
In contrast, Perry wanted distance from her pop persona - as the headline for Cragg's 2017 Guardian interview with her put it: ""I created this character called Katy Perry. I didn't want to be Katheryn Hudson. It was too scary.""
Perry's first hit I Kissed A Girl caused controversy for the fetishisation of lesbians even back in 2008 when it was released. But today Roan's had global success telling her genuine queer awakening.
""The flip flopping has jarred in an era where... very defined pop star personas are the ones cutting through,"" argues Cragg.
Perry's 2021-2023 playground-styled Las Vegas residency embraced her surreal, fantastical image to commercial and critical success.
But it's not translating to a new generation of fans. ""I think ultimately people see her as a bit cringeworthy now,"" Cragg adds. ""Being shot into space on a billionaire's jolly while everyone watches that on social media platforms interspersed with war and the climate crisis... just feels tonally not ideal,"" he says.
Perry may have misjudged the public mood, but at the same time, the venom in the blowback points to deeper issues in pop culture beyond her control.
There is no doubt that the social media landscape has become more frenzied in recent years, with stars like Roan speaking against toxic fandoms.
Simon Diego, the creator of Brazil's Portal Katy Perry fan community, described the scale of the abuse towards the 40-year-old as ""unbelievable"".
The group showed their support by clubbing together with other fan pages to pay for a digital billboard message in New York's Times Square for 24 hours.
""We're so proud of you and your magical journey and we love you to the moon and back,"" it read.
""Know that you are safe, seen and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.""
It was this that Perry replied to directly with her PiÃ±ata remark acknowledging the backlash.
""I think Katy and many other celebrities are feeling unsafe in the one space that used to connect them to fans,"" Diego tells BBC News.
He believes that's why Perry has never posted photos of her daughter's face online.
But even that boundary was ignored in the wake of the spaceflight criticism, as commenters began targeting her four-year-old child simply because ""it's cool now"", he says. ""They don't understand how bad it could affect her.""
Others, like Marie Claire Australia editor Georgie McCourt, think pervasive misogyny plays a part.
""There's a particular ire reserved for women like Perry: ambitious, unapologetic, hyper-visible,"" she wrote in a column, noting that male celebrities have already gone into space without such surveillant reaction.
So where next for Perry? Cragg says a hit single would help.
""I'm not saying it will return her to the commercial highs of old, because that ship has sailed for a lot of pre-streaming artists, but it will steady the ship.""",Alex Taylor,2 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4le9n469o,Uber starts allowing customers to pay in cash,"Uber is now allowing passengers across most of the UK to pay in cash.
Following trials, the cash payment option was this week extended to all UK cities, except London, where it is being reviewed.
But individual drivers can still opt out of accepting notes and coins, partly if they are worried about safety of carrying them in their vehicles.
The move came as a major report suggested shops and services might need to be forced to accept cash in the future to protect those who rely on it.
On Wednesday, the Treasury Committee of MPs stopped short of recommending mandated cash acceptance now, but said its report was ""a wake-up call"" to government on the issue.
Uber has become a huge company and dominates the global ride-hailing market, as well as operating in a host of other transport sectors. Its rapid ascent has come with controversy and protests from other taxi providers.
The taxi app's success has been based around new technology, but meant customers needed cashless payments to use its services.
Following pilots in Birmingham, Stoke, Nottingham and Leicester, Uber said it has now extended the option of paying in cash to other UK cities, because some people preferred paying in cash or did not have a bank card.
""We believe that movement should be accessible to everyone, so following successful pilots in some UK cities over the last 18 months, we have decided to give passengers outside of London the option to pay for trips with cash,"" a spokesman said.
Passengers can select cash as their payment option on the app. Drivers can opt out in preferences on their own app.
If they do not have enough change, that is given as a credit to the passenger by Uber.
The cash option is being reviewed by authorities in London, and remains unavailable for Uber Eats or booking for other forms of transport via the Uber app.
Cash campaigner Ron Delnevo from the Payment Choice Alliance said Uber's move ""demonstrates that they now believe in the future of cash in the UK"", and brought the company's operations in the UK in line with many other countries.
He called on the government to introduce a law that would force all shops and services to accept cash.
Ministers have said there are no plans to introduce such rules.
However, the Treasury Committee's recent report did highlight various groups who relied on cash, including some people with learning disabilities and those who use cash to keep to a budget.
Among those reliant on cash, and who gave evidence to the committee, were victim-survivors of domestic and economic abuse.
Many face the dangers of being traced by their abuser via the payments they make. Buying a train ticket, for example, could only be done with cash in order to avoid an abusive partner becoming aware of their movements.
""It really is a matter of life and death,"" said Sam Smethers, chief executive of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse. ""Without it they find themselves monitored daily, with every transaction.""
Joint bank accounts and mortgages had also been used as a way to impose coercive control over somebody, she said.
And cash could be used as an eventual escape route.
""One victim-survivor said she hid pockets of cash around her house until she had enough to flee her abuser,"" she said.
The charity would like to see cash acceptance backed by law, but Ms Smethers said she welcomed the focus the committee's report had put on the plight of those facing economic abuse.",Kevin Peachey,2 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkx3vy54nzo,"Co-op cyber attack affects customer data, firm admits, after hackers contact BBC","Cyber criminals have told BBC News their hack against Co-op is far more serious than the company previously admitted.
Hackers contacted the BBC with proof they had infiltrated IT networks and stolen huge amounts of customer and employee data.
After being approached on Friday, a Co-op spokesperson said the hackers ""accessed data relating to a significant number of our current and past members"".
Co-op had previously said that it had taken ""proactive measures"" to fend off hackers and that it was only having a ""small impact"" on its operations.
It also assured the public that there was ""no evidence that customer data was compromised"".
The cyber criminals claim to have the private information of 20 million people who signed up to Co-op's membership scheme, but the firm would not confirm that number.
The criminals, who are using the name DragonForce, say they are also responsible for the ongoing attack on M&S and an attempted hack of Harrods.
The attacks have led government minister Pat McFadden to warn companies to ""treat cyber security as an absolute priority"".
The anonymous hackers showed the BBC screenshots of the first extortion message they sent to Co-op's head of cyber security in an internal Microsoft Teams chat on 25 April.
""Hello, we exfiltrated the data from your company,"" the chat says.
""We have customer database, and Co-op member card data.""
They also showed screenshots of a call with the head of security which took place around a week ago.
The hackers say they messaged other members of the executive committee too as part of their scheme to blackmail the firm.
Co-op has more than 2,500 supermarkets as well as 800 funeral homes and an insurance business.
It employs around 70,000 staff nationwide.
The cyber attack was announced by the company on Wednesday.
On Thursday, it was revealed Co-op staff were being urged to keep their cameras on during Teams meetings, ordered not to record or transcribe calls, and to verify that all participants were genuine Co-op staff.
The security measure now appears to be a direct result of the hackers having access to internal Teams chats and calls.
DragonForce shared databases with the BBC that includes usernames and passwords of all employees.
They also sent a sample of 10,000 customers data including Co-op membership card numbers, names, home addresses, emails and phone numbers.
The BBC has destroyed the data it received, and is not publishing or sharing these documents.
The Co-op membership database is thought to be highly valuable to the company.
Since the BBC contacted Co-op about the hackers' evidence, the firm has disclosed the full extent of the breach to its staff and the stock market.
""This data includes Co-op Group members' personal data such as names and contact details, and did not include members' passwords, bank or credit card details, transactions or information relating to any members' or customers' products or services with the Co-op Group,"" a spokesperson said.
DragonForce want the BBC to report the hack - they are apparently trying to extort the company for money.
But the criminals wouldn't say what they plan to do with the data if they don't get paid.
They refused to talk about M&S or Harrods and when asked about how they feel about causing so much distress and damage to business and customers, they refused to answer.
DragonForce is a ransomware group known for scrambling victims' data and demanding a ransom is paid to get the key to unscramble it. They are also known to have stolen data as part of their extortion tactics.
DragonForce operates an affiliate cyber crime service so anyone can use their malicious software and website to carry out attacks and extortions.
It's not known who is ultimately using the DragonForce service to attack the retailers, but some security experts say the tactics seen are similar to that of a loosely coordinated group of hackers who have been called Scattered Spider or Octo Tempest.
The gang operates on Telegram and Discord channels and is English-speaking and young â in some cases only teenagers.
Conversations with the Co-op hackers were carried out in text form - but it is clear the hacker, who called himself a spokesperson, was a fluent English speaker.
They say two of the hackers want to be known as ""Raymond Reddington"" and ""Dembe Zuma"" after characters from US crime thriller Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a 'blacklist'.
The hackers say ""we're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist"".
Co-op says it is working with the NCSC and the NCA and said in a statement it is very sorry this situation has arisen.
UK government officials have met over the cyber attacks, with national security staff and the chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre discussing support for retailers.
In a keynote speech next week setting out government action, minister Pat McFadden - who has responsibility for cyber security - will say the attacks need to be a ""wake-up call"" for every UK business.
""In a world where the cybercriminals targeting us are relentless in their pursuit of profit - with attempts being made every hour of every day - companies must treat cyber security as an absolute priority.
""We've watched in real-time the disruption these attacks have caused - including to working families going about their everyday lives.
""It serves as a powerful reminder that just as you would never leave your car or your house unlocked on your way to work. We have to treat our digital shop fronts the same way.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgrwxp5r15o,Meta threatens to cut off Facebook in Nigeria over huge fines,"People in Nigeria may lose access to Facebook and Instagram after parent company Meta said it faced large fines and  ""unrealistic"" regulatory demands from the Nigerian authorities.
Last year, three Nigerian oversight agencies imposed fines on the US-based social media giant totalling more than $290m (Â£218m) for violating various laws and regulations.
Meta was unsuccessful in a recent attempt to challenge the decisions in the federal high court in Abuja.
""The applicant may be forced to effectively shut down the Facebook and Instagram services in Nigeria in order to mitigate the risk of enforcement measures,"" the company said in the court papers.
Meta also owns WhatsApp, but it did not mention the messaging service in its statement.
The high court has given the company until the end of June to pay the fines.
The BBC has asked Meta to outline what its next steps will be but has not yet received a response.
Facebook is by far the most popular social media platform in Nigeria and is used by tens of millions in the country for daily communication and sharing news. It is also a vital tool for many of Nigeria's small online businesses.
In July last year, Meta was asked to pay three fines:
FCCPC chief executive officer Adamu Abdullahi said investigations carried out in conjunction with the data commission between May 2021 and December 2023 revealed ""invasive practices against data subjects/consumers in Nigeria"" but was not specific about what these were.
In its court submission, Meta said its ""primary concern"" was with the data commission, which it accused of ""misinterpreting"" data privacy laws.
Specifically, the commission has demanded that Meta seek prior approval before transferring any personal data out of Nigeria - a condition that Meta called ""unrealistic"".
The data commission also imposed other demands.
Meta was told it must provide an icon linking to educational videos about data privacy risks. This would be content created in collaboration with government-approved educational institutions and non-profit organisations.
The NDPC insisted that these videos highlight the dangers of ""manipulative and unfair data processing"" that could expose Nigerian users to health and financial risks.
Meta described the NDPC's demands as unfeasible, saying that the agency has failed to ""properly interpret the laws guiding data privacy"".

The pricing error allowed some shoppers to get products - including jars of Loyd Grossman pasta sauce, Costa ground coffee and Fox's cookies - for free.
Whether a retailer has to honour purchases of products advertising lower prices in error can depend on their terms and conditions.
But the BBC spoke to several people who were able to take advantage of the Co-op's reduced items on Deliveroo, such as Robinsons squash being discounted from Â£1.50 to 15p a bottle.
A Co-op spokesperson said the low prices were the result of ""a clerical error"".
""A small number of prices were showing incorrectly on our Deliveroo shop for a few hours last night,"" they said.
""This was quickly resolved, and we apologise for any inconvenience caused.""
Peter, who lives in Lancashire, told the BBC the ""incredible offer"" allowed him to get more than Â£80 worth of goods for just Â£3.29 - including delivery fees.
""I was surprised the Co-op and Deliveroo honoured and delivered the mispriced items,"" he said.
He said he will be donating most of the items to his local food bank ""who desperately need non-perishable food for people in my community"".
It was recently revealed that, like Marks and Spencer, the Co-op has been affected by a cyber attack.
The firm shut down parts of its IT systems in response to hackers attempting to gain access.
There is no suggestion this issue and the attempted cyber attack are linked.
A Deliveroo spokesperson confirmed the pricing error.
""Yesterday we experienced a brief temporary issue involving items in a promotional campaign with one partner being priced incorrectly,"" they said.
Meanwhile, Sally Marie from Bolton said like many who bought discounted goods on Thursday evening, she found out about it from a website which called it a ""glitch"".
""I was sat on the sofa and thought I'd give it a go before the Co-op ran out of stock,"" she said.
""I quickly installed Deliveroo, and to my surprise, I found some items priced at zero.""
Her order arrived just 15 minutes later.
People also posted evidence of their low-priced purchases from the Co-op's Deliveroo service on social media.
""Got myself a lot of cheap bits from the Co-op,"" said one user in a post on X.
""15p Robinsons squash will do well with the heat wave.""
Meanwhile on Instagram, one user said they found other products heavily discounted, with Airwick Reed Diffusers selling for Â£5.45 less than their regular price.
He told the BBC that the prices returned to normal within 45 minutes of him ordering and receiving his items via Deliveroo.
According to Citizen's Advice, your rights when shopping for an item online that has been discounted in a pricing error can depend on a store's terms and conditions.
These may only give the consumer legal rights once they have either placed the order or received it.
It adds that when buying in a shop, you should not have to give back an item or pay more for it if they sold it to you at a lower cost than they meant to - unless you discussed the price first but they ended up charging you less.
Many retailers tend to uphold pricing errors for products.
In 2022, a pricing mistake for copies of Fifa 23 Ultimate Edition on India's Epic Games store allowed some to buy the game for 4.80 rupees ($0.06; Â£0.05).
Its publisher Electronic Arts (EA) said it would honour games purchased at its erroneous 99% discount.",Liv McMahon,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28z1zg9z2o,Grief of family who made new life in the wilderness,"An award-winning documentary which began with a family building a life in the Norwegian wilderness instead captured the dark months after their lives were upturned by grief.
A New Kind of Wilderness followed Nik and Maria Payne on their rural smallholding as they pursued a dream of living ""outside of the rat-race"", raising their three children close to nature.
Director Silje Evensmo Jacobsen had been following a blog written by Maria, herself a photographer and film-maker, for years when she came up with the idea of filming the family's alternative lifestyle.
But none of those involved could have foreseen Maria being diagnosed with cancer, which eventually claimed her life in 2019, aged just 41.
The film, which won the World Cinema Grand Jury Prize: Documentary at the Sundance film festival in 2024, is set to be released in cinemas in the UK on 16 May.
Ms Jacobsen had filmed some of the documentary before Maria became unwell, but had paused the production for some years by the time she was diagnosed.
When she got back in touch with the Paynes in 2019, Maria had died.
Nik, who grew up on a farm near Chester before moving to Norway with Maria, agreed to led Ms Jacobsen document their lives as he and their children, Ronja, Freya, Falk and Wolf, came to terms with grief.
Ms Jacobsen said: ""Even though I only met Maria a few times, losing her felt like losing a friend.
""I felt this urgency to capture her world visually.
""For me, the best way to do that was to show her story through her family, her children, and their way of life, but now also with a deeper dimension [of] how they coped after such a huge loss, while making sure Maria's spirit lived on through her photos and stories.""
Nik said watching the film reminded him of the dark months after losing his wife.
He told BBC North West Tonight: ""It brings back the memories and you realise just how dark and hard a time it was.
""And yet somehow you come through it.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8jdpglll5o,"Exhibition 'brings back memories', says internee","A man who was sent to a German internment camp during Jersey's occupation in World War Two says a new exhibition on its history ""does bring back memories"".
Roy Newton was two years old when he was sent to Bad Wurzach with his family in 1942.
More than 600 people were detained there until they were released in April 1945.
ArtHouse Jersey is displaying some of the internees stories in the Structures & Memory exhibition.
Mr Newton, who attended the launch of the exhibition at Capital House, said he had been ""overwhelmed"" by the works on display.
""I hope the next generation comes and remembers what we went through and I'm sure there's a lot of good here so I know they will.""
The exhibition is open until 8 June.
Composer Emily de Gruchy was one of the artists involved with the project.
She said she felt ""quite emotional"" at the launch.
""It is so fundamentally important that we keep these stories alive and I didn't know about this part of our history so for me this has been a real learning experience,"" Ms de Gruchy said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze1kkw6y53o,Salt Path story creates a trail of walking fans,"A best-selling book about one couple's journey of discovery on the South West Coast Path has created a trail of walkers inspired by their story.
Written by Raynor Winn, The Salt Path is now reaching a new audience through the recently released film starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Issacs.
Among those already prompted to tackle the 630-mile (1,014 km) coastal route for themselves are Bobbie Tucker and her partner Jason Beynon, who have been training along with their dog Teddy.
They hope to complete the entire route spanning four English counties in just six weeks, raising money for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and visiting lifeboat stations as they go.
""My sister lent me the book a couple of years ago and as I was reading I just thought I have to do this,"" said Ms Tucker.
She introduced her partner Jason to the story and together they decided to take time off work to make the walk happen.
The book tells the true story of Winn's journey with her husband Moth walking the route from Somerset to Dorset, after being evicted from their farm and her husband receiving a devastating health diagnosis.
Mr Beynon said: ""Certainly for Moth it was a real journey. He had that diagnosis and for any man with any illness, to do that is quite exceptional and to do that with no money is just so brave.
""They could have just given up and said life has dealt us a bad hand but they didn't. What a terrific journey and one to inspire everybody.""
But not everyone wants to walk the entire path in one go.
Jane and Alan Gumbrell have being walking the coast path in sections and aim to complete it in a decade.
Ms Gumbrell read The Salt Path and is keeping her own journal of their trips and the people who join them one week at a time.
She said family members and friends had joined them on different holidays and were all in a section of her log book with photos and stories.
Mr Gumbrell said he recommended taking the route slowly.
""No need to rush it, it's stopping at all the different places for a few days, experiencing everywhere you stop. Just do it a week at a time,"" he said.
Tourism leaders expect fans of the film to seek out some of the filming locations and welcome more walkers.
Lorna Sherriff, national trail officer for the South West Coast Path Association, said everyone was welcome.
""There are 630 miles to share, there is something for everyone here,"" she said.
The association uses counting machines to record footfall at 15 different locations on the path.
The statistics gathered helps inform the organisation which part of the path is likely to need more maintenance.
Ms Sherriff said: ""It's an amazing free resource for people to get out there and walk. But it does cost a lot to maintain.
""It's Â£1,500 per mile, per year and it's 630 miles along, so that's an awful lot of money.""
Julian Gray, director of the association, estimates that walkers contribute Â£500m to the regional economy when they stay in accommodation and eat in nearby restaurants and pubs, supporting about 10,000 jobs along the route.
""To have a film which is focused just about the path is brilliant,"" he said.
""What The Salt Path will do is not just tell people about the trail, but the transformative power of walking.
""The South West Coast Path is the perfect multivitamin. It gets you out there, gets you near green space and blue space and connects you with nature.""
The film is released on 30 May, with a gala screening taking place at the Lighthouse Cinema in Newquay on Tuesday.

Known for his quirky and meticulously-created style and pastel-coloured aesthetic,  the exhibition at the Design Museum in Kensington will feature more than 600 models, props and costumes from films including the Grand Budapest Hotel and Royal Tenenbaums.
The museum says this is the first time these items have been displayed in Britain.
Co-curator Lucia Savi said every object was ""very personal to him - they are not simply props, they are fully formed pieces of art and design that make his inventive worlds come to life"".
Curators say the exhibition will begin with 1996's Bottle Rocket, Anderson's first feature film, and end with The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, a short film based on a Roald Dahl story for which he won an Oscar in 2024 for best live action short film.
As well as finished props and sets, the exhibition will feature work-in-progress material and maquettes - a small-scale model or rough draft of a sculpture or architectural work - organisers say.
Tim Marlow, director and chief executive of the Design Museum, said: ""He's an utterly compelling creator of cinematic worlds, whose singular vision and attention to detail are underpinned by an acute understanding of design and craftsmanship, which is why the Design Museum is the perfect location for this landmark retrospective.""
The show, which premiered at la Cinematheque francaise in Paris in March, launches on 21 November.

""I painted a bee just for fun popped it on Facebook and someone asked if they could buy it.
""I think I gave my first one away for free but I bought another canvas, and then I just bought another and carried on and it literally hasn't stopped from there.""
Positivity is a major theme of her art and she seeks to make happy feel happy through the vibrant paintings she creates.
""I think in the world we live in nowâ¦ there's a lot of sad things going on and depressing things going on and people struggle with mental health. I feel that I love creating art that when you look at it you feel happy and if it makes one person smile, I've done my job.
""That's all I want to do in life, is make the world a happier place through art.""
""Painting is my therapy. If I'm feeling down I go to my studio I put my music on full blast I dance for a bit and I paint and it just cheers me up.""

The seven day Swindon Festival of Literature begins on Monday and runs until Sunday, with events ranging from readings to open-air festival style performance art.

Professor Richard Dawkins, poet George Szirtes and impressionist Alistair McGowan were among the names set to appear.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34k2097g3o,Mum writes book to help dyslexic daughter,"A mother has written a book to help parents and children better understand dyslexia following her own daughter's diagnosis.
Dawn Crowle, from Chippenham in Wiltshire, noticed her nine-year-old daughter Sophie struggled with school work while she was being home-schooled during the Covid lockdown.
When Sophie received her diagnosis, at the age of seven, she did not fully understand what the condition was, which prompted Ms Crowle to collaborate with her friend, Rhiannon Jones, to write Sophie's Superpower.
Ms Crowle said the book makes Sophie ""beam from ear-to-ear"", adding she hopes to raise more awareness of the condition.
Dyslexia is a common condition that mainly causes problems with reading, writing and spelling.
Ms Crowle, who was also diagnosed with dyslexia at 14, noticed similarities to her own childhood and knew she could relate to her daughter.
The book tells the story of Sophie, a young girl who struggles with reading and writing in school, but once she receives a dyslexia diagnosis, everything starts to make sense.
Although the condition brings its own challenges, Sophie learns to embrace it as a superpower and gains confidence and resilience in her abilities.
Ms Crowle said that at school, Sophie often ""masked"" her struggles during lessons. However, when she got home, she would open up and express her feelings.
""We decided to have her privately tested... it was the best thing we ever did because it came out and there were so many things that we could help and support her with,"" Ms Crowle said.
On her website, Ms Crowle said that following Sophie's diagnosis she started to look for books at her daughter's level and age that she could read to Sophie to help her understand.
But she said she became ""frustrated"" she could not find anything and ""wanted to write one for Sophie"" herself.
""I hope that this story can help and relate to children, parents and teachers, as it has helped Sophie,"" she said.
The book officially launches on 17 May.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9342931pk2o,"Belly dancer, 84, has navel approach to exercise","An 84-year-old belly dancer, whose twisting tummy was once frowned upon during a British midriff crisis, has urged people of all ages to keep active as she reflects on her career.
Tina Hobin, from Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, teaches a belly dancing class every week and says she is the oldest professional belly dancer in the UK.
""Life is precious,"" she said, taking stock of her art. ""Exercise and dancing gives people a purpose... it's important because it improves muscle tone.""
Ms Hobin said that too many people were sitting down and watching TV instead of moving, which could cause back pain and mobility issues. But can shaking one's hips really avoid creaking hips?
Well, according to Ms Hobin, her particular form of activity - a dance originating in ancient Egypt - has helped many of her students with physical health problems, including strengthening the upper back as well as boosting flexibility.
""It's changed my life,"" she said. ""It's fantastic, it raises your energy levels and people can't believe my age, I've stayed slim since my 30s.""
She said the dance emerged after women in labour were encouraged to concentrate on their pelvic and abdominal regions to avoid the pain of contractions.
""Women tend to fight against contraction, but through the movements [they went with it], it's just nature,"" she said.
But such undulations - when presented on stage - once confused Britain which, she explained, could not easily disassociate the art from sex.
Ms Hobin said there was a lack of understanding about belly dancing, particularly regarding sexualisation, whether that be through deliberate presentation or flawed perception, both of which she was against.
""I was doing a lot of TV,"" she said of her past, ""and producers told me there hadn't been a belly dancer who had gone far [on screen]. That really, really annoyed me - they assumed [I was like] a stripper or prostitute.
""In this country, [the dance was mostly performed] in nightclubs [or by] strippers.
""I don't encourage people to come showing their bellies and boobs. I like to encourage women from all walks of life, all shapes and ages â there's not a particular image you have to emulate.""
It's all meant that she somewhat struggles with the term belly dancing, although admits it's the one by which people most easily recognise the form.
She said she preferred to call it ""the sacred dance of life"", or at least ""belly dancing for health and fitness"".
Ms Hobin said she had seen women's confidence and self-esteem blossom after taking up the dance.
""I've seen women who have been divorced and their husbands left them for someone else,"" she said.
""They didn't think they were good enough anymore, but they do dancing and it's helped them get in touch with themselves.
""[I've also seen] people who have been abused and said it helped them get in touch with their body and sexuality again.""
Ms Hobin said she was introduced to belly dancing in the 1970s.
After seeing a newspaper article about a class, she thought the dancer looked ""elegant and lovely"" and decided to become a member. She said she had never looked back.

She has been teaching her own classes since 1974 - with students including inmates at a women's prison - and has been invited all over the world to host belly dancing workshops.
And there are no plans to stop.
""I'll dance until I'm 120,"" she said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39jgkxvwjjo,Today's Doctor Who 'too sophisticated' for former star,"A former Doctor Who star admitted he could not understand the stories in the current version of the BBC science-fiction series.
Peter Purves played Steven Taylor, a travelling companion of the very first Doctor, for a year from 1965.
The 86-year-old actor, who lives at Sibton in Suffolk, spoke to the BBC at the opening of a new Doctor Who exhibition at Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery, where he was the guest of honour on Saturday.
Purves said the series had become ""far too sophisticated for my simple brain"", but believed its production values were now much higher, with far more money being spent than when he was in it.
Purves joined the cast of the hit children's show almost 60 years ago, first appearing in a serial called The Chase in June 1965.
His character Steven was a stranded space pilot of the far future, who the original Doctor, played by William Hartnell, rescued and then shared several adventures with.
""We used to have stories that were very simple, you went from there to there, you had a cliffhanger at the end of an episode, the following week you picked up from there and went to another cliffhanger, then end of story, on to another one.
""Very simple, very straightforward, very clear and easy for kids to understand.""
He said he stopped regularly watching the series in the early 1970s, when Jon Pertwee was the Doctor.
Despite Pertwee being a friend of his, Purves did not enjoy the show's format of the period, with the Doctor having been exiled to Earth and many of the stories taking place in the south of England.
""I didn't like the serials then because it got embedded in England, which lots of people think is fabulous and great, it just wasn't for me. It had lost what Doctor Who was all about.""
The actor said he still kept track of the programme's cast changes to avoid any awkwardness with fellow guests at conventions.
""I try to make sure I know who's in it. If I turn up somewhere and there's someone I don't know, it could be quite embarrassing, particularly if they're a principal character.""
While almost all surviving episodes of Doctor Who from 1963 onwards are now available to watch on the BBC iPlayer, Purves is not convinced it necessarily opens up the productions from his era to new generations of young viewers.
""I remember being in America at a convention and a woman came up to me and said, 'I've been trying to get my son interested in the classics, but he won't watch it because he thinks the television's broken' because you've got these black-and-white pictures.""
Purves regularly fronted Doctor Who-related features when presenting the children's show Blue Peter from 1967 to 1978 but said he generally stayed away from Doctor Who conventions and events until the 1990s.
He restored his connection to the series in that decade, when he began providing linking narration for audio releases of Doctor Who episodes from his time, which no longer exist in the archives, but for which the soundtracks survive recorded by fans at home.
Despite claiming not to be able to follow the programme's current style of storytelling, Purves told the crowd watching him cut the ribbon on the new exhibition that he was impressed by Doctor Who's longevity.
""It is a remarkable thing that a series could continue to hold an audience for so long.
""And here I am â getting very old â and being able to talk about it 60 years after I first did it.""

Pharrell Williams and Lewis Hamilton are among the co-chairs for this year's event, which raises money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.
The annual gala, which takes place in New York City, is usually attended by huge names from the world of film, fashion and music.
Here's everything you need to know ahead of the Met Gala 2025.
The Met Gala's theme is usually connected to the Costume Institute's latest exhibition, which this year is Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.
It's inspired by Monica L Miller's book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, published in 2009.
This year's Met Gala dress code is ""Tailored for You"" - a reference to the suiting and menswear which features in the exhibition.
In fact, this is the first Met Gala in more than two decades to focus exclusively on menswear.
""The theme this year is not only timely,"" said Gala committee member Usher, ""but also speaks to our rich culture that should always be widely celebrated.""
Expect lots of references from both the male and female guests to the role black style has played over the centuries, particularly in menswear.
The Met says the show ""presents a cultural and historical examination of black style from the 18th Century to today, through the lens of dandyism"".
Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who oversees the gala every year, is joined for 2025 by co-chairs Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky and LeBron James.
Black talent is also being celebrated with the event's host committee, which includes athlete Simone Biles, film director Spike Lee, actress Ayo Edebiri, pop stars Doechii, Usher, Tyla, Janelle MonÃ¡e and AndrÃ© 3000, author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and playwright Jeremy O Harris.
The Met Gala always takes place on The First Monday in May - to use the title of the 2016 documentary about the event.
This year, that means it takes place on Monday, 5 May, with guests arriving from about 18:00 EST (23:00 BST).
It might be a bank holiday in the UK, but for the designers, publicists and PAs, it'll be an extraordinarily busy day as they preen and prepare their stars to walk the grand staircase.
Although the public never gets to see inside the event itself, where the guests are treated to dinner, cocktails, live music and a look around the costume institute's new exhibition, the lengthy red carpet event beforehand ensures acres of media coverage.
The guest list isn't published in advance, but you can safely expect to see a huge number of A-listers on the night.
Unless you're a New York resident planning to stand behind the barriers across the road from the museum, your best bet is probably to watch it online.
Vogue will be running a live stream of the event across their digital platforms, including YouTube.
US viewers will be able to watch on Peacock and E! Online, while countless news outlets will be live streaming their own coverage on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok.
You can also follow the live blog here on the BBC News website.
But to be honest, photos and videos from the night will be inescapable when you open your social media feeds on Tuesday morning, so if you're in the UK and going to bed, you shouldn't have to look too far for coverage when you wake up.
No, sorry hun.
The Met Gala is an exclusive event, only open to a small number of invited guests - usually around 450.
Often, the biggest brands will buy a table, and use it to host their desired celebrities. The label benefits if the celebrity is associated with them and wears one of their outfits on the red carpet.
The proceeds from ticket sales go to the costume institute. It's understood an individual ticket goes for around $75,000 (Â£56,000), while a 10-seat table starts at $350,000.
But at least the A-listers don't have to deal with dynamic pricing.

But that's not all the week has in store.
BBC Three's I Kissed A Boy is back for series two, Sir David Attenborough's film Ocean is released on his 99th birthday, and PinkPantheress is dropping a new album.
Read on for what's coming up this week...
Earlier this year, Molly-Mae Hague broke her silence after being photographed apparently kissing her ex, Tommy Fury, at a party.
I was at the press event where she made the comments, ahead of her new TV series, Molly-Mae: Behind It All.
She told me, and the other reporters, that she and Tommy - who announced their split last year - were ""figuring it out as adults, as parents"", adding that the situation was ""really complicated"".
So what can we expect from part two of her documentary series, which launches on Prime Video on Friday?
We're told that, after the ""media frenzy"" that surrounded the photograph, we will see the former Love Islander ""living her dreams"" at Paris Fashion Week.
But the series will also reveal how hard she's finding life on her own at home.
Cameras will show her making âlife-changing decisionsâ and taking a trip to give rebuilding her family one last chance.
On Sunday, the UK's first ever gay dating show, I Kissed a Boy, returns to BBC Three.
Dannii Minogue is heading back to the Masseria in her role as Cupid, while the series is voiced by Layton Williams.
The format sees 10 singles matched up, and introduced for the first time - with a kiss to test out their chemistry.
From then on, you can expect love triangles, budding romance, wandering eyes - and plenty of drama.
Pop star Minogue has said she's excited to tell more ""diverse and important stories"", adding: ""I'll have the party started for a wonderful summer of love.""
The first series was praised by critics for its inclusive and positive treatment of gay love, and it was followed swiftly by I Kissed a Girl which aired last year.
By Mark Savage, music correspondent
Last August, PinkPantheress cancelled all her remaining tour dates â including lucrative support slots with Coldplay and Olivia Rodrigo â to concentrate on her health. ""I've reached a wall which I am struggling to penetrate through,"" she said in a statement to fans.
But she's put the downtime to good use. The 23-year-old's new mixtape, Fancy That, is accessible, hypnotic and seductive alt-pop.
She's been teasing the project since January, when she posted photos from her home studio, captioned: ""oh we are soooo back #2025."" Speaking to Mixmag, she said listening to Fatboy Slim and Groove Armada had inspired ""the size of the music"".
But it's another dance band whose DNA is sprinkled all over the EP. Basement Jaxx get writing credits on four of the five tracks, with PinkPantheress sampling classic 2000s dance hits like Romeo and Good Luck. Elsewhere, she chops in samples of the music she was raised on, from Sugababes to Underworld.
In a recent Reddit thread, PinkPantheress said the mixtape represented a ""more fun"" side to her personality than the introspective, ""emo asf"" lyrics of her debut album Heaven Knows. She certainly seems to be having a blast on party-centric club cuts Tonight and Illegal (sample lyric: ""Is this illegal? It feels illegal""); while Stateside giddily documents a transatlantic love affair.
It's all over in about 20 minutes â but what a rush.
On Thursday, Sir David Attenborough turns 99 - and the same day sees the release of his new landmark film, Ocean, in cinemas.
The documentary promises to take viewers on a ""breath-taking journey"" around the world's seas and oceans, showcasing their vital importance for our survival.
Using underwater footage, it will explore the major threats to our oceans, from destructive fishing techniques to mass coral reef bleaching.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpr212n18o,Dr Who display extends hours to attract visitors,"A museum is hoping that an unofficial exhibition dedicated to the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who will encourage more people to visit.
Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery has extended its opening hours and will open on Sundays for its new exhibition called Adventures in Time and Space.
Laura Hancock, the museum's heritage engagement manager, admitted that with local councils ""looking hard at their budgets"" there had been ""questions in the press about opening hours"".
""Really this exhibition is an opportunity for people to use your local museum,"" she said.
Guest of honour at the opening was former Doctor Who star Peter Purves.
The 86-year-old actor, who lives in Suffolk, starred in the series as Steven Taylor, a companion of the first incarnation of The Doctor, as played by William Hartnell, from 1965 to '66.
Speaking to the crowd as he cut the ribbon, Purves said he understood the museum could be under threat, and he hoped the exhibition would ""do something to make sure that it does stay open"". He encouraged people to ""spread the word"".
""These sort of facilities only exist for you, for us, so it's something which we must support,"" said Purves, who also presented the BBC's Blue Peter.
Another visitor on the opening day with a close link to the timelord was composer Dominic Glynn.
He provided music for Doctor Who in the 1980s, including creating a new version of its famous theme tune for the 1986 series â a job he admitted had made him ""very nervous, as you would be, because it's a national institution and you mess with it at your peril"".
Glynn, 64, said the exhibition was ""incredible... there is so much memorabilia from the last 60 years in this one place; it's absolutely stunning"".
Most of those attending the opening day were fans and viewers, rather than those who had worked on the series.
Sarah Grossman, 43, had travelled from London and said she was impressed.
Her favourite exhibit was a fake Mona Lisa prop from the 1979 story City of Death, co-written by Douglas Adams (who went on to write the BBC's Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy), ""because it's one of my favourite serials"".
Amy Cuddeford, 28, said it was fun to see props both from when she watched the series as a child in 2005, and when her mother had watched it in the 1960s and 70s.
Dominic Cuddeford, 23, also enjoyed seeing the props but was surprised to see how ""basic"" some of them appeared close-up, in contrast to how they were made to appear on-screen.
""It puts more validation into what goes into it, and what goes on behind-the-scenes to make the show,"" he said.
Many of the items on display had come from the collection of Derek Handley, who curated the exhibition.
Some are originals as used on-screen, while others are replicas he created.
He explained the event had taken about a year to put together.
""There's not just myself that collects Doctor Who costumes and props,"" he said.
""There's loads of other fans, and we have them all stored individually in our houses, and the only time people see them is when someone comes round to our house.
""So it's wonderful to be able to gather like-minded people together who have got all these wonderful things, and then put them out on display so the public can see them.""
Adventures in Time & Space runs until 2 November and is open Monday to Saturday, 10:00-16:00.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz79x7exn3wo,Marvel's Thunderbolts* proves a hit at box office,"Marvel and Disney's newest release Thunderbolts* has proved a hit at the box office, after taking an estimated $162m (Â£122m) internationally.
The film, which both production houses hope will kickstart a new franchise, is based around lesser-known superheroes who have to take on human and superhuman threats whilst fighting their own personal battles.
It stars Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan in two of the main roles, alongside Julia Louis-Dreyfus and David Harbour.
Whilst not all critic reviews have been favourable, the movie has been a hit with superhero fans - drawing in an impressive 95 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.
It means the film receives the third highest audience score for a Marvel title, tying with Spider-Man: Far From Home and behind Shangi-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Spider-Man: No Way Home.
Not all critics have not treated the film as favourably, with Empire's John Nugent noting that the film is ""missing a bit of colour - literally, in the washed-out palette and CG shadow-threat that dominates the latter half of the film â and figuratively, in its subject matter"".
He adds that the topics covered, including suicide, depression and domestic violence are ""not always sensitively handled"".
Radheyan Simonpillai at The Guardian gives the film three stars, citing that although the film is ""the best thing to come from the brand [Marvel] since WandaVision"", ""Thunderbolts often irritates because the depression and trauma the movie supposedly grapples with so often lives on the surface"".
Simonpillai is full of praise for Pugh though, ""who can wrestle sincerity out of a screenplay (and a franchise) that has so little"".
However, Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent looks on the film a little more favourably, giving it four stars and calling it ""the best Marvel movie in years"".
""Thunderbolts does feel different to what's come before.
""It's the first of its kind to seem genuinely self-aware - Thunderbolts might actually then be the ultimate Marvel film for now,"" she adds.
Audience fatigue when it comes to Marvel films is a genuine concern for the studio, which has been trying to pivot away from the characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe since the release of Avengers: Endgame in 2019.
It is perhaps why Deadpool & Wolverine was a big hit for Marvel last summer, as it featured characters that have been less front and centre for them, with Thunderbolts* potentially following a similar path.",Annabel Rackham,2 days ago,0

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2e4rr9420o,Ed Sheeran renames pub and puts on 'surprise' gig,"Fans of Ed Sheeran have been treated to a ""surprise"" gig at a pub in his home county that he is taking over for a fortnight.
The Thomas Wolsey in Ipswich town centre has been re-branded as The Old Phone - named after one of Sheeran's latest songs.
The pub will be known by that name for two weeks, before it reverts to its actual name again.
Music-lovers have been speaking of their delight at seeing the global star perform on their doorstep.
Rachel Clements, 28, from Stowmarket, said she was ""very excited that he's doing something this small, in our home town"".
Ms Clements said she was hoping to hear his latest track and new material from his Play album, which includes a song called Old Phone.
""We had one of his songs as our wedding song last year, so in a way I'm hoping he'll do that,"" she added.
Ms Clements was among the many fans who responded to an Ed Sheeran WhatsApp message to get tickets.
People were also waiting to see if they might be let in if there was space.
It is the latest instalment of Sheeran's pop-up pub concept.
He has previously opened versions of The Old Phone in Ipswich, Massachusetts, US, for one night, and another one at the Coachella festival in California.
Alyssa Ali, 20, from Florida in the US, had been in London where she has been studying for a month.
She fortuitously decided to come to Ipswich this weekend, as part of her travels around the UK.
Sheeran grew up in Framlingham, about 15 miles north of Ipswich, but he is known for being an avid Ipswich Town fan and has sponsored their shirts, and he played gigs at other pubs in the town before  he became famous.
""I love Ed and have been a fan for a decade,"" said Ms Ali.
""So I had to come to his hometown and go around Ipswich, and I was here yesterday, and then he decided to pop-up here in this pub, and my hotel's eight minutes walk from there, so we ran over here as soon as I found out, hoping to get in.
""I'm so nervous because I don't know if I'll be able to get in. I'm just so excited to be in his presence again.""
She said she was very much looking forward to hearing his new songs.
Michael Marron, 38, from Ipswich, was also hoping to see Sheeran perform.
""Delighted, we saw him do this show in America and we were wondering if he would do something like this in Ipswich.
""It's great that he's come back to Ipswich and he's entertaining the people of Suffolk.""
Sheeran is known for playing impromptu gigs in Suffolk's county town, including one on the Town Hall steps in 2022.
""It's a buzz, and he always goes the extra mile for the people of Suffolk,"" said Mr Marron.
""I remember he was here not so long ago and he gifted a guitar to a primary school child. It's great to see celebrities do that.""
It is understood music bloggers, influencers and selected fans were invited or picked at random to attend the gig.
Last week, the musician announced a a run of three gigs at Ipswich Town's Portman Road in July. He is also a minority stakeholder in the club, which has just been relegated from the Premier League.
The Thomas Wolsey is named after one of Ipswich's most famous sons - Henry VIII's right hand man Cardinal Wolsey, whose statue is just along the road from the pub.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zqnqqp7qo,Care leavers tell stories in 'pain into power' art,"Young people who grew up in care have been invited to turn their ""pain into power"" by creating art that describes their lived experiences.
The Woven Worlds project has delivered free art workshops to two groups - young people in Manchester who have spent time in care, and survivors of war in Kitgum, northern Uganda.
Fashion designer Jessie Stringer-Fewtrill, who grew up in care, obtained funding from the British Council to deliver the workshops with a Ugandan friend.
""I used art and words as a form of self expression, like creative therapy,"" said Miss Stringer-Fewtrill, who added that she loved to see the workshops' participants benefiting in the same way.
She said she hoped the sessions would help encourage care leavers to recognise that coming from a place of hardship is ""something to be celebrated"".
Artwork created in the workshops will be used for a fashion collection made from sustainable materials.
Miss Stringer-Fewtrill said being involved in the project had been ""really special"" since, for many years, she did not talk about her time in the care sector.
Sharing her own ""lived experiences"" had created a safe space where people could talk openly and express themselves, she said.
""I always say 'pain into power', so it's about channelling that energy and being powerful together,"" explained Miss Stringer-Fewtrill.
""Even though you've come from hardship, it's like 'Yeah, I've come out of that hardship and that's something to be celebrated'.""
Katende Godfrey, who works for Ugandan brand IGC Fashion, co-led the Woven Worlds project.
He delivered workshops in Uganda to a community impacted by civil war.
Those taking part in the sessions will also have their work featured in a fashion collection.
He said working with the community had been ""challenging"" and ""impactful"".
""What we have in this collection is beyond people's imagination,"" said Mr Godfrey.
Mr Godfrey and Miss Stringer-Fewtrill met in Uganda five years ago and said they both knew they wanted to work together because of their aligned interests.
Only this year, however, did they find the time to develop ideas and apply for funding.
They were ""elated"" to subsequently be awarded the International Collaboration Grant by the British Council, which aims to promote ""peace and prosperity by building connections, understanding and trust between people in the UK and countries worldwide"".
Miss Stringer-Fewtrill said both she and Mr Godfrey cared about ""community impact, upskilling, and raising awareness about the effects of fast fashion"".
Working on the project also gave Mr Godfrey a chance to visit the UK for the first time, and learn new artistic techniques, like naturally dying textiles.
Megan, 21, and 19-year-old Humaira attended the workshops in Manchester.
""At times it can be isolating in the care system,"" explained Megan, adding that the project had allowed her to meet people from similar backgrounds.
Both said they had learned about the importance of self-expression and how to positively channel their emotions into something creative.
""Care leavers have such unique experiences and it's important to create something from that,"" said Humaira.
The final fashion collection will be revealed in September

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3evq307348o,Festival 'survived all sorts' as it celebrates 25th anniversary,"""We've survived all sorts of challenges... We've had fires. We've had floods, a global pandemic, but we're still standing.""
From ""spit and sawdust"" beginnings to a major 10-day cultural celebration, one of Northern Ireland's leading festivals is celebrating 25 years of showcasing the arts.
Conceived in the shadow of the Good Friday Agreement peace deal, the first Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival (CQAF) was staged in May 2000 in an attempt to regenerate Belfast's north inner city.
A quarter of a century on, the city's cultural infrastructure has drastically improved, but financial support for the arts is at an ""all-time low"", according to the festival's director.
CQAF prides itself on being as accessible as possible, with numerous free events and low-cost ticket pricing.
Now established as a limited company with charitable status, the festival's income is evenly divided between self-generated and public funds.
However, balancing the books can prove challenging, CQAF director Sean Kelly explained.
""We had an agenda, I suppose, we wanted to make the arts a bit more affordable for people,"" Mr Kelly said as he reflected on the festival's early days.
""Every year is a struggle... Unfortunately what you have to do, sometimes, when the level of support goes down, is to put your ticket prices up slightly.
""We're trying to make sure that we don't price people out and make going to concerts and theatre just the preserve of people that have money, that's very much a part of our ethos.""
The Department for Communities has acknowledged that funding to the Arts Council of Northern Ireland ""has decreased, in real terms, by 30% over the last decade"".
This year's festival is taking place from 1 to 11 May, and features more than 100 performances across dozens of venues.
Recognised for its diverse programming, CQAF presents a combination of renowned acts, emerging talent and fringe performers, attracting more than 60,000 audience-goers to Belfast's cultural quarter.
""There's been many amazing moments,"" Mr Kelly told BBC News NI. ""People that I'd never, ever dreamed I'd work with.""
Standout performers have included Liam Clancy, ""who Bob Dylan regards as the greatest folk singer in the world"", who played at the festival just a few months before his death in 2009.
The same year attracted the likes of American soul singer Candi Staton, Irish rockabilly Imelda May and the, then, lesser-known Calvin Harris.
""He was little more than a bedroom DJ, he played in our marquee in Custom House Square,"" Mr Kelly said.
""He's one of the biggest music producers in the world, worth millions and millions of pounds, but I can tell you we weren't paying him a big fee in those days!""
Another highlight was Patti Smith's appearance at the 2003 festival.
The punk pioneer performed at a former Ulster University student union building, Conor Hall, to an audience of 300 people.
""It was kind of spit and sawdust but it was probably one of the most mesmerising performances I've ever seen in my life,"" Mr Kelly said.
Looking to the future, Mr Kelly isn't chasing scale or status.
""We don't need to be the biggest festival in Ireland.. If we do 100 shows and each of them are amazing, I'm happy with that.""
The Cathedral Quarter, Belfast's nightlife and arts epicentre, has changed significantly in the last 25 years, he explained, and a ""spiritual need"" for music, comedy and theatre ""is there and growing"".
""When we started there was no Black Box, there was no Mac Theatre, the Oh Yeah Music Centre... there was no real infrastructure in the area, all that has improved greatly.""
These spaces need protected, he added.
""We need to make sure that however successful the Cathedral Quarter becomes, however great the bar and restaurant culture is, the artists are respected,"" he said.
Artists like Belfast-born singer-songwriter AOIBHA, who is stepping into a new role as the 2025 Artist in Residence at the festival - a moment she describes as both an honour and a full-circle experience.
The role sees AOIBHA deeply involved with the festival, performing multiple support slots and culminating in her own headline show on 10 May.
It's a position she doesn't take lightly, reflecting on how previous artists in residence inspired her.
""I've really looked up to them,"" she said. ""When I was offered the opportunity it was a no-brainer.""
A passionate advocate for Belfast's arts culture, AOIBHA credits the city's small size for fostering creativity.
""The people are fantastic - welcoming, kind, and with the best sense of humour,"" she said.
""It's a city where you can quickly get to know other musicians in the scene, different venues... There's a real ability to build community and build strong connections.""
As for her upcoming shows during the festival, AOIBHA is especially excited about supporting acts like The Magic Numbers, Luca Fogale and Bernard Butler.
Still, it's her own headline show at the Harrison Hotel that stands out.
""It's a unique space for a gig,"" she said. ""I don't think anything like this has happened in that room before, so I'm really excited by the challenge.""
This moment is more than just a career milestone, it's a reflection of years spent immersed in Belfast's music community, both on and off the stage.
""There were so many times I stood in the audience thinking: 'One day, I want to play on that stage',"" she said.
""It feels like a really important time for me now, I'm there, it's really significant.""",Matt Fox,2 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c705p98d0kgo,Two million people attend free Lady Gaga concert in Brazil,"More than two million people have attended a free Lady Gaga concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, city officials say.
The pop star's biggest ever concert was paid for by the city in an attempt to revitalise Rio's economy.
They expect it could bring in $100m (Â£75m) to the local economy.
Saturday's performance was part of a promotional tour for Lady Gaga's eighth album, Mayhem, whose songs include Abracadabra and Die With a Smile. She last performed in Brazil in 2012.
Some fans - known as Gaga's ""Little Monsters"" - began queuing early in the morning and waited in long lines to gain access to the beach.
A massive security operation was in place, with 5,000 police officers on duty and attendees having to pass through metal detectors. The authorities also used drones and facial recognition cameras to help police the event.
Lady Gaga is not the first person to play a free concert in Rio. Madonna gave a  concert on Copacabana beach in May 2024, which was also paid for by the city.

""You waited for me, you waited for more than 10 years for me,"" an emotional Lady Gaga told the crowds as she unfurled a Brazilian flag.
""Brazil, I'm ready. I'm going to give it my all.""
The pop star appeared in Brazil-themed costumes for some of her acts, with outfits inspired by the national football team.
Thousands sang along with her best known hits including Alejandro, Poker Face and Abracadabra, creating an electric atmosphere as many waved rainbow-themed fans and watched on huge screens along the beach.
Fans travelled from all across the country to see the grandiose performance.
One man, 28-year-old Luan Messias, said he spent all night on a bus from Itanhaem in neighbouring Sao Paulo state.
Alisha Duarte, 22, told AFP news agency she started queuing at 0740 in the morning. ""Lady Gaga is worth it! It's going to get super crowded, but we'll survive,"" she said.
Another fan, Paulo Oliveira, explained why people were so excited about the concert. She ""tells us that we can be who we are, that we can be different and that being different is cool,"" he told Reuters.
It's going to be an ""unforgettable show"", concert attendee Lai Borges told Reuters on her way in. ""It's going to be emotional and I'm going to cry a lot,"" she said.
As the event drew to a close, Lady Gaga told the audience - in a reference to the nickname for Lady Gaga fans - ""we are monsters and monsters never die,"" and she brought the concert to a close with Bad Romance, perhaps her most famous song.",Gabriela Pomeroy,2 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynz85zj2vo,How Katy Perry became the Hot and Cold popstar,"Earlier this week American singer Katy Perry, best known for her bubblegum pop, said she felt like a ""human PiÃ±ata"" after weeks of online backlash.
The description felt suitably colourful - but the acknowledgement was serious. A decade on from headlining the Superbowl, Perry's part in a much-derided Blue Origin spaceflight has seen her star crash down to Earth.
Mockery over the apparent worthiness of her reaction, including kissing the ground after landing and saying she felt ""so connected to love"", spread online. Fast food chain Wendy's even posted to ask: ""Can we send her back?""
Trolls have now taken aim at her world tour, which began in Mexico on 23 April, criticising her dance moves and performances.
It seems the star who first broke through singing about a boyfriend's mood swings now faces an icy reception. Perry's blamed an ""unhinged and unhealed"" internet - but is toxic social media the only reason?



The music writer Michael Cragg, author of Reach for the Stars, believes Perry's problem is that she's stuck between pop cultures and feels increasingly out of touch.
""Her pop star persona was cemented in the 2010s as cartoon-y, fun and playful, all whipped cream bras and goofy videos where she wore oversized braces on her teeth,"" he says.
For a period this worked. Her second album Teenage Dream, which doubled down on Perry's staple cheeky, sexualised girl-next-door image, scored five Billboard number one singles to match a record set by Michael Jackson. Its follow-up, 2013's Prism, bore transatlantic smash single Roar (her fourth solo UK number one), as well as Dark Horse in the US (her ninth domestically). Perry hasn't topped charts under her own steam since.
""That was a long time ago in pop terms and it feels like she hasn't evolved,"" adds Cragg.

In the past year, her comeback single Woman's World, touted as a female empowerment anthem, struck critics as lyrically shallow.
Some fans also seemed unimpressed that it was produced by Dr. Luke, who previously faced sexual assault allegations from the singer Kesha. The producer denied the claims and the pair reached an agreement to settle a defamation lawsuit in 2023, but Perry remained tainted by association.
The track failed to land in the top 50 in the US and only just managed in the UK, at 47. ""Her sort of spiritual 'let love lead the way' messages she posts don't really hold sway with very online pop fans in the face of that decision,"" says Cragg.
""The regressive girl boss feel of Woman's World, and then the album not being great hasn't helped,"" he adds, pointing to rapper Doja Cat's success working with Dr. Luke without the same negative response.
It followed a pattern of failed reinvention attempts stretching back to 2017's Witness, where Perry attempted to launch her socially conscious ""purposeful pop"" era.
But its Sia-written lead single Chained to the Rhythm, which boldly attacked mindless pop culture, appeared to be undermined by Bon Appetit, a song openly objectifying Perry as a sexual meal.
Female pop stardom has shifted. Last year's biggest breakout music stars â Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX â were women joined by a thread of fierce self-assurance, underpinned by relatability and authenticity.
In contrast, Perry wanted distance from her pop persona - as the headline for Cragg's 2017 Guardian interview with her put it: ""I created this character called Katy Perry. I didn't want to be Katheryn Hudson. It was too scary.""
Perry's first hit I Kissed A Girl caused controversy for the fetishisation of lesbians even back in 2008 when it was released. But today Roan's had global success telling her genuine queer awakening.
""The flip flopping has jarred in an era where... very defined pop star personas are the ones cutting through,"" argues Cragg.
Perry's 2021-2023 playground-styled Las Vegas residency embraced her surreal, fantastical image to commercial and critical success.
But it's not translating to a new generation of fans. ""I think ultimately people see her as a bit cringeworthy now,"" Cragg adds. ""Being shot into space on a billionaire's jolly while everyone watches that on social media platforms interspersed with war and the climate crisis... just feels tonally not ideal,"" he says.
Perry may have misjudged the public mood, but at the same time, the venom in the blowback points to deeper issues in pop culture beyond her control.
There is no doubt that the social media landscape has become more frenzied in recent years, with stars like Roan speaking against toxic fandoms.
Simon Diego, the creator of Brazil's Portal Katy Perry fan community, described the scale of the abuse towards the 40-year-old as ""unbelievable"".
The group showed their support by clubbing together with other fan pages to pay for a digital billboard message in New York's Times Square for 24 hours.
""We're so proud of you and your magical journey and we love you to the moon and back,"" it read.
""Know that you are safe, seen and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.""
It was this that Perry replied to directly with her PiÃ±ata remark acknowledging the backlash.
""I think Katy and many other celebrities are feeling unsafe in the one space that used to connect them to fans,"" Diego tells BBC News.
He believes that's why Perry has never posted photos of her daughter's face online.
But even that boundary was ignored in the wake of the spaceflight criticism, as commenters began targeting her four-year-old child simply because ""it's cool now"", he says. ""They don't understand how bad it could affect her.""
Others, like Marie Claire Australia editor Georgie McCourt, think pervasive misogyny plays a part.
""There's a particular ire reserved for women like Perry: ambitious, unapologetic, hyper-visible,"" she wrote in a column, noting that male celebrities have already gone into space without such surveillant reaction.
So where next for Perry? Cragg says a hit single would help.
""I'm not saying it will return her to the commercial highs of old, because that ship has sailed for a lot of pre-streaming artists, but it will steady the ship.""",Alex Taylor,2 days ago,0

""Having the friendships and the support from everybody around you makes you feel welcome. It makes you feel loved. It makes you feel complete,"" she said.
""Being in the choir has definitely helped to heal me. I often think that it saved me when I didn't even know that I needed saving.""
The competition's artistic director, Mat Wright, said the event was a showcase for choirs from all over the world.
""We are thrilled to be welcoming 10 different countries, 24 choirs to this wonderful historic city,"" he said.
""It's a special opportunity for choirs from all different levels of experience, and crucially, different backgrounds and cultures, to compete against one another, but also to share in the joy of singing and connect in a really, really beautiful way.""
Ms Wood said she was very excited to take part: ""There's about 200 people in the choir, and it's just such an amazing feeling standing on that stage and being able to perform.""

The procedure, known as an laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, takes one to two hours and requires several more hours of recovery in hospital.
According to the NHS, you must stay off work for two to four weeks after having the procedure, which could mean Kelly could take a short break from presenting her show, Lorraine.

Black dandyism, the subject of the Costume Institute's much-anticipated spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, is a rich theme. A dandy is a flamboyantly dressed male figure who is concerned not only with looking good but with making a statement about his identity and individuality. And black dandyism is a defiant declaration against confinement, a celebration of black identity, and a movement based around resistance, pride and history.
The story of black dandyism does not begin with clothing but with the absence of it. Enslaved Africans, writes Monica L Miller in Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity (2009), ""arrived in America physically and metaphorically naked, a seeming tabula rasa on which European and new American fashions might be imposed"". Dandyism was a critical response to this, and was born out of a desire to self-define and envisage new social and political possibilities â in a context where the very concept of ""blackness"" was created by non-black oppressors.
Inspired by Miller's seminal book, the exhibition examines how men's style, and in particular, dandyism, has helped shape transatlantic black identities for more than 300 years. The star-studded Met Gala in New York, which takes place on Monday, takes the corresponding theme ""Tailored for you"" as its dress code. Co-chairing and hosting the event are actor Colman Domingo, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky and musician and creative director Pharrell Williams. They will work with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and honorary co-chair, basketball player LeBron James.
The show features garments, artworks, photographs and film, and explores 12 different characteristics of dandyism, ranging from Ownership, Heritage and Presence to Respectability, Beauty and Cool. The ""superfine"" in the title, says Miller, who is guest curator of the exhibition, pertains to ""a finely woven wool, which we're using as an expression of luxury, but also feeling 'superfine'"" â a reminder that how you dress can contain ""a lot of emotion"".
Indeed, one of slavery's first acts of debasement was to strip the enslaved of their own clothes, and dress them in standard-issue clothing. ""Everyone was supposed to look exactly the same,"" Miller tells the BBC. ""It was a vehicle of dehumanisation, but people immediately affixed buttons, ribbons, modified the garment a little, literally tailored it so that it could be individualised."" Dandyism was already laying its foundations.
In the 17th and 18th Centuries, for enslaved Africans brought back to Europe as domestic servants, control was once again asserted by their masters â in some households they were dressed up in ostentatious, deliberately anachronistic livery, their masters objectifying them in order to signal the family's wealth. Some were educated alongside members of the host family, whose guests were amused to see someone of colour speak and act like a gentleman.
However, in the case of Julius Soubise â manumitted (released from slavery) in the 1760s by his British mistress, the Duchess of Queensbury â the joke was on the aristocrats. Soubise reclaimed and exaggerated the flamboyant clothing that his mistress had made him wear by adding diamond-buckled red-heeled shoes, lace frills and clouds of perfume, and his subversive, startlingly feminised dandyism created shockwaves among white society. Educated, witty and charming, and a capable equestrian, fencer and violinist, he destabilised established categorisations of race, gender and class, and forced a reimagining in the white consciousness of what a black man could be.
While Soubise used dandyism to assert visibility, elsewhere in the exhibition, dandyism is shown being used for concealment. It was a form of dressing up that enabled William and Ellen Craft to escape slavery in Georgia in 1848, as told in William's 1860 memoir. Transgressing â once again â boundaries of race, gender and class, Ellen, the daughter of an enslaved woman and her slaveholder, disguised herself as a white invalid gentleman â complete with jaw bandage and sling, and green-lensed spectacles â in order to escape her captors, while her husband William was passed off as her servant. When William, with freedom in sight, dandified himself with ""a very good second-hand white beaver [top hat]"" the pair's cover was almost blown, drawing comments from a disgruntled planter that his ""master"" was spoiling him. Their escape succeeded, and the two went on to build a new life across the ocean in England.
Later, with the abolition of slavery in 1865, the Crafts were emboldened to move back to the US, while other black Americans began relocating from the rural South to the expanding cities of the North, establishing, for the first time, large black urban communities. One of these was Harlem, New York City, which, during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 30s, became a centre of creative expression and a manifestation of the black freedom that so many had dreamt of.
In forging a modern black identity and standing up against lynchings, riots and persistent discrimination, dressing up again played a central role. In 1917, around 10,000 African Americans took part in the Silent Protest Parade down New York's Fifth Avenue, the men in black tailored suits, the women and children dressed in white. It was a display of respectability, calm and control that contrasted with the savagery of the violence perpetrated against them.
The suit, explains Miller, is ""a historical throughline"" in the exhibition, which includes everything ""from livery garmentsâ¦ to tailcoats and different versions of itâ¦ to even track suiting"". One of the most dandified examples is the zoot suit, which debuted in Harlem's dance halls in the 1930s before spreading across the country. Donned by performers such as Dizzy Gillespie and Cab Calloway, as well as the activist Malcolm X, it featured oversized shoulder pads, wide lapels and ballooning trousers cuffed at the ankle, and was often accessorised with a pocket watch on a long chain and a brimmed hat. Its sheer voluminosity seemed symbolic of a burgeoning black community's desire to take up their own space and to move with freedom.

When rationing was introduced in the 1940s, this expression of counter culture became a source of supposed indignation due to the amount of fabric the zoot required. This became a pretext for further violence against people of colour, particularly in Los Angeles, where white mobs stripped people of their suits and slashed the fabric with knives. But the zoot suit was too strong a signifier of black sartorial elegance to be entirely subdued, and has continued to reassert its importance, reappearing as the trademark style of the musical group Kid Creole and the Coconuts in the 1980s, for example, and later inspiring rapper MC Hammer's iconic baggy-crotched ""Hammer pants"".
Described by Anna Wintour (editor-in-chief of US Vogue) in a recent article as ""a dandy among dandies"", AndrÃ© Leon Talley (1948-2022), the first black creative director at US Vogue, was born at the tail end of the zoot suit's reign, and went on to become one of fashion's black luminaries. His favourite photo of himself, taken in the 1980s, appears in the exhibition, along with the panel-checked Morty Sills suit he is wearing. Later, he would become known for his luxurious swooshing capes. ""He understood that, especially as a black man, what you wore told a story about you, about your history, about self-respect,"" writes Wintour. ""For AndrÃ©, getting dressed was an act of autobiography, and also mischief and fantasy, and so much else at once.""
For Nigerian-American artist, photographer and writer IkÃ© UdÃ©, whose self-portrait appears on the cover of Miller's 2009 book, the construction of self through fashion is a critical reaction to negative perceptions of it. ""Whereas the self can be devoured by public scrutiny, it can be saved by private self-objectification,"" he writes in his 1995 essay The Regarded Self. In Sartorial Anarchy #5 (2013), part of a series of self-portraits by UdÃ©, we see a pastiche of dandyism that both embraces this display and satirises it. ""He's wearing male dress in all of those portraits but from different time periods and geographies,"" explains Miller. ""It's a real manifestation of cosmopolitanism and wit.""
This theme of cosmopolitanism continues in the clothing of award-winning designer Foday Dumbuya, whose brand Labrum reflects his own journey from Sierra Leone to Cyprus and England, and features the tagline ""designed by an immigrant"". Much of his work celebrates his African heritage, and uses sharp, sartorial design to challenge negative associations with Africa and with migration. ""He's designing garments that often use immigration documents from his own family or from other people that he incorporates into the printed silk fabric,"" says Miller. The idea for the exhibition began, she adds, with an observation by the curator of the Met's costume collection, Andrew Bolton, ""that there was a kind of renaissance going on in menswear and black designers were really at the forefront of that"".
Black dandyism, maintains Miller, is part of a culture in constant movement. ""Black people are always trying to outrun stereotype and appropriation, and if we take it all the way back to the 19th Century, they're trying to outrun capture, so there's a way that that's built into the culture."" Consequently, dandyism shows no signs of dwindling. ""It's very much related to a jazz riff,"" Miller adds. ""Somebody puts that down, somebody picks that up, modifies it, changes it, it becomes something newâ¦""
Superfine: Tailoring Black Style is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City from 10 May to 26 October 2025. The accompanying book by Monica L Miller is published by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and distributed by Yale University Press.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33zkv0pp32o,Race Across the World brothers applied to defy age,"Two brothers who competed in the TV series Race Across the World said they took on the challenge to show they could complete it at any age.
Melvyn and Brian Mole, who are both in their 60s, were one of five teams who raced more than 14,000km (8,700 miles) across China, Nepal and India to win Â£20,000.
Melvyn, who lives in Middlesbrough, said: ""I saw the first series and I thought, 'could I do that?' And of course I could.""
After making the decision to apply he then needed to find a partner, but unfortunately Brian was not his first choice.
""The wife didn't want to go on it, so I called Brian and asked him if he fancied it,"" said Melvyn.
Brian said it took him a little while to make up his mind, but he was glad he did.
""I think Melvyn ran out of friends who would want to go on it with him. So in the end he contacted me and I said yes.
""The adventure then started there - and it truly was a fantastic adventure.""
Speaking to BBC Radio Tees, the pair said one of the difficulties they faced was explaining to people they could not use a mobile phone.
But Melvyn said skills they learned as children prepared them well for the journey.
""When we were kids we could read a compass, we could read a map and we would jump on trains and end up in the middle of the Peak District and get lost,"" he said.
""And we're still here.""
But they said one of the hardest parts of the journey was the ""torture"" the camera crew put them through.
""One of the most awkward feeling is you have to be with [the crew] when they're eating,"" Melvyn said.
""They'll order from the restaurant to the table. They'll get burgers, chips, they'll go to McDonald's - and you're sitting with what you can afford.
""It is torture, especially if they're having a beer.""

Traditional food and drink is served at the event in Les Jardins de la Mer and musicians come to the island to play traditional music as well.
About 1,000 people arrive at the site each day to celebrate Portuguese culture.
Mr Nunes has seen the event grow in popularity since it started.
He said ""last year we had to stop people coming in"" because it was so busy and ""it's first come, first served so people should get here early"".
Mr Nunes added: ""The island has got quite a few Portuguese restaurants with great food and drink and we bring them here for everyone to enjoy.""
About one in 11 Jersey residents say they have Portuguese or Madeiran heritage.
Anita De Andrade helps run one of the food and drink stalls at the festival.
She said ""it's great fun"" and ""it's great to see everyone having a good time and bringing all cultures together"".
Telmo Rodrigues is a Portuguese singer and travelled to the island to perform at the festival.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5wx91vn8qo,Do young people in west Belfast 'stand with Kneecap'?,"Irish rap group Kneecap have been in the spotlight for controversial reasons this week and BBC News NI asked young fans in their west Belfast home if their views of the group have changed.
The controversy began when a video of a November 2023 gig emerged in which a member of the west Belfast trio says: ""The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.""
On Thursday, the Metropolitan Police said they will investigate online videos showing Kneecap calling for the death of British MPs and shouting ""up Hamas, up Hezbollah"".
Kneecap said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and would not incite violence against any individual.
Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.
The husband of murdered MP Jo Cox later called on Kneecap to give a ""real apology"".
Katie Amess, whose father Sir David Amess was an MP when he was murdered in 2021, said she was ""gobsmacked at the stupidity of somebody or a group of people being in the public eye and saying such dangerous, violent rhetoric"".
Kneecap say the videos have been taken out of context.
A number of politicians have called for the Irish rap band to be uninvited from UK gigs.
Some of the band's performances have been cancelled but a number of artists have signed a joint statement in support of Kneecap and freedom of expression through the band's label Heavenly Recordings.
But what do young people on the Falls Road in west Belfast think?
PE and Primary Education student Naoise McCrory, 19, has been a fan of Kneecap for a few years and said her opinion on the group hasn't changed.
""Although there's a lot of controversy right now I'm still a fan of Kneecap and I think what they're doing is they're just spreading awareness on major issues that are going on right now in other parts of the world,"" she said.
""I can understand completely why some people have been offended but at the same time I just think personally what they're doing is that they're just trying to spread awareness and some things have been taken too literally and people can be offended on both sides.""
Naoise has tickets to go and see Kneecap in their Belfast concert at Boucher Playing Fields and says she will ""100% still go to their gig"".
Cinematography and photography student Cian Davison, 24, said he doesn't agree with what Kneecap have been saying recently but he enjoys their music.
""I think they're putting Irish language back on the map,"" he said.
""They're very talented individuals, not afraid to wear their identity on their chest and I really enjoy their music. I think they're a great artform and platform for young people to listen to and to relate to.
""Obviously to threaten anybody, to make a violent threat is disappointing, like it's not on and shouldn't happen anywhere no matter who you are or where you're from.""
Cian added: ""Depending on what they say in the future, obviously they should be allowed to have freedom of speech within their artcraft.
""They have a lot of susceptible, young fans that would do anything that they say so I think it's important that they watch what they say.""
English literature student Chloe Bell, 20, is planning to watch Kneecap live when they support Fontaines DC at Belfast Vital in August.
She says she still supports Kneecap.
""I still listen to their music and I know people are just trying to badmouth them but sure nowadays people are always trying to badmouth people on the internet so everyone always has a problem with something,"" she said.
Chloe said she expects the concert this summer with Fontaines DC will go ahead.
Aidan Toner, 21, is from west Belfast.
He said has seen some videos but they haven't changed his opinion on the trio at all.
""They're standing up for their country, as every person should... they can do what they want,"" he said.
""I like their music - I don't think the gigs should be cancelled.""
Music and Primary Education student Eoin Ferry, 19, said his opinion on Kneecap hasn't changed.
""I actually do love Kneecap,"" he said.
""I've followed them for years and I do love their music and I enjoy listening to them.
""I think that since I have been a fan for such a long time, it's not really changing my opinion on them. I still stand with them.""
He added: ""Personally as a musician myself, it's up to yourself if you want to [state political opinions].
""You shouldn't be made to do anything you don't want to do but if you want to I think that should be fine.
""Everyone's always going to have different opinions so I think Kneecap should just keep doing what they're doing and it's up to everyone else what they think of it.""
Kneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise.
The group was formed in 2017 by three friends who go by the stage names of Mo Chara, MÃ³glaÃ­ Bap and DJ PrÃ³vaÃ­.
Their rise to fame inspired a semi-fictionalised film starring Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender.
The film won a British Academy of Film Award (Bafta) in February 2025.",Faye Kidd,3 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39jmwrwxr4o,The stars who rocked Portman Road over the years,"Ipswich Town Football Club's Portman Road will welcome global superstar Ed Sheeran in July - but he is not the first to have rocked the stadium.
Similar big names including Sir Elton John and Rod Stewart have performed to thousands of fans in years gone by.
Even the legendary Tina Turner blessed the town with her presence during a show in the 1990s.
As Ipswich gets ready to welcome Sheeran in July for three shows, here is a look back at the stars who have played at Portman Road over the years.
The late Tina Turner came to Portman Road in 1990 as part of her Foreign Affair tour that included 121 shows.
Notably her Portman Road show was the first ever concert to be held at the stadium.
Songs performed to the thousands included What's Love Got to Do With It, Proud Mary, Show Some Respect and many more.
Turner died in 2023 at the age of 83.
Stewart has performed not once, not twice, but three times at Portman Road.
He first took to the stage in 1991 with fans queuing for hours to ensure they got a good spot once inside the stadium.
Stewart literally kicked off this show by booting a football into the crowd of 25,000 fans.
Fast forward 16 years, he was back again in 2007 as torrential downpours failed to stop the crowds turning up in their thousands.
Supporting group The Pretenders kept the crowd warm despite the rain, before Stewart came out and belted out hits like Maggie May and You Wear It Well.
Stewart was back in town in 2019 performing to a 19,000 strong crowd as the heavens once again opened.
Bryan Adams, the Groover from Vancouver, filled Portman Road back in 1992 for his Waking Up the World tour.
He was supported by Squeeze, Little Angels and Extreme, and the tour merchandise T-Shirts included Ipswich's name nestled in with big cities like Athens, Berlin, Manchester and more.
The encore was electric as Adams performed the beloved song Summer of '69 as well as Diana and One Night Love Affair.
The Canadian star later returned to Ipswich to perform at the Regent Theatre in 2010.
1970s rock group Dire Straits performed at Portman Road back in 1992, nine months after the release of their sixth studio album, On Every Street.
The album went to number one in the album charts after its release.
The Portman Road tickets cost Â£21 and the band was supported by Was (Not Was) and Lyle Lovett.
Sir Elton performed at Portman Road in 2004 and more recently in 2017.
In 2004, 23,000 fans attended to see the gig, which was the first one at the stadium in 12 years.
James Blunt warmed up the crowd before Sir Elton took to the stage.
BBC Suffolk reporter at the time, Oli Moorman, spoke of the ""amazing atmosphere"" as Sir Elton performed.
""The look of complete elation on so many faces (in some cases fuelled by a tipple or two) was a clear sign that Sir Elton had given the people of Ipswich a night to remember,"" he said.
In 2017 Sir Elton was then supported by Jake Isaac at a sold out show and wowed the crowds with Rocket Man, Your Song, and many other hits.
American quartet R.E.M. performed at Portman Road for their Around the Sun tour in 2005.
The show was the day after the country was left shocked by four suicide bombers targeting London's transport network killing 52 people and injuring hundreds more.
Singer Michael Stipe started the show with a statement detailing the band's intention for the performance, which he said was ""about catharsis, about epiphany, about feeling, about remembering, about community and about celebration - about celebrating life"".
Songs included on the set list were Everybody Hurts, Losing My Religion and Man on the Moon.
In 2005 Neil Diamond, the legendary singer behind Sweet Caroline, performed at Portman Road.
The two hour performance included many of his top hits, but fans at the time said they were disappointed with the lack of Song Sung Blue that would have been very apt with Town's blue kit.
Regardless many were still overjoyed with the then 64-year-old's performance.
In 2006 American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers traveled to Ipswich as part of their UK tour that year.
The sold out show to 28,000 fans was kicked off by singer Anthony Kiedis questioning to the crowd: ""Ipswich? Where's Ipswich?""
The gig included hit songs like Californication that was described as ""immense"", and others like Can't Stop, Dani California and Right on Time with a London Calling style intro.
BBC reporter Jim Connolly said at the time the crowd ""lapped up"" the performance.
In late 2009 P!nk announced her Funhouse Summer Carnival Tour for the UK which included a Portman Road date.
It was just one of six shows for the American singer.
In the summer of the following year, P!nk delighted fans with songs including Get the Party Started, Funhouse and So What.
She also included acrobatic stunts that she has become famous for during her live shows.
Barry Manilow, the American singer behind Copacabana, Mandy and Could It Be Magic announced he was playing Portman Road in 2014 as part of an eight-date tour.
It was also the first show at the stadium since P!nk in 2010.
Manilow performed many of his hits delighting thousands of fans.
While Sheeran has just announced his upcoming shows, it is technically not the first time he has performed at Portman Road.
Sheeran previously performed there in 2021 as part of TikTok's UEFA Euro 2020 show.
While the event was live streamed, there was no live audience however.
Sheeran has performed other shows however across Ipswich including in Chantry Park in 2019.
Tickets for Sheeran's upcoming July shows go on sale in the coming days.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05nrdz2vqeo,Nepo babies or superstars in waiting?,"While most 13-year-olds were spending their Monday evening stressing over homework, awkward school crushes and what to post on TikTok, Blue Ivy Carter was performing in front of a crowd of 70,000 people alongside her mother BeyoncÃ© on the opening night of her Cowboy Carter tour.
Her numerous cameos throughout the show â particularly her solo dance during DÃ©jÃ  Vu â were highly praised.
""She must be one of the most self-disciplined 13-year-olds in America,"" Variety's Chris Willman wrote. On social media, fans said the child prodigy was the ""greatest nepo baby of all time"" as they marvelled at her flawless dance routines.
Being a nepo baby - shorthand for the children of celebrities who often find themselves fast-tracked into industries such as film, fashion, and music - may have been scorned at in the past, but Blue Ivy's performance may have complicated the narrative.
The teen had access to a stage that most could only dream of, but she also delivered a performance that fans and critics agreed was very impressive, which raises the question: Is this just another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight, or could Blue Ivy be a genuine star in her own right?
This is also not the first time Blue Ivy has performed in public â she joined her mother on stage two years ago on the Renaissance tour and last year voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King.
But music journalist Caroline Sullivan says Blue Ivy's trajectory to stardom ""has very little to do with her and everything to do with the parent"".
""It's about how much we like or dislike the parent â BeyoncÃ© is well liked so fans will praise Blue Ivy,"" she explains. ""Of course, it helps that she's good at what she does but even if she wasn't, she'd be given an easier ride.""
Sullivan also says that the authenticity of Blue Ivy wanting to perform instead of being forced to do it by her mother adds to how we perceive her.
Speaking to the BBC last month, BeyoncÃ©'s mother, Tina Knowles, said Blue Ivy and her siblings were being nurtured to do ""anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed into show business"".
She added that her granddaughter had had to ""work for"" her role in The Lion King prequel and she ""worries about the fame"" impacting her grandchildren.
Blue Ivy is hardly the first child to have performed on stage with a famous parent. Madonna's 17-year-old daughter played the piano on her mother's Celebration tour in 2023, Dave Grohl's 19-year-old daughter has often sung with him on stage and Phil Collins' son was the drummer on his 2019 tour.
""It's not because he's the boss's son that he's playing the drums, it's because he's good enough,"" the former Genesis drummer said in 2019 as he defended his decision to take his 17-year-old son on his world tour.
Sullivan says it can often be ""naff and cringy"" if a musician brings their child on stage ""just for the sake of it"", but if done right, it can be ""incredibly sweet and show a lot of love"".
Many critics, including Tomas Mier from Rolling Stone, said BeyoncÃ©'s youngest daughter Rumi joining her on stage for Protector was ""one of the most heartwarming moments of the evening"".
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's 11-year-old daughter, North West, has also forged the beginnings of a music career, recently delivering a rap verse in Japanese on FKA Twigs' single Childlike Things.
Twigs said she chose to collaborate with North West because her ""energy is so inspiring"" and she was ""so confident"".
""I wasn't that confident when I was a kid. I was so shy, I was scared of the dark, I was very different to the other kids at my school. It suddenly occurred to me that I would have loved to have a friend like North, who could speak up for themselves.""
North West also appeared as Young Simba in the Hollywood Bowl's The Lion King 30th anniversary concert last year but her singing was criticised on social media.
""Given how controversial her parents are, I think North West will struggle to break away from the nepo baby claims because unless she is unbelievably talented, she will be slated,"" Sullivan says.
In December 2022, New York magazine's cover story on nepo babies caused a stir in the showbusiness industry.
The cover featured the faces of famous actors including Dakota Johnson, Jack Quaid, ZoÃ« Kravitz and Lily Rose-Depp edited onto the bodies of babies, with the headline: ""She has her mother's eyes. And agent.""
The story claimed that ""a nepo baby is physical proof that meritocracy is a lie"" and that ""today, they're not only abundant - they're thriving"".
It was met with backlash by many stars who claimed the label was unfair and diminished their hard work.
Gwyneth Paltrow, a nepo baby herself as the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and film director Bruce Paltrow, said the term was an ""ugly moniker"" and that children of famous people should not be judged negatively because ""there's nothing wrong with doing or wanting to do what your parents do"".
Similarly, Zoe Kravitz told GQ that it was ""completely normal for people to be in the family business"", while Stranger Things actress Maya Hawke said a famous family name ""definitely gives you massive advantages in this life but the chances will not be infinite; so you have to keep working and do a good job. If you do a bad job, the chances will stop"".
Almost Famous star Kate Hudson, daughter of actors Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, said in a 2022 interview with the Independent that ""people call it whatever they want"", but the idea that children will follow in the footsteps of their parents is ""not going to change"".
Hudson was right that, in the three years since New York magazine's cover story caused so much controversy, nepo babies haven't slunk off into the background. In fact, they continue to thrive, particularly those with real talent.
Pam Lyddon, a PR executive in the entertainment industry says that there's ""no denying that being well-connected can absolutely help you succeed in the industry"" but ""while connections might get you noticed, you do still need genuine talent, hard work, and resilience to stay in the game - results speak for themselves and reputations are everything.""
She explains that for the new wave of nepo babies, talent is even more important as the ""scrutiny is more intense and people are more media savvy"" so you can't get away with mediocrity.
As fans and critics continue to praise Blue Ivy, it seems that the credibility of nepo babies hasn't been damaged by the nepo baby backlash, and if you have the star factor, your parents being Beyonce and Jay-Z is only going to help you fly.",Yasmin Rufo,3 days ago,0

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd3zz968dno,Pottery collection back on display after 17 years,"Thousands of pieces of pottery spanning 200 years of history have gone back on public display.
The Spode Museum reopened on the company's original site after many pieces were hidden from public view when the company fell into administration in 2008.
The collection includes more than 20,000 ceramic pieces and 40,000 engraved copper plates, as well as archive photographs
The museum held its grand opening on Friday after 18 months of regeneration projects to create a new visitor attraction.
Volunteer Jan Roberts told the BBC: ""These pieces are Stoke's legacy. The skills can't be replicated. The guilders, the painters, the back-printers. It's our responsibility to say look what we've got - its amazing.""
Michael Escolme, museum manager said: ""The Spode Museum trust have worked hard over the past decade to secure the long-term future of the museum collection for the people of Stoke-on-Trent and the many thousands of people around the world who know the Spode name to be a marque of the very finest quality.
""We're overjoyed to finally welcome visitors to our new, refurbished space and to keep our museum free for everyone to enjoy.""
The museum also provides two modern meeting rooms and two community rooms for local groups and artists to use.
People can also get married in front of the newly renovated Blue Room.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyqzllqj7zo,Slain Russian journalist's sister on the film preserving her memory,"The thriller about slain Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Words of War, opens in US cinemas today. The filmmakers took into account some of the inaccuracy concerns about the script raised by her family, Politkovskaya's sister Elena Kudimova told the BBC.
The film is coming out just in time for the World Press Freedom Day. Words of War was produced by Sean Penn. Anna Politkovskaya is played by Maxine Peake, and one of the leading male roles is performed by Jason Isaacs.
Words of War tells the story of legendary Russian journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya.
In Russia, her name is synonymous with courage and an indomitable spirit. She rose to prominence for her investigations into human rights abuses in Chechnya - a region in southern Russia that fought two wars for independence in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Her older sister, Elena Kudimova, describes her as ""someone who, despite all the threats and the danger to her life, kept doing her work until the very end.""
Politkovskaya openly criticised the Russian authorities and President Putin himself. Despite receiving numerous threats over the years, she refused to back down.
Her sister recalls that while Politkovskaya considered emigration, she always changed her mind at the last moment. She would say: ""I can't leave because nobody else will help the people here.""
From 1999, Politkovskaya traveled to Chechnya almost every month for several years. Kudimova recalls that for many wronged and desperate people, Politkovskaya became ""the last resort"" - the one who could make things right.
She took part in the negotiations for Nord-Ost, the 2002 hostage crisis at a Moscow theatre, after the Chechen rebels specifically requested her.
In 2004, she hoped to help resolve the crisis in Beslan, where heavily armed militants held hostages in a school for three days.
However, she never made it there - she was poisoned on the plane while en route to Beslan.
In 2006, Politkovskaya was shot dead in the elevator of her apartment building in Moscow. Six men were convicted over the murder, but the person who ordered it has never been identified.
Her sister Elena doubts that the mastermind will ever be brought to justice. ""If they had wanted to find him, they probably would have done so by now,"" Kudimova adds.
Before the film's release, Politkovskaya's family raised concerns about the Words of War script, believing the film took too many liberties with the truth.
While the filmmakers insist that the drama is based on real events, they emphasise that it is not a biography.
However, Politkovskaya's sister notes that the filmmakers did take the family's feedback into account, and certain scenes that raised the most questions were removed from the final cut.
""[Anna's son] Ilya was portrayed in the original script as a sort of womanizer, [and in the film] Anna doesn't have a romance with [Dmitry] Muratov,"" she said.
Dmitry Muratov, a Nobel Prize-winning journalist, was Anna Politkovskaya's former colleague at the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta.
According to Kudimova, Maxine Peake portrays her sister accurately, though she believes Anna's personality was ""much greater and more complex"" than what is depicted on screen.
""Her real life had far more dramatic episodes than those shown in the film,"" she says.
Kudimova criticised the film's setting for leaning too heavily into cold-weather clichÃ©s.
""I was struck by the fact that it's constantly snowing, as if Russia has only one season. In reality, we have all four."" However, Kudimova is grateful that the film helps preserve the memory of her sister.
Kudimova said that Anna never thought about her own legacy. She recalled how, at some point, someone had suggested Anna write an autobiography - she was in her 40s at the time.
Anna had laughed at the idea, saying it felt more like something you do when you're a hundred. But then she came up with the idea of writing six short stories.
At the end of each, she said, she was supposed to die - but didn't, for different reasons. And they were going to be funny stories.
When asked about how Anna would want to be remembered, Elena says that her sister did not think about her legacy: ""She simply wanted to live.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1jwe7582o,Trump signs order to block funding to public radio,"US President Donald Trump has issued an executive order calling for all federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) to be blocked.
On Thursday evening, Trump alleged that both organisations have engaged with ""biased and partisan news coverage"".
The order instructs the board of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting (CPB), which distributes funding to PBS and NPR stations, to ""cease direct funding"" to the ""maximum extent allowed by law"".
PBS called the order ""blatantly unlawful"", while CPB said the organisation is not ""a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority"".
Meanwhile, Radio Free Asia, which receives funding from the government, said on Friday it was shutting down most of its news broadcasts and letting most staff go.
CEO Bay Fang said the cuts were due to the Trump administration withholding congressionally allocated funding, even though a federal judge sided with the broadcaster last week.
The executive order says the board should ""decline to provide future funding"" to the news organisations.
""Which viewpoints NPR and PBS promote does not matter,"" it continues.
""What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.""
Paula Kerger, CEO of PBS, called the president's order ""blatantly unlawful"" and said it ""threatens our ability to serve the American public with educational programming, as we have for the past 50-plus years"".
The White House has said that funding of news media is ""not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence"" and that the media landscape has become more ""diverse"".
However, the CPB budget has already been approved by Congress through 2027.
Patricia Harrison, CEO of the CPB, said the organisation is not ""a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority"".
""Congress directly authorised and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government,"" she said.
""In creating CPB, Congress expressly forbade 'any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting'.""
More than 40 million Americans listen to NPR public radio each week, and 36 million watch a local television station from the PBS network each month, according to their estimates.
NPR director Katherine Maher estimated in March that the radio station would receive about $120m (Â£90m) from the CPB in 2025, ""less than 5% of its budget.""
Both organisations have previously said that Trump's effort to cut funding could have a ""devastating impact"" on those who rely on them for credible news, including during emergency situations.
Media rights group RSF warned on Friday about ""an alarming deterioration in press freedom"" in the United States under Trump and ""unprecedented"" difficulties for independent journalists around the world.
Following the news of Trump's executive order, REM singer Michael Stipe was among the figures offering support to the journalists affected.
""Whether it's music or a free press â censorship anywhere is a threat to the truth everywhere,"" he said in a statement. ""On World Press Freedom Day, I'm sending a shout-out to the brave journalists at Radio Free Europe.""",Yasmin Rufo,4 days ago,0

A Mischief of Rats will be on display from 3 May in Hull and features 6ft tall (1.8m) painted rat sculptures  for people to enjoy on a walking trail in the city.
The art trail was created to pay tribute to rock musician Mick Ronson, who was from Hull and a member of the local 1960s band the Rats, before becoming David Bowie's guitarist.
Co-director Clare Huby previously said the trail would be launched ahead of what would have been the musician's 80th birthday on 26 May 2026.
She said: ""I know people in Hull have been keen to have something that will honour Mick Ronson, so this just seemed like the perfect opportunity.""
Ms Huby added the project would also help the Daisy Appeal charity, which supports Cottingham's Castle Hill hospital, with the sculptures being auctioned in September.
The charity hopes to raise up to Â£250,000 for ""cutting-edge research"" into cancer.
Mick Ronson died of cancer in 1993 aged 46.
The art trail, which is similar to previous projects, including Larkin with Toads, A Moth for Amy and Puffins Galore, will run until August and includes locations in Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire.

The free-to-visit Upper Gallery at Bath's Victoria Art Gallery is now open to the public after extensive conservation work was carried out to protect the Grade II-listed building.
The venue houses Bath & North East Somerset Council's (BANES) collection of public artworks, and pieces by artists such as Paul Klee and Grayson Perry.
Robert Campbell, BANES head of culture and heritage, said it was a ""milestone moment"" for a ""much-loved"" council-owned art space.
All of the Victoria Art Gallery is free to enter for residents in the BANES Council area who hold a Discovery Card, and relies on support from visitors and locals.
While conservation work took place, the gallery team developed The Modelling Room, a dedicated learning and engagement studio for schools and the community.
The council said it was ""very grateful"" for the commitment  of its supporters and the individual donor who helped to fund the development of the new space.
""We are honouring its important past while investing in its future,"" Mr Campbell said.
""The completion of vital conservation work in the Upper Gallery and the launch of our first dedicated learning and engagement space are milestone moments.
""We're thrilled to welcome the public back to this much-loved cultural space.""
The exhibition - First Impressions: Printers' Proofs of Works by Great 20th Century Artists - runs in the Upper Gallery until 6 July.

In a social media post Echo Echo Dance Theatre Company said it has had a funding application of more than Â£112,000 turned down by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland (ACNI).
Without that funding, Echo Echo said it faces an ""immediate existential threat"".
The ACNI said investment in dance in ""the Derry city and the north west region remains a priority"".
The Derry dance company said the funding would have covered three staff members' wages as well as some overheads.
""We are currently assessing the impact that this cut will have on the future of Echo Echo Dance Theatre Company and our home studios,"" the company said.
It added: ""This decision comes as a great shock to all involved in the company.
""This is an immediate existential threat to the company but we expect to continue all of our current programmes and keep Echo Echo Studios open and staffed for at least the next three months as we consider all of our options.""
A meeting with the ACNI will take place next week, the company added.
The ACNI described the dance theatre company as an Arts Council client and multi-grant recipient who had ""accessed funding from many of our programmes, including the Annual Funding Programme (AFP)"".
""Unfortunately, with disappointment this year Echo Echo did not receive 25-26 AFP funding,"" the ACNI said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdz08vwqd4o,Diddy rejects plea deal in sex trafficking trial,"Sean 'Diddy' Combs has formally rejected the US government's offer to plead guilty and spare himself the possibility of a prolonged prison sentence.
The musician appeared in court on Thursday, wearing glasses and a beige prison uniform, ahead of the start of his sex trafficking trial next week. He appeared to be in a good mood, and waved to the gallery as he arrived.
Asked by judge Arun Subramanian if he rejected prosecutors' plea deal, Combs replied: ""Yes, I do, your honour. Thank you.""
The 55-year-old is facing charges of sex trafficking and prostitution that allege he coerced women into prolonged sexual orgies he called ""freak-offs"". He has denied all the charges against him.

If he is found guilty, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.
At a recent hearing, his lawyer Marc Agnifilo offered a preview of the star's defence, saying that the rapper led the ""lifestyle"" of a ""swinger"".
Mr Agnifilo argued that while some people may find that behaviour inappropriate, it is not criminal.

Jury selection in the long-awaited trial begins on Monday - coincidentally the same day as the Met Gala, the glittering charity event where Combs was once a mainstay.
The process got under way earlier this week, as potential jurors were given questionnaires to discover what they already know about the case, part of an effort towards finding 12 people (and six alternates) who can be impartial, despite intense media coverage of the case so far.
Prosecutors and defence aim to screen up to 150 people before opening statements are given on 12 May.
The trial is expected to last at least eight weeks, with Combs' former partner Cassandra Ventura among those expected to give evidence.
Ventura, an R&B singer professionally known as Cassie, sued Combs in November 2023, accusing him of rape and serial physical abuse during their decade-long professional and romantic relationship, which he denied.
She settled the case just one day after suing - but CNN later broadcast surveillance footage showing Combs hitting, kicking and dragging Ventura in the lobby of a California hotel.
Combs' lawyers had tried to get the footage dismissed from the trial, arguing that it had been sped up and the events were shown out of sequence - although they did not deny their clients behaviour.
However, Judge Subramanian ruled last week that the footage could be admitted.

Since his arrest in September, Combs has been jailed in Brooklyn - far from the mansions in Miami and Los Angeles where he had been living, but about an hour from the Harlem neighbourhood where he was born.
In pre-trial hearings, he has looked older and thinner than his previous playboy persona. His hair and beard have gone grey, since hair dye is not allowed in the notoriously run down detention centre, where he is being held in a special protection unit.
For his trial, however, the hip-hop mogul has been given special permission to wear ""non-prison clothing"", with casual business attire replacing his tan prison jumpsuit.
According to a court order, Combs will be ""permitted to have up to five button down shirts, up to five pairs of pants, up to five sweaters, up to five pairs of socks, and up to two pairs of shoes without laces to wear to court"".
Defendants are often given permission to wear their own clothes during a trial, as prison outfits could subliminally influence a jury's decision.",Mark Savage,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddev9214gdo,"YouTube jazz pianist, 84, plays in market stall","An 84-year-old jazz pianist who made a name for himself on YouTube during the coronavirus lockdown has taken up residency at a tiny arts centre, based at a market stall, in order to meet other musicians.
Mike Kemp started an online channel to help with his mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Speaking about his new audience online, he said: ""If lockdown hadn't occurred, my career would have come to an end because of my health.""
Mr Kemp's stint at the centre, alongside Northampton-based artist Musetta Seagrove, continues until the end of Saturday.
The Creative Place (TCP) arts centre, run by Northampton Film Festival, opened six months ago in Northampton's refurbished Market Square.
During lockdown, Mr Kemp said he collaborated online with other musicians virtually.
He said he wanted to do the residency to meet other YouTubers, musicians and filmmakers, to learn how to improve the technicality and reach of his videos.
The ""intricacy"" of constructing videos and experimenting with different editing software like GarageBand provided a distraction and ""comfort"" to him during that time, he added.
""People always ask me, 'Have you been playing all your life?' And I say, 'Not yet',"" he said.
Mr Kemp, originally from Coventry, worked in electronics before playing piano with a jazz quartet.
He said he enjoyed his job in electronics but it ""felt like [I] was wearing somebody else's shoes"".
Mr Kemp said it felt like he had not worked ""a day in his life"" since 1960 when he began his music career.
Becky Carrier, who runs the arts centre, said it promoted ""connection, inspiration and creativity"".
""Everybody has a story to tell and everybody has a unique voice,"" she said.
""It is for people that have a creative bone in their body, but also for people that just want to try something new.
""It is really nice for people to use their ears and their eyes to experience quite different things.""

Aimie Atkinson, who can be seen in the cinema in the filmed version of the musical, recalled her introduction to theatre at the Gordon Craig Theatre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, was ""everything"".
As a 13-year-old she was unexpectedly drafted on to the stage while working as an understudy for a pantomime production of Cinderella.
""I was this like really shy, insecure 13-year-old, but really I loved it so much and that really made me go 'Oh, I want to do this',"" she said.
""The whole reason I'm here is because of my roots in Stevenage, although I like to call it St. Evanage, it's fancy,"" she joked.
She encouraged young fans who want a future on the West End to visit their local  amateur clubs.
""They're so accessible, they're not obviously hugely expensive. So that I think is definitely a place to start.
""Then for me from there it was just like every single day doing something towards what I wanted to do. Whether that was dancing around my living room or doing a free online singing lesson.
""I think it's just doing something small every day to what you want to do.""
The performer also reflected on the success of Six The Musical, a musical about the wives of Henry VIII where she played the role of Katherine Howard.
""To be with a show from its early start, where we were earning no money, to performing around the country - it's amazing to have seen it come to this.
""Doing the movie with the original cast was like a feeling of coming home, because those women have become like my family.""
While she found watching herself on the big screen version ""terrifying"", she loved watching her co-stars who she could never appreciate from an audience perspective.
She described the production as a ""massive part of me"" and said it influenced her latest album Queen, which is out in June.
The lead single, a cover of Alone by Heart which is released on Friday, is a duet with fellow original Six cast member Natalie Paris.
""She's such an incredible vocalist and we just wanted to do something that was really sort of epic, cinematic and queenly.
""The album is influenced by the journey of Six that I've been on and includes covers of songs from other shows I've been in.""
When asked if it is nicer to perform without being dressed as a queen she joked: ""Listen, I love wearing a crown, you never know.""

Aaron Mackenzie, from Daventry in Northamptonshire, appears as Kelly in Warfare - a movie based on a 2006 mission in the country.
The story follows a US military unit embedded with an Iraqi family.
Speaking about the film's accuracy to real experiences on the front line, Mr Mackenzie said: ""It's so true to life. Even down to breaking a doorway... we drilled that day in, day out. There wasn't one point [in the film] where I thought I would do this differently.""
Mr Mackenzie joined the military after the Iraq war in 2012 and trained as a signaller in the marines.
He described his time in the forces as ""extremely fun"" after travelling the world.
After leaving in 2018, he trained in acting and has since taken roles in theatre and film.
""I lent into that [military] experience,"" he said.
""There are a few in the cast who were ex-military and [the filming process] was a great experience.
""As a serviceman, you're trained to have a steely exterior, to have a stoic persona. But as an actor, you've got to be emotional.""
Warfare has been directed by Oscar nominee Alex Garland, whose back catalogue includes the 28 Days film franchise and Ex Machina, and Iraq veteran and film-maker Ray Mendoza.
The cast features actors Will Poulter, Kit Connor, D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai and Charles Melton. It is out in cinemas.
Mr Mackenzie said: ""The bootcamp [during filming] was reminiscent of [real] training, exercising together, learning together, doing weapon drills and range packages together, building camaraderie.""
He said the method of film-making ""created an atmosphere"" that ""felt really organic"".
Following filming, Mr Mackenzie said he was channelling his experiences into working with children in schools across the Midlands, and he is planning to open his own mental health drama-based workshops.
""What I like to do now is use creativity and art to help children break down emotional barriers. I use drama as a tool,"" he said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpylg06y4o,Film fans breathe life into 'forgotten' IMAX cinema,"The ""underdog story"" of a ""forgotten"" cinema, which is being revived by enthusiasts, will be told in a new film.
The Big Picture, by Bristol filmmaker Arthur Cauty, focuses on the city centre IMAX theatre which closed in 2007 due to running costs and reduced footfall.
The cinema has since been mainly used for corporate events, but a team of film fans  have given it a new lease of life as a community-run cinema, with a dream to one day get it fully back up and running again.
Timon Singh said with Bristol being a UNESCO city of film it would be great to bring the ""overwhelming"" IMAX experience back to the public again.
Mr Singh added: ""I love what Arthur's done with his film about the venue. It's like an underdog story.""
The old IMAX projector, which is about the size of a car, still sits in the venue, but with the reels and equipment weighing almost half a tonne, he said you would ""need a forklift"" to use it.
Instead, Forbidden Worlds Film Festival, run by Mr Singh and Dave Taylor, owner of Bristol video shop 20th Century Flicks, have been using a 2K Christie projector for their events.
Mr Singh said he hoped public support for the cinema, that has been renamed Bristol Megascreen, will grow in the face of increasing closures.
""For most people in the country, watching films on an IMAX screen means going to London,"" he added.
Mr Cauty said he was drawn to making a film about the venue after working in the industry in Bristol for 10 years and never hearing about the cinema until recently.
""A lot of people had just forgotten it was there,"" the filmmaker said.
""In the early 2000s, I think it was kind of doomed to fail - IMAX is quite a difficult format and its popularity dropped off.
""I don't really know what the future holds for it - people are currently using a HD projector in there - to run the IMAX projector could cost around Â£100,000 a year.""
The Big Picture will have its premiere at the Forbidden Worlds Film Festival at Bristol Megascreen on 28 May.

Ed Chapman said: ""I wondered if it could be done with biscuits, I thought surely they're going to be crumbling all over the place.""
The art was commissioned as part of the brand's 100th birthday celebrations for their chocolate digestive.
McVitie's has operated a biscuit factory in Harlesden, west London since 1902.
""I immediately went out and bought some biscuits to try them out and tested out how it might work - eventually I found my way with them.""
Asked how it was possible to make such vivid portraits out of digestives, he said: ""I initially thought they were all quite similar, but actually there's a white chocolate, gold chocolate, dark chocolate and of course the milk chocolate, and if you flip them over, there's the biscuit side which is plain, so there's a few grades of colour and tones there - it's a palette.
""When I started this, I didn't think about the warm weather. Thankfully I've got a north facing studio, but I kept them in the fridge as they were easier to cut.
Ed says the current warm spell is a bit of a worry, but said: ""I've protected them with several layers of varnish so, I'm not saying they're indestructible, but they should certainly last - they wouldn't last in the direct sun though.""
The artist said it took about 180 hours to make the three portraits and he used ""thousands"" of biscuits, which were supplied by McVitie's.
Mr Chapman said the work had already been getting good feedback and attention online.
The mosaic artist has also done campaigns for other companies, including Keep Britain Tidy.
The pictures will be displayed on The Strand from 2 to 5 May.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05ny0jdv5o,Teacher reunited with Roald Dahl's opal gift,"A teacher from Australia was reunited with an opal gifted by his class to the children's author Roald Dahl more than 30 years ago.
Mark Taylor, 57, made a special trip to the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, to see the precious gem while on a visit to the UK.
The world-renowned author had kept it on the desk in his writing hut at his home, Gipsy House.
He was given it by the class at Mintabie Area School in central Australia after doing a telephone link-up when he visited the country as part of his book tour promoting the recently published Matilda in 1989.
The children had been reading his books and were fascinated by the author, Mr Taylor said.
""He had a way of saying the most extraordinary and hilarious things, while remaining perfectly calm and teaching us at the same time,"" he added.
Mintabie, which is now an abandoned mining town, is more than 1,000km from Adelaide and a long way from facilities that other children would take for granted.
Mr Taylor said his students' faces transformed when Dahl told them how lucky they were to live in a place where treasures were dug up from the ground.
He recalled that Dahl told the class: ""There could be treasures all around you, waiting to be found, and you might never know it. In fact, you could be sitting or standing on an incredible treasure now.""
Mr Taylor said the author had asked if the students had ever found opal stones, to which the class responded they had.
An opal stone was duly sent to Roald Dahl via his publisher, Penguin.
Steve Gardam, director of the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre, said: ""The opal stone has been on the writing desk of Roald Dahl since he received it in 1989 and has remained there ever since.
""In 2011, Dahl's writing hut was transferred to the Museum and is one of the key exhibits here in Great Missenden.""

Lillywhite produced for bands including U2, The Rolling Stones, The Killers and Talking Heads during his five-decade career.
The Egham-born producer said it was ""very humbling and very lovely"" to accept the award on 1 May.
""I did not even finish secondary school. I did O-levels and then I was asked to leave, so I was amazed by today,"" he said.
Lillywhite compared the honour to becoming a CBE for services to music in the 2012 New Year Honours list.
He told BBC Radio Surrey: ""That was a really amazing thing, to go to the palace and get that, but this had pomp and circumstance to another level because I had to wear the gown and I got the certificate.""
The producer toured the university's facilities and spoke with ""fantastic"" current students during his visit.
""When you see young people and the enthusiasm they have for doing good, you realise that yes, we'll muck through it,"" he added.
He said his advice for the students was to ""follow your heart, and don't take what your teachers say as being gospel"".
""You enter cult status by doing that. Always question the teachers and take from them what you think is good for you,"" he said.
He said he had spent his life ""with a little bit of imposter syndrome"", but its ""always been part of my thing to always try your hardest and never be complacent"".
The university also honoured scientists Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Prof Peter HÃ¸j, along with businessmen Alan Parker, John Mullen and Lim Hua Min.
University of Surrey vice-chancellor Prof Max Lu said: ""We are proud to recognise these outstanding individuals whose work has made a lasting impact across science, education, the arts, business and beyond.
""Their achievements speak to the values we hold dear at Surrey - excellence, creativity, and the drive to make a difference in the world.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4l9nxjd0o,Groundbreaking musician Jill Sobule dies in house fire,"Jill Sobule, a groundbreaking US songwriter whose hit I Kissed a Girl is widely considered the first song with openly-gay themes to crack the Billboard Top 20, has died in a house fire in Minneapolis, Minnesota, her publicist has said.
Sobule, whose satirical anthem Supermodel featured in the 1995 coming-of-age film Clueless, was 66.
She had been due to perform on Friday in her home city of Denver, Colorado to showcase songs from her autobiographical stage musical. A free gathering will now take place in her honour.
Tributes have been pouring in on social media, including from English musician Lloyd Cole, who said: ""I'm really too numb to post much of anything. We loved her. She loved us.""
Born in 1959, Sobule's career spanned three decades, her music dealing with topics including the death penalty, anorexia and LGBTQ+ rights.
Her most famous work came on her eponymous 1995 album, which included Supermodel and I Kissed a Girl.
The latter drew renewed attention in 2008 when Katy Perry released a different single of her own with the same title.
Sobule later became a pioneer of using crowdfunding to release albums, and wrote music for theatre and television shows, including the theme for the Nickelodeon show Unfabulous.
John Porter, Sobule's manager, said she was a ""force of nature and human rights advocate whose music is woven into our culture"".
He continued: ""I was having so much fun working with her. I lost a client & a friend today. I hope her music, memory, & legacy continue to live on and inspire others.""
Eric Alper, a Canadian music correspondent, posted on X that she ""paved the way with heart, humour, and honesty"", adding that the openly gay artist ""changed the soundtrack - and the conversation"".
""Jill Sobule was so special. Heartbreaking news,"" American actress Carrie Coon posted.
Police in the suburb of Woodbury are investigating the cause of the fire at the house where Sobule was found, the Star Tribune reported.",George Wright,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkg403x1gxo,Four ways the film Conclave sheds light on the secretive way popes are chosen,"The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.
On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.
Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.
But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating?
Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.
They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.
""They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,"" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.
This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.
In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's ""focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny"", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.
The film invokes an ""incredible, introspective atmosphere"" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. ""I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.""
On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.
This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. ""It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,"" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.
While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.
Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, ""there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes"", she adds.
""There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.""
Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.
During this time, the participants will be ""getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision"", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.
In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.
In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.
Having said this, the imminent election may be one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.
Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - ""places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat"", says Prof Rowlands.
This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision.
The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.
Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as ""an ancient spiritual ritual"", he wanted to bring the participants ""into modernity"".
""We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.""
Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: ""Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.""
She adds: ""It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxg094zk58o,David Bowie to Doctor Who: Famous faces come to life in art show,"From Winston Churchill to Amy Winehouse, and Charles Darwin to Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa, portraits of a host of British icons feature in the first immersive exhibition to use one of Britain's national art collections.
The National Portrait Gallery (NPG) has combined digital versions of portraits from its collection with animated graphics and voiceovers to tell the stories of 19 celebrities and historical figures.
It is the latest in a wave of increasingly popular immersive art shows, which fill gallery walls with large-scale projected visuals.
The show launches in Salford on Friday before going on a UK tour. But while access to see the original portraits in the NPG in London is free, entrance to the Stories Brought To Life exhibition costs up to Â£35.
NPG director Victoria Siddall told BBC News: ""The main driver of this is taking the collection to new audiences outside of London.
""But there is another element to that, of course, which is raising revenue, which is absolutely crucial for museums to thrive.
""Obviously we're always looking at new innovations that can help engage audiences. And if that brings us revenue too that's wonderful.""
All national galleries charge for admission to special exhibitions, she added.
The gallery has forecast an operating deficit for the latest financial year.
The use of the striking paintings and photos with animated graphics, music and narration was a ""powerful combination"", Siddall said.
The exhibition is being held in a pop-up venue at MediaCity in Salford until August and will then tour to five more locations, but they have not been announced.
The venue's walls are filled with about 40 giant picture frame-style boxes, which the portraits and animations are projected onto.
Some of the chosen personalities, such as Malala Yousafzai, Churchill and Audrey Hepburn, tell their stories in their own words; while actors narrate the sections about others, including William Shakespeare and Emmeline Pankhurst.
It's a whistlestop guide to selected slices of history, with each person's story told in two or three minutes, and the entire show taking about 45 minutes. It ends with Queen Elizabeth II.
Standard adult tickets cost between Â£22 and Â£30, with an extra Â£5 for a flexible ticket, and some ""affordable"" Â£10 tickets available on Mondays.
Joy Coker, editor of arts outlet Alt A Review, said she thought it was worth it, but that the price could exclude some people.
""Right now with the cost of living it might not be something everybody can afford,"" she said.
""It's thought-provoking and it actually makes you think about each individual subject again, and takes you back to those moments in time, which you're not necessarily going to get from a looking at a portrait on its own.""
In recent years, artists from Vincent van Gogh to David Hockney have successfully been given the immersive treatment.
This weekend, LS Lowry will also be added to the list when a new, free immersive experience brings his trademark matchstick men to life at Salford's Lowry arts centre.
The walls, floor and ceiling of one gallery show projections of the artist's 1953 painting Going To The Match. The crowds flocking to watch Bolton Wanderers FC are animated, with the visuals zooming in on sections of the artwork.
The six-minute experience is narrated by Bolton comedian and actress Sophie Willan, and visitors can then see the real painting in the next gallery.
""People are going and standing in front of the painting and then looking for elements that have come to life, and that is a different way for them to be able to engage with the real artwork,â The Lowry chief executive Julia Fawcett explained.
The venue bought the painting for almost Â£8m in 2022 and has spent two years working on the immersive version. Fawcett said she did not consider charging for entry.
""Our galleries are free and this is part of our gallery offer,"" she said. ""For us, it was about making sure we reached the widest possible audience.
""We know immersive [art] is popular but we know also that price can be a barrier, and it would be counter-intuitive, when you have a project that is about reaching more audiences and deepening people's love and appreciation of the artist, to put a barrier in place.""",Ian Youngs,4 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyqe3v5jjdo,Counter-terrorism police investigating Kneecap videos,"The Metropolitan Police's counter-terror officers will investigate online videos showing rap trio Kneecap calling for the death of British MPs and shouting ""up Hamas, up Hezbollah"".
A video emerged of the west Belfast trio at a November 2023 gig where one person from the band says: ""The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.""
Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.
Kneecap say they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and would not incite violence against any individual. They say the video in question has been taken out of context.
Some gigs featuring the band have been called off since the video emerged, most recently their Plymouth show, which was cancelled just two days after it was announced.
Organisers cited safety reasons, saying they had ""taken advice from relevant authorities and agencies"".
The group have since announced new Plymouth gigs at a different venue.
On Thursday, the Met Police said: ""On April 22, we were made aware of an online video believed to be from a music event in London in November 2024.
""Following this, we were made aware of a further video, believed to be from another music event in London in November 2023.
""Both videos were referred to the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit for assessment by specialist officers, who have determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos.
""The investigation is now being carried out by officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command and inquiries remain ongoing at this time.""
In a statement earlier this week, Kneecap said they rejected ""any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever.""
The statement says: ""Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah""
They stated that ""an extract of footage, deliberately taken out of all context, is now being exploited and weaponised, as if it were a call to action"".
Referring to two MPs who have been murdered in the UK in recent years, the trio added: ""To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt.""
A Cabinet minister has said the rap group should not be allowed to perform at Glastonbury festival, where they are listed for the Saturday.
Commons Leader Lucy Powell said that although the final decision would be for the festival organisers, she believed ""no-one in this House"" would want to see the group at Glastonbury, adding: ""We'll all continue to say so loud and clear.""
Kneecap have faced criticism and commercial consequences after displaying messages about the war in Gaza during their set at US music festival Coachella earlier this month.
They were dropped by their sponsor and booking agent Independent Artist Group (IAG) and former X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne called for Kneecap's US work visas to be revoked.
Following this, footage emerged from a previous gig, which is now under investigation by counter-terrorism officers.
A number of artists have signed a joint statement in support of Kneecap.
Fontaines DC, Annie Mac, Bicep, Massive Attack, Pulp, Paul Weller and Christy Moore are among the artists who signed the open letter by Kneecap's record label, Heavenly Recordings.
The statement said there had been a ""clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform"" the band.
It accused ""senior political figures"" in Westminster and the UK media of being ""openly engaged in a campaign to remove Kneecap from the public eye"".
""As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,"" the statement added.
""In a democracy, no political figures or political parties should have the right to dictate who does and does not play at music festivals or gigs that will be enjoyed by thousands of people.""
Kneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise.
The group was formed in 2017 by three friends who go by the stage names of Mo Chara, MÃ³glaÃ­ Bap and DJ PrÃ³vaÃ­.
Their rise to fame inspired a semi-fictionalised film starring Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender.
The film won a British Academy of Film Award (Bafta) in February 2025.",Abigail Taylor,5 days ago,0

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddejgv4rlgo,"After 20 years, family favourite The Gruffalo set for new adventure","After more than 20 years roaming the deep dark wood, the Gruffalo is coming back in a new book, which author Julia Donaldson says she was spurred to write by a campaign to reverse a decline in children's reading.
The book will be published in 2026, and will be the third about the beloved animal - after 1999's best-selling original and 2004's sequel The Gruffalo's Child.
Donaldson said she had the idea ""a long time ago"", but was inspired to finally put pen to paper after the National Literacy Trust (NLT) started using the previous two books in its Early Words Matter scheme.
According to the NLT, just 35% of children aged between eight and 18 said they enjoyed reading in their free time in 2024.
That is the lowest level since the charity started gathering data in 2005.
Some of those who had the original books read to them as young children will now be able to read the new story to their own kids.
The first picture book saw a humble mouse encounter a fox, a snake and an owl in the deep, dark wood - before meeting the Gruffalo itself, and tricking the furry monster into being scared of it.
Then in The Gruffalo's Child, the character's offspring went in search of the ""big, bad mouse"".
""It's always a challenge to write a sequel,"" Donaldson said in a statement. ""Five years elapsed between publication of The Gruffalo and The Gruffalo's Child, and now it will be more than 20 between The Gruffalo's Child and the third book.
""I actually had the basic idea for the story a long time ago, but couldn't think how to develop it.
""It was only when the NLT, whose work I'm very impressed by, used the first two books as part of their Early Words Matter programme that I was spurred on to get my idea out of the cupboard and see once and for all if I could turn it into a really satisfying story. To my surprise, I managed to do just that!""
She said she was ""delighted"" when illustrator Axel Scheffler came back on board. ""I really hope that children - and adults too - will enjoy the new story, as I know what a wonderful experience shared reading can be,"" she added.
Publisher Macmillan Children's Books billed the new book as ""a fresh and exciting adventure that has all the hallmarks of a Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler classic"".
The first two books have sold 18 million copies, Macmillan said.
NLT chief executive Jonathan Douglas said ""reading and sharing stories is critical for shaping a child's early speech and language development"".
Since the two main Gruffalo books were published, there have been spin-offs and animated versions of both, the first of which was nominated for an Oscar.
Donaldson has written more than 200 books in total, and told the BBC last year it was ""amazing"" that The Gruffalo had such an impact, but that she thought it ""hogs too much of the attention"".
Sir Jonathan Bate, professor of English Literature at Arizona State University told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday that the Gruffalo ""really is one of the children's classics.""
He added: ""It plugs into an ancient archetypal story, the story of the trickster, the small creature who, through cleverness, defeats all sorts of danger.""
But where has the character been for all these years?
Speaking on the same programme, eight-year-old Lupin said he imagined the Gruffalo had ""been traveling and exploring"" in his time away.
""The Gruffalo's child is now grown up and has kids, so the Gruffalo is a granddad,"" he speculated.
""He has been traveling on a cruise ship. He stole away in a suitcase, by the way, and he's now in Australia.
""He has had to shave off all of his fur as it is so hot and wear a disguise as he is so famous.""
Another young listener, Jessica, said she thought the Gruffalo might have ""gone to school or ""gone on holiday to Center Parcs and gone in the swimming pool"".
Alternatively, she added, he ""might have learned history"" or ""made some crafty things at school.""
A third, Ottilie, said she was ""so excited"" about the Gruffalo's return.
""Maybe while he's been away he has been hunting for other creatures to eat, or maybe him and the mouse have become best friends and they went to the park and played on the swings,"" she considered.
""Or the Gruffalo might have took a long, relaxing holiday in Mauritius,"" she added.",Ian Youngs,5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grdqlk7l5o,Green Man Festival silent on Kneecap inclusion,"Green Man Festival has remained silent over whether it plans to axe the group Kneecap from this year's line-up.
The Welsh government said it ""unequivocally condemn calls for violence against any group or individual"" and the festival should consider ""whether it is appropriate for the act to perform"".
The west Belfast rap trio are set to perform at the festival, held near Crickhowell, Powys, in August.
The group have the support of several artists with ties to the festival who have signed an open letter calling for artists to have freedom of expression but, despite repeated requests from the BBC, Green Man Festival has not commented.
Welsh Conservatives demanded the act be pulled after footage emerged from one of the band's performances allegedly showing them calling for MPs to be killed.
Gareth Davies, Welsh Conservative culture, tourism and sport spokesman, said the festival ""risks further inciteful comments"" if Kneecap is allowed to perform.
In a post on Instagram, Heavenly Recordings, Kneecap's record label, listed a number of artists who have expressed support for Kneecap.
The independent record label said in the caption: ""These artists support the right to Freedom of Expression. This is an ever expanding list. If you are an artist who wishes to be added please DM us.""
About a quarter of the artists who have signed the open letter have played at the Green Man Festival before.
Fontaines D.C, Idles and Bicep, who signed the letter, have all played at Green Man in recent years and at least two of the acts listed have prominent spots on this year's line-up with English Teacher having signed it and Yard Act asking to be added.
In the wake of the comments, several gigs in Germany and one at the Eden Project in Cornwall have been cancelled.
Kneecap are also due to perform at Wide Awake Festival, Glastonbury and 2000 Trees Festival. They have not said whether the band will still be performing.
In early April, there were calls for Kneecap's US visas to be revoked after their performance at the Coachella music festival.
This week, a video emerged from a November 2023 gig that appeared to show one person from the band saying: ""The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.""
The footage is currently being assessed by counter-terrorism police.
In a statement posted on X, Kneecap said they rejected ""any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever"".

As in the 1981 film it is based on, everyone is rattled when one pair heads for divorce. Fey and Will Forte play one of the couples. Colman Domingo and Marco Calvani are another, a same-sex twist that is the most obvious update from '81. And Steve Carell plays a man who is leaving his wife (Kerri Kenney-Silver) for a younger woman (Erika Henningsen), a timeless part of the plot.

Lyonne stars as Charlie Cale, who has an incredible knack for running across murders, scoping out who's telling the truth and who's lying, and solving the case by the end of the episode. Now on the run from a different crime boss than in the first season, Charlie is still on the road, travelling to a different place in every episode, each featuring a slew of guest stars. This time they include Cynthia Erivo, Awkwafina, Giancarlo Esposito, Kumail Nanjiani, John Mulaney, Katie Holmes and about two dozen others, as Charlie stumbles across trouble at a funeral home, a baseball game and an alligator farm. Running through it all are Lyonne's trademark sardonic delivery and the series's fast-paced retro feel.

Judy Blume's 1975 YA novel about first love is reimagined with an update in this series set in Los Angeles in 2018, with a cast largely composed of black actors. High school students Keisha (Lovie Simone), a track star, and Justin (Michael Cooper Jr), a basketball player, are childhood friends who lost touch. When they meet again at a party and fall in love, they face all the intense feelings and decisions that brings. Over the years, Blume's novel has been banned in several US states for the direct way its characters confront the question of when to have their first sexual experience (Blume's honesty is exactly what many fans like about her) and the issue needed a new lens for the 21st Century. But the series' showrunner, Mara Brock Akil, has also leant into the timeless theme of romance, and the Los Angeles setting feeds into it. ""What better metaphor for this love story than what LA represents,"" she has said. ""You're looking for a place to follow your dreams, and love is a part of that.""
Forever premieres 8 May on Netflix internationally
Retro television is having a moment with Poker Face and this action drama set in 1972 in the Southwest US. JJ Abrams is an executive producer and, along with LaToya Morgan, wrote the first two episodes of the series, which stars Josh Holloway, still best known as Sawyer from Abrams's Lost, as a swaggering driver for a crime syndicate. Rachel Hilson plays the first black female FBI agent, who chases him down, with Keith David as the syndicate's boss. In addition to the cat-and-mouse crime story and possibly wavering loyalties, Duster has knife fights, cars flipping over and dust all around. Abrams told The Hollywood Reporter that the series came about because ""I had this image of a phone booth in the middle of the desert and a car driving up, and a guy getting on the phone to find out where he was meant to go next"".Â  That turned into a show that he calls ""a crazy story"" with humour, absurdity and lots of plot turns.

Television is full of sci-fi series, but this one has a comic twist and Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd, as a robot who manages to hack its own system and go rogue. ""I am a security unit,"" it announces in its cheery voiceover. ""I was built to protect and obey humans. And humans are idiots."" Chris and Paul Weitz (About a Boy) created the show, based on Martha Wells' series of books, The Murderbot Diaries, and have given it a Blade Runner-meets-Black Mirror style. Although the title robot calls itself Murderbot, it doesn't really want to kill anyone. It prefers sitting around bingeing its favourite show, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, a series-within-the-series with John Cho and Jack McBrayer playing the leads. When it lands on a new planet, its social awkwardness creates a very human problem, which makes it, SkarsgÃ¥rd told Empire magazine, ""more relatable than most characters I've ever played"". Of course, he has played Tarzan and a vampire, so relatable is a relative thing.

Julianne Moore and Meghann Fahy star in this dark comedy about power, class and control, set over one weekend on a wealthy resort island. Moore plays Michaela, a philanthropist and animal activist who is also iron-fisted in her control of island society. Her personal assistant, Simone (Milly Alcock, who played the younger Rhaenyra Targaryen in House of the Dragons), is so in thrall to her that Simone's sister, Devon, (Fahy) comes to the island to stage an intervention. Kevin Bacon plays Michaela's billionaire husband, with Glenn Howerton and Bill Camp among the supporting cast. The series was created by Molly Smith Metzler, who also created the hit Netflix series Maid. She based Sirens on her 2011 play Elemeno Pea, and has said that the show has ""a Greek mythology vibe"", presumably because Michaela sends out such a siren's call to Simone. But details are scarce, so for all we know this siren, as in mythology, could turn out to be half bird. Fully human or not, Moore is always worth watching.

Matthew Goode stars in this crime thriller, the latest show from Scott Frank, the creator of terrific series including The Queen's Gambit and Monsieur Spade. The hero, Carl Morck (Goode), is an abrasive detective in Edinburgh whose partner has been paralyzed on the job, sending him into a tailspin and landing him a low-profile role as head of a new cold-case unit called Department Q. Headquartered in a basement, his unit of misfits is meant to be no more than a publicity move for the police â but as in Slow Horses, the band of outcasts is smarter than their prized colleagues. Frank based the show on a series of Danish novels and changed the setting to Edinburgh, where it was shot. Meanwhile, Morck has been made into an Englishman, a fish out of water whose ex-wife is Scottish, which accounts for his very bad attitude toward all Scots. The top-flight cast includes Kelly Macdonald and Shirley Henderson.

An unlikely family tangle is beneath the plot of this thriller with Jessica Biel and Elizabeth Banks as estranged sisters who have very different lives. Biel plays Chloe, a polished media executive who lives in upscale comfort with her lawyer husband (Corey Stoll) and teenage son. Banks plays Nicky, a recovering addict who is struggling financially. When someone in the family is murdered, the death and their old sibling rivalry converge, as the sisters come together to find the truth of what happened. Lorraine Toussaint, Matthew Modine and Gloria Reuben are also in the cast. Olivia Milch, who co-created the show with Regina Corrado (based on a 2019 novel by Alafair Burke) told Glamour that the question of which sister is better ""changes moment to moment"", which sounds just right for a thriller.

As she ambles into her next chapter in life, nearly 30 years after Sex and the City premiered, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) still has great shoes, as seen in the trailer for the third season of this sequel series. The new season puts her where the last one ended, in a new apartment and trying a long-distance relationship with Aiden (John Corbett). But Carrie is now writing a novel, instead of the personal column she used to write. As always, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) have their own issues. Sarita Choudhury and Nicole Ari Parker return as recently-acquired core friends Seema and Lisa, while Rosie O'Donnell and Patti LuPone appear as brand new characters. The show has inspired long-loyal, opinionated fans, who will want to know whether or not two old favourites are missing: Che Diaz (Sarah Ramirez), Miranda's former partner who was a love-them or hate-them character, and Kim Cattrall, whose phoned-in cameo as Samantha last season â really, she was shown in a car on the phone for a minute â was a fizzle.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dg3pn24z0o,Robert De Niro shows support for transgender daughter,"Hollywood star Robert De Niro has said he is showing ""love and support"" for his daughter Airyn, after she came out as transgender.
In a recent interview with LGBTQ+ publication Them, Airyn De Niro spoke about ""stepping into this new identity"".
Airyn's famous father told Variety in a statement: ""I loved and supported Aaron as my son, and now I love and support Airyn as my daughter.
""I don't know what the big deal is,"" he added. ""I love all my children.""
The Goodfellas actor's daughter, 29, noted how she began to transition last year because, as a transgender woman, ""there's a difference between being visible and being seen.
""I've been visible. I don't think I've been seen yet.""
Airyn, daughter of De Niro and US actress and model Toukie Smith, also said the actress and LGBTQ advocate Laverne Cox had been an inspiration; and that she now hoped to help expand trans visibility and to honour her black queer ancestors.
""Trans women being honest and open, especially [in] public spaces like social media and getting to see them in their successâ¦ I'm like, you know what? Maybe it's not too late for me.""
And with regard to the experience of being one of seven De Niro children, she went on say that ""no parent is perfect, but I am grateful that both my parents agreed to keep me out of the limelight.
""They have told me they wanted me to have as much of a normal childhood as possible.""
Transgender women in the UK have come under scrutiny in recent weeks, after judges at the Supreme Court unanimously ruled a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.
Now the UK's only ever judge to publicly say they are transgender is planning to take the government to the European Court of Human Rights over the ruling which she said violated her human rights.
Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.",Paul Glynn,5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20zg0n52jo,Film festival celebrates region's textile history,"A film festival in the Borders is celebrating the region's textile history this year.
The Alchemy Film and Moving Image Festival is in its 15th edition and runs in Hawick from 1 to 4 May.
It includes a film looking at the legacy of textile designers Bernat and Margaret Klein who lived near Selkirk.
Festival director Michael Pattison said they were excited to host its premiere in the Borders.
The film, called On Weaving, is the work of  2012 Turner Prize nominee, Luke Fowler and 2014 Max Mara prize winner, Corin Sworn.
It features the current owners of the Kleins former home, talking about them and the story of the textile industry in the Borders.
Dr Pattison said he was delighted to have the film as part of this year's festival.
""The film is a rich portrait of the Klein home as well as of active sites of textiles production in the Scottish Borders,"" he said.
""Its use of analogue film to capture these places in all their colour and texture provides a lasting snapshot of our region's architectural and industrial heritage.""",Unknown,5 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l05xx6ekdo,Lorde: 'Working with Charli XCX kicked me into opening up',"Singer Lorde says collaborating with Charli XCX gave her more confidence to explore her vulnerabilities with her new music.
The singer-songwriter from New Zealand is gearing up to release her fourth album, Virgin, this summer, and the first single, What Was That, shot straight into the UK top 10.
Lorde tells BBC Radio 1's Jack Saunders it's taken a lot of work to get the album to this point: ""I never thought it would come out,"" she says.
""I wrote this from the perspective of, 'well I could never say that',"" the singer, real name Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor, says.
""It was just sort of an exercise in saying everything I needed to say about a whole lot of different stuff and I put off dealing with that.
""I was like, that's for future Ella to deal with.""
Then came a message from Charli XCX, inviting her to collaborate on her track girl, so confusing from her acclaimed album Brat.
In the remix, Lorde opens up about struggling with an eating disorder and comparing herself to the singer-songwriter from Essex.
""Brat coming out really gave me a kick,"" says Lorde.
""Meeting her in that place of rugged vulnerability and people responding really well to that, I was kind of like, 'OK cool - this is a good thing to be doing'.
""I really suffer from this thing of not feeling my own power... and the remix just started me up and I was like, 'no no, people are listening and they care and your words carry real weight'.""
Aside from its multiple awards, Brat also became a cultural phenomenon when it was released.
It featured in the US presidential election campaign and the Collins Dictionary, which crowned it word of the year.
Lorde performed the remix during Charli's Coachella set in California last month, with Charli even suggesting ""Lorde summer 2025"" could follow 2024's Brat summer.
Lorde says Brat also inspired her to refine what she wanted to say with her first new music in four years.
""It forced me to further define what I was doing because Charli had so masterfully defined everything about Brat,"" she says.
""And it's so amazing when a peer throws the gauntlet down like that. We've gotta pick it up and I've spoken to a lot of peers who all had the same feeling.""
Lorde's lead single, What Was That, was officially released last week after being teased on TikTok, debuting in the UK Top 10.
Lorde says it gives a flavour of her upcoming album, where she's tried to reconnect with her younger self.
""I really went into it like, 'just make something for you, just make something you think is cool',"" she says.
""It's not unlike how I was making music as a 15-year-old, just trying to impress myself.
""What Was That was the first song from this album that I wrote and was like, 'OK, I know where to go with this',"" she says, describing the track as ""Lorde canon"" and ""recognisably me"".
""It's funny to be 12 years into your career and for people to have an understanding of your tropes and what you do.""
The singer says she ""wanted to lock people back in"" to her sound after her last album, 2021's Solar Power, which she says was ""a very different flavour for me"".
""It's about going to the core of who I am in the purest way possible, stripping away anything unnecessary.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c078rm3zde7o,Woman completes granddaughter's unfinished novel,"A woman has completed her granddaughter's unfinished novel after the teenager's sudden death.
Allana Raine King, from Bristol, passed away in 2018 at the age of 19 due to complications from encephalitis, a rare autoimmune brain condition. According to her grandmother, Lorraine Martin, Allana had completed 90% of her novel before her death.
Ms Martin, from Weston-super-Mare, north Somerset, said it was a daunting task as she had no prior writing experience. But seeing it published feels like her granddaughter's dream has finally come true
It is now on sale at Bristol's Waterstones.
""By the time she was a teenager, Allana was rarely without a notebook, recording her feelings and daily experiences,"" Ms Martin said.
""Allana was joyful, compassionate, and wise beyond her years.  She had this incredible ability to connect with the emotions of others.""
The book, Land of the Free, follows a young man called Rocky in a dystopian world, where technology has taken over.
Ms Martin told the BBC her task of finishing the novel was made easier by extensive notes, left by Allana.
""I felt like I was lost at sea initially,"" Ms Martin said.
""One day I came to the realisation that I've got to make an attempt to do this.
""And the story line was captivating so I got engrossed into it and it kept going from where Allana had arrived in the story.
""I found myself in a zone and the words and the storyline just seemed to happen spontaneously.""
At the time of her death, Allana was set to head to university to study creative writing.
Ms Martin always dreamed walking past Waterstone's and seeing Allana's book there.
""To have that dream, it was like my dream for her [has] come true.""
Half of all the proceeds made will go towards Encephalitis International, which supports the 4,000 people diagnosed with the condition in the UK each year.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crm30mv30myo,Mod clothing exhibition set to open in Brighton,"An exhibition celebrating the clothing of the mod youth culture in the 1960s is set to open in a city which has close connections with the trend.
The In Crowd: Mod Fashion & Style 1958-66 opens at Brighton Museum on 10 May and features outfits designed by Mary Quant, John Stephen and the original Brighton-based mod brand Ben Sherman.
The display is curated by Roger K Burton, an expert in vintage fashion, and features rare and early mod outfits drawn from his collection.
Mr Burton, who has styled films including Brighton-based Quadrophenia and Absolute Beginners, said the exhibition was ""a chance to step into the world of a transformative youth culture that left an indelible mark on fashion and society"".
He said: ""The Mods rejected the 1950s, favouring sharp tailoring, bold colours, and a sense of modernity that captured the spirit of youth culture.
""More than just a fashion statement, they embraced a fresh outlook on life, celebrating youth, freedom, and modernity in ways that continue to inspire today.""
The exhibition showcases the influential designers who defined the mod movement with sleek miniskirts, sharp suits, and crisp button-down shirts that embodied its forward-thinking spirit.
""These garments were statements of individuality, rebellion, and modernity,"" said Mr Burton.
Hedley Swain, chief executive of Brighton & Hove Museums, said: ""This exhibition not only showcases the remarkable craftsmanship and innovation of mod fashion but also celebrates Brighton's unique historical connection to this influential youth movement.""
Founded in Brighton in 1963, Ben Sherman has become a symbol of sharp British style, favoured by the mod movement for its tailored designs and contemporary aesthetics.
The heritage brand will present an ""archival installation"", Ben Sherman: The Decades, which will run alongside the main exhibition from 23 May.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgqv54330dlo,'Playing Celine Dion on stage is a lot of pressure',"When Lauren Drew was offered the role of Celine Dion in Titanique in London's West End, she did not have to think twice.
For the Port Talbot-born musical star, a lifelong fan of the ""queen of power ballads"", it was a dream come true.
Drew described the Olivier Award-winning show as a parody of the 1997 film Titanic, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.
She said the role comes with ""a lot of pressure,"" as she must deliver Dion's powerhouse vocals on the hit My Heart Will Go On.
Drew began performing at a young age as a champion freestyle disco dancer, but it was during school that she discovered her passion for singing and acting.
She trained at Neath Port Talbot College before earning a full scholarship to Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in London.
Growing up in a working-class family with limited means, Drew said she worked tirelessly to fund her dreams, taking on various jobs from the age of 14.
She said her family ""kind of sacrificed everything for me, so I do this for them"".
Now 32, she said she believed there was something special about her hometown, which has produced stars like Sir Anthony Hopkins, Michael Sheen, and Richard Burton.
""I think the town naturally breeds very hardworking people,"" she added.
Following acclaimed performances in Six the Musical and Legally Blonde, Drew has reached new heights of recognition in Titanique, with celebrity fans including Alan Carr and Amanda Holden.
Drew said audiences should expect a wildly different experience from the film it parodies.
Co-created by Tye Blue, part of the team behind RuPaul's Drag Race, Drew said the show is ""wacky, wonderful, and crazy"" and ""a real ride"".
""I need you to imagine a Titanic Museum, and Celine Dion crashes and she says, 'Oh, no, no, no'. This is not actually what what went down. I'll tell you what went down because I was there and this story is a fever dream,"" she added.
The show also features Bad Education star Layton Williams, as the Iceberg.
But for Drew, a grounded performer playing an over-the-top diva, she said it was all about giving the audience a joyful escape.
She added: ""I feel like the world needs it right now.
""You know, it's just kind of unapologetic, crazy joy.
""And everybody, every single show, they're on their feet, every single time, without fail, it's just, it's so much fun,"" Drew said.
In 2022, Celine Dion, widely known as the ""queen of power ballads"", revealed her battle with Stiff Person Syndrome, a rare autoimmune neurological disorder that causes severe muscle spasms.
It affected her ability to sing and perform and led to her cancelling tour dates.
Dion returned to live performance for the first time since revealing the condition at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, where she sang on the Eiffel Tower.
However, her health struggles are not mentioned in Titanique, which takes a more playful, spoof-like approach to her legacy.
Although Lauren Drew's portrayal of the 200-million-record-selling Canadian star is an exaggerated version, audience expectations remain sky-high.
She said: ""There is such pressure, because people love her so much, she's such a kooky person, but first and foremost, I know that people want the vocals, so I am living like a nun at the moment.""
Determined to ""make sure people get what they expect"" from someone playing Celine Dion, Drew has been ""guzzling down litres of water"" and studying countless videos to capture the star's signature mannerisms.
She said: ""I was such a massive fan of her anyway, and I've been told over the years that I remind people of her, so it wasn't too far a stretch.
""I kind of have that bonkers energy quite naturally anyway.
""But I've watched a lot of videos, things that she does when she's on stage, the flick of her hand and the pound of her chest, and she's very dynamic, in everything that she does, and everything is very deliberate,"" Drew added.
The hard work paid off for her as she was recently nominated for an Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical.
Drew said she hopes her success will show people ""not to limit themselves because they came from nothing"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x8n5kn80qo,More Kneecap gigs cancelled after 'kill your MP' controversy,"Three more Kneecap concerts have been cancelled in Germany.
It comes after news that footage of a band member calling for MPs to be killed is being assessed by counter-terrorism police.
A ticket site for the gigs in Hamburg, Berlin and Cologne states that the summer shows are no longer going ahead.
A number of politicians have called for the Irish rap band to be uninvited from some UK gigs, with Tory MP Mark Francois saying the group should not be allowed to play Glastonbury in light of the ongoing police investigation.
The largest body representing Jews in the UK have called for Glastonbury to cancel the group's planned performance.
In a statement, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the rap trio's remarks had ""caused great concern both within the UK Jewish community and wider society"".
Speaking on RTÃ's Prime Time on Tuesday, the band's manager said ""moral hysteria"" had taken hold and that the band are being held to a higher moral standard than politicians.
Daniel Lambert claimed a ""concerted campaign"" against the group is ""solely about de-platforming artists"".
""It's about telling the next young band, both through the music industry and through the political class, that you cannot speak about Palestine,"" he said.
A number of other artists have signed a joint statement in support of Kneecap.
Fontaines DC, Annie Mac, Bicep, Massive Attack, Pulp, Paul Weller and Christy Moore are among the artists who signed the open letter by Kneecap's record label, Heavenly Recordings.
The statement said there had been a ""clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform"" the band.
It accused ""senior political figures"" in Westminster and the UK media of being ""openly engaged in a campaign to remove Kneecap from the public eye"".
""As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,"" the statement added.
""In a democracy, no political figures or political parties should have the right to dictate who does and does not play at music festivals or gigs that will be enjoyed by thousands of people.""
On having gigs cancelled, the band's manager said: ""It's not for us to worry, it's for us to have the strength of conviction that we did the right thing.""
He added that going to Coachella was the right thing to do, and ""all of this has emerged from that"".
TV personality Sharon Osbourne called for the band's US work visas to be revoked after their performance at the Coachella music festival in California earlier this month, where they described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide.
Scheduled appearances at Hurricane and Southside festivals, also in Germany, were cancelled last week.
A gig at the Eden Project in Cornwall has also been cancelled.
On Tuesday, an Eden Sessions Limited spokesperson said: ""Ticket purchasers will be contacted directly and will be fully refunded.""
The band are set to support Fontaines DC at Boucher Playing Fields, Belfast, in August.
Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show, Belfast city councillor Jim Rodgers of the Ulster Unionist Party said ""serious consideration should be given"" on whether the concert should go ahead.
""I've already spoken to some of the council officers and I'm hoping that the necessary action will be taken. We have to lead by example,"" he said.
""We would be sending out the wrong message if we were to allow this group to go ahead with their event.""
The Democratic Unionist Party has called for an emergency city council meeting.
""Citing concerns over 'dangerous rhetoric,' glorification of terrorism, and incitement to violence, we insist such acts should not be platformed on Council-owned land,"" the party said.
A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: ""Use of the venue for these events is managed via a legal agreement between the council and the promoter. Events programming remains a matter for the organisers.
""Any matter that an elected member wishes to raise would be considered by the relevant committee and full council.""
Kneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise.
The group was formed in 2017 by three friends who go by the stage names of Mo Chara, MÃ³glaÃ­ Bap and DJ PrÃ³vaÃ­.
Their rise to fame inspired a semi-fictionalised film starring Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender.
The film won a British Academy of Film Award (Bafta) in February 2025.
Last week, a video emerged of the west Belfast trio at a November 2023 gig appearing to show one person from the band saying: ""The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.""
The daughter of the Conservative MP David Amess whose father was stabbed to death at a constituency surgery called for Kneecap to apologise.
In a statement on X, the band said that ""an extract of footage, deliberately taken out of all context, is now being exploited and weaponised, as if it were a call to action"".
They also called some of the backlash a ""smear campaign"" and said it was ""a transparent effort to derail the real conversation"" away from their messages of ""love"" and support for Palestine.
They added: ""To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt.""
On Tuesday, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox called on Kneecap to give a ""real apology"".
Brendan Cox, whose wife was killed in June 2016, said this was ""only half an apology"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr78kj3nveyo,Olly Murs says scrutiny of his body is 'madness',"Olly Murs says scrutiny of his physique is ""disappointing"" and ""absolutely madness"" after pictures of his body before and after a fitness regime prompted a flood of reactions online and in the media.
Social media users and newspaper columnists have been offering opinions about whether the English singer and presenter looked better before or after.
Thanking fans following his gig in Dublin on Tuesday, the star responded on a video posted on his Instagram story, admitting it had been ""a weird day"".
""I don't know if you guys have been on social media, but there's loads of weird stuff being wrote about me, about my body and stuff,"" he noted. ""Absolutely madness.""
He continued: ""But anyway, moving on. Thank you for cheering me up.""
On Wednesday, Murs shared a photo of a Daily Mail article dissecting his transformation from having a ""huggable dad bod"" to a more muscular physique.
The article suggested that, despite his efforts in the gym, women actually preferred the former.
""I wouldn't normally comment on stuff like this but from what I've seen I just want to say that this journey at the start of the year was for many personal reasons and not one of them was to spark a debate and divide opinions,"" Murs posted in his Instagram caption.
""So it's very disappointing to see this kind of reporting!""
He signed off by sending love to ""everyone who's been kind"" as well as ""anyone out there improving themselves and making adjustments to their wellbeing"", urging them to ""keep it up"" and ""ignore the noise!""
The media articles followed much online discussion about a poll that had been conducted on X, which found that although male users generally thought Murs looked better after his fitness regime, women generally said they preferred his previous figure.
The 40-year-old from Essex rose to fame on the X Factor - a show he later presented - and went to have hits with tracks like Troublemaker, Dance With Me Tonight and Up.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kv7pnx28qo,Stone lion sculpture gets facelift to match twin,"A lion statue has had a facelift to make it match its twin.
The pair have stood at the entrance to Weelsby Woods in Grimsby since the 1950s, until a car hit one in 2023, knocking it off its pedestal.
It was repaired and restored to its plinth, but the face did not match the other lion sculpture.
Now stonemasons have remodelled the face of the existing one so it looks like the repaired one.
The two-tonne lions were carved in 1876 for the gateway of a house on Abbey Road in Grimsby.
They were moved to the park when it opened in 1951 following a donation of 150 acres of land to the town by a local fishing magnate.
After the crash, community group the Friends of Weelsby Woods raised Â£10,000 to repair the damaged lion.
The latest restoration was paid for by North East Lincolnshire Council and used the same Lincoln stonemasons who had previously fixed it.
Councillor Henry Hudson said he was ""elated"" to see the pair back together.
""It's great to see the lions match again,"" he said.
""It was a travesty when the first was destroyed.
""However, now the pair look even better and we're thrilled to have been able to do this.""

https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250428-how-19th-century-bad-boy-antonin-careme-made-food-rock-n-roll,The true story of the first-ever 'rock star' chef,"A new Apple TV+ series explores the life of the so-called ""King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings"" â shown as a wild enfant terrible in post-Revolutionary France who blazed a trail for future generations of cooks.
It's described as ""the story of the first celebrity chef"". The French language series CarÃªme is a dramatisation of the life of Antonin CarÃªme, who was born into poverty in pre-Revolutionary Paris around 1784. His talent would make him chef for the French diplomat Charles Talleyrand, the Emperor Napoleon, the future George IV of Britain, Tsar Alexander of Russia and the Baron de Rothschild. He also wrote celebrated cookbooks and introduced the Toque (the tall chef's hat), still in use today â giving birth to the very idea of the ""celebrity"" chef.
Indeed, Benjamin Voisin, the actor playing Antonin CarÃªme, believes that if the chef had been working in the 2020s, ""he'd have been the one with 100 million views on TikTok. That would be the equivalent of what he did at the time,"" he tells the BBC.
And Voisin's portrayal of CarÃªme feels modern; he plays him with a touch of the rock star as well as kitchen chef. He wears an earring, his clothes seem to owe more to the 1980s New Romantic movement than 19th-Century costume, and from his affairs with women to his lack of deference to his so-called superiors, he is what could be described (in French) as an enfant terrible. He is also confident, brash and authoritative in his kitchen â a manner that echoes 21st-Century celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay.
The series is inspired by a biography of CarÃªme and his gastronomy by Ian Kelly, who also co-created the series with screenwriter Davide Serino. The historical figure of the young chef is actually described by Kelly in his book as a ""bookish innocent"" when he takes his first job, but Voisin's look in the series isn't too far from Kelly's description of CarÃªme aged 25: ""He was handsome, his hair cut and tousled forward in the fashionably Byronic manner... he was described as slight, and a slight eater."" Kelly also describes CarÃªme as ""ambitious, solipsistic, even narcissistic"" as a person â although the CarÃªme on screen risks much for those he loves.
Indeed, perhaps inevitably, the series takes various liberties with the truth, also depicting CarÃªme as a spy for his powerful masters, something there's no historical evidence for. The show's lead director Martin Bourboulon describes the added drama as ""the charm of fiction in the show"". The reality is that the real man didn't leave much information behind. As Kelly says in his biography, ""He [CarÃªme] would disclose the minutiae of his professional lifeâ¦ and the menus, guests and ingredients that made up his working days. But about his personal life he revealed nothing.""
What is true to the era is the depiction of the aristocratic kitchens he worked in, his small army of staff, and their fevered preparations for royal banquets. He's seen in the series organising a meal for Napoleon Bonaparte, and in real life he was responsible for the Emperor's wedding cake. CarÃªme's ability to sugar-sculpt led to extraordinary creations in the shape of classical lyres and Venetian gondolas, all carefully sketched out on paper first by the chef himself. But that wasn't all he was capable of, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University.
""He helped establish a routine for how kitchens were run,"" Freedman tells the BBC. ""He also defined dishes and the repertoire of sauces, what was considered to go with what food, what kind of garnishes would be standard, and the kind of multi-course dining that would come to be characteristic [of haute cuisine]. And as his original metier was confectionery and sugar sculpting, even having a centrepiece of sculpted food is owed to CarÃªme.""
While some of the real-life recipes in his cookbooks still sound mouthwatering (Kelly mentions an orange flower and pink champagne jelly), others, such as a stuffed boar's head, might seem strange to today. But Bourboulon says that, above all, he wanted to make the chef himself accessible to a modern audience.
Bourboulon, responsible for two successful film adaptations of Alexandre Dumas's historical novel The Three Musketeers, tells the BBC that he wanted to avoid ""the usual period drama style"" in this story.
""I really wanted to bring a bit of sexiness, rock 'n' roll attitude, and a modern twist for all the main characters, especially CarÃªme,"" he says. ""And Benjamin Voisin is like this in real life.""
Voisin says their idea of the chef was that he had ""a Mick Jagger aspect to him. It's really what attracted me"".
""I love looking to the historical story of CarÃªme, but this rock star element, that kind of Lenny Kravitz look he has, plus the idea the show gives about his attitude to life, is really important. Maybe that's why Martin came to me to talk about playing him. I also love the story of this young man trying to find his place in society.""
The historical CarÃªme's stellar career might well have given him a swagger; he was known as ""the King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings"". He's often credited asÂ a founder of French gastronomy and ofÂ Grande CuisineÂ (classic French cuisine which was at its most lavish during the 19th Century).
However, according toÂ Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University, he might not even be France's first celebrity chef. The FrenchmanÂ Guillaume Tirel, known as ""Taillevent"", is famous for cooking for French kings during his lifetime (1310-95), and wrote a cookbook that still survives, The Viandier. SeveralÂ restaurantsÂ still bear his name.
CarÃªme's status is, he says, ""a celebrity chef of modern Europe, but still almost the last of a kind. He lived still in the time of the courts and chefs finding aristocratic patrons. He doesn't have a restaurant or interact with ordinary people, [and] his tremendous number of cookbooks aren't directed towards amateurs, but towards other chefs.
""So he's a transitional point to the purely modern celebrity chef, who are celebrities in the sense of media exposure, their television presence or just their ability to be a character and to run a restaurant.""
The young CarÃªme's turnaround in life was remarkable. Historian Ian Kelly describes him in his biography, CarÃªme: The First Celebrity Chef (which inspired the series) as one of multiple children in a family from one of Paris's worst slums. By 1792, around the same time thatÂ  the ""Reign of Terror"" would begin in the French Revolution (a period of state-sanctioned violence and executions) he had been abandoned by his parents but was taken in by a cook, and then apprenticed to a notable pÃ¢tissier, Sylvain Bailly. While still a very young man, he was hired by one of the most famous politicians of the Napoleonic era: Prince Charles Maurice Talleyrand-PÃ©rigord, known as Talleyrand.
Even if the real CarÃªme didn't dabble in espionage, Bourboulon points out that the chef's culinary brilliance would have been exploited as a display of power by his employers, and that food would have been as much a part of diplomacy during the early 19th Century as the modern state banquet is now.
""We know that CarÃªme worked for Prince of Talleyrand and for Napoleon,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's so French to share the menu, the food, and use the quality of the food to help diplomatic relationships, and historically, they really did do this. There's an example at the end of the first episode, when CarÃªme brings in a dessert for Napoleon and an English diplomat seated at the same table. And it's exactly how we imagine it would have been done during that time.""
Politics isn't the only display of passion in the narrative either, or as Bourboulon says, ""Love is as important in the lives of French people, possibly more so"". The visuals directly link the food CarÃªme cooks with sensuality; the camera lingers over the dishes, while red fruit drips over the title sequence. The series even starts with CarÃªme licking cream off his love interest Henriette, played by Lyna Khoudri.
""The parallel between the two types of pleasure is there in the series,"" Voisin says. ""Hands are involved in both cooking and the pleasures of the flesh, that's the connection.""
The link between French food and sensuality are linked was certainly there in CarÃªme's Paris. Ian Kelly describes how the post-Revolution capital ""had become the City of Light â and the capital of food"". The talk around the young CarÃªme, he says, would have been ""of philosophy, fashion, food and sex: what the world has come to expect from Paris"".
CarÃªme's fame grew across Europe because of his celebrity clientele, but he also benefited from France's growing interest in gastronomy as culture (he was also a contemporary of gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, celebrated for writing about the art of eating) and the idea that French cuisine was superior because of the sensuality of its people, Paul Freedman says.
""I think it goes back to the image that France continues to have today as pleasure-loving, as sophisticated, not merely gorging themselves or getting drunk, but [possessed of] a kind of sensuality that is cultivated in the sense it's tasteful and distinguished,"" he tells the BBC.
A French chef, he explains, would become necessary as a status symbol for many aristocrats of the 19th and 20th Century. ""One of the biggest examples in literature is PG Wodehouse writing about one of Bertie Wooster's aunts, Dahlia, living in terror that her temperamental French chef, Anatole, would quit.""
The era of the celebrity restaurant chef was ushered in by CarÃªme's growing fame, and the cookbooks he wrote, according to Professor Nathalie Cooke, the author of Tastes and Traditions: A Journey Through Menu History. Before the French Revolution, restaurants existed in limited form in Paris, but most served only soup. Their proliferation, Cooke tells the BBC, was born from ""economic disaster"".
""Imagine you're an aspiring young chef and you're working in Paris in the late 18th Century, and they've beheaded Marie Antoinette, and they're getting rid of all those jobs that you've aspired to, cooking for royalty and the aristocracy,"" she says. ""That's why the restaurant culture grew: these very skilled chefs needed to make money and find an audience during economic turbulence, and in a post-royalty age. That's also why CarÃªme wrote cookbooks: he was establishing himself in this new age of print media, but also, by addressing his work to other chefs, he was training a new breed of chef that was going to serve a larger audience instead of just royalty.""
A later French celebrity chef who dominated European food culture, Auguste Escoffier, (1846-1935) â who ran restaurants at the Ritz hotels in Europe, and at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Club in London â ""is really CarÃªme's heir,"" Cooke says.
""Escoffier really becomes famous when he decides to write down formal French cooking methods,"" she explains. ""He was able to achieve CarÃªme's vision [of making recipes accessible to other chefs] in a way that CarÃªme could not, because CarÃªme was living in the age of the birth of restaurant culture, which was only just developing and only in Paris. Escoffier took it to London too."" (CarÃªme did spend time in England, serving the then Prince Regent, later George IV, but although he cooked for Tsar Alexander of Russia in Paris, he refused to move there and take a job.)
The emergence of TV and radio (and later internet) in the 20th Century has meant that the celebrity chef has become an international phenomenon, not just confined to those writing cookbooks or running restaurants, but open to all those with a knack for connecting with their audience. The most famous chef of the television era, Julia Child, (portrayed by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie and Julia) was an American who had lived in Paris, and a devotee of French cooking. She even received the Antonin CarÃªme Medal for excellence, although this is a US, not a French, honour.
In another nod to modernity, the young CarÃªme in the series is also shown taking part in a chef's competition, normalised now by the growth of shows such as Iron Chef, MasterChef, and The Great British Bake Off (which streams internationally as The Great British Baking Show.) While the latter's ""Showstopper"" category might trace its ancestry back to CarÃªme's own sugar sculptures of the 19th Century, the first modern professional event of this kind for chefs started in 1983, when another chef, Paul Bocuse, established the Bocuse D'Or, in Lyon, France.
But now that TV shows, podcasting and social media also allow skilled amateurs to become celebrities, Paul Freedman says there are characteristics of how he discerns a truly ""celebrity"" chef
""My definition in books and articles that I've written is that the contemporary celebrity chef is distinguished by being regarded as a genius or an artist, [as opposed to] people who are [just] excellent at their craft. The Frenchman Paul Bocuse would be the first celebrity chef according to that definition, in the 1980s. Even before he invents dishes, he created the ethos of the chef as genius, and a version of a creative artist. So the celebrity chefs of our era are excellent at their craft, but Ferran AdriÃ , who was at El Bulli, or RenÃ© Redzepi of Noma, or Heston Blumenthal in Britain are all [also] creative geniuses, or at least that's how they're presented.""
There is though, a direct line traceable from their creations, and their kitchens, to those of Antonin CarÃªme â and not just because some of them might still wear a Toque. Bourboulon hopes that this new portrayal of the chef, nearly 200 years after he died, will give his legacy new attention.
""Although CarÃªme's name is quite famous in France, it could be even more famous, I think,"" he says. ""I would love people to rediscover, or just discover, what he did, how this young man brought all his talents to the tables of these powerful men like Napoleon. His life is a really exciting thing to mix together â food, love and politics.""
CarÃªme premieres globally on Apple TV+ from April 30, 2025.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4rvg04xvo,Katy Perry felt 'battered and bruised' by backlash,"Singer Katy Perry has admitted feeling ""battered and bruised"" by the backlash following her recent space trip, but reassured fans she is OK and would ""keep looking to the light"".
Writing two weeks after the much-derided Blue Origin voyage, which saw her take an 11-minute flight with five other women, the US star said the ""online world"" had tried to make her a ""human PiÃ±ata"".
Her comments came after fans paid for a billboard in New York to show their support for her ahead of her world tour.
Responding to a fan account that posted a video of the billboard, Perry said she was ""so grateful"" for her fans, adding they were ""in this beautiful and wild journey together"".
Perry has been one of pop's most successful singers over the past two decades, but the narrative around her has become more negative in the past year.
A poorly received album was accompanied by a lead single, Woman's World, which had a music video which many viewed as regressive.
She was then criticised for her part in Jeff Bezos's all-female Blue Origin space flight, during which she sang Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World to her fellow passengers, and held up the setlist for her new tour to an in-flight camera.
Some commentators said it was ""tone deaf"" for celebrities to be taking part in such a fleeting and expensive trip at a time of economic struggle.
However, singer Lily Allen apologised this week for ""being mean"" about Perry, saying that although she disagreed with the flight, there was no need to join the ""pile on"" against the singer.
Some fans showed their support for Perry by clubbing together to pay for a digital billboard message in New York's Times Square for 24 hours.
A Brazillian fan account on Instagram explained fans had done it to ""remind her that she is never alone; our love for her is boundless, unwavering, and eternal"".
""We're so proud of you and your magical journey and we love you to the moon and back.
""Know that you are safe, seen and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.""
Perry left a comment expressing her gratitude, telling fans: ""I love you guys and have grown up together with you and am so excited to see you all over the world this year!
""Please know I am OK, I have done a lot [of] work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me.""
She said she is ""not perfect"", but rather on a ""human journey playing the game of life with an audience of many and sometimes I fall"".
""But I get back up and go on and continue to play the game and somehow through my battered and bruised adventure I keep looking to the light and in that light a new level unlocks.""
She added: ""When the 'online' world tries to make me a human PiÃ±ata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed.""
The singer, whose hits include Roar, Firework and I Kissed A Girl, has just started a world tour, which will run until December and visit the US, Canada, South America, Canada, Europe and the United Arab Emirates.
Perry said she was looking forward to ""seeing your faces every night, singing in unison, reading your notes, feeling your warmth"".",Steven McIntosh,6 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w82gr0dlwo,Major Gianni Versace exhibition to open in London,"A major exhibition of Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace's creations is to be staged in London this summer.
The show will feature more than 450 original pieces, including outfits worn by Princess Diana, Kate Moss, Sir Elton John, Naomi Campbell and George Michael.
Gianni Versace Retrospective will open at Arches London Bridge on 16 July, with organisers saying it would ""give visitors a kaleidoscopic view of the 90s"".
Versace was one of the most influential designers of his generation until he was murdered in 1997. After his death, his sister Donatella took over as creative director of the company.
The announcement of the exhibition's London launch comes a month after Donatella announced she would be stepping down from her position.
Dario Vitale takes over her role this month, but Donatella Versace will remain an ambassador for the company.
Previous iterations of the retrospective exhibition have visited the Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Sweden and Spain, but organisers said it had never been shown in the form it will take in London.
The show has been updated and expanded for the UK, showcasing 21 seasons of Versace's designs, while a new feature - Gianni Versace in London - will be added.
Curator Karl von der Ahe said the exhibition's launch in London felt ""especially meaningful"", describing the city as ""one of the world's fashion capitals"".
""Gianni Versace's bold, unapologetic vision revolutionised fashion, and this city - so rich in creativity and cultural influence - provides the perfect stage to celebrate his legacy,"" he said.
Organisers said the exhibition would feature the largest collection of vintage Versace designs ever to be displayed in the UK, and would also include accessories, sketches, photographs and interviews alongside the outfits.
Liz Koravos, managing director of Arches London Bridge, described Versace as a ""genius of his time"".
""Gianni Versace ties to so much in modern culture and his legacy is enduring, a mark of a talented designer,"" she said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crm3rjede4xo,Food authors say Australian influencer copied their recipes,"Two cookbook authors have accused TikTok influencer Brooke Bellamy of copying their recipes.
Nagi Maehashi, the Australian founder of popular food website RecipeTin Eats, said Ms Bellamy's cookbook contains recipes with ""word-for-word similarities to mine"".
Ms Bellamy, who owns the popular Brooki Bakehouse, has rejected her allegations, saying her book contains ""100 recipes I have created over many years"". One of those in question was created before Ms Maehashi published hers, she claims.
Hours after Ms Maehashi's raised her allegations, US author Sally McKenney also accused Ms Bellamy of plagiarising her vanilla cake recipe.
Ms Maehashi said that a reader pointed out what she described as ""remarkable similarities"" between her caramel slice recipe and the one in Ms Bellamy's best-selling cookbook Bake with Brooki.
She said she later also discovered similarities between her baklava recipe and Ms Bellamy's, offering a side-by-side comparison in a statement on RecipeTin Eats.
Ms Maehashi is the author of two cookbooks and her website, which she started in 2014, attracts a monthly readership of 45 million page views.
Ms Bellamy is the owner of three Brooki Bakehouse branches, all in Queensland, which were set up in 2022. She is also a popular baker on TikTok with two million followers.
Ms Maehashi said she had contacted Ms Bellamy's publisher, Penguin Random House Australia, adding that they ""brought in lawyers and resorted to what felt to me legal intimidation"".
""It feels like a blatant exploitation of my work. To see them plagiarised and used in a book for profit, without permission, and without credit, doesn't just feel unfair,"" she added.
Ms Maehashi has retained her own legal counsel and has written to both Ms Bellamy and Penguin.
Bake with Brooki was published in October 2024 and has since sold A$4.6m (Â£2.1m; $2.9) worth of copies.
Penguin and Ms Bellamy have both strenuously denied the accusations, with the publisher issuing a response to Ms Maehashi confirming ""the recipes in the BWB Book were written by Brooke Bellamy"".
Despite maintaining no wrongdoing, Ms Bellamy said she offered to take down the recipes from future reprints ""to prevent further aggravation"", and that this was communicated ""swiftly"" to Ms Maehashi.
She added that she had ""great respect for Nagi"", but has stood by her recipes in a series of Instagram stories.
""Recipe development in today's world is enveloped in inspiration from other cooks, cookbook authors, food bloggers and content creators,"" she said, adding that the ""willingness to share receipes"" is what she loves about baking.
Both Ms Maehashi's and Ms Bellamy's cookbooks have been shortlisted for this year's Australian Book Industry Awards.
Ms McKenney, who authors the website Sally's Baking Addiction, accused Ms Bellamy of copying her vanilla cake recipe, which is included in Ms Bellamy's cookbook and YouTube channel.
""Original receipe creators who put in the work to develop and test recipes deserve credit - especially in a best-selling cookbook,"" Ms McKenny wrote on Instagram.",Yang Tian,6 days ago,0

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dg2z399gyo,"Kneecap should give 'real apology', husband of murdered MP says","The husband of murdered MP Jo Cox has called on Kneecap to give a ""real apology"" after footage emerged of the band allegedly calling for MPs to be killed.
It comes after the band defended themselves and posted an apology to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess in a statement on X on Monday night.
The band said that ""an extract of footage, deliberately taken out of all context, is now being exploited and weaponised, as if it were a call to action"".
The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""They should apologise. I think you have seen what they have said, I think it is half-hearted"".
Brendan Cox, whose wife was killed in June 2016, said this was ""only half an apology"".
Speaking on Tuesday, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said that ""what they're reported to have said is a total disgrace"".
""I hope that everybody involved - not just the band but also those involved surrounding them and those involved in events - also take some responsibility on this and look very seriously at the consequences of these kinds of remarks, not just what's been said,"" she told Times Radio.
Speaking in the House of Commons, Tory MP Mark Francois described it as a ""crocodile tears apology"" and said the group should not be allowed to play Glastonbury in light of the ongoing police investigation.
Home Office Minister Dan Jarvis joined condemnation of the band in the Commons and urged the organisers of the Glastonbury festival to ""think very carefully about who is invited there later this year"".
TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Harris said he could understand why it was important Kneecap clarify any comments attributed to them.
""We need to get back to the focus here being on the fact that there are children in Gaza dying. There are children in Gaza being killed,"" Harris told the Irish Cabinet.
Speaking on Radio Ulster's Talkback programme on Tuesday, Mr Cox said: ""It's fine to say that you're sorry for it, but the way that they have actually spoken about it is to suggest that it's a conspiracy, that they have been targeted unfairly and for me that then doesn't come across as unfortunately particularly genuine.""
In their statement, Kneecap said they rejected ""any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. Ever"".
""To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt,"" the band added.
The footage of Kneecap is being assessed by counter-terrorism police and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for prosecution.
On Tuesday, the Cornwall-based Edens Sessions announced that the Kneecap show scheduled for 4 July has been cancelled.
During an interview with RTÃ's Prime Time on Tuesday night, Kneecap's manager Daniel Lambert was asked if he was worried about Glastonbury, where the band are due to perform this summer.
He said: ""It's not for us to worry, it's for us to have the strength and conviction that we did the right thing.""
Earlier, the daughter of Conservative MP Sir David Amess, Katie Amess, who was stabbed to death at a constituency surgery in 2021, said the rap group should apologise.
Speaking to BBC News NI on Tuesday, Katie Amess said she had not heard from Kneecap directly.
""They definitely need to reach out to the people they're apologising to, otherwise you're just apologising generically. It would be nice to hear from them directly,"" Ms Amess said.
""The apology, it just seems to blame everybody else, it doesn't really take any accountability. I think we just need to let the authorities do the work they are employed to do now and see where that goes,"" she said.
Ms Amess added: ""It would be good if they could actually be sincere with the apology and actually try and make amends on a human level rather than on a social media level.""
She said her offer to meet with the band still stands.
Mrs Cox, the former Batley and Spen MP, was killed by far-right terrorist Thomas Mair on 16 June 2016, a week before the EU referendum vote.
""The apology that they've given I don't think has grappled enough with the gravity of what they said,"" said Mr Cox.
""When you lose someone that close to you, that never goes away and that every single day that is part of your life. It's the real sense that they are missing out.""
Mr Cox added: ""It wasn't a throwaway remark. It was part of a conversation that they were having about politics, and it was a very clear incitement to violence.
""I doubt that they really wanted someone to go out and kill a Tory MP, but if you say those wordsâ¦ then the risk of someone acting on those words is there.""
Mr Cox said the band needed to ""deeply reflect"" on whether they want to be associated with calls for violence.
""I think a more fulsome reflection on the mistake that they've made, if it indeed is a mistake, I think is necessary.""
Mr Cox added that ""in order to be confident"" that the band is ""genuinely remorseful"" and not ""just trying to save their bookings or their tour, I think they need to grapple more fundamentally with it"".
Mr Cox said ""using the plight of people in Gaza in the way that they have done and to say that this is an attempt to shut them up on those issues is not acceptable"".
""Whatever your democratic politics, whether you're a Tory, Labour, Sinn FÃ©in, Ulster Unionist, whatever, there is no excuse for incitement of violence against members of parliament or against civilians, and that should be something that we can all agree on,"" he added.
In their statement, Kneecap said: ""They want you to believe words are more harmful than genocide.""
They condemned ""all attacks on civilians, always"" and added that the band ""do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah"".
Daniel Lambert told RTÃ's Prime Time that ""we're in the space now of moral hysteria and moral outrage and you've a band being held to a higher moral account than politicians who are ignoring international law"".
He said that children in Gaza were ""starving to death and we're spending six or seven days talking about Kneecap"".
He claimed there was a concerted campaign, adding: ""It's not about Kneecap, or something that Kneecap may or may not have said, it's solely about deplatforming artists.""
Both Hamas and Hezbollah, are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.
Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages.
Israel launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed at least 52,243 Palestinians - mostly civilians - according to the latest figures released by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.
Last week, Sharon Osbourne called for the band's US work visas to be revoked.
It came after their performances at Coachella, an annual music festival in California, where they ended their set with pro-Palestinian messages.
Writing on social media, the TV personality and America's Got Talent judge said the hip-hop trio ""took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements"".
Kneecap hit back at the visa call, and when asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: ""Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.""
The visas held by the band members are understood to no longer be valid and they are in the process of securing a new sponsor ahead of their sell-out October tour in North America.
Kneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise.
The group was formed in 2017 by three friends who go by the stage names of Mo Chara, MÃ³glaÃ­ Bap and DJ PrÃ³vaÃ­.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y7mxzn9nlo,The Alarm singer Mike Peters dies aged 66,"Mike Peters, front man of Welsh rockers The Alarm and a long-standing cancer campaigner and fundraiser, has died aged 66.
His band was formed in 1981 in Rhyl, Denbighshire, out of the punk era and had a top 20 hit, Sixty Eight Guns, two years later.
It typified an anthemic style of song but their unpretentious and down-to-earth approach earned loyal followings on both sides of the Atlantic.
Peters lived with blood cancer for 30 years, following his diagnosis of lymphoma in 1995, and later having chronic lymphocytic leukaemia twice.
He was born in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, and lived in Dyserth with his wife of 39 years, Jules - who had fought her own cancer battle - and their sons Dylan, 20 and Evan, 18.
He was awarded the MBE in 2019 for his services to cancer care.
Peters - who had worked in the computer department for Kwik Save supermarket - had started the band The Toilets in Rhyl in 1977, after seeing the Sex Pistols play in Chester.
After various changes of line-up, notably the introduction of guitarist Dave Sharp, and changes of name, The Alarm played their first gig in Prestatyn in 1981.
They would go on to sell an estimated five million records and also become the first Welsh musicians since Tom Jones and Bonnie Tyler to crack America.
Thanks to a support slot with U2 on their 1983 US tour, The Alarm gained a transatlantic following - not an inconsiderable achievement.
Their debut album Declaration was released in 1984. As well as Sixty Eight Guns, it also included another favourite, Blaze of Glory.
The band had honed their live performances by extensive touring, and were also reliable ""go-to"" support choice for big names - which included Bob Dylan, Queen and U2 again - including an appreciative crowd at Cardiff's National Stadium in 1987.
Despite their travels, The Alarm still had strong bonds with their homeland and Peters was able to live quietly in north Wales.
The band also released a Welsh-language version of their 1989 album Change, called Newid.
Peters announced from the stage in London that he was quitting The Alarm in 1991 but continued to work with The Poets Of Justice, the line-up including his wife Jules.
In 1999, Peters worked with The Cult guitarist Billy Duffy forming a band called Coloursound.
Duffy said he felt the Welshman ""inspired millions of people"" during his career.
""(Music) was his lifeblood. Everything was an inspiration for him to express his feelings through music,"" he added.
He reformed The Alarm in 2000 and also worked as the singer for Big Country for a couple of years from 2011.
The Alarm has sold more than five million albums and had 16 UK Top 50 singles.
Television presenter, and former The Alarm roadie, Gareth Jones said Mike Peters has been the ""most significant person"" in his life.
He even gave him his nickname Gaz Top, which has stuck to this day.
""I would have never had a career if it wasn't for him and it's a hard day to know that he's not around anymore,"" he said.
Jones said that The Alarm frontman had a positive effect on ""everyone"" around him.
""We loved together, we drank together, we played rock 'n' roll together,"" he added.
""We'll always be connected.""
In 2004, as a humorous stunt aimed at the music industry and its obsession with youth, Peters released a single called 45 RPM - a retro-punk song - under the pseudonym of The Poppy Fields.
He pretended his group were teenagers from Chester, who mimed along to the video for the song. It entered the top 30.
The storyline was perfect to be translated into a film, Vinyl - directed by Sara Sugarman, incidentally from Rhyl, and an Alarm fan.
Peters was first diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1995 and described his relationship with the cancer over the next two decades as like ""fighting a war"".
At the end of 2005, the singer was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, which returned in 2015 before he went into remission.
He co-founded the Love Hope Strength Foundation alongside his wife to help recruit bone marrow donors at live music shows.
It also involved Peters and fellow musicians taking treks to the Himalayas, to peaks including Mount Kilimanjaro and Yr Wyddfa, also known as Snowdon, in his native Wales.
The charity's director, Kirsty Thomson, called him a ""brilliant advocate"" of the NHS, adding that he ""loved life like nobody else I know"".
The 2007 concert was billed the ""world's highest"", watched by 3m online. In 2017, his Big Busk involved a walk between cancer wards at each north Wales hospital and ended on the summit of Snowdon.
He would take his message to Washington and Westminster.
Peters also filmed a documentary about his cancer fight and one with his wife Jules for BBC Wales about a year in their lives and her recovery from breast cancer, While We Still Have Time.
Peters joined Bruce Springsteen on stage at charity concert in 2014 and musicians who had joined The Alarm for impromptu appearances ranged from Bono to Neil Young.
Peters was affable and approachable and tireless in both his campaigning - and in continuing to tour with his music across Europe and the United States, as well as writing new material.
There were also annual weekend events in Llandudno - The Gathering - which brought together fans from all over to celebrate the music of Peters and The Alarm.
In March 2018, part of a tour of Germany was postponed after Peters suffered an allergic reaction to his medication.
In 2025, he became ill again when his Richter syndrome - an aggressive form of lymphoma - returned.
He said it would have killed him within two months if left untreated, adding music had kept him alive since his latest diagnosis.
Peters said he hoped a highly specialised therapy which ""re-programmes"" his immune cells would lead to a ""cancer free life"".
""It was devastating because it all happened in an instant,"" he said.
""There was no chance to even think about it.""
In 2018, he told Guitar World magazine that his ""simple message"" was ""to stay alive and appreciate every second you've got"".
""Live right up to the last breath and stay positive about the world, your family and the environment you live in.""",Catriona Aitken,7 days ago,0

https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250429-thunderbolts-film-review,Thunderbolts* is 'the greatest Marvel in years' âââââ,"The latest in the superhero franchise ""is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun"", with a ""charismatic"" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber.
Ever since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end.
The Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called ""Infinity Saga"" â the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years.
The key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods.
There's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong â but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. In various ways, they are all connected to one of Marvel's most memorably slippery villains, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a businesswoman with all the brittle, condescending confidence that you might expect from the reliably excellent star of Seinfeld and Veep.
De Fontaine, it seems, has been behind several superhero-related black ops. Now that her political opponents are closing in on her, she decides to destroy all the evidence of her shady undertakings, including the people who carried them out. And so it is that Yelena and the others switch from trying to kill each other to trying to keep each other alive. They become a sort-of team, but they aren't sure whether or not to call themselves the Thunderbolts, so the asterisk in the title signifies that it's just a placeholder name until they can think of something better.
One small snag is that most of the characters' back stories are in other films, and in a TV series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, rather than in Thunderbolts* itself. Another snag is that the gang's pursuit by De Fontaine's troops accounts for the majority of the film's running time, so there aren't many set pieces that haven't been in the trailers already. On the other hand, superhero films are rarely so tightly focused, and rarely progress so seamlessly from scene to scene, with no pausing for breath, and no sudden jumps to different ends of the Earth. Captain America: Brave New World, which came out in February, was similar to Thunderbolts* in that it revolved around Washington DC politics, and followed on from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. But that film was a messy sprawl, whereas this one is so neatly plotted that you can get the gist and enjoy the ride whether you're a Marvel nerd or not.
More like this:
â¢ A combat epic that 'does what film does best'
â¢ Disney's Snow White has a major 'identity crisis'
â¢ Mickey 17 is a 'disappointment'
The underlying issues in Thunderbolts* are just as focused as the narrative. The characters all have to deal with the shame and trauma of their troubled pasts â and this theme is there from the opening scene to the requisite Final Battle, which is slightly rushed, but stylishly surreal enough to recall two mind-bending films written by Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In between, the characters' guilt is explored in some touching and surprisingly brutal sequences, as well as in some sharply-scripted, briskly-edited and skilfully-performed comic scenes.
At both ends of the spectrum, Pugh delivers a performance which would win her awards if it weren't in a superhero film. She delivers her punchlines with expert timing, especially when she is bickering and bantering with Red Guardian. But she can also radiate raw emotion â and all while maintaining a decent Russian accent and cartwheeling through her acrobatic fight scenes. When it comes down to it, that's why Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as Pugh at its centre.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o,"Kneecap: Rap group are no strangers to controversy, but is this time different?","To their fans, west Belfast rave-rap group Kneecap are a rowdy, subversive force of nature. But to many others, their inflammatory political messages make them dangerous and amoral.
Following in the footsteps of anti-establishment rap groups like NWA and Run The Jewels, the trio present themselves as dissident underdogs, giving a voice to the oppressed.
Their lyrics, delivered in a rapid-fire mix of English and Irish, cover everything from drug-fuelled parties to their desire to free Northern Ireland from British rule.
On stage and on film, they've created a riotous experience that's thrilled Glastonbury, won a Bafta award, and inspired what's been called an ""Irish language revolution"".
But their rising profile has resulted in increased scrutiny and anger about their political statements.
During an incendiary performance at the Coachella music festival in California earlier this month, they described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide. As a result, they've been called anti-Semitic and branded ""terrorist sympathisers"".
Now, footage from two previous gigs is being assessed by counter-terrorism police in the UK.
In one, the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting ""up Hamas, up Hezbollah"". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.
Kneecap have responded with a statement, saying they ""do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah"".
They claimed that footage where they appeared to say ""the only good Tory is a dead Tory"" had been ""taken out of all context"", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.
But Cox's widower Brendan was unimpressed, calling their statement ""only half an apology"". Downing Street agreed, describing their words as ""half-hearted"" and ""completely unacceptable"".
The row was discussed in the House of Commons on Tuesday, with Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp calling their comments ""evil"".
It isn't the band's first brush with controversy. If anything, controversy is in their DNA. But this time, the fallout threatens to engulf their career, with venues and festivals under pressure to cancel the band's gigs.
To understand how we got here, here's Kneecap's origin story.
Kneecap were formed in 2017 by rappers Mo Chara (Liam Ãg Ã hAnnaidh) and MÃ³glaÃ­ Bap (Naoise Ã CaireallÃ¡in), alongside beatmaker DJ PrÃ³vaÃ­ (JJ Ã Dochartaigh).
Their career was sparked by an incident in which MÃ³glaÃ­ and a friend were out spray-painting the day before a march in support of an Irish Language Act.
MÃ³glaÃ­ had written ""cearta"" (rights) on a bus stop when police arrived. He fled but his friend was arrested, and spent a night in the cells after refusing to speak English to the police.
They documented the incident in the song C.E.A.R.T.A, which they released ""just for the craic. No plans for after,"" Mo Chara told the Irish Times.
To their surprise, the song was playlisted by Irish broadcaster RTÃ, only to be removed after listeners complained about drug references in the lyrics.
After that, their output was sporadic. The mixtape 3CAG (slang for the drug MDMA) arrived in 2018, followed by the singles H.O.O.D and MAM - dedicated to MÃ³glaÃ­'s mother, who had died by suicide.
Those early records showcased an ability to move between sharp satire, tender vulnerability and the experiences of Northern Ireland's ""ceasefire babies"" - the generation born around the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.
Talking to the BBC in 2023, the band said they were inspired by US bands like Dead Prez, NWA and Wu Tang Clan.
""Rebel music in Ireland has all the same sort of ideas as hip-hop in America. A community that's oppressed, using songs to revolt in some way,"" said Mo Chara.
They perform most of their lyrics in Irish, drawing inspiration from a burgeoning underground scene of ""as Gaeilge"" rap acts like ImlÃ© and Seamus Barra (the latter was even name-checked in their debut single).
""The only way that Irish history and mythology was passed down was orally. I think that's why it's important for us to have that intertwined with our music,"" MÃ³glaÃ­ Bap told Crack magazine last year.
Kneecap's lyrics frequently contain Republican slang and slogans. Even their name is a reference to the IRA's chosen method of punishment for alleged drug dealers during the Troubles.
The messaging has landed them in hot water before. DJ PrÃ³vaÃ­ lost his job as a teacher in 2020 after his school was alerted to a video of a concert where he'd painted ""Brits out"" on his buttocks.
Two years later, the band made headlines in Belfast after commissioning a mural of a burning police vehicle with a slogan criticising Northern Ireland's pre-Good Friday police force, the RUC.
Designed to promote a festival appearance, it was criticised by politicians across the  spectrum.
""Loathe to give the band more publicity,"" said Alliance leader Naomi Long, ""but as a community we need to start asking ourselves what messages we're sending out about the kind of future we want.""
The band have claimed their take on Republicanism is partially tongue-in-cheek - satirising the self-important sloganeering they grew up with.
""Republicanism is so vast, and on a spectrum,"" MÃ³glaÃ­ Bap told the New York Times. ""We like to toy with it. We like to take the irony on.""
Certainly, the band's gleeful celebration of drug culture puts them at odds with the old guard of the movement - but the band are serious about their desire for a unified Ireland.
""The British government has failed us for 100 years,"" Mo Charra told Vulture last year. ""It's not like this is a trial run. You've had enough time and it's failed.""
Kneecap's reputation grew in 2024 with the release of a film, also called Kneecap, which presented a semi-fictional, and often hilarious, account of their rise to fame.
Starring the band as themselves, with Michael Fassbender as MÃ³glaÃ­'s father, the movie won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival, with critics praising its ""punky defiance"" and ""unruly energy"", and was nominated for six Baftas.
It was followed by their debut album, Fine Art, a concept record that threw fans into a hedonistic night out with the band at a fictional Belfast pub called The Rutz.
With songs that skewered the music industry and addressed Northern Ireland's mental health crisis, it showcased a band with more to say than their reputation suggested.
Still, in an era of sanitised, apolitical music, Kneecap's instincts for provocation and protest were inevitably going to draw attention.
Pro-Palestinian chants have featured in their gigs since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza war. But when they brought those messages to Coachella, they faced a new level of scrutiny and criticism.
Kneecap weren't the only people who uttered pro-Palestinian messages at the festival, but accusations of genocide and video screens that declared ""F*** Israel"" were seen by some as crossing a line into hate speech.
The organisers of Israel's Nova Music Festival, where more than 360 people were killed by Hamas in 2023, said Kneecap's message ""deeply hurt"" their community, and invited the band to visit an exhibition about the victims and survivors â ""not to shame or silence but to connect"".
Others took a more strident tone. A music industry group called The Creative Community For Peace, along with Sharon Osbourne, called on the US government to revoke the band's visas.
The band's manager defended their actions. Citing Hamas-run health ministry figures that more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed since the start of the war, Daniel Lambert characterised criticism of the Coachella performance as ""moral hysteria"".
""If somebody's hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by,"" he told RTÃ1. ""But it's really important to speak truth and thankfully, the lads are not afraid to do that.
""They have the bravery and the conviction, given where they've come from in a post-conflict society, to stand up for what's right, and [they] are willing to do that despite the fact that it may harm their career.""
Right now, their career is under intense pressure.
Since Coachella, Kneecap have received death threats and have been dropped by their booking agents in the US, which could jeopardise their visas ahead of a forthcoming sold-out tour.
The discovery of the concert video in which the band shouted ""the only good Tory is a dead Tory"" and advised the audience to ""kill your local MP"" shocked the political establishment, with counter-terrorism police reviewing the footage.
In Scotland, First Minister John Swinney has called for the band to be dropped from Glasgow's TRNSMT festival, saying their comments had ""crossed a line"".
The Eden Project in Cornwall has cancelled their gig in July, and others, including Glastonbury, are under pressure to call off appearances.
Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said on Tuesday: ""There is an ongoing live police investigation, so the government would urge the organisers at the Glastonbury Festival to think very carefully about who is invited to perform there later this year.""
At the same time, the criticism has only increased the profile of an act who were essentially an underground act a month ago.
This week, Kneecap's album entered the iTunes chart in Italy, Brazil and Germany for the first time.",Mark Savage,7 days ago,0

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg25k199geo,Philip Pullman 'relieved' to finish Lyra's final book,"Author Philip Pullman has revealed details of the sixth and final book in his series about Lyra Silvertongue, the character at the heart of His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust trilogies.
The Rose Field will be published on 23 October, and will follow his heroine's story up to her early 20s.
She was 11 when she was introduced in the best-selling and award-winning first His Dark Materials book, Northern Lights, in 1995.
Pullman, 78, said he was ""relieved"" to have ""come out of the end alive and able to see it being made into a book and published"".
The Rose Field refers to a magnetic or gravitational field, and was mentioned in the opening chapters of Northern Lights, when scholars at Lyra's Oxford college secretly discussed a mysterious phenomenon called Dust.
""In this final book, Lyra is on the verge of discovering what Dust is and what it means, and the story is about how that happens,"" the author told BBC Radio 4's The World At One.
The story also deals with the nature of imagination, the former Oxford English teacher said. ""I've got a view of what the imagination is, and Lyra discovers what she thinks the imagination is, so we're talking about that as well.""

Beyond the world of Dust and daemons, this book has been influenced by real-life global events, including the rise of tech billionaires, Pullman revealed.
""It has become clear to me in the last 10 years that the influence of money and the power of the billionaire class, the power of the tech industry and all those extractive things like oil and gas and so on, have a much deeper effect on the world than I had thought,"" he said.
""And in thinking about that, and seeing the way the story's gone, and seeing what Lyra has to face and endure and decide about, I've thought about it more deeply myself.
""The world has changed enormously. We're either at the end of a long period of American power, which will end, presumably, like the end of any empire, in chaos, destructiveness, and then the gradual coming together of nations in a new form. That'll be interesting to watch, if I'm still alive to watch it.
""But we're also at a time when we can look back, with the resources of the internet and so on... We're at an age where we've got the wisdom of centuries and millennia to draw on. It'll be interesting to see if we do or we don't. I suspect that most of us won't, but some of us might.""
The Rose Field comes six years after the publication of the previous book in The Book of Dust series.
The trilogy's first two books have sold 49 million copies around the world, publisher Midas said.
Pullman said he would now turn his attention to planning a memoir, which would be titled Before I Forget.
""I've been talking for quite a while about writing a memoir before I forget everything, and that's something that's possibly on the horizon,"" he said.
""I was born in 1946 I was brought up as a child of the British Empire, which still existed then. And I've seen a very great number of changes, as everyone of my age has.
""There's nothing remarkable about that, but I've seen a lot of things that I loved, enjoyed, made me happy, made me excited in various ways. And I'd like to remember those and write them down, because I think it's a shame if they're not celebrated and remembered.""",Ian Youngs,7 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93g20z7943o,"Trainer prices will rise due to tariffs, says Adidas","Sportswear giant Adidas has warned import taxes imposed by President Donald Trump will lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers including the Gazelle and Samba.
""Since we currently cannot produce almost any of our products in the US, these higher tariffs will eventually cause higher costs for all our products for the US market,"" chief executive Bjorn Gulden said on Tuesday.
Clothing manufacturers are among the businesses hit hardest by tariffs as they source labour from countries such as China and Vietnam, which have faced steep levies from the US.
Adidas did not comment on how much prices would rise, but said the trade war had ""put a stop to"" an upgrade in its financial outlook.
Mr Gulden said it was ""currently impossible to quantify"" cost increases resulting from tariffs, ""or to conclude what impact this could have on the consumer demand for our products"".
""Given the uncertainty around the negotiations between the US and the different exporting countries, we do not know what the final tariffs will be. Therefore, we cannot make any 'final' decisions on what to do,"" he added.
Vietnam has become the global centre of athletic shoe manufacturing and it is subject to some of the most punishing US tariffs. Nike, Puma and Adidas all have large factory outlets in South East Asia.
Trump has introduced tariffs in a bid to bring manufacturing back to US shores. However companies such as Adidas say the US lacks factories with the specialised equipment to make running shoes and workers with the knowledge to operate them.
Vietnam faces some of the highest tariffs at 46%, although those levies are currently on hold for 90 days as countries try to negotiate better deals.
Mr Gulden said in a conference call with reporters that Adidas exported more products to the US to mitigate the impact of tariffs before they took effect. He said the company also re-routed products made in China meant for the US to other markets instead.
The company reported preliminary results last week showing its profits had almost doubled to â¬610m (Â£519m) in the first three months of the year, marking its strongest sales performance for the period in company history.
Sambas and its newly launched Taekwondo trainer saw strong demand, with sales growing in all markets outside the US.
""You could ironically say that not being so dependent on the US now is an advantage for us compared to maybe companies that are more American,"" he said, a remark pointing to its rival, Nike.
Adidas shares were largely unchanged in early Frankfurt trading on Tuesday. The stock had recovered most of its losses after some tariffs announced earlier this month were partially suspended.",Vishala Sri-Pathma,7 days ago,0

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9vw540zngo,Banksy's legacy amid steelworks loss fuels new play,"What happens to a town when the UK's most talked about artist leaves an unannounced drawing on a garage wall?
Season's Greetings, by the anonymous artist Banksy, appeared in Port Talbot in December 2018, days before Christmas, prompting a rush of visitors to swell the back lanes where the commentary on the town's famous steel industry now resided.
The drawing, across two walls at right angles, showed a boy playing joyously in a downfall of snow â but turn the corner and the viewer sees the ""snow"" is actually ash falling from a fire burning in a bin, echoing the larger plumes of smoke emitted day and night at the steelworks.
Now that event â and the wider story of the town's fate â has been turned into a play, Port Talbot Gotta Banksy, based entirely on transcripts of the townsfolk's response.
Tracy Harris and Paul Jenkins, south Wales-based playwrights, had worked together on a previous project using the same technique of verbatim speech, that time gathered from young people they were devising a show with, and were looking for ideas for another.
When they heard about the Banksy and went to visit, a chance conversation with a fellow director who said ""someone should write a play about this"" gave Paul ""one of those lightbulb moments,"" that the material might be right under their noses.
However neither anticipated that what began as a plan to capture the response to a singular event would grow into a six-year labour of love documenting the end of a 100-year way of life for a working-class community.
Paul said of Season's Greetings: ""It was a beautiful piece of art and we realised that the people in Port Talbot recognised that as well and they really, really loved it and took it into their hearts.""
""We were at the site every day, talking and listening to the community's opinions and feelings and responses to the Banksy, what they thought about the theme of it, the pollution, steelworks, all of that. And it just started there.""
A version of the play could have happened at an earlier point but then ""Covid happened"".
""And then by a stroke of luck or genius, the story kept developing,"" said Tracy.
There were the twists and turns with the artwork itself â first it was protected by security at the site, then bought by an English art collector to go on display in the town, with a promise it would always remain there.
That failed to happen and the piece was finally removed to an undisclosed location in England in February 2022.
But the other story which weaved into and over the Banksy was the devastating news that steel production as it had existed for most people's lifetimes would end.
And it was only when the works' blast furnace got switched off in September 2024 that Tracy and Paul finally decided it was time to stop gathering interviews and devise the play.
Over the course of six years the pair collected more than 100 hours of recordings that they have managed to boil down to a two-hour play.
""It's made it such a universal story now, much bigger than what we originally thought,"" said Tracy.
Paul added: ""When we started, we thought it was going to be a story about the Banksy, the first Banksy in Wales and what people thought of it.
""But of course it became much more about the theme of the Banksy, drawing attention to the pollution from the steelworks, and then of course when the threat to the steelworks [happened] it's become much more a gritty portrait of that community and their resilience.
""They were gifted the Banksy at Christmas â that was taken away from them. And now the blast furnaces, the industry that they've had for 100 years, although hopefully it is going to transition to green steel and an electric arc furnace, at the moment the blast furnaces have just been switched off.
""So there's this terrible sense of uncertainty hanging over the town. The pollution, the theme that Banksy highlighted, is gone, but at the cost of thousands and thousands of jobs in the town.""
Every word said on stage is an absolute reproduction of words spoken by real people. Six actors represent people Tracy and Paul went back to again and again over the years as well as a host of other voices.
Even their lines are not learned but delivered through headsets directly to the actors as they say them.
The tale is told in chronological order but from a wide range of differing perspectives, with some news reports and headlines added to help the audience understand the latest development where necessary.
One of the people represented in the show is a steelworker who's started spray painting, highlighting a type of transformation that has occurred within the town even as it faces the consequences of the loss of its industrial heritage.
Tracy said: ""Port Talbot's become the street art capital of Wales suddenly. Even though it's a sad story, it's also a story of hope because [the people] do bounce back.
""They've decided to make the town a colourful town and start spray painting everywhere.""
""The legacy of the Banksy is there's an incredible street art scene now. So many local artists, so many walls are covered in colour and amazing art,"" adds Paul.
""The colour of the town has changed. It's gone from being a grey, industrial town where the skies are full of smoke all the time to being a really colourful town.""
Doing the research for the play helped give voice to people who ""often have no say in what's happening"", but it also revealed to the pair the breadth of talent across the arts in Port Talbot.
""What's beautiful about this play is you see it from a community's point of view, and you see it from all those voices you would never normally hear, who would never get a chance to tell their side of the story and what that art meant to them and how important it was to their town,"" says Tracy.
""It's so poetic sometimes the way they describe it.""
Paul says at the start of the process they had assumed at some points they would have to write in some lines to join the pieces of the story together, but found that their interviewees had done it for them naturally.

Guernsey artist Tiffany Anna has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and said she sought to inspire people through her art.
Her exhibition is running at the JARO Gallery in St Helier in Jersey until 25 May.
She said: ""Even today I'm shocked that I actually have that many people following me and so many people message and say they have been inspired to pick up art againâ¦ I love inspiring people to do that because I feel it is such an important thing to be creative.""
Ms Anna previously worked as a photographer but it was during lockdown in 2020 when she asked her artist mother if she could borrow her brushes.
She said: ""I started with a bee. I thought it was the simplest thing to paint.""
""I painted a bee just for fun popped it on Facebook and someone asked if they could buy it.
""I think I gave my first one away for free but I bought another canvas, and then I just bought another and carried on and it literally hasn't stopped from there.""
Positivity is a major theme of her art and she seeks to make happy feel happy through the vibrant paintings she creates.
""I think in the world we live in nowâ¦ there's a lot of sad things going on and depressing things going on and people struggle with mental health. I feel that I love creating art that when you look at it you feel happy and if it makes one person smile, I've done my job.
""That's all I want to do in life, is make the world a happier place through art.""
""Painting is my therapy. If I'm feeling down I go to my studio I put my music on full blast I dance for a bit and I paint and it just cheers me up.""
""I genuinely wish more people with do this, or have access to do this so they also can feel how I feel when I paint.""

York Minster said the Talent Award would be open to artists working in various disciplines and ""at any stage of their career"".
Candidates are being asked to propose large-scale installations that interpret the minster's legacy through the themes of ""renewal and transformation"".
The winning entries are set to go on show for 10 months to mark the anniversary in 2027.
Immersive art shows in recent years have included the Phoenix exhibition, which marked 40 years since a devastating fire at the minster, and Colour and Light, which explored wildlife in York.
A spokesperson for the minster said: ""The Talent Awards are open to anyone anywhere in the world and are an opportunity to contribute to the ongoing narrative of a space that has stood as a centre of culture, craft, and community for nearly 1,400 years.""
Cherie Federico, who runs the annual Aesthetica short film festival in York, is working with the minster on the awards.
""We're especially interested in how artists can explore themes of water and baptism â powerful symbols of renewal and transformation,"" she said.
The Very Rev Dominic Barrington, Dean of York, added: ""No visitor to the minster leaves without a sense of the artistry that generations have poured into this place.
""These exciting artistic commissions offer a chance to rediscover, reassess and reassert our mission today through the lens of contemporary art.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9342931pk2o,"Belly dancer, 84, has navel approach to exercise","An 84-year-old belly dancer, whose twisting tummy was once frowned upon during a British midriff crisis, has urged people of all ages to keep active as she reflects on her career.
Tina Hobin, from Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, teaches a belly dancing class every week and says she is the oldest professional belly dancer in the UK.
""Life is precious,"" she said, taking stock of her art. ""Exercise and dancing gives people a purpose... it's important because it improves muscle tone.""
Ms Hobin said that too many people were sitting down and watching TV instead of moving, which could cause back pain and mobility issues. But can shaking one's hips really avoid creaking hips?
Well, according to Ms Hobin, her particular form of activity - a dance originating in ancient Egypt - has helped many of her students with physical health problems, including strengthening the upper back as well as boosting flexibility.
""It's changed my life,"" she said. ""It's fantastic, it raises your energy levels and people can't believe my age, I've stayed slim since my 30s.""
She said the dance emerged after women in labour were encouraged to concentrate on their pelvic and abdominal regions to avoid the pain of contractions.
""Women tend to fight against contraction, but through the movements [they went with it], it's just nature,"" she said.
But such undulations - when presented on stage - once confused Britain which, she explained, could not easily disassociate the art from sex.
Ms Hobin said there was a lack of understanding about belly dancing, particularly regarding sexualisation, whether that be through deliberate presentation or flawed perception, both of which she was against.
""I was doing a lot of TV,"" she said of her past, ""and producers told me there hadn't been a belly dancer who had gone far [on screen]. That really, really annoyed me - they assumed [I was like] a stripper or prostitute.
""In this country, [the dance was mostly performed] in nightclubs [or by] strippers.
""I don't encourage people to come showing their bellies and boobs. I like to encourage women from all walks of life, all shapes and ages â there's not a particular image you have to emulate.""
It's all meant that she somewhat struggles with the term belly dancing, although admits it's the one by which people most easily recognise the form.
She said she preferred to call it ""the sacred dance of life"", or at least ""belly dancing for health and fitness"".
Ms Hobin said she had seen women's confidence and self-esteem blossom after taking up the dance.
""I've seen women who have been divorced and their husbands left them for someone else,"" she said.
""They didn't think they were good enough anymore, but they do dancing and it's helped them get in touch with themselves.
""[I've also seen] people who have been abused and said it helped them get in touch with their body and sexuality again.""
Ms Hobin said she was introduced to belly dancing in the 1970s.
After seeing a newspaper article about a class, she thought the dancer looked ""elegant and lovely"" and decided to become a member. She said she had never looked back.

She has been teaching her own classes since 1974 - with students including inmates at a women's prison - and has been invited all over the world to host belly dancing workshops.
And there are no plans to stop.
""I'll dance until I'm 120,"" she said.

A routine inspection at the Core Theatre in Solihull in 2023 led to the discovery of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac), which is prone to collapse.
With repair works completed, the theatre will reopen its doors on Sunday with a charity gala, including performances from local musicians, choirs and dance groups.
Solihull's mayor, councillor Shahin Ashraf, said The Core was the borough's ""home of culture"" and had been ""sorely missed"".
Hundreds of schools and public buildings were forced to close fully or partially when Raac was discovered during inspections in 2023, and councillor Ian Courts, the leader of Solihull Council, said it had taken a lot of work to make the theatre safe.
""We had to repair the Raac, and we had to do work on the roof,"" he told the BBC.
""What we also took an opportunity of was to improve the studio as well.""
Sophia Gough, who will be singing with her group the Boogaloo Babes, said the reopening was going to be ""amazing"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1egxg87zzgo,Retired dancer returns to stage four decades on,"A former professional dancer has come out of retirement to return to the stage that inspired him to take up his career almost 40 years ago.
Geoff Hopson, 53, from Stockton, returns to Darlington's Hippodrome on 16 May to play the King in a ballet production of Snow White.
The venue, formerly known as Darlington Civic Theatre, is where Mr Hopson first discovered his passion for dance at the age of 16.
After an international career, Mr Hopson said he was ""excited"" to return to the stage where it all began.
He said he was inspired to become a dancer after seeing an all-male cast in a Gang of Five production at the venue.
Mr Hopson, who retired after an injury when he was 34, said: ""When I saw the five male dancers perform in Darlington all those years ago, they were everything I wanted to be.
""They were athletic, powerful, graceful â I saw what they were capable of and knew it was what I wanted to do.
""I didn't even tell my mother I was studying to be a dancer until I was in my second year of training, so I definitely didn't come from that sort of theatrical, performing background.""
He said his return to Darlington was made even more special by the fact that the role was choreographed especially for him by balletLORENT's artistic director, Liv Lorent.
After retiring, Mr Hopson went into teaching, lecturing at Teesside, Northumbria and Sunderland universities and delivering workshops in primary schools.
He said: ""I came out of retirement because I love everything about this show â it's clever and funny and smart and sad.
""I was incredibly lucky to find my passion in life and I don't know what I'd have done without it.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9ve2123zy8o,Exhibition looks at how Shakespeare began to write,"Curators are putting together an exhibition that aims to show people how William Shakespeare came to write his plays.
The exhibition, called Becoming Shakespeare, opens in Stratford-upon-Avon later this month.
It has been described as a look at the influences that helped to shape the dramatist when he was young, and what inspired him to create his work.
Rachael North, chief executive of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, said it would focus on the playwright's ""formative years"".
She said visitors would be able to ""feel a personal connection to the beginnings of his extraordinary journey"".
Bradley Wynne, creative director at Sarner International, which has been working on designs for the exhibition, said Shakespeare's Birthplace, in the Warwickshire town, was ""one of the most literary heritage sites in the world"".
The exhibition opens on 24 May and organisers said prebooking was recommended.
The Shakespeare's Birthplace website describes how the bard was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564.
His father was a glove-maker, holding civic positions in the town, which meant he was likely to have sent his children to the local grammar school.
The young writer would have lived with his family at their Henley Street house, until he turned 18.
He then married Anne Hathaway, who was eight years older than him and already pregnant when they tied the knot.
Experts have said it is a mystery how he got to London, but by 1592 his reputation in the capital was established.
His success made him ""considerably wealthy"" and he went on to buy the largest house in the borough of Stratford.
Researchers now believe Shakespeare spent more time in Stratford than previously thought, lodging in London and dividing his time between his hometown and the capital, in what could have been a two or three-day commute.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3evq307348o,Festival 'survived all sorts' as it celebrates 25th anniversary,"""We've survived all sorts of challenges... We've had fires. We've had floods, a global pandemic, but we're still standing.""
From ""spit and sawdust"" beginnings to a major 10-day cultural celebration, one of Northern Ireland's leading festivals is celebrating 25 years of showcasing the arts.
Conceived in the shadow of the Good Friday Agreement peace deal, the first Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival (CQAF) was staged in May 2000 in an attempt to regenerate Belfast's north inner city.
A quarter of a century on, the city's cultural infrastructure has drastically improved, but financial support for the arts is at an ""all-time low"", according to the festival's director.
CQAF prides itself on being as accessible as possible, with numerous free events and low-cost ticket pricing.
Now established as a limited company with charitable status, the festival's income is evenly divided between self-generated and public funds.
However, balancing the books can prove challenging, CQAF director Sean Kelly explained.
""We had an agenda, I suppose, we wanted to make the arts a bit more affordable for people,"" Mr Kelly said as he reflected on the festival's early days.
""Every year is a struggle... Unfortunately what you have to do, sometimes, when the level of support goes down, is to put your ticket prices up slightly.
""We're trying to make sure that we don't price people out and make going to concerts and theatre just the preserve of people that have money, that's very much a part of our ethos.""
The Department for Communities has acknowledged that funding to the Arts Council of Northern Ireland ""has decreased, in real terms, by 30% over the last decade"".
This year's festival is taking place from 1 to 11 May, and features more than 100 performances across dozens of venues.
Recognised for its diverse programming, CQAF presents a combination of renowned acts, emerging talent and fringe performers, attracting more than 60,000 audience-goers to Belfast's cultural quarter.
""There's been many amazing moments,"" Mr Kelly told BBC News NI. ""People that I'd never, ever dreamed I'd work with.""
Standout performers have included Liam Clancy, ""who Bob Dylan regards as the greatest folk singer in the world"", who played at the festival just a few months before his death in 2009.
The same year attracted the likes of American soul singer Candi Staton, Irish rockabilly Imelda May and the, then, lesser-known Calvin Harris.
""He was little more than a bedroom DJ, he played in our marquee in Custom House Square,"" Mr Kelly said.
""He's one of the biggest music producers in the world, worth millions and millions of pounds, but I can tell you we weren't paying him a big fee in those days!""
Another highlight was Patti Smith's appearance at the 2003 festival.
The punk pioneer performed at a former Ulster University student union building, Conor Hall, to an audience of 300 people.
""It was kind of spit and sawdust but it was probably one of the most mesmerising performances I've ever seen in my life,"" Mr Kelly said.
Looking to the future, Mr Kelly isn't chasing scale or status.
""We don't need to be the biggest festival in Ireland.. If we do 100 shows and each of them are amazing, I'm happy with that.""
The Cathedral Quarter, Belfast's nightlife and arts epicentre, has changed significantly in the last 25 years, he explained, and a ""spiritual need"" for music, comedy and theatre ""is there and growing"".
""When we started there was no Black Box, there was no Mac Theatre, the Oh Yeah Music Centre... there was no real infrastructure in the area, all that has improved greatly.""
These spaces need protected, he added.
""We need to make sure that however successful the Cathedral Quarter becomes, however great the bar and restaurant culture is, the artists are respected,"" he said.
Artists like Belfast-born singer-songwriter AOIBHA, who is stepping into a new role as the 2025 Artist in Residence at the festival - a moment she describes as both an honour and a full-circle experience.
The role sees AOIBHA deeply involved with the festival, performing multiple support slots and culminating in her own headline show on 10 May.
It's a position she doesn't take lightly, reflecting on how previous artists in residence inspired her.
""I've really looked up to them,"" she said. ""When I was offered the opportunity it was a no-brainer.""
A passionate advocate for Belfast's arts culture, AOIBHA credits the city's small size for fostering creativity.
""The people are fantastic - welcoming, kind, and with the best sense of humour,"" she said.
""It's a city where you can quickly get to know other musicians in the scene, different venues... There's a real ability to build community and build strong connections.""
As for her upcoming shows during the festival, AOIBHA is especially excited about supporting acts like The Magic Numbers, Luca Fogale and Bernard Butler.
Still, it's her own headline show at the Harrison Hotel that stands out.
""It's a unique space for a gig,"" she said. ""I don't think anything like this has happened in that room before, so I'm really excited by the challenge.""
This moment is more than just a career milestone, it's a reflection of years spent immersed in Belfast's music community, both on and off the stage.
""There were so many times I stood in the audience thinking: 'One day, I want to play on that stage',"" she said.
""It feels like a really important time for me now, I'm there, it's really significant.""",Matt Fox,2 days ago,0

Ipswich Regent Theatre, which has been an entertainment staple in the town since the 1920s, will be closed until 12 December as part of a Â£3.5m redevelopment project.
The changes will see a single-storey extension built at the rear of the venue, a ""wall of fame"" mural created at the entrance, and the toilets refurbished.
The St Helen's Street theatre, which is the largest in the East of England, will also boast larger bar areas, while disabled access will also be improved and modified.
Jane Riley, in charge of culture at Ipswich Borough Council, said: ""It's going to make the whole space so much nicer and I personally am looking forward to it.
""One common complaint is there nowhere to sit, as there is limited seating now, but where the ladies toilets are currently, that will all become bar space and seats.
""It will be a much more comfortable experience and people will notice that immediately.""
The proposal for the new-look auditorium was approved by Ipswich Borough Council's planning department in December.
As part of the scheme, the existing canopy will be refurbished and illuminated lettering will be installed at the front.
The theatre's Crush Hall and Circle Lounge bars will also be modernised, the council said, and the toilet facilities improved.
The final performance before the closure took place on Saturday, with Give A Little Love singer Daniel O'Donnell taking to the stage.
The first show after reopening is due to be the Cinderella Christmas pantomime, running from 12 to 31 December which also includes two adult performances on the 29 and 30 December.
Some of the shows that would have been staged at the venue will instead take place at the nearby Corn Exchange.
""It's a popular venue and it's always a shame to have to close a building but now is the time to do it as the summer is actually a relatively quiet period,"" added Ms Riley.
""[But once the revamp is complete], it will look and feel a lot nicer to use and will help the experience.""
Keen theatre-goer Tracey Pearson has watched 102 shows at the Regent in the last 10 years and says she was ""very excited"" about the revamp.
She currently has one show booked at the nearby Corn Exchange ""to fill the gap"", but has already booked three events to attend once the theatre reopens.
""We are very much excited and looking forward to returning,"" she told the BBC.
""My mum is in a wheelchair and if she has to get up to let people past the staff tell the people to give her time to get up from her seat - they are very welcoming and friendly.
""The prices are good and there is something for everyone.""

A Mischief of Rats will be on display from 3 May in Hull and features 6ft tall (1.8m) painted rat sculptures  for people to enjoy on a walking trail in the city.
The art trail was created to pay tribute to rock musician Mick Ronson, who was from Hull and a member of the local 1960s band the Rats, before becoming David Bowie's guitarist.
Co-director Clare Huby previously said the trail would be launched ahead of what would have been the musician's 80th birthday on 26 May 2026.
She said: ""I know people in Hull have been keen to have something that will honour Mick Ronson, so this just seemed like the perfect opportunity.""
Ms Huby added the project would also help the Daisy Appeal charity, which supports Cottingham's Castle Hill hospital, with the sculptures being auctioned in September.
The charity hopes to raise up to Â£250,000 for ""cutting-edge research"" into cancer.
Mick Ronson died of cancer in 1993 aged 46.
The art trail, which is similar to previous projects, including Larkin with Toads, A Moth for Amy and Puffins Galore, will run until August and includes locations in Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g7j5r0qpyo,Culture leaders 'unwilling' to police which toilets people use,"Leaders across the UK's cultural sector have said they are ""unable and unwilling"" to police which toilets people choose to use after a recent Supreme Court ruling.
Last month, the Supreme Court said the terms ""woman"" and ""sex"" in the 2010 Equality Act ""refer to a biological woman and biological sex"".
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) issued interim guidance that, in places open to the public, trans women - people who are biologically male but identify as female - shouldn't use women's facilities such as toilets.
More than 1,000 cultural figures have signed an open letter which claims the judgement ""overlooks the need to protect trans, non-binary and intersex people from discrimination"".
Signatories include joint chief executives and general directors of the Welsh National Opera (WNO), Adele Thomas and Sarah Crabtree, the founder of the Vagina Museum, Florence Schechter, and the director of Queer Britain museum, Andrew Given.
The letter says that the majority of cultural venues ""are unable to magic up new toilet facilities"" and ""this kind of segregation will have significant social, cultural and economic impact"".
The Supreme Court judges say trans people are still protected from discrimination under equalities legislation, and that this interpretation of the law does not cause disadvantage to the ""potentially vulnerable group"".
The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government and argued for a ""common sense"" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an ""immutable biological state"".
Following the ruling two weeks ago, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: ""Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling.""
Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media to say the campaign group have ""protected the rights of women and girls across the UK.""
Barrister Akua Reindorf described the ruling as ""a model of clarity and provides a solid foundation for approaching consequential issues"", while Helen Joyce, the director of advocacy at the campaign group Sex Matters, said the ruling was ""incrediblyâ¯important for the half of humanity who need single-sex spaces"".
Several organisations have been updating their guidelines in light of the Supreme Court's ruling.
Earlier this week, the Football Association announced transgender women will no longer be able to play in women's football in England from 1 June.
Meanwhile, professionals in the UK music industry have signed a different open letter expressing solidarity with the trans community.
Signatories including Charli XCX, Jessie Ware, Jade, Olly Alexander, Sugababes, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Paloma Faith.
Their letter says that the industry must ""urgently work to ensure that our trans, non-binary, and intersex colleagues, collaborators, and audiences are protected from discrimination and harassment in all areas of the industry - whether in studios, at venues, in offices, or at festivals"".
The letter comes after actors including Oscar-winning star Eddie Redmayne, The Brutalist actor Joe Alwyn and Babygirl star Harris Dickinson signed an open letter addressed to film and TV industry bodies, encouraging them to support the trans community.
The letter said that the signatories wish to ""add our voices to the 2,000+ signatories of the Open Letter from UK Writers to the Trans Community"", which was signed by Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies and Chewing Gum's Michaela Coel.
The EHRC has issued guidance aimed at clearing up questions about what the judgment will mean in practice.
Transgender women ""should not be permitted to use the women's facilities"" in workplaces or public-facing services like shops and hospitals, the EHRC said.
The same applies to transgender men, who are biologically female, using men's toilets.
The watchdog also insisted that transgender people ""should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use"".
The EHRC is currently reviewing its statutory code of practice for services and will seek affected stakeholders' views on how the practical implications of the judgment can be reflected in the updated guidance in a consultation expected to launch later this month.",Yasmin Rufo,4 days ago,0

""I was this like really shy, insecure 13-year-old, but really I loved it so much and that really made me go 'Oh, I want to do this',"" she said.
""The whole reason I'm here is because of my roots in Stevenage, although I like to call it St. Evanage, it's fancy,"" she joked.
She encouraged young fans who want a future on the West End to visit their local  amateur clubs.
""They're so accessible, they're not obviously hugely expensive. So that I think is definitely a place to start.
""Then for me from there it was just like every single day doing something towards what I wanted to do. Whether that was dancing around my living room or doing a free online singing lesson.
""I think it's just doing something small every day to what you want to do.""
The performer also reflected on the success of Six The Musical, a musical about the wives of Henry VIII where she played the role of Katherine Howard.
""To be with a show from its early start, where we were earning no money, to performing around the country - it's amazing to have seen it come to this.
""Doing the movie with the original cast was like a feeling of coming home, because those women have become like my family.""
While she found watching herself on the big screen version ""terrifying"", she loved watching her co-stars who she could never appreciate from an audience perspective.
She described the production as a ""massive part of me"" and said it influenced her latest album Queen, which is out in June.
The lead single, a cover of Alone by Heart which is released on Friday, is a duet with fellow original Six cast member Natalie Paris.
""She's such an incredible vocalist and we just wanted to do something that was really sort of epic, cinematic and queenly.
""The album is influenced by the journey of Six that I've been on and includes covers of songs from other shows I've been in.""
When asked if it is nicer to perform without being dressed as a queen she joked: ""Listen, I love wearing a crown, you never know.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qw910q875o,Theatre praises Oldman's 'thrilling' York return,"Gary Oldman's return to the theatre where he made his professional debut is a ""very generous decision"" by the star, venue staff say.
The Oscar-winning actor is starring in Samuel Beckett's play, Krapp's Last Tape, at York Theatre Royal until 17 May, his first stage role since the late 1980s.
He previously said staging the one-actor play, which he also directs, would be all the more poignant as it was ""about a man returning to his past of 30 years earlier"".
Vicky Biles, from the theatre, said it had been ""very exciting"" to welcome new audiences from around the world alongside regulars during the sell-out run.
""We do hope that people coming to see it will look at other things that we have happening here and come back again,"" said Ms Biles, the theatre's communications and development director.
Oldman started out at the venue in 1979 in plays like Privates on Parade and She Stoops to Conquer - as well as playing the cat in the pantomime Dick Whittington that Christmas.
Plans for his long-awaited return started about 18 months ago, Ms Biles said, when Oldman visited the theatre and met chief executive Paul Crewes.

""Gary spent about an hour on the main stage with his family, talking about his memories of working here in 1979,"" she said.
""That started the conversation with Paul about Gary's desire to return to theatre.""
Producing the play, which is not set to tour elsewhere in the UK, had been ""thrilling"" for the theatre, said Ms Biles.
""He hasn't done theatre for over 30 years and to choose to come back to where he started his career is very special,"" she said.
""It's a very generous decision on his part to continue to support this theatre and give us this wonderful production.""
The production has received several positive reviews, including the Guardian describing it as a ""startling piece of theatre"".
The Times, however, said Oldman ""could dig deeper"", with the performance creating ""mixed results"".
""It's very rare for York to be at the centre of focus of the theatre world,"" said York-based critic Charles Hutchinson.
""It's rare that the New York Times, for example, should send a reviewer to York to see anything at all, and they're there for Gary Oldman.""
Sting and Trudie Styler had visited to watch the production, he added, as well as Slow Horses writer Mick Heron.
Mr Hutchinson said the opening to the production featured 67-year-old Oldman silently eating fruit.
""It is interesting when you watch something and it's silent other than someone eating a banana and how it makes an audience feel,"" the critic said.
""Are they going to find it funny, do they have permission to give the first laugh?""
He added: ""He has absolute charisma on screen, but what's interesting here is he's playing a character who is downbeat and looking back on 30 years earlier.""
After his York debut, Oldman's glittering career has included playing Sirius Black in the Harry Potter films and winning a best actor Oscar in 2018 for his Winston Churchhill portrayal.
Mr Hutchinson, 64, added: ""People say to me, why didn't you go to work in London? The answer is because still so much goes on in the north.
""I feel more special seeing something like this in York than going to London.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74zg7dd2j0o,Mosaic artist uses biscuits to make famous faces,"A mosaic artist based in London said he had some ""trepidation"" when McVitie's called and asked him to make some famous portraits out of biscuits.
Ed Chapman said: ""I wondered if it could be done with biscuits, I thought surely they're going to be crumbling all over the place.""
The art was commissioned as part of the brand's 100th birthday celebrations for their chocolate digestive.
McVitie's has operated a biscuit factory in Harlesden, west London since 1902.
""I immediately went out and bought some biscuits to try them out and tested out how it might work - eventually I found my way with them.""
Asked how it was possible to make such vivid portraits out of digestives, he said: ""I initially thought they were all quite similar, but actually there's a white chocolate, gold chocolate, dark chocolate and of course the milk chocolate, and if you flip them over, there's the biscuit side which is plain, so there's a few grades of colour and tones there - it's a palette.
""When I started this, I didn't think about the warm weather. Thankfully I've got a north facing studio, but I kept them in the fridge as they were easier to cut.
Ed says the current warm spell is a bit of a worry, but said: ""I've protected them with several layers of varnish so, I'm not saying they're indestructible, but they should certainly last - they wouldn't last in the direct sun though.""
The artist said it took about 180 hours to make the three portraits and he used ""thousands"" of biscuits, which were supplied by McVitie's.
Mr Chapman said the work had already been getting good feedback and attention online.
The mosaic artist has also done campaigns for other companies, including Keep Britain Tidy.
The pictures will be displayed on The Strand from 2 to 5 May.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05nq8600gzo,Open air theatre raises curtain on 11th season,"An open air theatre is raising the curtain on its 11th summer season, which includes music, comedy, drag and family shows.
Brighton Open Air Theatre (BOAT), in Dyke Road Park, will host performances from Friday until 21 September.
General manager Will Mytum said the theatre aimed for ""a balance of supporting local artists and keeping prices keen"".
""It's wonderful to welcome new visitors each season as well as our loyal regulars,"" he added.
There will be more than 70 productions from when the venue opens, including a brand new version of Winnie The Pooh.
In August, Drag in the Park: Pride Edition will celebrate Pride Weekend, and there will be theatre performances of Cinderella, Moby Dick and Twelfth Night.
Comedians Sara Pascoe, Romesh Ranganathan and Al Murray will also appear.
Community group Dad La Soul, which aims to address masculinity and men's mental health, will throw a family-friendly ""block party"" in August.
Mr Mytum said the theatre, which is completely self funded, aimed to keep prices low for the audience.
""We want to be a venue that anyone can come to,"" he added.
The 400-seat theatre, a registered charity, was the brainchild of Brighton playwright and construction manager, Adrian Bunting.
In April 2013 he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and spent his final days planning for a long-held ambition to create an open air theatre in the city.
He left his life savings of Â£18,000 to kick-start the project and asked four of his friends to continue his dream after his death.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxg094zk58o,David Bowie to Doctor Who: Famous faces come to life in art show,"From Winston Churchill to Amy Winehouse, and Charles Darwin to Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa, portraits of a host of British icons feature in the first immersive exhibition to use one of Britain's national art collections.
The National Portrait Gallery (NPG) has combined digital versions of portraits from its collection with animated graphics and voiceovers to tell the stories of 19 celebrities and historical figures.
It is the latest in a wave of increasingly popular immersive art shows, which fill gallery walls with large-scale projected visuals.
The show launches in Salford on Friday before going on a UK tour. But while access to see the original portraits in the NPG in London is free, entrance to the Stories Brought To Life exhibition costs up to Â£35.
NPG director Victoria Siddall told BBC News: ""The main driver of this is taking the collection to new audiences outside of London.
""But there is another element to that, of course, which is raising revenue, which is absolutely crucial for museums to thrive.
""Obviously we're always looking at new innovations that can help engage audiences. And if that brings us revenue too that's wonderful.""
All national galleries charge for admission to special exhibitions, she added.
The gallery has forecast an operating deficit for the latest financial year.
The use of the striking paintings and photos with animated graphics, music and narration was a ""powerful combination"", Siddall said.
The exhibition is being held in a pop-up venue at MediaCity in Salford until August and will then tour to five more locations, but they have not been announced.
The venue's walls are filled with about 40 giant picture frame-style boxes, which the portraits and animations are projected onto.
Some of the chosen personalities, such as Malala Yousafzai, Churchill and Audrey Hepburn, tell their stories in their own words; while actors narrate the sections about others, including William Shakespeare and Emmeline Pankhurst.
It's a whistlestop guide to selected slices of history, with each person's story told in two or three minutes, and the entire show taking about 45 minutes. It ends with Queen Elizabeth II.
Standard adult tickets cost between Â£22 and Â£30, with an extra Â£5 for a flexible ticket, and some ""affordable"" Â£10 tickets available on Mondays.
Joy Coker, editor of arts outlet Alt A Review, said she thought it was worth it, but that the price could exclude some people.
""Right now with the cost of living it might not be something everybody can afford,"" she said.
""It's thought-provoking and it actually makes you think about each individual subject again, and takes you back to those moments in time, which you're not necessarily going to get from a looking at a portrait on its own.""
In recent years, artists from Vincent van Gogh to David Hockney have successfully been given the immersive treatment.
This weekend, LS Lowry will also be added to the list when a new, free immersive experience brings his trademark matchstick men to life at Salford's Lowry arts centre.
The walls, floor and ceiling of one gallery show projections of the artist's 1953 painting Going To The Match. The crowds flocking to watch Bolton Wanderers FC are animated, with the visuals zooming in on sections of the artwork.
The six-minute experience is narrated by Bolton comedian and actress Sophie Willan, and visitors can then see the real painting in the next gallery.
""People are going and standing in front of the painting and then looking for elements that have come to life, and that is a different way for them to be able to engage with the real artwork,â The Lowry chief executive Julia Fawcett explained.
The venue bought the painting for almost Â£8m in 2022 and has spent two years working on the immersive version. Fawcett said she did not consider charging for entry.
""Our galleries are free and this is part of our gallery offer,"" she said. ""For us, it was about making sure we reached the widest possible audience.
""We know immersive [art] is popular but we know also that price can be a barrier, and it would be counter-intuitive, when you have a project that is about reaching more audiences and deepening people's love and appreciation of the artist, to put a barrier in place.""",Ian Youngs,4 days ago,0

The Hollywood actor, who is starring on stage in Good Night, and Good Luck, was one of a number of stars to receive their first Tony nods on Thursday.
Pussycat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger, Succession's Sarah Snook and Breaking Bad's Bob Odenkirk were nominated for their roles in Sunset Blvd, The Picture of Dorian Gray and Glengarry Glen Ross respectively.
The Tonys reward excellence in Broadway theatre over the past year. This year's nominations are led overall by the musicals Buena Vista Social Club, Death Becomes Her and Maybe Happy Ending, which have 10 each.
They are all up for best musical in a crowded field that also includes Dead Outlaw and Operation Mincemeat, which has transferred to New York from London.
Elsewhere, Audra McDonald received her 11th Tony nomination, for her role in Gypsy, making her the most nominated performer in history.
Rosemary's Baby actress Mia Farrow is another famous screen star up for her first Tony award, for her part in The Roommate.
Clooney is up for best performance by an actor in a leading role in a play, for his role in the stage adaptation of 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck.
It focuses on the conflict between veteran TV journalist Edward R Murrow and US senator Joseph McCarthy.
""It's a thrill to have five nominations for this play,"" Clooney said of the play, which he also co-wrote, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
""For everyone involved, this has been an incredible experience. I couldn't be more proud or feel more lucky.""
However, Clooney's drama was not listed in the best play category, despite being the highest grossing production on Broadway in recent weeks.
The contenders for that prize include English, The Hills of California, John Proctor Is The Villain, Oh Mary! and Purpose.
Meanwhile, one of the most expensive productions on Broadway, Othello, led by Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, was snubbed completely in the nominations.
The play has been drawing in the crowds but also received mixed reviews from critics.
New musical Redwood, starring Idina Menzel, was also entirely shut out, as was another musical, The Last Five Years, starring Nick Jonas and Adrienne Warren.
Robert Downey Jr had less luck on his Broadway debut than Clooney, as his one-act stage play McNeal received no nominations.
Romeo + Juliet was recognised for best revival of a play, yet its stars Rachel Zegler and Kit Connor missed out.
But singer and actress Gracie Lawrence, from TV show The Sex Lives of College Girls, received her first Tony nomination too for her Broadway musical debut in Just In Time.

There will be four concerts from 22-24 August at Bristol Beacon and St Georges making it the second summer in a row that the Proms have taken up residency in the city.
The headliners include composer Charles Hazelwood, the founder of Paraorchestra, as well as the orchestra of Welsh National Opera with Carlo Rizzi and mezzo-soprano Avery Amereau.
Simon Wales, chief executive of Bristol Beacon, said: ""We strive to offer world-class classical music to our audience as part of our wider artistic programme and we are proud to be working with the BBC Proms to continue to offer music that is open to all.""
All four concerts at Bristol Beacon will be broadcast live on BBC Radio 3.
The radio station will also host its Late-Night Live edition of Late Junction in the Lantern Hall, which will be presented by Verity Sharp and guest artists Sarahsson and Wojciech Rusin.
An afternoon concert, which will also be recorded for broadcast, will take place at St George's Bristol as part of the Proms weekend.
Sam Jackson, a controller from BBC Radio 3 and BBC Proms said: ""The Proms was founded in 1895 on the belief that everyone should have access to the very best of classical music, so I am delighted that our concerts across the UK reach audiences on their own doorstep, as well as being broadcast on Radio 3.""
Mr Hazelwood and the Paraorchestra are collaborating with The Breath and composer Oliver Vibrans to create a folk-inspired sound for the events.
He said: ""I can say, hand on heart, that this will be so much more than the standard orchestra-meets-band.
""I guarantee you will hear things - and instrumental combinations - that you have never heard before.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kv7pnx28qo,Stone lion sculpture gets facelift to match twin,"A lion statue has had a facelift to make it match its twin.
The pair have stood at the entrance to Weelsby Woods in Grimsby since the 1950s, until a car hit one in 2023, knocking it off its pedestal.
It was repaired and restored to its plinth, but the face did not match the other lion sculpture.
Now stonemasons have remodelled the face of the existing one so it looks like the repaired one.
The two-tonne lions were carved in 1876 for the gateway of a house on Abbey Road in Grimsby.
They were moved to the park when it opened in 1951 following a donation of 150 acres of land to the town by a local fishing magnate.
After the crash, community group the Friends of Weelsby Woods raised Â£10,000 to repair the damaged lion.
The latest restoration was paid for by North East Lincolnshire Council and used the same Lincoln stonemasons who had previously fixed it.
Councillor Henry Hudson said he was ""elated"" to see the pair back together.
""It's great to see the lions match again,"" he said.
""It was a travesty when the first was destroyed.
""However, now the pair look even better and we're thrilled to have been able to do this.""

If approved, the Grade II listed Sessions House, in Spilsby, Lincolnshire, will undergo major repairs and alterations, including improved access and a new cafÃ©.
The former court building was placed on the Theatres Trust's at-risk register in 2015, but the charity that runs it was granted Â£5m of government levelling up funding in 2023.
Charity trustee Bruce Knight said: ""It feels amazing to have reached this point in the project. It's taken quite some time to do the design and do all the work that's been necessary.""
The proposal, which has been submitted to East Lindsey District Council, includes a part-change of use, as well as alterations to the existing theatre and bar.
New community spaces would include the cafÃ©, a meeting room, offices, a heritage display and an outdoor seating area.
Mr Knight said the theatre would be opened up for greater public use by turning it into a multi-purpose facility with a ""sustainable future"".
""We hope we can soon progress to the point of beginning to see the plans becoming a reality,"" Mr Knight added.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/creqlgp47plo,Mescal and Stormzy set for National Theatre shows,"Theatre audiences will get a double dose of Paul Mescal in 2027, after the Irish actor signed up for two productions at the National Theatre.
The star of Normal People and Gladiator II will appear in two classic 20th Century plays - Death of a Salesman and A Whistle in the Dark.
The shows are among a raft of new productions that were announced by the prestigious London venue's new artistic director Indhu Rubasingham on Tuesday.
Other stars coming to the National's stage over the next two years include recent Oscar nominee Monica Barbaro and Bridgerton's Nicola Coughlan, while rap artist Stormzy will collaborate with the theatre on a new production.
Rubasingham was named artistic director in December 2023, taking over from Rufus Norris after his decade in charge.
The National's Lyttelton Theatre will return to a repertory model for the first time since 2020, meaning multiple shows will be staged concurrently featuring the same cast.
As part of a new repertory run, Paul Mescal will make his National Theatre debut in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman and Tom Murphy's A Whistle in the Dark.
Despite having different settings and cultural backgrounds, bosses said the two shows shared common themes of dysfunctional family relationships and the weight of societal and familial expectations.
Mescal, who won an Olivier Award in 2023 for A Streetcar Named Desire, will play Biff Loman in Death of a Salesman. It has not yet been announced who will play the character's father Willy, who is central to the play.
US actress Monica Barbaro, recently nominated for an Oscar for playing Joan Baez opposite Timothee Chalamet in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, will appear in a revival of romance drama Les Liaisons Dangereuses.
She and Poldark star Aidan Turner will make their National Theatre debuts in the show alongside Lesley Manville.
Meanwhile, Derry Girls star SiobhÃ¡n McSweeney, Bridgerton's Nicola Coughlan and The Sixth Commandment's Ãanna Hardwicke will appear together in John Millington Synge's Irish classic The Playboy of the Western World.
A new collaboration between the theatre and rap artist Stormzy was also announced, but details have not yet been revealed.
It is a project Rubasingham first pitched as part of her application for the job, saying his involvement would make for a ""cut-through show that goes beyond theatre"".
After being appointed, Rubasingham joked she spent ""six to eight months doggedly pursuing Stormzy and his team"", and he came on board after visiting the building.
She said the project was ""very exciting"" and confirmed it would be ""a piece with his music"", but added: ""I'm not saying more than that.""
In a statement, Stormzy said he had ""always been drawn to theatre"" and said he and Rubasingham ""properly hit it off"" when they met. ""I'm excited to go on this creative journey with her,"" he added.
Elsewhere, Black Panther star Letitia Wright will appear in The Story, a new play by US writer Tracey Scott Wilson about an ambitious black journalist who defies her editor to pursue an incendiary lead.
Other productions announced on Tuesday included:
Born in Sheffield and with Sri-Lankan heritage, Rubasingham is the seventh artistic director since the National was founded by Sir Laurence Olivier in 1963, and the first woman to hold the position.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, she pledged that the National's next chapter would be known for telling ""bold stories in big ways, which cross continents, move hearts and open minds"".
""It's making sure that audiences who love the National and have been going there for 40 or 50 years are still wanting to be part of it, as well as attracting audiences that don't feel welcome or don't know the National,"" she said.
Asked whether she would want the National to eventually return to the levels of repertory theatre being performed at the venue before the pandemic, Rubasingham  replied: ""If the finances allowed, it would be really wonderful.
""It is more expensive to rep,"" she noted, ""but there are a lot of advantages in terms of taking riskier work, and allowing word of mouth.""",Steven McIntosh,7 days ago,0

The college principal, Jason Lancaster, said the town was ""very proud"" and the exhibition ""brought its history to life"".
Among the buildings featured in the project are the Royal and Derngate theatres, the Guildhall, Tricker's shoe factory and the Express Lift Tower.
The County Ground and the Mounts swimming baths are also included.
The exhibition reveals photos and artwork of the landmarks, presented alongside a soundscape of people's memories of the buildings and the industries associated with them.
The project has involved students from several departments, including fine art, photography, music technology, business and dance.
Carpentry apprentices have also played a part.
Mr Lancaster said: ""Northampton is a very proud town with an incredible heritage. Wherever you walk you can feel the history around the place and this exhibition brings much of that to life.
""This collection is a celebration of collaboration, with students from across the college coming together to work with external partners to create something truly special for the whole town to enjoy. It really is something to treasure.""

Beamish, The Living Museum of the North in County Durham is up for the Â£120,000 prize-winning pot alongside Cardiff's Chapter and Compton Verney in Warwickshire.
Belfast's Golden Thread Gallery and the Perth Museum in Perth and Kinross round off the shortlist.
Art Fund director Jenny Waldman said that this year's finalists ""are inspiring examples of museums at their best"" and ""deeply connected to their local communities, responsive to the world around them, and alive with energy and ideas.""
""Each one offers a distinctive experience, showing the endless creativity and care that goes into making museums inspiring and exciting spaces for everyone,"" she noted, speaking on behalf of the award judges.
The winner will be announced on Thursday 26 June at a ceremony at the Museum of Liverpool, marking the first time the event has ever been held outside of the UK capital.
Let's take a closer look at the nominees for this year's prize, which are all now guaranteed to receive at least Â£15,000.
Beamish, The Living Museum of the North in County Durham is an open-air museum which reflects life in north east England in the 19th and 20th centuries.
It brings Georgian, Edwardian and war-time history to life through immersive exhibits where visitors engage with costumed staff and volunteers.
Judges praised Beamish for continuing its ""long-standing commitment to preserving local heritage"" and its ""exceptional visitor experience"".
In the past year the museum has completed its Remaking Beamish project, which saw the recreation of a 1950s town developed with community input, as well as the opening of the aged miners' homes (AMH), which tells the story of welfare provision provided for retired miners.
This year, as part of the National Railway 200 celebrations, it will also host the Festival of Transport (24 May-1 June).
Chapter is an international centre for contemporary arts in Cardiff, which includes a gallery, artists' studios, theatres and cinema screenings.
In recent years, the centre has commissioned fourteen exhibitions by diverse international artists - including Adham Faramawy, Ntiense Eno-Amooquaye and Abi Palmer - which have explored themes from climate crisis to materiality.
The Arts Fund noted how Chapter ""continues to co-create exceptional programmes that enrich Cardiff's cultural landscape"", from printmaking to music.
It offers ""pay what you can"" pricing and free community tickets, and also recently introduced an artist residency programme with free studio space, and launched Wales' largest festival of deaf-led creative activity, Deaf Gathering Cymru.
Compton Verney in Warwickshire has six art collections, a sculpture park and cafÃ©, set within a Grade I-listed 18th Century mansion.
The gallery was described as ""a vibrant cultural destination committed to making art accessible to all by connecting people with art, nature, and creativity"".
Last year, it unveiled its Sculpture in the Park exhibition featuring works by artists such as Sarah Lucas, Permindar Kaur, Larry Achiampong, Helen Chadwick and Erika Verzutti.
The venue invites artists and communities to reimagine its 18th Century facade, and its exhibitions have also explored the legacies of the likes of Capability Brown, Louise Bourgeois and Chila Kumari Singh Burman.
More than 6,000 schoolchildren have visited and participated in early creative projects, while recent initiatives have also included a monthly dementia cafÃ© and an upcoming large-scale multimedia exhibition of work, reflecting on life and death, by Emma Talbot (5 July-5 October).
The jury noted the museum's commitment to ""breaking down barriers to cultural careers for young people with disabilities.""
Contemporary arts space Golden Thread Gallery in Belfast features two large galleries, a community participation and engagement hub, and Northern Ireland's first visual art library and archive.
After closing in 2023, the gallery reopened last year at a new Queen Street address in the city centre, presenting exhibitions by artists including Charlotte Bosanquet, Rob Hilken, Graham Fagen, Susan Hiller and Claire Morgan.
Since reopening it has welcomed more than 23,000 visitors.
The gallery partnered with Translink NI to help produce a public sculpture by Kevin Killen incorporating local narratives and community stories at the redeveloped York Street station.
This summer it will host the video and photographic works of Sophie Calle with her exhibition Beyond the Gaze - Shared Perspectives (21 June-27 August).
Perth Museum serves as the new home of the Stone of Destiny, one of Scotland's most cherished treasures, which has returned to Perthshire after more than 700 years.
The civic museum opened last year following a Â£27 million development at the former Perth City Hall, by Dutch architects Mecanoo, enabling it to tell the story of Scottish history.
The Stone of Destiny experience uses immersive modern technology to frame the contested object within the story of the medieval boy king of Scotland, Alexander III.
A new exhibition exploring the history and legacy of Macbeth is now underway (25 April-31 August 2025).
The museum has been building partnerships with 10 primary schools, helping students, teachers and communities to connect with their heritage.
Since its opening, Perth Museum has attracted around 250,000 visitors, boosting the local economy.
The Art Fund is the national charity for museums and galleries.
The last time its main prize shortlist totally overlooked London - where many of the nation's biggest museums were historically located - was in 2021, when the award was ultimately won by Firstsite in Colchester, Essex.
Waldman added she hoped this year's award would ""inspire"" people to visit some ""remarkable places"" in their local region and help them ""discover the powerful role they can play in our lives.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77nmxnrjljo,Museum showcases Terry Pratchett's Discworld art,"A museum is displaying a number of illustrations that featured in author Sir Terry Pratchett's famous Discworld series.
The exhibition opens at Weston Museum on May 24 and features illustrations by artist and character designer Paul Kidby - who worked with Pratchett for 30 years.
Sir Terry Pratchett passed away in 2015 and lived in Somerset and the wider South West for much of his life.
""We are very excited for the exhibition, especially after reading the comments and seeing the engagement on social media"" said Victoria Haddock, Exhibitions and Programmes Assistant at South West Heritage.
""This family-friendly exhibition offers a stunning selection of Paul's work, providing visitors a rare opportunity to see how the inhabitants of Discworld are brought to life, from early sketches to the final masterpieces,"" she added.
The award-winning Discworld series is set on a flat planet balanced on the back of four elephants stood on the back of a giant turtle and populated with hundreds of wonderful wizards, witches and magical creatures.
The exhibition will feature original sketches, prints, paintings and sculptures that fully showcase Kidby's creative process.
There are 41 Discworld novels in total - with the first being coming in 1983 and the last being published posthumously - five months after Sir Terry Pratchett's death in 2015.
Pratchett wrote 70 books in total in a 44 year career, he died  of natural causes aged 66, having been diagnosed with Alzheimers.
Mr Kidby has also illustrated for books written by Terry's daughter, Rhianna, although these are not part of the Discworld Series.
In 2017 Mr Kidby created a bronze memorial bust of Sir Terry. The exhibition is a touring exhibition from St Barbe Museum and Art Gallery.
The exhibition will run until August 30th.",Joe Skirkowski,7 days ago,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwzev009qgo,Underpass mural designed to 'inspire positivity',"An artist who painted a mural in a town's subway has said he wanted his art to create positivity for those who see it.
Krishna Malla, who paints under the name Tech Moon, was commissioned by Poole Business Improvement District (BID) to paint a mural on the walls of Poole subway.
His work depicted Dorset's iconic landmarks, symbols, wildlife and historical figures.
He said the artwork's ""sole purpose"" was to ""just make people feel positive"".
""It's not trying to sell you anything, it's not trying to be preachy, but just to instil a positive attitude and a positive feeling,"" he said.
The mural, which he painted in April, included Old Harry Rocks, the flying boats that were based in Poole during WW2.
It also featured pirate Harry Paye, who attacked ships approaching the Poole coastline in the 14th and 15th Centuries.
Malla, who has previously painted a mural on a homeless shelter in Bournemouth and a public toilet block in Salisbury, said he found painting such large artworks ""tricky"" at times.
""There's quite a few different techniques to [paint such large pictures],"" he said.
He said he used a scribble grid to mark reference points on the blank wall - but that meant the wall looked scruffy to begin with, which sometimes caused problems.
""People often call the police at that stage,"" he said.
""They actually turned up in the first 15 minutes on this particular job, which is quite impressive.""
Despite the challenges, Malla said he enjoyed how the work encouraged him to learn about the area in which he painted.
""Because every job is different you're researching lots of different things,"" he said.
""For the toilet block in Salisbury, we were looking into native species that we are going to benefit from this river work that they were doing.
""The Poole job, it was... revealing these hidden histories.""
He said the story behind the artworks made people appreciate them more.
""When people of reflect and recognise what you're doing, I think that's when they enjoy the art work a bit more,"" he said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6dvdwjpj4o,Child damages â¬50m Rothko painting in Dutch museum,"A child has damaged a painting worth millions of pounds by the American artist Mark Rothko at a museum in Rotterdam.
A spokesperson for the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen said it was considering the ""next steps"" for the treatment of Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8.
The damage occurred during an ""unguarded moment"", a museum spokesperson told the Dutch media outlet Algemeen Dagblad (AD) last week.
A spokesperson for the museum told the BBC the damage was ""superficial"", adding: ""Small scratches are visible in the unvarnished paint layer in the lower part of the painting"".
The abstract painting is estimated to be worth up to â¬50m (Â£42.5m), according to newspaper AD.
""Conservation expertise has been sought in the Netherlands and abroad. We are currently researching the next steps for the treatment of the painting"", the museum spokesperson told the BBC.
""We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future,"" they added.
Sophie McAloone, the conservation manager at the Fine Art Restoration Company, said that ""modern unvarnished"" paintings like Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 are ""particularly susceptible to damage"".
This is ""owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,"" she said.
""In this case, scratching of the upper paint layers can have a significant impact on the viewing experience of the piece,"" Ms McAloone said.
The Rothko painting was hanging in the museum's Depot â a publicly accessible storage facility beside the main museum â as part of an exhibition displaying a selection of ""public favourites"" from the gallery's collection.
Jonny Helm, a marketing manager at the art restoration service Plowden & Smith, said the incident had implications for UK institutions such as V&A East and the British Museum, which are considering ""opening up the display of things that would otherwise be obscured in archives.""
""How will this event affect other UK institutions who are opening up their archives in the same way?"" Mr Helm said.
Restoring a Rothko painting is a difficult task because ""Rothko's mixture of pigments and resins and glues were quite complex"", Mr Helm said.
He said the fact the painting is unvarnished â meaning it is ""open to the environment"" â will pose an additional challenge to conservators.
Conservators working to restore the painting will now likely be in the process of documenting the extent of the damage and researching ""historic successful treatments"" of Rothko paintings.
""Rothko works seem to have terrible luck â this isn't the first damaged Rothko we've heard about,"" Mr Helm said.
Rothko's 1958 work, Black on Maroon, was deliberately vandalised by Wlodzimierz Umaniec at London's Tate Modern gallery in October 2012.
Umaniec was sent to prison for two years and subsequently apologised for his actions.
During his trial, prosecuting barrister Gregor McKinley said the cost of repairing the work would be about Â£200,000. It took conservators 18 months to repair the painting.
Rachel Myrtle, Head of Specie and Fine Arts at Aon, a company that offers insurance broking to its clients, said fine art insurance policies typically cover ""all risks associated with physical loss and damage to artwork"".
This includes ""accidental damage caused by children or visitors, albeit with certain exclusions"", she said.
She said that when an artwork is damaged, a gallery's insurer will appoint a specialist fine art loss adjuster to visit the museum.
The loss adjustor typically ""reviews the damage to the artwork, examines any CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the loss, and assesses conservation options"", Ms Myrtle said.
The museum did not comment on who will be held liable for the damage to the 1960 painting, which the gallery reportedly bought in the 1970s.
The Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen has previously billed visitors who have caused damage to artworks on display.
In 2011, the museum asked an unsuspecting tourist who stepped on Wim T. Schippers' peanut butter floor artwork, called Pindakaasvloer, to pay for repairs to the work.
Sharon Cohen, a spokesperson for the museum at the time, was quoted by AD as saying: ""It is normal procedure for people to pay if they damage art.""
The Rothko painting is described by the museum as an example of colour field painting, a term used to describe art characterised by large blocks of flat, solid colour spread across a canvas.
Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 painting is one of several works of modern art that have been damaged in the Netherlands in recent years.
In November 2024, multiple screen prints by the US pop artist Andy Warhol were damaged by thieves during an attempted robbery of the MPV art gallery in the town of Oisterwijk.
In another incident, a Dutch town hall admitted it ""most likely"" disposed of 46 artworks by accident â including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen â during renovation works last year.
Museums have different policies when responding to damage caused by children.
In August last year, a four-year-old boy accidentally smashed a 3,500-year-old jar into pieces at the Hecht Museum in Israel.
At the time, Hecht Museum worker Lihi Laszlo told the BBC the museum would not treat the incident ""with severity"" because ""the jar was accidentally damaged by a young child"".

Jamie Lee Matthias, who went viral after presenting an artwork to his wife on their wedding day, has painted a portrait of BBC Radio Oxford presenter Sophie Law that will be featured in Sobell House Hospice's exhibition My Lovely Postcards.
The project received submissions from more than 600 artists, including celebrities.
An exhibition of the mini masterpieces will take place this weekend at The Cloister Gallery at St John the Evangelist Church in Oxford.
Presenter Law received her portrait via the charity's fundraising director Beth Marsh, while Mr Matthias joined the show on the phone.
She said he had ""caught her best side"".
""You've caught the very witchy-looking hair I get this time of the morning when you get up,"" she said.
The picture was modelled on a photo she had taken with Tony, an ox created for BBC Radio Oxford by Oxfordshire-based yarn-bomber Yarnsy.
The artwork was sold for Â£2,800 at auction for the hospice in September.
""I've never seen a portrait of myself quite like that before,"" Law said.
Mr Matthias said he received multiple orders for his art from ""all over the world"" since going viral.
""They send such lovely messages about the joy and the laughter that it brings,"" he said.
""We advertise it as 'terrible', I know my ability in art and it's not very good.""
The project is in aid of Beth's Bursary Fund, which supports palliative care nurses with training and education.
It was set up by the family of Beth Foreman, who died aged 32 in 2016 and was cared for by Sobell House nurses.
The project has featured original pieces by celebrities including Dame Judy Dench, Mel Giedroyc and Mark Gatiss.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8eg84yye3o,Ceramic cats purchased by museum 'huge mews',"One of the artists who created a pair of cats inspired by John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress said she was left ""overwhelmed"" after they were purchased by a museum for Â£6,000.
Ceramic artists Vicky Lindo and Bill Brookes made the works Despair and Promise for the Bawden and Me exhibition at The Higgins Bedford.
Miss Lindo said: ""It's the ultimate for any artists to have your work in public collections, as when we die it will still be there.""
Victoria Partridge, The Higgins' keeper of fine and ceramic arts, said: ""I'm thrilled that we get to keep them in Bedford forever - it really is huge mews.""
Miss Lindo said: ""It's incredible - when we made the work we didn't expect that this would be the outcome.
""You make it and hope someone might want to buy it but it's never really the goal.
""It's overwhelming. It's really special because it belongs to everyone and anyone can go and look at it.""
The cats were purchased with Â£4,800 from The Arts Council England/V&A Purchase Grant Fund and Â£1,200 from The Trustees of The Cecil Higgins Art Gallery.
They were made for the Bawden and Me exhibition, which featured work by 40 artists and creators who were able to access Bawden's extensive archive to create new pieces inspired by his art.
It was one of The Higgins's most successful exhibitions and attracted 36,000 visitors, Mrs Partridge said.
Miss Lindo said she was immediately drawn to Bawden's tapestry of The Pilgrim's Progress, Bunyan's Dream.
She said she did not know the story, but listened to the audiobook as they worked, which became ""immersive research"".
Cats were chosen as the main inspiration as they are her ""DNA"" and Bawden ""was cat mad"", she added.
Ms Partridge said: ""When the cats were on display they were universally admired, especially by children, because it's a lovely way of talking about John Bunyan's story through the medium of cats.
""As soon as I saw them, when I opened the box, I knew we had to have them for the collection, because they have such amazing links with Bedford, through the work of nationally acclaimed artists.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c209q8d8zjwo,Radiohead reimagined with classical twist in home city,"A classical music ensemble's concert of Radiohead songs in the band's hometown of Oxford will feel extra special, its artistic director says.
London Concertante's Radiohead Reimagined show is touring cathedrals and abbeys across the UK, and arrives at Christ Church Cathedral on Sunday.
The ensemble, used to performing the works of Bach, Vivaldi, and Vaughan Williams, will reinterpret songs from the band's entire catalogue.
Chris Grist, who is also founder of the orchestra, tells the BBC: ""The fact that Radiohead are from Oxford, for us to bring the show there feels like a real homecoming.""
It means reimagining both the guitar anthems and alternative rock from their breakthrough albums The Bends and OK Computer, through to their more experimental later releases, such as Kid A and In Rainbows.
Grist says he spent an ""awful lot of time listening to every single Radiohead album"", and that whittling down the songs was difficult.
""It has been a really fun challenge and we've tried not to shy away from really musically-challenging situations,"" he says.
Radiohead's cultural legacy has been expanding in recent years.
Upcoming productions include an art exhibition at the prestigious Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and a stage show at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford Upon Avon that will combine the Bard's Hamlet with their Hail to the Thief album.
Grist believes that a former ""perceived snobbery"" in the art and classical world is ""evaporating"", as the opportunities rock music can bring become evident.
""[This] can be a starting point for the listener to then explore further the world of classical music, and that's certainly our aim whilst we're creating this show,"" he says.
""There is such a line that goes through from the great masters to great rock music, and the way that we've approached it is to not dumb down anything about the music that we're presenting.
""So for a Radiohead fan, they'll hear their favourite tunes in a slightly different way, but for a classical music audience who perhaps aren't familiar with the Radiohead repertoire, they'll hear a symphonic concert that happens to be music by Radiohead.
""It's our way of trying to bridge that gap.""
Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood is classically-trained and has written extensively for orchestras before, and both he and Thom Yorke have separately worked on soundtracks for filmmakers such as Paul Thomas Anderson, Jane Campion, Lynne Ramsay, and Luca Guadagnino.
Grist says both are ""immersed in that world"" which makes their compositions so ideal to work on.
""You can tell from their writing and music that their musical brains are thoroughly engaged,"" he says.
""When you delve deep into what they've created, there is harmonic and rhythmic complexity, and even simple melodic lines are used so effectively.""
He adds: ""There's an ethereal quality to their music, which is going to lend itself so well to the venues we're going to play, particularly Christ Church.
""It's such an iconic and beautiful venue to be in, and hopefully we'll convey that through the music.
""For an audience it's all about the partnership between the venue, the music, and the ambience of what they're seeing, and I think that's why live music is still so alive today because it's the only opportunity where listeners get to experience that full immersive element.""

The exhibition will be on display at the city's Central Library from 28 April to 10 May.
A small selection of images is also on show in K Teas Cakes cafe on St George's Parade, while a pop-up gallery has been planned in the 01902 Urban Rooms on Queen Square in December.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kx251j2gjo,Roman-style mosaic unveiled at sea watching spot,"A Roman-style mosaic has been unveiled at a sea life viewing station on the Scarborough coast.
The artwork, by Turner Prize winner Jeremy Deller and mosaicist Coralie Turpin, measures 27.5ft (8.4m) long and 20ft (6m) wide and is a permanent installation.
It spans the floor of a new sea watching station on Marine Drive, which is a renovated 1990s seaside shelter with free telescopes for viewing marine life.
Deller said: ""I wanted to make a piece of public art that didn't get in the way of the view because there's a great view here.""
""It's meant to be almost invisible until you stand on it and I like the idea of that,"" he said.
Deller came up with the idea for a Roman mosaic reflecting the wildlife in Scarborough and Turpin helped bring it to life.
It depicts a whale, a ship, dolphins and the various marine life on the Scarborough coast.
""Coralie is a mosaicist and she knew how to make an idea happen,"" Deller said.
""The idea is sometimes the easy bit, making something that is thousands of hours of work is the difficult part.""
Alongside her team, Turpin hand cut up to 300,000 pieces of tile to put the mosaic together, which took six months to complete.
""It looks like it has been discovered during an archaeological dig,"" she said.
""It's fragmentary, so you would only have found little sections of it.""
Turpin said the colour scheme was based on Roman mosaics, which had originally been made using marble.
The project was a collaboration between art and science organisation Invisible Dust and Yorkshire Wildlife Trust.
Jeanine Griffin, curator at Invisible Dust, said: ""The aim is to really engage people with the amazing wildlife on their doorstep and draw in people who are interested in nature and culture to Scarborough, as a year-round tourist offer.
""It's a really beautiful spot elevated above the sea, you can see right over the seawall to look at pods of dolphins.""

Flying Start is the story of Harry, who has an extravagant stunt lined up for Ipswich Town's final match of the season, but his wife is going into labour.
It is part of the annual Ink festival in Halesworth, Suffolk - a showcase of new short plays.
Writer Mary Onions said: ""My son-in-law is a big Ipswich Town fan, so we have been sharing the ups and downs with him over the past year.... mainly downs.""
Ipswich secured promotion after finishing second in the Championship in the 2023/24 season, sparking jubilant celebrations from supporters.
However, their time in the top flight has been spent towards the bottom of the table, with just four wins so far.
They face Newcastle at 15:00 BST, with four subsequent matches before the end of the season.
Anything but a win at St James' Park will confirm relegation, and even then the Blues would need a dramatic change in fortune to stay up.
The Ink Festival spans five days, showcasing over 70 new short plays, staged in multiple venues around Halesworth by professional actors and directors.
The final pieces are selected from over 1,000 submissions, which are open to all writers at any stage of their careers.
Flying Start was part of Pod Seven, four plays directed by Callum Berridge and performed by Ben Elder and Charlotte Parry.
Mr Berridge, who is associate director at Eastern Angles theatre company based in Ipswich, said: ""Instantly when I saw Mary's play I knew it was going to be such a crowd pleaser.
""There are so few platforms for writers to have their work showcased, so Ink is a really key part of the theatre ecology in Suffolk.""
This year Young Ones star Nigel Planer is one of the Inkredibles - famous supporters who have written a play for the festival.
He told BBC Radio Suffolk: ""It's the only [festival] for playwrights, as far as I know.
""That's very important because getting a play on; getting a theatre, getting actors, we'll try and pay them, it's the hardest thing in the world!
""And it's not just emerging writers, almost every writer I know has this problem, just getting their work on.
""I think all playwrights are just thirsty for the experience of seeing their work performed, so Ink is incredibly important.""
Following the four days of programming, the festival hosts have invited schools to see performances from Monday, with some performances developed to tour.
Ink director Julia Sowerbutts said: ""If you see a play, whether it is about bullying or being gay, or all sorts of subjects, it can be very enlightening.
""People can sometimes think we are just a fluffy theatre company, but we've done a play about county lines which has been seen by thousands of young people. I am certain that has saved lives.
""We have just been asked by the NHS to write a play about youth suicide, so we will tour that after the festival.
""I think it is really important, but it is sometimes difficult to convince people how important it really is.""

Yeovil's Octagon Theatre in Somerset shut in April 2023 to allow for a Â£15m upgrade. But there have been multiple delays, with people waiting for Somerset Council to submit a revised business after the initial proposals were scaled down.
Rich Walters, vice chairman of the town's Civic Players, said: ""Community theatre is not just a bit of fun, it feeds into the whole of society.""
Somerset Council spokesperson said the authority remained committed to reopening the theatre, with work expected to be completed in 2026 or 2027.
The Swan Theatre is now the only community theatre open in the town, offering audiences a 131-seat auditorium and a stage.
A crowdfunder has been launched to help this volunteer-run venue upgrade while The Octagon is closed.
Mark Payne, chair of The Swan Theatre Company, said there is ""a lot of appetite"" for local people aspiring to break into the arts.
But, Mr Walters said there is now a shortage of performing arts space in the area.
He said: ""All of us miss The Octagon - the opportunity to work at a professional theatre is amazing.
""A lot of people from this area who may have worked with societies have gone on to professional training and are now working as professionals in the industry.""
He is concerned that the lack of theatre space will negatively impact young people.
""We all know the pressure on children these days is even more intense now and to have something like theatre to express themselves and meet other likeminded people... the impact cannot be underestimated,"" he added.
Both of the actors said that the closure of The Octagon has had an ""enormous"" impact on audiences too, with some productions unable to tour to the area because of a lack of space or availability.
A council spokesperson said they recognised the theatre's importance as an arts and entertainment venue.
They added that work is under way on submitting a revised business case to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.
The refurbishment has been scaled down from the initial Â£30m plan, due to rising costs making the original project ""unviable"".
The timescale of the project is subject to a wider review with a newly appointed design team, but more clarity is expected ""in the coming weeks"".
Councillor Federica Smith-Roberts, lead member for communities, said: ""The Octagon Theatre redevelopment is a pivotal project that will modernise the venue for the whole of Somerset, making it a hub for cultural expression.""
Mr Payne added the closure is ""a really sad thing for the town"".
""We know that there's procedures to go through, but it's taken such a long time already,"" Mr Walters added.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1egqq06n5eo,'UFO' and light shows close culture festival,"A year-long festival celebrating 50 years of the Calderdale borough will come to an end this weekend, with the grand finale showcasing a series of light installations.
The Beacons event will see a UFO-like sphere shine in Todmorden, while a ""searchlight spectacular"" will light up the Old Flour Mill in Brighouse and a ""halo of light"" will be visible over Halifax.
April has seen 50 events in the CultureDale programme, marking every year since the metropolitan borough was formed in 1974.
Danielle Durrans of Calderdale Council said: ""We knew we wanted something huge and memorable to give Calderdale the 50th birthday party it deserves, and the Year of Culture has certainly done that.""
The light shows are the culmination of more than 350 events to have taken place during CultureDale.
The UFO-inspired piece, located at the Canal Basin off Burnley Road in Todmorden, is by local artist Aimee Grundell, who said people would ""witness a fusion of mystery, light and sound"".
The backdrop for the bright beams of Brighouse will be the ROKT Activity Centre in the Old Flour Mill.
Organisers said the beams would be visible for miles and would ""dance and play"" throughout the sky on Saturday and Sunday from 20:00 until 22:00 BST.
The sight would be a ""celebration of Brighouse and its enduring spirit"", the council said.
Meanwhile in Halifax, the sky across Beacon Hill will see a ""halo of light"" weaving patterns across the clouds.
Organisers have called it a celebration of Halifax - its landscape, heritage and spirit.
The Wainhouse Tower will also be lit up in colour.
Durrans, cabinet member for public services and communities, said: ""CultureDale has showcased the borough's creativity, talent, distinctiveness and diversity, and will be part of its story for generations to come.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2de81de8xro,'Heartbreak' as VE Day post box decorations stolen,"People say they have been left ""heartbroken"" after a decorative knitted post box topper created for VE day has been stolen.
Kingswood Town Council worked with local knitting shop, Yarn and Yardage, to produce the two elaborate toppers to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two.
In a post on Facebook, council bosses said they were ""completely heartbroken"" after a knitted Lancaster Bomber that formed part of one of the designs was stolen, and they are now calling for them to be returned.
""It's really heartbreaking because one person's spent hours doing that and everyone's been really excited to see the finished product,"" said Alice Twinn, from the council.
""The team and the local community are really upset that it's happened,"" she added.
""We've had messages from parents who take their children to see the toppers and they've been really disappointed to see that its been damaged in this way.""
Toppers were also been created to celebrate Christmas, Easter and other big events over the last year - but this is the first time they have been significantly vandalised.
""When we started a lot of people said they would get damaged and we really wanted to challenge that because the community deserves nice things regardless of reputation and we've been really pleased that they've been so well respected,"" said Ms Twinn.
Carly Morrish is the owner of Yarn and Yardage and set up the yarn bombing group that made the topper.
""The team are already planning something to replace it and that speaks volumes of the people in this group because they will not be beaten,"" she said.
""Every time we have an idea we level up and draw on each others skills to make it bigger and better - our motto is that yarn will always win!""
The council said they have put in a request to the police for CCTV.
They have also invited anyone who is in possession of the stolen plane to hand it in to Yarn and Yardage where no questions will be asked.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnv58ejyrpzo,Warhol print accidentally thrown away by Dutch town hall,"A Dutch town hall has admitted that it ""most likely"" accidentally disposed of 46 artworks, including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen, during renovation works last year.
Maashorst municipality said the works, including a 1980s silkscreen print of Queen Beatrix worth about â¬15,000 (Â£12,800), disappeared during work on a town hall last year.
An investigation said the artworks were stored in a basement during renovations and a lack of guidelines for storing the artworks could have been among the reasons why they ended up being thrown away.
Mayor Hans van der Pas told public broadcaster Omroep Brabant: ""That's not how you treat valuables. But it happened. We regret that.""
A statement by the municipality on Thursday said the artworks were put into storage during work on a town hall in Uden - which is being incorporated into the neighbouring municipality of Landerd to form the Maashorst municipality.
""It's most likely that the artworks were accidentally taken away with the trash,"" they said.
A report by investigators found that some of the artworks were stored in wheelie bins in the basement and were ""not handled with care"", according to daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad.
The report concluded: ""Ownership was not properly established, no policies and procedures were established regarding the renovation and insufficient action was taken when the artworks turned out to be missing.""
It went on to say that a lack of guidelines for registration, storage, conservation and security of the artworks, were also contributing factors.
Local media reports that the 46 artworks altogether were worth around â¬22,000 (Â£18,800) and the Maashorst municipality said it was unlikely they will ever be found.
Queen Beatrix reigned as queen of the Netherlands from 1980 until she abdicated in 2013, when she was succeeded by her son King Willem-Alexander.
The Queen Beatrix print was part of Warhol's series Reigning Queens, which comprised of 16 colourful prints of four monarchs, including the late Queen Elizabeth II, Margrethe II of Denmark - who abdicated in 2023 - and Queen Ntombi Twala of Eswatini, previously known as Swaziland.
Warhol, considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century, created the prints in 1985 - two years before his death.
In November last year, Warhol prints of Queen Beatrix and Ntombi Twala were stolen - and abandoned - during a heist on a Dutch art gallery.
Local police at the time said thieves took four silkscreen prints from the MPV Gallery in the North Brabant province and fled by car.
But the portraits of Queen Beatrix and Queen Ntombi were later abandoned because they did not fit in the vehicle, NOS reported at the time.",Vicky Wong,25 April 2025,0

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y29172nd8o,Elgar's four-legged friend returns to Hereford,"A much loved pet that inspired the composer Edward Elgar has been honoured in a stone sculpture.
Dan the bulldog is the hero of Elgar's 11th Enigma Variation, but a wooden statue in Hereford installed in 2002 was looking a bit worse for wear.
With funding from Hereford Guild of Mayor's Guides, a new sculpture of Dan has been carved in local sandstone and will soon be back on the banks of the River Wye.
""It's amazing. For so long, when we've taken our walks along the river bank we've been a bit sorry to show people poor old Dan in his shabby state,"" said Angela Eaton from the guild.
""He was thrown into the river at one point and travelled downstream to Mordiford, where he was spotted by a local resident,"" Ms Eaton said.
""He installed him in his own garden and tried to hold Herefordshire Council to ransom for not looking after him properly.""
The original Dan was a much-loved pet of the former organist at Hereford Cathedral, George Robertson Sinclair.
In 1898, he was walking along the River Wye with his friend Edward Elgar when Dan fell into the water.
All 14 parts of Elgar's orchestral work are inspired by one of his friends.
He dedicated the 11th to Dan and recreated the sounds of him falling down the bank, paddling upstream and celebrating climbing out with a bark.
The new sculpture has been carved by Saul Sheldon at Hereford Cathedral's Stonemason's Yard, a few metres away from where the real Dan lived.
""He's climbing out of the reeds, out of the river,"" said Mr Sheldon.
""If he was just sat there, gazing up at the clouds it would have been a bit easier I suppose but it's nice to do something a bit different.
""The old wooden one, he's been on his travels down the Wye.
""Hopefully this one will be much harder to tip over, that's for sure.""
The new stone Dan has been funded by the Hereford Guild of Mayor's Guides, the Elmley Foundation, Hereford City Council and the Herefordshire Community Foundation.
He will be on permanent display on the Bishop's Meadow, opposite Hereford Cathedral.
The sculpture will be unveiled on 26 July to mark the opening of the Three Choirs Festival in Hereford.
The original wooden carving of Dan will be put on display at Hereford Museum.",Nicola Goodwin,25 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8k78nvj83o,Grande dame hangs up her ballet shoes aged 89,"Sheena Gough is 89 years old but she can easily lift her leg on to a ballet barre to demonstrate elegant dance moves to her class.
The ballet teacher, who trained in London and Paris, has pupils who travel hundreds of miles every week for her 90-minute lessons in Edinburgh.
But now the grande dame has decided to hang up her ballet shoes after a 72 year career.
BBC Scotland News joined her last class in the Stockbridge area of the city, where her students said it was the ""end of an era"".
Sheena enrolled at the Scottish School of Ballet in Grosvenor Crescent in Edinburgh when she was 14 years old.
By the age of 17, her talent had caught the eye of English ballet dancer and choreographer Anton Dolin - who begged her parents to let her be taught by Bolshoi-trained Olga Preobrajenska in Paris.
""Fortunately my parents agreed,"" Sheena said.
""I was really rather nervous, my parents took me over in the car and dropped me off at someone's flat in Paris and left me to get on with it.
""It wasn't even a school, she was just somebody that famous dancers from all over the world would go to to attend her classes, so it was a little bit daunting.""
Margot Fonteyn - the Royal Ballet prima ballerina -  was among Sheena's fellow pupils in the classes, which were conducted in French.
""She was sweet, I remember her having difficulty with one of the steps. It was all quite an adventure,"" Sheena said.
But it was when she moved to London that she badly injured her ankle while doing pointe work - where dancers perform on the tips of their toes - and her parents told her to travel back to Edinburgh while it healed.
There she helped with the teaching at her former ballet school during her recovery.
""And lo and behold I discovered I was far happier teaching than performing - and I've never looked back. I've been teaching ever since,"" she said.
Ian Johnston, 60, regularly makes a 200-mile round trip from Castle Douglas to join Sheena's lessons.
He first joined her class when he lived in Edinburgh in 1991. Now he brings his son, Sandy.
""I travel this distance every week because Sheena is one of a kind, her classes are inspirational and her teaching style is very exciting,"" he said.
Ian contacted the BBC through Your Voice, Your BBC News to suggest we tell Sheena's story.
""There is nobody else who teaches quite like her,"" Ian added.
""Her classes are notoriously tough and rewarding.
""It's going to be quite a shock not to have her anymore but I will hear her corrections in my head and her saying, 'Where's your face? Where's the join? Where's the excitement?' every time I do other classes in the future.""
Ian's son, Sandy, added: ""I can't tell you how much I will miss the classes, they are the best I have ever been to and unlike anything else.
""She doesn't let us away with anything, she notices everything, and she knows what you can aim for.
""I'm very sad she's retiring because you don't find many classes like these anymore.""
Sheena said she decided to retire after worrying she might not be able to remain at her peak.
But she is not planning to have a rest.
""There is the garden and my house to tidy up,"" she said.
""I think I ought to make it easier for anybody who has to sort it out after I go.""
Another pupil, data scientist Ryan Mcmanus, said it was the end of an era.
The 34-year-old, who travels more than 100 miles every week for the class, said: ""It's the highlight of my every week to come along and have a great time learning how to do things and getting corrections.
""I have been to other classes and what I like about Sheena is she is very insistent on the fundamentals: on correct placement, correct posture, on correct technique.
""I've seen a vast improvement in me and it's entirely down to her correctness, which I really appreciate coming from a scientific background myself.
""I had tears in my eyes when the class ended, I'm so sad and I sincerely doubt we will be able to find anyone like her again.""
Tracy Hawkes, a ballet dancer who owns the dance studio in St Stephen Street where Sheen's classes are held, said the teacher had left a wonderful legacy.
""She's certainly one of the grande dames in Scotland,"" she said.
""To have someone who has been through decades of change in style and methods of teaching but has continued to have been such a font of all knowledge and experience, to have someone who is nearly 90 still doing that is just amazing.
""I've been so proud to have her here at the studio and it's a very sad day now she's retiring.""
Some of Sheena's pupils have gone on to the Royal Ballet, International Ballet and the British Ballet.
""One of my former pupils is about to move to the Scottish Ballet and when he heard I was retiring he was on the phone saying he wants private lessons, I'll get you tickets to come see me dance if you just give me some private lessons,"" Sheena said.
""So, it's meant to be the end - but we'll see.""",Angie Brown,25 April 2025,0

Weymouth and Portland received a combined Â£60,000 from Dorset Council in funding as part of the new County of Culture scheme.
Every year, the initiative, run by the Arts Development Company, sees a different town, village or hamlet in Dorset named as the host, with last year's winner being Bridport.
The locally based not-for-profit arts organisation, B-Side, is working with both town councils to organise events for the next 12 months.
This evening St Nics Gallery in Weymouth will host what organisers called ""an unforgettable evening of music, art and dance"".
Activities from ballet and brass bands to natural history walks, film clubs, DJ nights festivals and more are expected over the next year.
Starting this weekend, there will be street performances in Weymouth Town Centre and a brass brand playing at the Portland High Angle Battery.
Reveal is the name of this year's scheme, because the board said it wanted to uncover creativity and change the way that people conceive of towns that sit in rural or coastal settings.
Director Rocca Holly-Nambi said: ""Our communities have so much to offer creatively, and our places are rich with culture.
""We see this year as a springboard for working together, celebrating who we are, and putting in place solid foundations for a thriving cultural sector for years to come.""

https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250423-the-masterpiece-full-of-coded-messages-about-ww1,The overlooked masterpiece full of coded messages about WW1,"Esoteric and pioneering, the paintings of a lesser-known Pre-Raphaelite, Evelyn De Morgan, explored the trauma and meaning of war â and prefigured current fantasy art.
On a rocky beach that glows red with lava, smoke-breathing dragons surround wretched-looking prisoners beseeching an angel to deliver them from suffering. The oil painting Death of the Dragon by Evelyn De Morgan looks at first like a scene from the New Testament's apocalyptic Book of Revelation. But, painted between 1914 and 1918, it's also something more personal and critical: an allegory for the misery and bondage of World War One, and the confrontation between good and evil.
The spectacular painting, measuring more than a metre high, is one of the highlights of a new exhibition, Evelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian London, at London's Guildhall Art Gallery, home to the City of London Corporation's art collection. On display are rarely seen works from the De Morgan Foundation, as well as two newly-restored paintings and two recreations, completed just last year, of works lost in an art warehouse fire in 1991.
The show coincides with the reopening of the De Morgan Museum in Barnsley, Yorkshire, following an extensive roof renovation, and responds to a rising interest in this lesser-known artist. She has tended to be eclipsed by her husband William â a ceramicist and writer, who had worked early in his career with the textile designer William Morris â and the famous men in their circle: her uncle and art teacher, John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, for example, and the painters William Holman Hunt and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Much of what we know about De Morgan today comes from her sister Wilhelmina, who set up the De Morgan Foundation, but even she saw fit to publish the couple's posthumous biography under the title William De Morgan and his Wife.
Yet, Evelyn De Morgan more than deserves the art world's belated acclaim. A Slade graduate, who was working at the tail end of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, she took the arguably twee or overly sentimental genre into new territory, creating tableaux that were unusually visionary and energetic. The women she portrayed were less passive than those depicted by her contemporaries, and featured as symbols of agency rather than objects of the male gaze. Instead of a drowned body floating down the river, as in Sir John Everett Millais' Ophelia, or figures whose main currency was their looks, we meet a skilled sorceress creating magical potions and flying superheroines who can cast rain, thunder and lightning from their fingers.
These goddess-like figures show the influence of the classical art that De Morgan had studied. Immaculately executed works such as Boreas and Oreithyia (1896) reveal her interest in mythology and her mastery of the human form, reminiscent of Michelangelo.
In Death of the Dragon, in terms of composition, it's easy to see the influence of Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus (1483â1485), which De Morgan had visited in Florence. If De Morgan's haloed angel echoes this idea of rebirth â reflecting the artist's belief in a spiritual afterlife â then the winged beasts are its counterpart, Death, always biting at the heels of the people and threatening to overcome them. Elsewhere in her work, Death takes alternative forms: a dark angel bearing a scythe, sea monsters or â more obliquely â a sand timer. It's a symbolism that speaks to life's transience, and acquires additional poignancy in her later work, conveying the collective trauma of living through a World War that claimed close to a million British lives.
""During the First World War they [the De Morgans] were in London, so they would have been directly affected,"" Jean McMeakin, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the De Morgan Foundation, tells the BBC. ""Death was real for them in a way that perhaps we've largely forgotten these days,"" she points out. ""Members of William's family died from tuberculosis, and his own health was often quite poor. Death was, in a way, always present in the background.""

De Morgan was a pacifist and her art became a form of activism. In Our Lady of Peace (1907), a response to the Boer Wars, a knight pleads for protection and peace, while in The Poor Man who Saved the City (1901), wisdom and diplomacy are advocated as alternatives to military intervention. Later, in The Red Cross (1914-16), angels carry the crucified Christ over a withered landscape pierced by Belgian war graves â a suggestion, perhaps, that the Christian faith is at odds with the brutality of war, but offers us hope of redemption. ""You must never praise war,"" De Morgan declared in The Result of an Experiment (1909), a book of ""automatic writing"" co-authored with her husband. ""The Devil invented it, and you can have no conception of its horrors.""
The idea of the forces of good and evil acting upon ordinary people was pervasive at this time. ""Spiritualism was quite popular,"" asserts McMeakin, citing the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle â the creator of Sherlock Holmes â as one of its most famous adherents. Other-worldly beliefs, she says, were ""probably the result of the turmoil, the massive changes happening in society leading up to the turn of the century, plus a period of many wars, which would have had an impact on their view of the world"". Doubtless, De Morgan was also influenced by her mother-in-law, Sophia, a well-known spiritualist and medium. With so many lives lost, it was no doubt tempting to believe that you could reconnect with the departed.
For De Morgan, materialism was in opposition to spirituality, and many of her works conflate the pursuit of wealth with death. Crowns, as worn by the winged serpents in Death of the Dragon, are a repeated motif denoting greed and miserliness. In Earthbound (1897), an avaricious king in a gold cloak patterned with coins is about to be overwhelmed by the angel of death, while in The Barred Gate (c.1910-1914), a similar figure is denied entry to Heaven.
With the future so uncertain, De Morgan places the importance of spiritual fulfilment and happiness at the centre of much of her work. In Blindness and Cupidity Chasing Joy from the City (1897), for example, ""Cupidity"" is personified as a crowned figure clutching treasures who is driving away ""Joy"" in the form of an angel. Here, as in Death of the Dragon, the central characters are chained, suggesting trapped souls.
In The Prisoner (1907-1908), the barred window and a woman's chained wrists make captivity a metaphor for gender inequality, hinting at the De Morgans' support for universal suffrage (Evelyn was a signatory of at least two important petitions, while her husband was vice-president of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage). The theme recurs in Luna (1885), where the rope-bound body of a moon goddess, a mythological figure of feminine power, functions as a metaphor for a woman's struggle to influence her own destiny.
Christened ""Mary"", Evelyn later adopted her then-gender-neutral middle name, as women's art was not taken seriously. ""She wanted to be considered on the same level as her male peers,"" says McMeakin. ""We can assume a huge degree of self-possession and determination in her desire to become a professional artist,"" she adds, making the point that even De Morgan's mother opposed her career choice.
Technically, De Morgan was also a pioneer. She experimented with burnishing and rubbing gold pigment into her works to add depth and interest, and explored new painting techniques invented by her husband, made by grinding colours with glycerine and spirit. Stylistically, she was also ahead of her time. The unconventional use of pinks and purples, and the bold rings of rainbow-coloured light, prefigure the psychedelic painting styles of the 1970s, while her terrifying monsters would not look out of place in contemporary fantasy art.
While art history has tended to paint women as virgin mothers, objects of beauty or temptresses, De Morgan's specifically female perspective recasts them as figures of hope that augur an alternative, brighter future. In Lux in Tenebris (light in darkness) (1895), for example, the female figure holds an olive branch in her right hand, offering a pathway to peace. In Death of the Dragon, the angel is surrounded by a magnificent rainbow: a symbol (along with the sky) of joy that denotes spiritual fulfilment and freedom, as well as the promise of an afterlife.
It's a mistake to think of works such as Death of the Dragon as ""completely bleak"", argues McMeakin, noting that ""often with [her] apocalyptic scenes, there is a glimmer of hope, or a part of the painting that is calm"". In many ways, Death of the Dragon is optimistic, expressing a sense that the war â the metaphorical dragon â is nearing its end, and that good can overcome evil. In this existential battle, De Morgan saw a place for her work. When she was agedÂ  just 17, she chastised herself for not painting enough. ""Art is eternal, but life is short,"" she wrote in her diary. ""I will make up for it now, I have not a moment to lose.""
Evelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian London is at the Guildhall Art Gallery, London until 4 January 2026.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c793l125gwvo,'We'll do Paddington proud' - Tom Fletcher reveals details of musical,"McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt ""overwhelming excitement"" working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November.
The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would ""do Paddington proud"", adding that the musical numbers are ""my favourite songs I've ever written"".
The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.
The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.
Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt ""so honoured and lucky"" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect ""all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly"".
""There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,"" he joked.
Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.
He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the show was formally announced in 2023.
With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature ""lots of juicy new material"".
""We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,"" she said.
""Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.""
Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.
The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.
Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what ""the musical language"" of Paddington was. ""Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,"" he explained.
He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with ""a very fast 'yes please'"", but began writing music for the show right away.
""While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.""
He reflected: ""My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.""
The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.
In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.
It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.
""I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!"" joked Swale. ""He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!""
She continued: ""I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.""

Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for ""really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do itâ, adding: âEvery single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.
""I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.""
As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical ""also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington"".
""For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.""
Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be ""fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right"".
He added: ""I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.""
The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, ""so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in"", he explained.
""It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.""
Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.
""You can rest easy,"" laughed Swale. ""Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.""",Steven McIntosh,24 April 2025,0

There will be 86 concerts in all, with a number taking place in Gateshead, Bristol, Bradford, Belfast and Sunderland.
Tickets go on sale at 9am on 17 May. On-the-day ""Promming"" tickets are Â£8 including booking fees, and seated tickets start from Â£10 plus booking fees.
The all-nighter, on 8 August, is being planned by organist Anna Lapwood, who said the idea had been several years in the making.
""I spend a lot of time at the Albert Hall in the middle of the night, practising, and I find it fascinating that the building is still just running overnight,"" she says.
""There are always people there - cleaners and security guards - a bit like A Night At The Museum.
""So we talked about how fun it would be to be able to invite people into that space, both physically, but also the abstract space of being in an iconic building in the middle of the night.""
Her programme will include YouTube pianist Hayato Sumino, Russian cellist Anastasia Kobekina and Norwegian ensemble Barroksolistene, whose ""Alehouse sessions"" aim to recreate the atmosphere of a 17th Century English tavern.
Lapwood says the artists are all connected by an enthusiasm for ""messing around"" with music, citing Sumino's viral video of the ""seven degrees of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"".
""There are various moments where we're hoping to do some collaborations,"" she reveals. ""But the logistics of this are all very, very complicated, not least trying to figure out everyone's sleep schedules!""
This summer's season is the first since the departure of Proms director David Pickard. He has been replaced by Hannah Donat who, as director of artistic planning, had shaped the festival alongside the controller of BBC Radio 3, Sam Jackson.
""I think of the Proms as the classical music equivalent of Wimbledon,"" she says.
""Everyone likes to go to Wimbledon, even if they don't watch tennis for the rest of the year; and everyone likes to go to a Prom, even if they're not going to concerts for the rest of the season.""
""It gives the concerts a warmth and an informal atmosphere.
""People don't worry too much about knowing the repertoire inside out - there's just something spectacular about the Albert Hall and seeing the orchestra onstage.""

Among the concerts to watch out for are:
19 July: The Great American Songbook and Beyond with Samara Joy. Fresh from winning best jazz album at this year's Grammys, US singer Samara Joy teams up with the BBC Concert Orchestra for a night of standards by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holliday.
20 July: Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand. The world's only professional one-handed concert pianist, Nicholas McCarthy, makes his Proms debut, playing a concerto originally written for Paul Wittgenstein, after he lost his right arm during World War One.
26 July: The Traitors. ""I've asked for a cloak and an owl,"" says Claudia Winkelman, ahead of this one-off concert, featuring classical pieces ""with betrayal at their heart"" alongside the gothic re-workings of pop songs heard in the TV reality show.
2 August: Mahler's Resurrection Symphony. Canadian mezzo-soprano Emily D'Angelo, whose voice has been called ""a thing of wonder"", makes her Proms debut with Norwegian soprano Mari Eriksmoen and the HallÃ© orchestra.
8 August: 100 Years of the Shipping Forecast. The subtle magic of the Shipping Forecast is celebrated in a special concert, in Belfast's Ulster Hall, featuring Radio 4's continuity announcers and a new work by poet laureate Simon Armitage.
9 August: The Planets and Star Wars. The National Youth Orchestra play two of the world's most recognisable pieces of orchestral music, with an intergalactic theme.
10 August: Edward Gardner Conducts the LPO. Taking a journey through icy waters and cascading waterfalls, the London Philharmonic present a quartet of pieces, including Debussy's La Mer and Sibelius's Oceanides - with an aquatic theme. Electrifying mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina joins in, for her Proms debut.
14 August: Joe Hisaishi and Steve Reich. Legendary Studio Ghibli composer Joe Hisaishi makes his Proms debut conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in two large-scale works exploring themes of destruction and loss - including his piece The End of the World, reflecting the ""anxiety and chaos"" after the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York.
23 August: MÃ¤kelÃ¤ conducts Mahler's Fifth. Finnish conductor Klaus MÃ¤kelÃ¤ isn't yet 30, but his electrifying performances have already made headlines around the world. He comes to the Proms with the Dutch Concertgebouw Orchestra, to play Mahler's leonine fifth symphony.
7 September: Angelique Kidjo - African Symphony. ""I want to show the world the richness and beauty of African culture,"" says the Beninese-French music icon Angelique Kidjo of her return to the Proms. Part of Bradford's City of Culture programme, her concert will highlight iconic tracks from legends including Miriam Makeba, Fela Kuti and Youssou N'Dour.
The season concludes with the traditional ""Last Night"" on 13 September, conducted by Elim Chan.
Soprano Louise Alder and trumpeter Alison Balsom will make star turns, alongside the traditional medley of sea shanties, Pomp and Circumstance and Auld Lang Syne.
The concert will also include Donat's favourite ""Easter egg"" for her first year in charge.
""There's a piece of music that I'd wanted to get into the Proms for some time,"" she says, referring to Arthur Benjamin's Storm Cloud Contata.
The music was originally written for Alfred Hitchcock's spy thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1934; and re-arranged by Bernard Herrmann for Hitchcock's Hollywood remake in 1956.
""The final scene takes place in the Albert Hall,"" explains Donat, ""and while Jimmy Stewart's chasing this assassin around the building, Bernard Herrmann is conducting the orchestra on stage - and that's the piece we're including in the Last Night of the Proms.
""It's one of those little winks to the audience that I like to include during the season.""
For those who cannot attend, all of the concerts will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Sounds, and 25 of the nights will be televised.",Mark Savage,24 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250422-the-gory-shakespeare-play-that-makes-people-faint,The gory Shakespeare play that makes people faint,"Tragedy Titus Andronicus is the Bard's goriest work, and a new production is set to be one of the most extreme takes on it yet. It raises the question: why do we watch such brutality?
Good theatre has the power to really move us â a statement that's usually taken metaphorically, rather than literally. Yet when it comes to Shakespeare's bloodiest play, Titus Andronicus, its impact can be so visceral it causes audience members to faint. I should know: while reviewing a production at Shakespeare's Globe in London, back in 2014, its disturbingly violent scenes caused me to start to feel light-headed, even while safely sat down in my seat. Unfortunately, it was a bench with no back: before the end of the first half, I had fainted away completely, falling backwards and waking up in a stranger's lap.
Warning: this article contains some graphic descriptions of violence
And I was far from the only person to have such a full-bodied response to Lucy Bailey's production of this gory revenge tragedy: the press went wild for stories of ""droppers"", with more than 100 people fainting during the run â testament to the immense power of Shakespeare's writing, and the skill of performers, as well as to the props department's handling of litres of fake blood.
One of the Bard's earliest plays, written in 1591-2, and almost certainly his first tragedy, Titus Andronicus is a story of violent vengeance: Titus, a general of Rome, returns from wars against the Goths with their queen, Tamora, and her sons held as captives. When her eldest son is sacrificed by Titus, Tamora swears revenge â setting in motion a series of increasingly brutal acts that ends Â with an infamous scene involving the baking of pies... Boasting 14 deaths, it is the most violent of all Shakespeare's plays â and now it's back on stage, with a new production opening at the UK's Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon.
The play's unavoidable ultra-violence has meant that, for much of the performance history of Shakespeare â whose birthday is today â Titus Andronicus was considered a bit of an embarrassment, a bloody stain on his reputation: too gruesome, too over-the-top, to be considered in the same category of greatness as, say, Hamlet or Othello. Then there's its sometimes queasy tone: the excesses can tip Titus into a gleefully macabre, manic comedy (an aspect also embraced in Bailey's gore-fest). Let's just say, the Victorians were not fans.
But the play's reputation began to revive in the second half of the 20th Century. At the Royal Shakespeare Company alone, there have been several seminal productions in the past 70 years, starring Laurence Olivier (1955), Patrick Stewart (1981), Brian Cox (1987) and David Bradley (2003), while Anthony Hopkins playing Titus on screen in Julie Taymor's influential, blackly funny film version in 1999 also surely helped boost the play's standing. Some of these productions leaned heavily on the horror, too: there were fainters and walk-outs in Deborah Warner's unflinching 1987 production, which CoxÂ once claimedÂ was the most interesting play he'd done and the best stage performance he'd ever given. But he also pointed to the odd humour of the play, calling it ""a young man's playâ¦ full of energy, joie de vivre and laughter that often strikes people as ludicrous"".
Titus is notÂ alwaysÂ staged with grisly literalness: in the Olivier-starring production by Peter Brook, the mutilation of Titus's daughter Lavinia was famously suggested with stylised red streamers â an aestheticised approach also used in the Japanese Ninagawa Company's production in the 2000s. More recently, Jude Christian's all-female 2023 production in London's candle-lit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse enacted the violence on candles themselves, with cast members stabbing, snapping or snuffing them.
In the latest production of Titus Andronicus, however, there will be blood. Buckets of it. ""We are doing gallons of blood. We've made a sort of wet room [on stage], it's got a drainage system and an abattoir hookâ¦"" says Max Webster, the play's director, over a video call from Stratford-upon-Avon. He's had to figure out how to stage no fewer than 27 different acts of onstage violence, from punches through to limbs being lopped off and tongues being cut out. And the only limit on the amount of gore sloshing around is the practical question of how to clean it up between scenes. ""It's an unbelievably boring thing about how many crew members and squeegees it takes,"" laughs Webster. ""In one sentence, you're thinking 'what is the meaning of tragedy in relation to human nature?' â and then very quickly you get into 'how many mops can the crew hold?'.""
Webster, whose acclaimed productions include an adaptation of Booker Prize winner Life of Pi and a recent David Tennant-starring Macbeth, wanted to direct Titus Andronicus for one simple reason: Simon Russell Beale, one of Britain's greatest Shakespearean actors, asked him to. Titus was a part that Russell Beale fancied a crack at, and the RSC was happy to oblige. This version is updated â set in a crisp, besuited modern world riven by conflict, although where exactly is kept deliberately vague.
""It's trying to be open â we're not setting it in Kosovo or Gaza or Sudan,"" says Webster, adding swiftly ""And we're not going to try to produce the US army onstage or something â it's trying to make sense of Rome as a 'superpower of empire' rather than as 'the United States of America'.""Â Still, he sees Titus as freshly, troublingly relevant, in light of shocking events such as the 7 October Hamas attacks, the war in Gaza, and the sudden invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine, the story's extreme violence doesn't seem so unimaginable.
In this production, the violence is certainly no laughing matter. In rehearsals, they have been playing it entirely seriously, and eschewing the blackly cartoonish or stylishly Tarantino-esque approach to the violence that some directors explore. This has risks: Webster fully expects that, when the show is in front of an audience, there may be some nervous laughter; it'll be their job in previews to figure out where these laughs form a necessary ""pressure release valve"", and where they're really just a sign to make the show even more harrowing.
For Webster, it isn't possible to laugh at the brutality of Titus Andronicus in 2025 â it's too real. He sees the play as ""a howl of pain""; watching it becomes an act of witness, an attempt to face up to atrocities taking place right now â something that he acknowledges could be hard for an audience. ""I can walk down the Avon [river], and know my family is safe and it doesn't feel like the world is burning. But you look at other parts of the worldâ¦ these horrors, that maybe feel historical to us, are actually happening.""
But Titus Andronicus isn't a documentary; it's an old play, that people choose to stage and choose to pay to go to see. So why, when we could just watch the news, do we opt to watch such harrowing content as art, as entertainment? It's a question that partly motivated Russell Beale to do Titus,Â he told The Guardian last week: ""I don't understand the violence. I don't understand why as an audience we feelÂ excited, stimulated, challenged byÂ it; it's so relentless.""
It may have been shunned in later centuries, but Titus Andronicus's original audiences loved it â and many other forms of graphically horrible entertainment, from bear baiting to public hangings. Titus was a hit in Elizabethan England, and in writing it Shakespeare may, in fact, have been playing to the crowd: it resembles the super-violent revenge tragedies that were popular at the time, rarely-staged works such as Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy. Such plays were, themselves, drawing inspiration from the incredibly bloody and outrageous tragedies written by Seneca in the First Century AD â including Thyestes, a source of direct inspiration for Shakespeare, where the title character is fed a pie made of the flesh of his own children. And obviously, Ancient Greek tragedies â even if they keep acts of violence off-stage â are a rich and enduring source of creative murders of family members and cycles of bloody revenge.
Such tragedies, Webster points out, had their origins in ritual performances of sacrifice. ""I guess theatre came out of killing goats in Ancient Greeceâ¦ there's always been some relationship between theatre and violence and the sacred stuff.""
More like this:
â¢ Edward II: Did a gay love affair spark a royal crisis?
â¢ The Shakespeare words you don't know you know
â¢ The Shakespeare tragedy that speaks to us now
It does seem that watching the very worst things imaginable unfolding has an irresistible appeal â not only do we still return to Greek or Shakespearean tragedies, but we've also turned death and violence into major sources of entertainment, apparently appropriate for daily consumption. Horror films, true crime podcasts, police procedurals, first-person shooter video gamesâ¦ depictions of very, very bad things happening to bodies are pervasive across all art forms, all the time. You might even say we're addicted to the adrenaline shot we get from such emotionally-wringing, extreme forms of entertainment: research shows that the blood-pumping, heart-racing high we get from fear is close to the pleasurable bodily experience of excitement.
From the high body count of fantasy shows like Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon to the dystopian chills of Squid Game to the seemingly endless appetite for the torture porn movies of the Saw franchise, much of our creative output would make Seneca smack his lips in approval.Â But beyond the potential physical thrills, why are we so drawn to watching such violent content?
When I ask Webster, he's as unsure as Russell Beale. ""The truth is, I don't know. But thereÂ isÂ a lust to watch violence on-stage â it is a basic human urge."" He wonders if it forms a safe outlet for our innate human darkness. And a common theory as to why we enjoy the terrors of a horror movie or the bleakness of a dystopian novel is just this: that such fictional outings are a secure way for us to rehearse terrible acts â without ever having to experience those in real life. ""Maybe it is so we don't have to do [violence] in our lives?"" Webster ponders. ""We all have these weird, dark, turbulent fantasies that we don't talk about because they're not socially acceptableâ¦ so maybe seeing it on-stage is an escape, or a relief?""
The academics Haiyang Yang and Kuangjie Zhang confirm Webster's theory, sharing research in the Harvard Business Review that found that horror entertainment ""may help us (safely) satisfy our curiosity about the dark side of human psycheâ¦ As an inherently curious species, many of us are fascinated by what our own kind is capable of. Observing storylines in which actors must confront the worst parts of themselves serves as a pseudo character study of the darkest parts of the human condition.""
If I'm honest, the news that there's so much blood in Webster's Titus Andronicus that they need a drain on stage has got me nervous of watching the show, rather than gleefully ready to excise my inner demons. Is he worried that this Titus might be so powerful â so bloody, and so upsetting â that people will faint? He is not. ""It's important you provide a content warning, and then people can make an informed decision about if they want to see it,"" says Webster. ""If people faint, they faint.""
Titus Andronicus is at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 17 June

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c705knpw4r8o,'Extraordinary world-views': Turner Prize nominees revealed,"A learning disabled artist, a former Iraqi refugee and one of the youngest ever nominees are among the artists shortlisted for this year's Turner Prize.
Nnena Kalu, Mohammed Sami, Zadie Xa and Rene MatiÄ - who at 27 is the second youngest artist to be nominated after Damien Hirst - are all in the running for the prestigious annual art prize, the Tate announced on Wednesday.
An exhibition of their work will be held at the Cartwright Hall Art Gallery from September as part of Bradford's UK City of Culture celebrations.
The winner, who will be awarded Â£25,000, will then be announced on 9 December at a ceremony in the West Yorkshire city.
Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain and chair of the Turner Prize jury, said the shortlist ""reflects the breadth of artistic practice today, from painting and sculpture to photography and installation"".
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the artists, who are each guaranteed to receive Â£10,000, offer ""extraordinary world-views that are very personal"".
Take a closer look at all four shortlisted artists and their work:
Glasgow-born Nnena Kalu (above), who has limited verbal communication, has been a resident artist with Action Space, which supports artists with learning disabilities, for more than 25 years.
She creates large-scale swirling abstract drawings and sculpures made from colourful streams of repurposed fabrics and materials such as reels of VHS tape.
The jury praised her ""unique command of material, colour and gesture and her highly attuned responses to architectural space"".
Photographer, writer and poet Rene MatiÄ, from Peterborough, is nominated for their solo exhibition, As Opposed To The Truth, at CCA Berlin, which touches on the rise of right-wing populism and identities.
MatiÄ captures ""fleeting moments of joy in daily life, and expressions of tenderness within a wider political context"", according to Tate, using intimate photos of family and friends placed in an installation which also includes objects like the artist's collection of black baby dolls salvaged from second-hand shops.
The work looks at themes including ""the constructed self through the lens of rudeness"" and rudeboy culture, a Jamaican subculture.
The jury said they were ""struck by the artist's ability to express concerns around belonging and identity"".
Mohammed Sami hails from Baghdad and his work draws on his life and experiences during the Iraq war and as a refugee in Sweden.
The artist is recognised for solo exhibition After the Storm at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, and the jury were impressed by his ""powerful representation"" of war and exile.
His large-scale paintings explore memory and loss, layering patterns and colours to create ""haunting, dreamlike scenes"".
Zadie Xa comes from Vancouver, Canada, and her work is inspired by her Korean heritage and the importance of shamanic beliefs.
Interweaving paintings, murals, traditional patchwork textiles and 650 brass bells that make harmonised sounds inspired by Korean shamanic ritual bells, Xa's art focuses on the sea as ""a spiritual realm to explore traditions and folklore, speaking to a multitude of cultures"".
The jury felt the ""vibrant installation"" was a ""sophisticated development"" of her work.
Established in 1984, the prize is named after radical painter JMW Turner - who would have turned 250 on Wednesday - and is awarded each year to a British-based  artist for an ""outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work"".
Shanaz Gulzar, creative director Bradford UK City of Culture 2025, said it was ""a huge honour and privilege"" to bring the prize to the city that gave the world David Hockney.
""Bradford has produced some amazing artists, literary artists, visual artists, contemporary artists,"" she told Radio 4.
""And to have these four artists in Bradford, I think really speaks to how we're delivering our year so far, and it speaks to our audiences.""
Last year's prize was won by Jasleen Kaur, who used a vintage Ford Escort, worship bells and Irn-Bru to celebrate the Scottish Sikh community.
Other ther previous winners have included Sir Anish Kapoor (1991), Damien Hirst (1995) and Sir Steve McQueen (1999).",Paul Glynn,23 April 2025,0

Emin, a celebrated artist who grew up in Margate, hopes the feature - a ""love letter"" to the artist - will highlight the town's ""thriving contemporary art scene"", the gallery said.
Joseph Mallord William Turner, born in London on 23 April, 1775, is considered one of Britain's greatest Romantic artists.
Emin's projection of her poem For Turner from 20:00 BST on the artist's birthday is inspired by his emotive use of light and atmosphere and is part of the year-long Turner 250 festival.
Views of east Kent feature in more than 100 of Turner's 19th Century landscapes and seascapes.
Waves Breaking on a Lee Shore at Margate is currently on loan from Tate Britain and will be shown at Turner Contemporary until 26 April as part of the celebrations.
The gallery, built near to where he used to paint the sea, was named after Turner when it opened in 2011.
The Fighting Temeraire, one of his most famous works, currently features on Â£20 banknotes.
Turner Contemporary said it hoped Emin's tribute would highlight the town's ""ongoing artistic legacy and its ability to inspire generations of artists.""
The gallery will also host a free exhibition later in 2025 showcasing pieces from young Kent artists inspired by Turner's works.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7vzqvg451o,Musical brings cult classic Restless Natives to the stage,"An all-singing, all-dancing stage version of Restless Natives is aiming to introduce the cult film classic to a new audience.
Most of the cast in the new musical production weren't born when the movie was released 40 years ago.
But they say they are very aware of the film's roots and its status among fans.
The 1985 comedy was part of a boom in Scottish filmmaking, alongside movies like Local Hero and Gregory's Girl.
The modern-day Robin Hood story followed mask-wearing highwaymen the Clown and the Wolfman.
They rode a motorbike as they robbed tourists with a toy gun, then gave the money away â eventually becoming a tourist attraction in their own right.
The stage version comes complete with masks, a motorbike and the music of Big Country.
Kyle Gardiner, 27, says it is ""an honour"" to play Ronnie, also known as the Clown.
""The film's a cult classic,"" he says.
""There are so many people we've bumped into who just adore the film.""
Finlay McKillop, 26, plays Will, also known as the Wolfman.
He says the cast want to do the story justice for the die-hard fans of the original film.
""They've got the merchandise, the T-shirts, the bike with the correct registration plate - it makes us want to do an even better job,"" he says.
""I think people will enjoy it - and who doesn't love a musical?""
Kirsty MacLaren, 33, plays Margot, the tour guide whose bus is targeted by the unlikely highwaymen.
""I was too young to have seen the film originally but I think audiences are going to love it,"" says
""I think what's really nice about it is we've got all the moments in the film that everyone loves.
""So if you're a lover of the film you're going to have a great time. It's got all the Big Country tunes from the film, but it's also going to open it up to a new audience.""
When it came to turning the film into a stage musical, the producers started by asking the team behind the movie.
Restless Natives writer Ninian Dunnett is co-writing the musical, working alongside with the original director, Michael Hoffman, and producer Andy Paterson.
Ninian admits that they have been on ""a steep learning curve"" - but says the challenges have been outweighed by the thrill.
""I thank my lucky stars every day, every moment for this because it's a writer's dream to write something that means something to people and then that means something to people years later, decades later.""
He says the fundamental story of the film and the musical is one of friendship.
""It's about people who help each other out and who go on a journey to make themselves something when they haven't been given much of an opportunity in life,"" he says.
While the bigger issues about the haves and the have nots are still in the show, he wants audiences to have a good time, laugh and ""share that journey of doing something to make yourself more than you are"".

The WNO announced last year it was cutting back its spring tour in 2025 along with other measures due to ""increasing financial challenges"".
Among those supporting a campaign calling for something to be done included a host of Wales' most famous artists such as Michael Sheen, Katherine Jenkins, Ruth Jones and Sir Bryn Terfel.
While the new agreement protects members' jobs, unions said the orchestra would lose approximately 10 vacant seats, so the campaign to protect jobs was ongoing.
Members of the Musician's Union (MU) have been campaigning after WNO management said it was forced to consider making the orchestra part time and cut musicians' pay by 15%.
Its campaign, which included sustained industrial action from September to March has achieved both goals, the MU said in a statement.
The Welsh government will also provide an additional Â£1.5m to support arts organisations, the union said.
WNO is Wales' largest arts organisation and one of only two full time professional orchestras in the country.
""This is an incredibly difficult time for the arts in the UK and the opera sector has been especially hard hit, with WNO disproportionately affected and facing significant ongoing financial challenges,"" MU general secretary Naomi Pohl said.
MU regional organiser for Wales and south-west England Andy Warnock said the WNO was ""still in a fragile position overall"".
He added: ""It's essential that WNO retains its full-time performing forces, which we know is the aim of the company's new leadership, so we need politicians and both Arts Councils in England and Wales to join us for discussions on how that can be achieved.""",Charlie Buckland,23 April 2025,0

A Right Royal Heist will open at the cathedral on 3 May as part of Lincoln's Festival of History.
In 1536, items including jewels and vestments were removed from Lincoln Cathedral as part of the destruction of the monasteries after Henry VIII declared that he, not the Pope, was head of the Church of England.
Local artists are bringing the items back to life at the exhibition through digital illustration, ceramics, painting and textiles.
The register and inventory of all jewels, vestments and other ornaments was written by cathedral treasurer Henry Lytherland and has survived for more than 400 years, Lincoln Cathedral said.
Work from artists Mel Langton, Fiona Hodges, Lisa Tank and Hannah Cawthorne from Indigo Crow Gallery and costume designer Helen Symonds will be on display in the Exhibition Gallery until the end of July.
Ms Langton and Ms Hodges said they had been inspired by Henry VIII and their pieces focused on him, depicting a monstrous giant removing the objects and a ceramic sculpture showing him enthroned as the ultimate magpie, surrounded by artefacts.
Costume designer Ms Symonds said her hand-crafted headpiece was inspired by the Dean's Eye window at the cathedral.
""It pays tribute to the local people who protected the glass during times of conflict, as well as to the countless creatives and artisans who lost their work during the raids under Henry VIII,"" she said.
Fern Dawson, curator at Lincoln Cathedral, said: ""When the project was first developed, I really wanted to leave the options open for the artists involved to bring their own personality and material skills to express how the document inspired them.
""Bringing an historic document to life in this way has been really exciting and the ideas it has inspired are fantastic â we can wait for the exhibition to open and for everyone to see these new works.""
Admission to the exhibition is included in the cathedral entrance fee.

The Tbilisi-born sculptor, painter and architect divided opinion with a series of large-scale projects in Moscow, including a massive 98m (321ft) monument to Tsar Peter the Great, who famously detested the city.
Rising to fame during the Soviet era, Tsereteli led the team of designers for Moscow's 1980 Olympic Games, and later built large sculptures in cities across the world.
He was also known for his closeness to the Russian political elite, once saying that Vladimir Putin's ""healthy soul"" had inspired him to make a bronze study of the Russian president.
Tsereteli was a close friend of Moscow's mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and his position as part of the Soviet Union's upper crust allowed him to travel outside of the country, where he met Pablo Picasso in Paris.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Tsereteli was ""an artist of world renown, a public figure who knew no boundaries or obstacles in strengthening peace and supporting creativity"" in a social media post after his death.
""He will live not only in our hearts, but also in his works,"" she added.
During a row over the Peter the Great monument's future in 2010, several Moscow residents told the BBC they hated the sculpture, which at 98m is slightly taller than the Statue of Liberty.
Despite the sometimes frosty reception his works received, Tsereteli was widely respected throughout the art world, and served as the president of the Russian Academy of Arts.
His enormous constructions can be found in cities around the globe, including a monument to Christopher Columbus in Seville, Spain, and the Chronicle of Georgia monument in his hometown of Tbilisi.
They also include the ten-storey Tear of Grief monument, commemorating victims of the 11 September 2001 attacks, which stands in New Jersey. It was presented to the US by the Russian government.
Another sculpture, Good Defeats Evil, sits at the UN Headquarters in New York. It depicts St George slaying a dragon, which lies among broken fragments of US and Soviet missiles.
The work represents ""the vanquishing of nuclear war through the historic treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States"", according to the UN website.
In 2006, Tsereteli caused controversy in a small French town, which erected his huge 8.75m-tall (29 ft) bronze statue of Pope John Paul II. Opponents said the statue violated France's secularity laws.
At 110m (360ft), Tsereteli's colossal monument to Christopher Columbus's first voyage, Birth of the New World, is one of the tallest sculptures on earth. It was eventually constructed in Puerto Rico, after several US cities rejected it.
He also made smaller bronze studies of major figures including Princess Diana and Putin.
Tsereteli was also a painter - notably of flowers - and an architect who took a key role in reconstructing Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.",Ian Aikman,22 April 2025,0
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8v2789levo,Bristol mural painted for World Earth Day,"A huge new mural to celebrate Earth Day has been painted close to a primary school
Created on Kensal Road in Bristol, the artwork depicts our world among the stars as a honey bee flies around pollinating it.
Artist Farrah Fortnam, who created the mural near Victoria Park Primary School, said it is a symbol of the need to rewild the planet.
Earth Day was first held in 1970 as an educational initiative to teach people about the importance of environmentalism.
This year's theme is Our Power, Our Planet, highlighting the need for renewable energy and clean electricity.
Speaking to BBC Radio Bristol's Joe Lemer, Ms Fortnam said: ""It does look quite magical if I say so myself - thank you sunshine!
""It took me all of last week off and on, in and out of the rain, but yes, I had the heavens on my side.
""I feel like we need as much joy in our lives [as possible] at the moment.
""There's a lot of turmoil in the world as we know, but I just want us all to step back, go quiet, just focus on all the infinite beauty that's on our planet - in the universe -  and just know that you're ok.""
Ms Fortnam says some people who look closely at the mural may spot the Aquarius constellation and Orion's Belt, while more obvious is a colourful rainbow bursting out of the Earth into space.
Choosing the location on Kensal Road, she said, was a ""no brainer"", given the nearby school.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7n8d20lvo,Outdoor seating planned for theatre cafe-bar,"Concert-goers in Bradford would be able to enjoy outdoor drinks under plans to extend a cafe-bar to include outdoor seating.
Bradford Theatres, run and managed by the city council, hopes to add outdoor seating to the pedestrian area outside St George's Hall on Hall Ings.
The council has also submitted an amendment to the premises licence to allow alcohol to be sold in the seating area.
If granted, the area would seat about 40 people, and would operate from Tuesday to Saturday between 11:00 and 15:00, or into the evening on show days.
The plan comes after a Â£45m scheme to pedestrianise the city centre ended earlier this year.
The space would include outdoor chairs, tables and parasols, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Alex Ross-Shaw, Bradford Council's executive member for regeneration, planning and transport, said: ""With work on the Transforming Cities Fund Scheme coming to an end, the newly pedestrianised areas are already attracting more people to the city centre.
""The vision was to create traffic-free spaces for people, which are easy to get around and pleasant for people to spend time.
""It was always envisaged that newly pedestrian areas would be ideal for this type of use, so I'm delighted that Bradford Theatres are considering this option for St George's Hall.
""The new spaces are also ideal for events, like the way the space was used last weekend for the brass event which was really well attended.""
Adam Renton, general manager for Bradford Theatres, said: ""We have already seen increased footfall around St George's Hall since the new pedestrian areas have been completed, and it's the perfect time for us to look at ways to expand our cafe-bar offer.
""Having this outdoor space will allow us to encourage people to extend the time they spend in the city centre when coming to see one of our shows.
""It will also increase the visibility of our existing cafe-bar from the street.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygjm7e377o,Deceased local artists' work displayed at gallery,"An exhibition has opened featuring artwork by local artists who have passed away.
The event, Dead Good Artists, is hosted by the Wooden Box Gallery in Ramsgate in collaboration with Pilgrims Hospices.
Rebekah Sunshine, owner of the gallery, says it is a ""privilege"" to help people maintain the artistic legacy of their deceased family members.
She said the artists were all from Kent, and many of them were amateurs.
Ms Sunshine told BBC Radio Kent that when the gallery opened four years ago, people asked her what they could do with the artwork family members had left behind.
She developed the idea when a close friend passed away and his artwork was left to his family.
""I thought what happens to their creative journey when they pass away? I want to support families who are in this situation,"" she said.
""People hold special memories of the artwork and I think it's important to keep the memories alive rather than leaving the pieces hidden away.""

Some people who have their family member's artwork displayed, told BBC Radio Kent what it meant to them.
One relative said: ""Seeing his work on the wall, and hearing positive comments was moving and heartwarming. I felt strongly connected to him and I feel immensely proud.""
Another said: ""When I heard about the exhibition, I immediately knew I would like to submit my grandfather's work to the gallery.
""He used a lot of different mediums and materials to create, for example the back of a cornflake box. It means a lot to the family to see his artwork on display.""
The gallery is also hosting workshops with Pilgrims Hospices to help families handle what it means to be a steward of an artist's legacy, and the emotional and practical burdens that comes with this responsibility.
Ms Sunshine added: ""There is a lot of guilt when families are having to decide what to do with their deceased family member's artwork, especially ones that are not to your taste.""
The exhibition is open from Tuesday until 26 April from 10:00 to 15:30 BST.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypjppeljwo,New play brings back memories of floods in real 'Happy Valley',"On Boxing Day in 2015, the town of Hebden Bridge was under water; thousands of homes and businesses were submerged when Storm Eva battered the north of England, causing significant damage in the Calder Valley.
As a new play which depicts the community's efforts to ""rebuild their sodden town"" opens at Leeds Playhouse, the BBC has been to meet the people affected by ""The Flood"".
""Water was cascading off the hillside and literally rising in the town centre,"" Andrew Entwistle recalls.
The 81-year-old flood warden had spent the days prior to the storm warning people to brace themselves.
When the water came, he was going to try and lay out sandbags in an attempt to delay the deluge surging through streets, but it was too late.
""My wheelbarrow was floating down the street,"" he tells the BBC.
""Nobody had the flood defences then that we have now.
""Everywhere you looked there was just water, people were trapped in buildings; it was up to my armpits.
""It literally climbed up the walls.""
Evidence of the water levels are still visible in Hebden Bridge 10 years later.
In The Albert, a pub which regularly hosts the flood wardens' bi-monthly meetings, a sign marking the depth hangs high on the walls above a chalkboard displaying drinks deals.
""It was catastrophic, the worst in living memory,"" Mr Entwistle continues.
""The water came and it stayed for around 48 hours and we were on our own.
""There was no electric; everything had gone off, there were no communications, it was so quiet.""
Mr Entwistle and his wife had just celebrated their golden wedding anniversary when the floods hit.
Using candles left over from their celebrations, he attempted to light the way for the community in the inky darkness.
""Everybody rallied round,"" he adds.
Among those to rally was Deborah Collinge.
Now the owner of The Albert, the 60-year-old was living in nearby Luddenden when Hebden Bridge flooded.
She spent hundreds of pounds on cleaning supplies to help the community when the water finally drained, and opened her back room as a creche.
""It was the first time I ever saw men cry,"" Ms Collinge tells the BBC.
""Two guys told me they saw a lady that had been in the water all day and all night.
""It was around her waist and she was just holding her husband's ashes.""
The Flood, written and directed by Lucie Raine, focuses on the spirit displayed during the devastation.
Ms Raine had friends and family living in Hebden Bridge and remembers the ""apocalyptic"" images, taken of places she walked around regularly.
""The memory is quite powerful, it still touches me.""
After deciding she would write a play about the events that unfolded, Ms Raine began chatting to anyone she could.
""What was unusual was the amount of pride people had; they immediately talked about what happened afterwards, the way they came together.
""People waded through sludge to make sure others got groceries.""
The Flood has been described as ""a love letter to the town that refused to give in to the volatility of nature"".
Walk around Hebden Bridge today and evidence of that defiant spirit can still be spotted.
Hidden in plain sight along almost every door and window are brackets that floodgates can be attached to the moment a flood alert escalates to an urgent warning.
Some shops have signs which can transform into barriers, others have valuable goods and electrics raised more than a metre from the ground.
What could be mistaken as decorative cladding in The Albert can be turned into shelving strong enough to hold detachable table tops and chairs.
Many stores have replaced carpets with hard materials such as wood or stone so mud and mess left behind by the water can be swilled away.
Having endured six major floods since 2000, for people in Hebden Bridge, preparation is part of every day life.
Thankfully, adds Mr Entwistle, no lives have been lost to the flooding, but living under the threat of heavy rain has taken its toll on the community.
""The records that people had, photographs, ashes, mementoes; they all disappeared.
""People's lovely possessions were contaminated; they're all gone and irreplaceable.""
He has since experienced PTSD since the 2015 flooding and says the anxiety in the town is ""palpable"" during heavy rainfall.
Mr Entwistle hopes the play can teach people how ""massive"" the impacts of a flood are.
""Talking about it sends shivers down my spine.
""It eats into your soul, we live on a knife-edge.""
The Flood is touring theatres in Yorkshire and the north, including Leeds Playhouse and the Hebden Bridge Little Theatre until 17 May.

A combination of 42 quilts and 23 individual panels, which represents about 385 people who lost their lives to HIV/Aids in the UK, will be displayed in the art gallery's Turbine Hall.
The US National Aids Memorial describes the memorial quilt as ""the largest community arts project in history"", with the UK quilt being ""one chapter"" of this project, the Tate Modern said.
It will be on display from 12 June to 16 June, with a live reading of names on the quilt taking place on 14 June.
In response to the Aids pandemic, American activist Cleve Jones formed the NAMES Project in 1985.
It invited people to create textile panels to commemorate friends, family and loved ones who died during the pandemic. The individual panels are sewn together to create larger quilts, which have in the past been shown outdoors to raise awareness about HIV and Aids.
The displays often included a reading of all the names on the panels.
The NAMES project UK was launched by Scottish activist Alistair Hulme who witnessed an early display of the NAMES Project Aids Memorial Quilt in San Francisco.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2y91jp00lo,Murals making town 'more colourful place to live',"Murals installed in Ramsey are making the town ""a more colourful place to live"", the commissioner behind the project has said.
Four installations by Manx artists have popped up in the seaside town after the local authority backed outgoing commissioner Lamara Craine's plans.
An initial Â£2,000 was earmarked for the project, with a further Â£5,000 now budgeted to allow for a total of 26 pieces of artwork to be mounted on buildings.
Craine said the murals were ""great additions to brighten up our streets, give our residents something enjoyable to see, and our visitors the opportunity for a selfie"".
She said she had been inspired by seeing similar works in Peel, Castletown and Onchan.
Craine said she wanted to expand the public art plans to include privately owned properties in Ramsey town centre, adding that the murals ""bring colour and character"".
The designs for the mural boards, which are 8ft by 4ft (2.4m by 1.2m), can be inspired by themes of Ramsey, connections to the sea, Manx Folklore, the Isle of Man TT, historic local landmarks and local wildlife.
An installation on Cannell's Lane was painted by Kathy Craig, who was ""blown away seeing it in person"".
She said the collection was set to be a ""real mix of talent and creativity"".
She hopes taking the artwork out of galleries and moving it on to the streets will make it ""accessible to anyone, and maybe put a smile on their face"".
Meanwhile, Bar Logo on Crellin's Lane hosts a piece called the Foxglove and the Bee by Leanne Higgins.
The sports bar's manager, Ali Kennish, said the project was a ""great idea to brighten up the town.
""So many buildings have just bare walls. It's great to see some colour and life brought into them.""
Ramsey resident and artist Marianne Hatchard ""pays homage"" to her favourite creatures from Manx folklore in the Galloping Glashtyns mural mounted on the exterior of a shoe shop on Christian Street.
She said she drew inspiration from the powerful waves on the island's shores, and the half-man, half-horse legend always drawn to the tides.
""This is my way of celebrating the unique culture of the Isle of Man,"" she said.
The project was ""such a big, in-your-face, example of how many talented people we have here, and it's lovely to be a part of it"".
A fourth mural called Ramsey's Bathing Belle can been seen outside the pizza restaurant in Market Place.
Craine said she was ""humbled"" the creatives, who were paid Â£200 each for their work, had agreed to ""make our town a more colourful place to live"".
She encouraged any landlords interested in hosting furture murals to join the scheme.
She said another 22 ""awesome spectacles"" were in need of a home.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevdzvpegmzo,Theatre without planning permission loses appeal,"A theatre complex has lost a High Court appeal against an order to close one of its venues that was built without planning permission.
The Arden, the newest of three stages at Titchfield Festival Theatre in Hampshire, is continuing to host performances despite being declared illegal by a planning inspector in August 2024.
The High Court upheld the inspector's decision, which followed an enforcement notice by Fareham Borough Council.
It said the land had no lawful use as a theatre.
Previously, the theatre accused the council of pursuing a ""vendetta"" against it.
It organised an online ""Save Festival Theatre"" petition, attracting more than 6,000 signatures.
Artistic director Kevin Fraser previously told the BBC: ""We took very strong legal advice before we even put a spade in the ground.
""After 10 years there is a thing called 'deemed permission' within planning law, and our legal advice was that we could claim deemed permission for that full theatre use.""
However, the High Court ruled the inspector did not err in law when she ruled that the 463-seat Arden theatre was effectively a new unit for planning purposes.
Neil Cameron KC, sitting as a deputy judge, also dismissed other appeal grounds, including over the wording of the enforcement notice.
In August 2024, the theatre was told it must cease performances within two months.
It was given seven months to fill in the orchestra pit and dismantle the stage, seating and sound and lighting equipment.
However, in November the theatre was granted permission to appeal, and said it considered the planning enforcement to be on hold.
The Arden is currently hosting a production of The Sound of Music and has plans for performances up to 17 May, according to its website.
In a statement, Titchfield Festival Theatre said: ""The trustees are obviously disappointed with the ruling from the Judicial Review.
""We are taking further legal advice on the potential outcomes. In the meantime the Arden Theatre continues to operate.""
Fareham Borough Council has been approached for comment.

Night glow: The lights of the many rides and stalls at Funderworld on The Downs are not just illuminating that part of the city, but the taller rides can be seen from miles away.
Grey Good Friday: It was a damp day on Friday as the weather did not play ball with it being a bank holiday but at least the gulls enjoyed having the harbour (largely) to themselves.
Maybe just one: It is hard to travel across Bristol without passing an artisan bakery of some sort or another. These cardamom and pistachio knots were being baked at Loaf this week.
Heading to the match: More than 16,000 fans saw Bristol Bears take on Leicester Tigers on Sunday, the visitors winning the contest 19-36.
In the shadow of giants: The cricket season is here, meaning fans heading to watch Gloucestershire home games can once again walk into the County Ground under the mural of legendary player W. G. Grace.
In all weathers: Every Saturday morning hundreds of runners take on the hills of Ashton Court as part of the weekly Park Run. Easter Saturday was no different despite the wind and rain.
Park life: Charity Your Park Bristol & Bath has been given almost Â£250,000 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to improve accessibility for disabled people and their carers in parks in the two cities.
Recognition: The team at Common Ambition Bristol, which aims to reverse HIV health inequalities in the city, has been given a national award. Common Ambition raises awareness of HIV in African and Caribbean heritage communities through dedicated clinics and community events.
Lifesavers: Staff from University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust (UHBW) have been providing crucial liver scans to people in the city's homeless community with the support of the Big Issue under the ""Alright My Liver?"" scheme.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn50rqrlgo,The ex-city trader who sold Malala painting for Â£51k,"Alexandra Johnson was already grieving her mother's death when Covid-19 hit the UK in 2020.
As a former city trader, she had no formal art qualifications, but she nonetheless decided to manage the boredom and channel her grief by painting in her kitchen.
The mother-of-three has gone on to sell her works - painted exclusively with a palette knife and spatula - for five-figure sums.
Earlier this month, her portrait of Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai sold for Â£51,200 at the prestigious Bonhams auction house.
""I always go for powerful women, not for [their] jobs and career, just for their inner strength,"" said Johnson, who lives in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex.
Johnson left her job as a trader in 2002 to become a full-time mum.
She became a full-time carer for her own mother in 2017 after her cancer diagnosis, and Janet died in February 2019.
The 53-year-old recalled how ""we were really bored"" when the first lockdown was imposed and she was still ""fresh in grief"".
""I don't think I'd spent five hours painting [at that point] but during lockdown the pace of life had become a lot slower,"" she told the BBC.
""I wanted to see how good I could be.""
Her ""amazing"" mother served as an ""inspiration"" for those early paintings.
Janet had already sacrificed her own health by giving a kidney to one of her brothers when she was 60 years old.
The painter said she was forever in awe of how women supported other women in times of crisis, and she described how her work paid ""homage"" to their ""strength and grace"".
She says her paintings explore memory, femininity and resilience.
""I pull from my experiences. It's personal, it's my feelings on a canvas, my favourite pieces are anything that are of my mum.
""I found it so therapeutic.
""I only do women, and I've had some really low points in my life and the women in my life just pushed me through.
""We come from a big family of powerful women.""
Women wear many hats and spin many plates, she explained: ""We take on so much.""
Johnson - who works under the name Zara Muse - sold her first painting ""Angelique"" in 2023 for Â£22,500. Shape of Stillness went for Â£47,500 in December.
The painting of Malala was was put up for sale at Bonham's after it was put forward by one of her loyal collectors.
Malala, now 27, was 15 when she was shot in the head by the Taliban on the way home from school.
""Malala represents strength and bravery â the kind of woman I want to celebrate through my work.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9846vj8rqqo,'I went from Suffolk to New York to pursue acting dream',"When Jonny-James Kajoba developed an appetite for the performing arts as a child, he knew he wanted to do everything he could to make it a career.
Born in Ipswich, Kajoba became a chorister at St Mary le Tower at the age of five.
During his A-levels, he became one of thousands to be accepted into the prestigious Juilliard School for drama in New York, USA.
Now a year on from graduating, the 22-year-old has worked on several plays and short films, and will star in a Broadway show next year.
Kajoba said his parents pushed him academically, but he spent a lot of his youth learning to play piano, violin and the harp while enjoying after school and weekend drama clubs.
A pivotal moment he said was when he was inspired by a show at the Wolsey Theatre in Ipswich.
""I didn't really know what it meant to be an actor, whether that was something that someone could do,"" he explained.
""I went to see this play and I was so mesmerised at how something on stage could be so beautiful.
""It wasn't just acting itself, it was the whole production of it all.""
In secondary school, Kajoba would spend lunchtimes looking up drama school requirements and learning monologues.
He continued to perform in shows and notably in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night at Shakespeare's Globe theatre in London when he was 16.
During his A-levels, he set his sights on Juilliard and started the long application process while applying to UK universities as a ""backup plan"".
He had to submit videos of himself reciting monologues, and he nearly gave up on the application until he found out the admissions deadline had been extended.
He was soon invited for in-person auditions in New York in January 2020 and once there, he made it through countless rounds.
""Everybody around me was like, 'Jonny, you're going to get it', but you have to understand that was one day out of like 30 days of auditions they do,"" he explained.
He returned to his A-Levels and his final audition was staged online because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
A short time later, on the day his school was sent home for lockdown, he was told he had been accepted into Juilliard's class for 2020, made up of just 18 students.
""I was running around... I could not believe it, I made it to Juilliard,"" he said.
""Out of between 6,000 to 8,000 people, 18 got in.""
Kajoba started online classes in July 2020 before later moving to New York in October for his studies.
""Across the four years, we only perform publicly in the third and fourth year because the first two years are all about the interior work you do as an actor,"" he added.
""One thing the head of the division always used to say is, 'We are training you for a 70-year career'.
""It's about building yourself as a true artist.""
In his fourth year, Kajoba was signed to a New York talent agency and he received the John Houseman Award for acting.
It is given to the actor who displays exceptional ability in classic theatre and he said it was ""an honour to be part of that legacy"".
Kajoba, who still lives in New York, continued: ""Juilliard really allowed me to meet myself, meet the version of myself I was always meant to be.
""Of course that changes everyday, but I'm just so grateful for that gift and the fact I get to honour that in every play, film, whatever that I do.""
Kajoba has already worked on some short films as well as several plays.
He recently starred in a short film called Seek No Favor produced by Carmen Cuba, a well-known Los Angeles producer, that is currently in post-production.
He will start work on another film called Good Mourning this month, and is due to star in a Broadway theatre show called Spare Parts next year.
""I used to say this when I was 14 or 15 years old, to my friends; the big, big dream is that I produce my own films.
""I want to make projects that make audiences think, 'OK, how did you do that?', in the sense that creating something that goes beyond language and physicality.
""I want to do that while uplifting voices that are not necessarily given the space to do that.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34dz0xnjzo,First island exhibition for Jersey artist,"A Jersey artist is having his first full exhibition on his home island.
Max Corbett's collection of street scenes is being exhibited at the Jaro gallery in St Helier as part of its permanent artists' collection.
Corbett said his work was a combination of ""street photography and traditional oil painting techniques"", using bright colours and an ""all over the place"" style.
He said he took inspiration from impressionist painters of the 18th and 19th Centuries who saw the streets as a ""window into what life is truly like"", adding ""the street is where people and society is at its most obvious.""
His work was spotted by the gallery's curator, Jasmine Rose Noel, at a one-off showing last summer, he said.
As well as exhibiting his work in St Helier, Ms Noel has helped Corbett display at art fairs around Europe and the US, including London, Berlin and Miami.
He has travelled around the world to get inspiration and photos for his pieces, including London and - most-recently - Tokyo in Japan.
Corbett, who studied Fine Art and Design at Lancaster University, said having a ""breadth of culture and pieces and places"" in his work was important.
""I'm trying to tick off as many references for my work,"" he said.
However, Corbett said his ties to Jersey remained deep: ""This is the best place for me to get my work done - it's where I feel home.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5w0j723jwo,Choreographer has a ball as debut lands panto win,"A dancer said winning a top pantomime award for choreographing her debut solo venture was ""mental"".
Ebony Clarke took home the Pantomime Awards best choreography prize for her innovation on Cinderella at the Royal & Derngate in Northampton.
Ms Clarke said that after being in the theatre industry for about 10 years, and ""looking after people's"" work, she decided it was time to do it ""on my own"".
Being involved in the show by Evolution Productions, that ran during December, was ""a dream"", she said.
The winners of the awards were announced at a ceremony in Woking, Surrey, last Sunday.
Ms Clarke said she had performed in pantomimes and been associate director and choreographer on a number of hit shows including Romeo & Juliet and Everybody's Talking About Jamie.
""I was like 'Hey I want to try and do this on my own and see if I can do it' and Emily and Paul, who run Evolution Productions, were like 'Yeah we're going to give you a shot' and Northampton was the the one and here we are.
""It's mental.""
Her success was down to planning, and ""working out what songs we're putting in, how long it's going to be, whose going to be in that number, what the sets look like, what principals are in it, all the logistics, before we start getting creative with the choreography"".
Working with the cast, including Andy Day from BBC's CBeebies was a joy, she said.
""He was so ready for anything I threw at him.
""His song, that opened Act Two, Boom Boom Shake the Room, he loved it, he was so good.
""The whole process was a dream.""
She said ""it's been a mental couple of week"" as she had been to the Olivier Awards 2025, for her work as resident choreographer on the recent West End show, Why Am I So Single, by the same team behind Six The Musical.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7078q5e5o,Theatre scheme helps people in 'loneliest borough',"A new project is attempting to tackle isolation in what has been described as ""London's loneliest borough"".
Hampstead Theatre in Camden has launched a programme for adults at risk of social isolation, offering writing and performance sessions or tickets to see a show at the theatre.
Costas, 84, is one of those who is taking part in the scheme. He is now a budding playwright.
""This community experience is unbelievable,"" he said. ""To be honest, I didn't know that I had it in me. I've started writing since then. I'm on my third play.""
Jennifer Davis, theatre and participation director for Hampstead Theatre, runs the course.
She said she was inspired to launch it after reading Camden's State of the Borough Report in 2024.
According to the document, more than a third of adults in Camden said they felt lonely some of the time, often or always. At 36.3%, the figure was the highest of all the London boroughs.
""I couldn't quite believe it. Camden is such a busy, bustling part of the capital and I couldn't understand why,"" Ms Davis said.
""I thought the theatre needed to do something about it.
""There's lots of brilliant theatres doing this kind of work, and for me, theatre has always offered a community, a home, and I wanted to open up Hampstead to the Camden community.""
She added: ""Whether you're on the stage, whether you're writing a play or performing in it, or watching it, it is a communal experience.
""It's where conversations can be sparked and bonds are built -  I just thought we were the perfect place to be doing this kind of work.""
Ms Davis said the theatre had worked on the project with Age UK Camden, Wac Arts and the Winch - local charities that support people in the borough.
""Theatre is such a brilliant way of sharing, exploring your identity, meeting new people and building bonds,"" she added.
Professor Jason Arday, who has a Radio 4 programme called A Lonely Life, said loneliness was ""becoming part of the general zeitgeist"".
""We are living in a more lonely society for lots of different reasons,"" he said. ""Division plays a big part of that, the turbulence and the stresses of life, I think people are finding it harder.""
Professor Arday said small interventions, such as the project by Hampstead Theatre, were ""hugely impactful"".
""Importantly, it does set a premise for best practice, in terms of what other communities can engage in across the nation,"" he said.
""You probably couldn't think of many better instruments than the arts.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyq1ydq5vxo,Light installation will transform church interior,"A church is set to be transformed by a new light installation as part of a public art programme.
Fermynwoods Contemporary Art, an educational art charity based in Northamptonshire, has brought Halo, an immersive work by Swiss-Danish artist Tobias Zehntner, to All Saints Church in Earls Barton.
First commissioned at the Abbaye de la Cambre in Belgium, Halo features a suspended lighting structure that casts shadows and glowing rings above the audience.
""This installation feels like the perfect expression of that sacred in-between,"" said Reverend Jenny Bland from All Saints.
""The light that is interconnected with church, evoking candles, halos, mystery, divinity.
""A space where we might glimpse or experience something greater than ourselves.""
The project forms part of Fermynwoods' Love + Light programme, which uses art to explore themes of climate awareness, interconnectedness and collective reflection.
TobiasÂ Zehntner, the artist behind the piece, said: ""I'm really happy to find a church community that are willing to have an artwork that is running and moving throughout their regular church service and activities.""
A special church service will be held alongside the exhibition, encouraging interfaith and intercultural dialogue.
James Steventon, director of Fermynwoods, added: ""We are delighted to bring this special artwork to a special Northamptonshire church which is open to everyone.""
The installation is supported with funding from the Northamptonshire Community Foundation.
People can visit the installation between 19:00-21:00 BST and it will run until 29 April.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y43drlr94o,Historical city centre theatre's latest renaissance,"A historical city centre theatre is reopening almost two years after it was forced to close its doors.
The Grade II listed Epstein Theatre on Hanover Street in Liverpool shut in 2023 after the city council said it could no longer provide it with financial support.
The Theatres Trust, a charity that campaigns to protect UK theatres, added the site to its ""at-risk register"" in a bid to save what it described as a ""unique and beloved"" venue, which opened as a performance space in 1913.
So how has Epstein Theatre managed to reopen and what can audiences expect?
The Epstein started out as the Crane Concert Hall, situated above the Crane brothers' music emporium.
It was renamed the Crane Theatre in 1938, but after a takeover and refurbishment in 1967 it reopened as Neptune Theatre in 1968.
The venue was closed in 2005 due to health and safety concerns before reopening in 2011 following a Â£1.2m upgrade under its current name which honours the late Beatles manager Brian Epstein.
The theatre was left under ""unbearable"" financial pressure by former assistant manager Kelvin Lloyd who stole Â£273,000 from it between April 2016 and December 2017. He was jailed in 2019 after admitting the theft which pushed the theatre into administration.
Epstein Entertainments Ltd was awarded the contract to operate the theatre on behalf of the city council in 2018.
But five years later the theatre was forced to close when the city council cut its funding.
While the city council retains the venue's freehold, JSM Company Group Ltd - a property management group with a leisure portfolio in Liverpool - has become the new leaseholder and is responsible for Hanover House, the building which contains the Epstein.
JSM Company Group Ltd has leased the Epstein Theatre itself to Theatrical Times Ltd, a new partnership between investors Joseph Roe and Anthony M. Sheedy.
Mr Roe has a history of building developments while Mr Sheedy is a former operator of the Limerick Theatre Royal and a producer/stage manager and performer of the renowned Castle Entertainers at Bunratty and Knappogue Castles in Ireland.
About Â£1m is being invested in the venue which includes refitting the stage with new lighting, stage cloths and sound, and improving the backstage areas and remodelling the theatre's bar.
JSM Company Group is also seeking planning permission for further works within the building, including the development of a 15-bed aparthotel.
While the building is undergoing a revamp, Epstein will have a familiar figure at the helm with Anthony Proctor returning as the general manager.
He said he was ""absolutely thrilled"" to return to the Epstein and to bring the historical theatre ""back to life"".
""The Epstein holds a very special place in the heart of Liverpool audiences as well as generations of artists who have performed in its stunning auditorium,"" he said.
Liverpool City Council's cabinet member for health, wellbeing and culture, councillor Harry Doyle said it was ""hugely exciting news"" the ""iconic venue"" was reopening.
""Anthony is the perfect person to breathe new life into this gem â his passion, ambition and vision signifies a new chapter for the theatre, and I look forward to seeing its renaissance and working with the team to help promote this cultural asset.""
Joshua McTaggart, the chief executive of Theatres Trust, said it was also delighted at the news.
Following its closure in 2023, the trust added the venue to its Theatres at Risk Register and said it had been ""working since then to help find a way forward for this unique and beloved venue"".
He added: ""We continue to work with Theatrical Times Ltd to ensure a bright and stable future for this glorious venue on its return to entertaining the people of Liverpool.""
Test events are being held kicking off with Dancing in the Aisles cabaret show on Sunday ahead of launching a full autumn programme of shows on 19 September, to mark the birthday of Brian Epstein.
Hosted by actor and comedian Lindzi Germain the line-up includes musician and playwright Asa Murphy - who was the last person to perform on the Epstein stage before it shut in 2023 - and comedian and actress Crissy Rock, star of ITV's Benidorm.
Other events include Beating Berlusconi!, a one-man comedy show on 24 May celebrating the 20th anniversary of Liverpool's historic Champions League win in Istanbul, inspired by a real-life encounter inside the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in 2005.
Laughterhouse Comedy on 31 May features award-winning acts including Paul Sinha (The Chase), Tom Stade (Live at the Apollo) and Scott Bennett (Royal Variety Performance).
Something About Lennon - The John Lennon Story is also coming to the theatre on 6 July.
Mr Proctor said: ""I can't wait to reveal the first new season and officially launch it with an amazing gala evening, aptly being held on what would have been Brian Epstein's birthday.""
He added: ""The venue has always been a home for great entertainment, and I can guarantee that will continue under Theatrical Times Ltd.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjnvz138kyo,Art event marks 80th anniversary of Liberation Day,"Celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of Guernsey's Liberation Day will include an artist-led exhibition.
Exile and Return was developed when artist Rosanne Guille and the Reverend Dr Adrian Datta, of St Pierre du Bois Church, met while swimming at Fort Grey.
Held at the parish church of St Pierre du Bois and the Rectory Fellowship rooms, it will be open for six weeks from 7 May with a preview on 6 May.
Dr Datta gave the exhibition its title, saying it echoes and reflects the many narratives he had heard in relation to those who stayed and those who left the island during the days of Nazi occupation.
Dr Datta said: ""The 80th Liberation Day celebration is hugely significant in the life of the Bailiwick.
""Sadly, but inevitably, there are fewer and fewer people around who lived through the occupation years. It is important that their experiences are honoured, remembered and marked in a very special and clear way.
""The Occupation Arts Collective is doing this through the medium of the visual arts. It will leave a permanent legacy of this occasion.""
There were 12 artists involved in the exhibition. They are Jenny Aitken, Pierre Datta, Sally Ede-Golightly, Annabel Ede-Golightly, Deborah Grice, Rosanne Guille, Keith Langlois, Olympia McEwan, Fiona Richmond, Adam Stephens, Lou Stephens and Aaron Yeandle.
Ms Guille said: ""In telling the story of the occupation, the artists involved have created an impressive body of work.
""We have asked them to tap into their family histories, recollections and experiences, along with an exploration of local archives.""
Guernsey Arts sponsored the exhibition and said: ""The Occupation Arts Collective have put together a sensitive and high-quality project examining the years of hardship and sacrifice leading up to this anniversary.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250501-now-is-the-time-to-explore-outer-east-london,London's newest hip area isn't where you think,"A few miles from East London's perennially hip neighbourhoods, an explosion of art and culture is transforming a once-neglected stretch into one of the city's hottest destinations.
East London. Two words that, if you know anything about the UK's capital, often conjure up opposing opinions.
There are those who mourn its supposedly waning hip factor â regaling stories of 1980s warehouse art shows or squat parties â while deploring the rampant commercialism of its supercharged epicentre, Shoreditch. Others, meanwhile, will rave about new independent galleries or small-plate restaurants in nearby Dalston, Bethnal Green or Hackney. Yet, the general consensus is that East London's long-buzzing arts and food scenes are continuing to move ever further out, driven â as in other world cities â by the relentless search for affordability.
But a few miles east of these oversubscribed neighbourhoods are two boroughs that are lesser known to visitors and have been quietly emerging as London's next artsy enclave: Waltham Forest and Newham. Stretching north from Stratford up to Leyton and Walthamstow, thisÂ  once-unfashionable outer area hasn't always matched East London's brand of cool. And yet in spring 2025, it's witnessing a cultural explosion, with new museums, theatres and bars and some of the city's biggest arts openings that are putting this under-the-radar corner of London on the map.
The catalyst for these boroughs' rise was the 2012 London Olympics, which transformed the area's scrapyards and brownfield land into the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park â an oasis of rivers, canals and water meadows bordered by Stratford, Leyton and Hackney.
""The Olympics brought a huge amount of investment in infrastructure, transport links and housing,"" said Britannia Morton, co-chief executive of Sadler's Wells, the world-famous Islington-based dance theatre founded in the 18th Century. ""The Olympic Park, where our new Sadler's Wells East is based, was created converting marshland into this beautiful environment.""
Sadler's Wells East, which opened in February 2025, is located in East Bank, a Â£1.1bn new waterside cultural quarter in the Olympic Park. ""[It was] formerly known as Fridge Mountain â a dumping ground for old electronic appliances,"" said Morton. The first landmark to open here was the University of the Arts' London College of Fashion in October 2023, which has galleries and a cafe open to the public. Sadler's Wells East was built in Italian red brick and houses a 550-seat state-of-the-art auditorium and six dance studios.
""Whether you're interested in ballet, hip-hop, kathak or contemporary, our eclectic programme brings the most innovative work created locally, nationally and internationally to Stratford,"" said Morton. Visitors can enjoy free events in its public spaces, including lunchtime dance classes on the community dance floor, as well as a bar and restaurant. There are panoramic views from its rooftop over the London Aquatics Centre, Sir Anish Kapoor's 114.5m ArcelorMittal Orbit (the UK's largest sculpture) and the London Stadium.
Across the park at the Here East innovation and tech campus (formerly the London Olympics Media Centre) is the glass-fronted V&A East Storehouse, opening 31 May 2025. It's the first half of the new V&A East, whose South Kensington-based original is the world's largest museum of applied arts, decorative arts and design, with more than 2.8 million objects in its permanent collection.
This first instalment is essentially a new home for the V&A East's reserve collection (hence the name ""Storehouse""), and ""a magical new behind-the-scenes museum experience"", according to its deputy director and COO Tim Reeve. With 100 curated mini displays, its half a million works range from theÂ Glastonbury FestivalÂ Archive to DiorÂ haute couture and mid-century furniture. ItsÂ world-first Order an Object experience allows anyone to book an appointment to view anything from Roman frescoes to Elton John's costumes. It will also be home to theÂ new David Bowie Centre, opening 13 September 2025, displaying the singer's outfits, lyrics and archive.
""It's a new standard for access to national collections,"" said Reeve. ""We're encouraging visitors to feel empowered to make their own journeys through the V&A's global collections.""
The second half, the five-storey V&A East Museum, is opening in East Bank in spring 2026. Its main exhibition hall will celebrate leading artists, designers and performers in major shows, and its galleries will narrate stories of East London's creative and manufacturing heritage.
Elsewhere in East Bank, BBC Music Studios, which will house the BBC Symphony Orchestra and host recording sessions and live performances, is slated to open in late 2025 or early 2026.
And that's not all. A couple of miles north in Walthamstow, another major cultural opening is happening. While this diverse north-east London suburb has long been thriving â its pretty village centre, some of which dates to the 15th Century, is indeed a gentrification hotspot â the imposing new Soho Theatre Walthamstow will further raise the neighbourhood's profile when it opens on 2 May 2025. A former cinema designed in 1930 by architect Cecil Masey, the distinctive building was inspired by the Moorish architecture of the 13th-Century Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. In its mid-20th-Century heyday, it also hosted gigs by The Beatles, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison, Dusty Springfield, Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones â before closing in 2003.

When it finally reopens, with its original Art Deco stylings revived, the Soho Theatre Walthamstow will have a 960-seat Grade II-listed auditorium, studio spaces, four bars and a restaurant. (In comparison, its current West End location has a capacity of just 240.)
""This is the first time we've had a professional theatre in the area,"" said executive assistant Annie Jones, who worked on the restoration project for more than five years. ""The programme will list up to nine shows a night â a mix of comedy, cabaret and theatre all rooted in its community. Waltham Forest has always been welcoming, with its vibrancy, multiculturalism and openness, and itsÂ spirit has onlyÂ grown.""
Connecting Stratford, the Olympic Park and Walthamstow is Leyton. This once-maligned area is now home to one of the most up-and-coming strips in East London. Previously more synonymous with fly-tipping, Tilbury Road railway arches (a narrow alleyway opposite Leyton Midland Road station) has been transformed by new arrivals in the last year alone, including three bars, a bakery, a Caribbean restaurant and two soon-to-open artisan cafes. The opening of two popular microbreweries in the last few years on the same stretch sparked this sudden transformation: Gravity Well, nestled in the station arch itself, and the edgier Libertalia taproom, named after a mythical anarchist colony in the 17th Century.
For Leyton-raised Danny Saunders, owner of tropical cocktail bar Leyton Calling (which opened in summer 2024) and cosy candlelit pub Chop Shop Tavern (which opened in February 2025), it's a personal coup, having known the area since the 1980s. ""I've come full circle,"" he said, with a smile. ""My latest bar is in the actual arch where I set up my first car repair business back in the day.""
Leyton's rise as a whole has, however, been something of a slow-burn. Back in the mid-2010s, nearby Francis Road began to be taken over by independent creative businesses. ""I opened here in 2017,"" said AimÃ©e Madill, who owns Phlox, a bookstore, cafe and wine bar. ""It was risky as it was still a 'less-developed' part of London, but local indie bookshops are more than a business, they're a sign of confidence in a community.""
Pedestrianised in 2017, the tree-lined street has since blossomed with chic cafes and bars: two of the latest openings are vinyl store-cum-craft beer bar Dreamhouse Records and Loop Dining, a pop-up space launched in summer 2024 to host weekly residencies from buzzy up-and-coming chefs.
""Unlike Stratford,"" Madill said,Â ""Leyton is characterisedÂ by small makers and creatives existing side by side with businesses who've been here decades. Most of us live here, so we've been able to revitalise, rather than reinvent, parts of the area â which adds to the sense of community.""
So what's next for outer East London? ""Young people and families are now priced out of Hackney,"" said Michaela Zelenanska, who runs natural wine bar Swirl, which opened in December 2024 on Tilbury Road. ""Leyton and neighbouring Leytonstone seem a logical next big thing. It's small businesses that make the place what it is.""
Will London continue to move ever further east? ""We're already engaging with artists, audiences and community groups in Barking and Dagenham,"" said Morton, referencing two outer London suburbs several miles from Leyton and Stratford. ""East London has always been a creative crucible.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250425-the-european-nation-where-bears-roam-free,The European nation where bears are booming,"As Romania's bear population grows, so do the opportunities for travellers to come face to face with the predators in a responsible way.
Romania is home to the largest population of wild brown bears in Europe outside of Russia, with as many as 13,000 bears living in and around the largely untouched forests of the Carpathian Mountains. But while bear-spotting has long been a tourist attraction in Romania, it historically didn't involve venturing into the forest.
""It wasn't that long ago that it was commonplace to see a bear kept in a cage outside of businesses here to attract customers,"" host Reece Parkinson explained in a recent episode of BBC's The Travel Show.
When Romania joined the European Union in 2007, the country began to adhere to the EU Zoos Directive, which issues guidelines for how captive animals are to be treated. In the past 18 years, the country has turned to more humane and sustainable ways to show off one of Europe's last truly wild corners and the brown bears who thrive here.
Brown bears have roamed the woods and mountains of Europe for millions of years. However, their numbers dwindled significantly as human civilisation expanded. Today, it's estimated that roughly 36,000 bears live in the European part of Russia, but new research conducted by Romania's Forestry Research Institute reveals that the nation's brown bear population is much higher than previously estimated â a fact that has brought both opportunity and challenges to surrounding communities.
On one hand, sustainable bear tourism in Romania is growing. Numerous tour operators likeÂ Outdoor HolidaysÂ andÂ Much Better AdventuresÂ now offer visitors guided ""bear-sighting"" hiking trips into the forests where brown bears live. This, in turn, also brings economic opportunities to the country's more rural communities and encourages continued conservation of the animals' habitat.
There's even a dedicated safe haven:Â Libearty Bear Sanctuary,Â nestled in the southern Carpathian Mountains in the town of Zarnesti, is the world's largest brown bear sanctuary. It not only rescues and provides medical care to formerly captive bears who can't be released into the wild, but also offers public tours, allowing visitors them to see the bears in a 69-hectare expanse of oak forests and grasslands.
""In the last 20 years, Cristina Lapis and her team [at Libearty Bear Sanctuary] have given a home to over 130 bears here in Transylvania,"" said Parkinson.
Unfortunately, not everyone is enthusiastic about their furry neighbours. As the bear population flourishes, so do dangerous encounters with humans.
Some local farmers, many of whom have lost livestock to the bears, have lobbied for culling Romania's brown bear population. Visitors have also had conflicts with the animals, often because of unexpected encounters while hiking the mountains âÂ several of which haveÂ turned deadly. Still Lapis, who runs the sanctuary, insists that such encounters are not the norm.
""I know hundreds of thousands of cases where people who are used to the forest saw a bear and nothing happened. So [there] must be something special that an accident happened,"" said Lapis. ""When you go in the forestâ¦ it's important to make noise. If you make noise the animal knows you're coming and goes away.""
Efforts are underway to try to find a happy medium that protects the bears and keeps visitors and livestock as safe as possible. The animals are protected under Romanian law, and reforestation and educational efforts are underway to prevent the bears from entering into human territory to feed and to teach humans what to do when they encounter a bear in the woods.
Most life-threatening encounters with bears are due to human error, usually when a human startles a bear or interacts inappropriately with cubs, making mother bears defensive. Therefore, when hiking in bear country â whether in Romania or elsewhere â it's important to talk loudly or clap your hands to give the animals time to avoid you. If you come upon a bear accidentally, make yourself as large as possible and back away.
""We cannot live alone [in the wilderness],"" Lapis said. ""We have to learn to share.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250423-scotlands-most-remote-railway-adventure,Scotland's most remote railway adventure,"Running from Inverness to Britain's most northerly junction, the Far North Line passes through sheep meadows, traditional villages and the world's only Unesco-listed blanket peat bog.
As the train pulls out of Inverness Station, bound for the utmost reaches of the Scottish Highlands, a familiar thrill tingles through my fingers. Having once called the area home during four summer work seasons, I still feel an unshakable connection to this remote, untamed scenery. And now, at last, I have returned to unite two of my great passions â the romance of rail travel and the peaty moorlands of northern Scotland â in one journey.
It's 07:00 and I'm on the Far North Line that stretches from Inverness to Thurso and Wick at the very tip of mainland Britain. Covering 168 miles and taking around four hours, it's the northernmost railway in Scotland, cutting through the Flow Country; a blanket peat covering much of the northern Highlands. Studded with bog pools and home to a vast array of unique flora and fauna, the Flow Country is the largest and most intact peat system in the world. In 2024, it was named the world's first and only peatland Unesco World Heritage Site. But, for me, the Flow Country's true appeal is its ethereal remoteness.
The sun has blanketed the Highlands for most of my visit, but now, the ground is covered with a dusting of frost that twinkles lightly in the early morning glow. As the train chugs past the village of Conon Bridge and the quaint port town Invergordon, the landscape stays gentle, with hills and farmland rolling past my window. There's no convivial chatter; an early morning start in northern Scotland means people silently clutching their takeaway coffee cups, perhaps preparing mentally for the day ahead. Gazing out of the window, I see a train passing, heading to Inverness. I am going in the opposite direction, deeper into the Highlands, where hurry always seems to fade away.
The Far North Line was built in stages in the late 19th Century, driven by a more pragmatic goal than my quest for remote landscapes. The tracks were created to boost trade, particularly in fishing and agriculture. The first terminus, Dingwall, opened in 1862, followed by Invergordon the next year. Golspie was reached in 1868, Helmsdale three years later, and finally, Thurso and Wick in 1874.
However, the line's creation was not without its struggles. Harsh weather, tricky terrain and financial difficulties threatened its completion.
Enter the third Duke of Sutherland. A passionate railway enthusiast, the duke had once completed an apprenticeship with the London and North Western Railway to better understand the workings of steam locomotives, writes Michael William in his book, On the Slow Train Again.
The Duke was eager to build a railway that, conveniently, would run close to his doorstep, Dunrobin Castle. On 20 June 1870, an Act of Parliament granted him permission to extend the line from Golspie to Brora and on to Helmsdale. But construction had already begun in anticipation, and by 1 November that year, the Dunrobin-to-Helmsdale section was operational.
Today, Dunrobin Castle Station is one of the Far North Lineâs most enchanting stops. Designed in 1902 by L Bisset, its Alpine cottage-like architecture evokes scenes from a Grimm Brothers fairy tale. But on my journey, the train swishes past the station, a humble request stop where passengers press a button should they wish to board.
Soon after Dunrobin, the train reaches the seaside. The 10 miles between Brora and Helmsdale are among the journey's most scenic. I see waves crashing against the shoreline's jagged black stones, sheep grazing on the green fields and a man with two border collies on their morning walk. Then, after Helmsdale, the tracks turn inland, deeper into the Highlands. We are now approaching the Flow Country.
The blanket bog covers 1,544 sq m, about 2.5 times bigger than the metropolitan area of London. When it was inscribed by Unesco, it joined other natural marvels like Australia's Great Barrier Reef and the GalÃ¡pagos islands on the Unesco list because, as the organisation states, it's ""home to a distinct combination of bird species and displays a remarkable diversity of features not found anywhere else on Earth"".
Earlier that week, I met with Dr Roxane Andersen, a professor of Peatland Science at the University of the Highlands and Islands, in the village of Lochinver, to discuss the landscape and its recently acquired Unesco status.
As someone who has been studying the area for more than a decade and was closely involved in securing its World Heritage status, Andersen knows the bogland through and through. It is a land of striking contrasts â hauntingly beautiful, even mysterious at times, stretching from the hills of the west coast to the gentler terrain of the east. Moreover, this vast bogland plays an indispensable ecological role.
""Like all peatlands, the Flow Country plays a critical role in regulating the Earth's climate because it slowly but steadily takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and stores it as dead vegetation, or peat, for millennia. In doing so, it cools the climate,"" said Andersen.
Along the Far North Line, Forsinard is the best stop to explore this unique landscape. Here, the old train station serves as Forsinard Flows Visitor Centre, open from April to October. From the train station, I stroll the 1 mile Dubh Lochan Trail along a wooden platform to the Flows Lookout Tower, which is open year-round. The platform is dotted with information posts about the landscape, from the trees that used to grow here to the workings of the bog's pool systems.
""There are places where one can actually walk for tens of kilometres in one direction without seeing another person, without crossing a road,"" said Graham Thompson, a local resident and tour guide. ""It truly is magnificent to still be able to experience this in the UK.""
Reaching the wooden two-storey lookout tower, I remember Thompson's words; indeed, there is no one around but relentless wind and an occasional gust of drizzle to keep me company.
I climb the tower and take in the view. The brown peat dotted with dark pools of water extends over the horizon. In its bleakness, the landscape has a strong impact. Here, amidst the bog and water, the creatures that thrive â insects, birds and the occasional mammal such as otters and red deer â form a delicate balance that makes this place truly one of a kind.
""It is Britain's last remaining wilderness,"" Thompson told me. And as I stand there, I can feel it.
But the Flow Country is no Paradise Lost. For centuries, it has struggled against the pressures imposed by human actions. On a riverside bench in Lochinver, I listened as Andersen explained how the area was shaped by the aftermath of the Jacobite uprising and the Highland Clearances, when this remote landscape was reshaped into vast estates dedicated primarily to sheep grazing. Once-peopled valleys and straths were emptied, with communities pushed to the coast, leaving behind the bogs and hills.
A more recent struggle dates to the 1980s, when commercial forestry introduced non-native trees and large sections of the bog were drained. While Thompson believes things are getting worse, with wind farms springing up everywhere, Andersen takes a more optimistic view, highlighting the transformation of both the landscape and the people.
""Now all these people sit around the table together and have a shared vision of what could happen in this landscape for the future. And I think that, as a society, the shift from 40 years ago to where we are today in such a short time is truly inspiring.""
I leave the viewing tower and Forsinard behind, Andersen's words of hope lingering in my mind, and hop back onto the Far North Line, continuing my journey to the small harbour town of Thurso.
As the train pushes further north, keeping away from the coast, I reflect on the sights I've seen. The Far North Line has delivered most of the typical Scottish imagery, from border collies and sheep to dramatic coastlines and wild bog landscapes. It has been a great alternative to the NC500, a popular and often over-crowded drive around the Highlands, offering a romantic way to experience the wild beauty of the region.
We pass Georgemas Junction, where the line splits towards Thurso and Wick, before finally reaching Thurso, the last train stop before the sea. Along the way, we've passed Beauly Station, home to Scotland's shortest train platform â at just 15.06m long, only one carriage door can be opened for people to exit or enter the train â and we've also passed Altnabreac, the country's most remote station; surrounded by boglands and located 10 miles from the closest road. Georgemas itself is the UK's northernmost junction. But more than these superlatives, this journey has been about slowing down and allowing the mind to wander.
Few rail journeys provide such a deep sense of solitude and reflection â a quiet, uninterrupted passage through some of Britainâs most remote landscapes, hiding multitudes of stories in its peated layers. It truly is, as Andersen put it, a ""legacy of past events"".

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250425-the-us-island-where-cars-are-banned,A US island with no cars and 600 horses,"In the midst of ""the car capital of the world"", there's a serene vehicle-free island home to 600 people, 600 horses and a once-upon-a-time way of life.
Home to the ""Motor City"" of Detroit, where companies like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler originated, the US state of Michigan is often called ""the car capital of the world"". But off the state's northern coast in Lake Huron is a serene, scenic island that has been luring travellers for hundreds of years â and has banned cars pretty much since they were invented.
Welcome to Mackinac Island: a 3.8-sq-km island home to 600 year-round residents, no motorised vehicles and the only US highway where you're not allowed to drive a car. Even golf carts are prohibited on the island's streets, so chances are if you hear a honk or a screech, it's from one of the island's geese or owls.
But why the absence of autos?
Because as Urvana Tracey Morse, who owns a craft store on the island's main drag, says: ""Horse is king here.""
According to local lore, when a car backfired in 1898, scaring horses nearby, village authorities banned internal combustion engines, a move that was extended to the rest of the island two years later. Ever since, locals have leaned into this tranquil, once-upon-a-time way of life.
More than a century later, some 600 horses keep things running here, from the depths of winter to the mad summer rush when roughly 1.2 million people board a 20-minute ferry from Mackinaw City or St Ignace on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and descend on the small village (also called Mackinac Island) on the island's southern tip. There, visitors shop for the village's famous fudge, explore its 70 miles of trails and soak up the clip-clopping sounds of a simpler time.
""Horses are used in everything from garbage removal to FedEx deliveries,"" says Morse, who has been selling scrimshaw, art, jewellery and other merchandise after first visiting as a college student in 1990. ""That's how our lifestyle has been; that's how our pace is.""
""Part of us just like the tradition that we get around by bike, or we walk or take the horse taxi,"" Morse adds.
For hundreds of years, Indigenous communities used the island's strategic location at the confluence of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan as a fishing and hunting ground. They thought its limestone bluffs and green forests resembled a giant turtle rising from the water, so they named it Michilimackinac, or ""place of the great turtle"" in Anishinaabemowin.
British forces shortened the name and established a defensive fort on the island in 1780. Today, visitors can still follow costumed interpreters, experience cannon firings and see an officer's quarters inside the oldest building in Michigan. But more than 200 years after the US took control of Mackinac following the War of 1812, its Indigenous roots remain.
""Mackinac Island is one of the most important [and] prominent places in Anishnaabe history and culture,"" says Eric Hemenway, an Anishnaabe member who has been instrumental in reviving Indigenous history on the island. ""The Anishnaabeek people have been at the Straits [the waterways connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan], some say, since time immemorial. And we are still at the place of our ancestors here at the Straits. The waters were, and continue to be, the highways of the Midwest.""
As Hemenway points out, a large number of Indigenous burial sites have been found on the island â some of which go back roughly 3,000 years. ""[Mackinac] is one of our most sacred spots on the Great Lakes,"" he says.
Hemenway has also worked on the development of the Biddle House, which is home to the Mackinac Island Native American Museum that opened in 2021.
""My biggest success [metric] is when I see other Native people come throughâ¦ this is our story,"" says Hemenway. ""[The island has] a touristy perception now, but the layers to this place are there.""
By the late 19th Century, Mackinac Island had become a playground for wealthy industrialist families from Chicago, Detroit and other parts of the once-thriving Midwest, who flocked to the island in summer to unwind in its pristine waters.
More like this:

Mackinac's 138-year-old Grand Hotel has individually decorated rooms and claims to have the world's longest porch; it's also one of the last fully functioning hotels from industrial America's Gilded Age. Such is the Grand Hotel's unique appeal that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer recently took to X to pitch the island as the location for season four of HBO's The White Lotus.
While the pitch was playful, Morse is hesitant for Mackinac to become overtouristed. ""You're proud of where you live; but at the same time I kind of don't want to tell people how cool it is here,"" she says.
Indeed, this pint-sized island packs a punch. Eighty percent of Mackinac's land area is comprised of Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can stroll through old-growth forest, admire towering limestone pillars, and hike, bike or hire a horse-drawn carriage to photograph one of the island's most famous attractions â the 50ft-wide Arch Rock.
Elsewhere, locals suggest heading north from the island's one village to ramble the 8.5-mile highway turned bike-and-hiking trail that runs the circumference of the island and offers views of the five-mile-long Mackinac suspension bridge and access to quiet pebble-covered beaches and woodlands.
Horses aside, the island's 1,500 bikes for hireÂ are the main way residents and visitors get around â a self-propelled mode of transport that suggests Mackinac residents are happy to move at a different pace than the rest of the country.
Living in a place without cars is one of the main reasons why Morse, who rides her bike nine months of the year, has decided to live year-round on the island, despite the harsh winters.
""I just love the idea of getting on my bike and coming down [to the village] through the trees. It sets me for the day,"" she says. ""You are always greeting and talking to people.""
But while cycling is the easiest and most popular mode of transport, bikes clearly play a secondary role in powering the island.
""Without the horses, this place wouldn't be what it is. It's what makes you feel like you've stepped back in time when you get off the boat and you hear that 'clip-clop',"" says Hunter Hoaglund, who works at Arnold Freight, a company that has run a ferry service to the island for 140 years and ships in a herd of its horses that overwinter on Michigan's Upper Peninsula every April. ""We have our trucks show up here each day [dropping off the horses], and within the next month we'll probably see 200 to 300 more show up."" An estimated 20-30 horses remain on the island during the winter to collect garbage, deliver packages and otherwise keep the island running.
Surrounded by crystal-clear water, Mackinac can be periodically cut off from the mainland in winter when ice floes can halt ferry services to or from the island.
But in spring and summer, Mackinac comes alive.
The dozens of lilac trees dotted along the village streets start to bloom in the lead up to the island's popular 10-day Lilac Festival in June. Stargazers head to Mackinac's Fort Holmes â the highest point on the island â and the Grand Hotel's Cupola Bar for unfiltered views of the northern Michigan night sky. But for most visitors, happily tuckered out after biking around the island, an ice cream or piece of fudge is best enjoyed overlooking the marina.
And all without the sound of a car engine to spoil the experience.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250422-japans-97-year-old-cherry-blossom-guardian,The secret keepers of Japan's cherry blossoms,"For 16 generations, master gardeners in this one family have dedicated their lives to preserving one of the nation's most cherished â and highly sought-out â symbols.
Each spring during sakura (cherry blossom) season, the Ninna-ji and Daikaku-ji temples in Kyoto's leafy Ukyo ward are overwhelmed by busloads of tourists who come to snap photos of the temples' blooming cherry trees. But little do they know that only a few kilometres away, there's a secret sakura garden hiding in plain sight.
This 1.5-hectare public plot, known as the Sano family garden, is an oasis of calm; found just off an unassuming street near traditional wooden machiya townhouses. But this isn't just any ordinary cherry blossom tree grove; it's also the domain of 97-year-old TÅemon Sano: Japan's most renowned sakuramori (cherry blossom guardian).
For more than a millennium, Japanese people have admired the delicate sakura petals as a symbol of transience and beauty. Today, this national pastime has blossomed into an international obsession, with millions of tourists from across the world descending on Japan to sip seasonal sakura-themed Starbucks drinks and participate in hanami (cherry blossom viewing) picnics and festivals from March to May. But while the world waits with bated breath for the cotton candy-coloured blossoms to burst each spring, one of the most important and least understood roles in the trees' maintenance lies with their behind-the-scenes caretakers.
According to Naoko Abe, cherry blossom expert and author of The Sakura Obsession, skilled sakura arborists have existed in Japan since time immemorial. But thanks to the popularity of the 1970s novel Sakuramori about a sakura-infatuated tree expert, communities began bestowing this title to deserving specialists in the years that followed. Typically a professional gardener or tree surgeon, a sakuramori is a combination of Lorax, botanist and spiritual guide dedicated to studying sakura and promoting their preservation.
As Asada Nobuyuki, the secretary general of the Japan Sakura Association, explained, there are roughly 100 sakuramori in Japan today, but one stands out. ""It can be said that TÅemon Sano is most deserving of the title sakuramori,"" said Nobuyuki, crediting the breadth of Sano's long, productive career and his family's generational wisdom.
On a Friday morning earlier this month, I crunched through gravel at this historic sanctuary to meet Sano himself. He is the 16th generation in a distinguished line of farmers who began cultivating the nearby land (known for its late-blooming dwarf cherry trees) in the mid-1600s. When his father died in 1981, he assumed the first name TÅemon, per family tradition, and took the reins of UetÅ ZÅen, the landscaping firm his family started in 1832 that is headquartered in the garden.
For more than 80 years,Sano has utilised his specialised knowledge to steward the survival of sakura trees in gardens throughout Japan and the world â including at the Isamu Noguchi-designed Japanese garden at the Unesco headquarters in Paris. Sakura Taikan, his most famous book, is the definitive tome on the trees and the culmination of research begun by his grandfather during theÂ TaishÅ period (1912â1926).
But just before our visit, the nonagenarian became ill and was rushed to hospital. Still, he arranged for me to meet his son, Shinichi Sano, who oversees operations at UetÅ ZÅen and who will one day succeed his father and carry on the family legacy as the next TÅemon and sakuramori.
As we strolled through the garden, Shinichi paused at an umbrella-like shidarezakura (weeping cherry), its swooping branches covered in geisha-blush blossoms. Shinichi said this 40-year-old tree was grown from the seeds of the most iconic sakura in Kyoto: the dramatic weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park, which was originally grown in the Sano family garden and replanted in its current public spot by TÅemon's father, the 15th TÅemon Sano.
Though sakura have attracted hanami lovers for generations, Shinichi said a major threat now looms over them: climate change. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, cherry blossoms have started to bloom 1.2 days earlier per decade since 1953. A recent study found that the peak bloom of Kyoto's cherry blossoms in 2020, 2021 and 2023 were the earliest in more than 1,200 years.
""If global warming continues at this rate, I believe there will eventually be regions in Japan where cherry trees no longer bloom,"" Shinichi said, noting that winters with elevated temperatures could nip blooms in the bud entirely, as trees require a sustained chill to initiate the blossoming process. If this happens, a major part of Japan's springtime tourism appeal would be jeopardised â as well as an integral part of the nation's cultural identity.
""The reason Japanese people are fond of cherry blossoms is because, after enduring a harsh winter, the vivid flowers bloom in the monochrome landscape as if to herald the long-awaited arrival of spring. This quiet presence is what draws people in and resonates deeply in our hearts,"" TÅemon later told me over email after being released from hospital. ""Out of 365 days a year, the cherry blossoms endure wind and snow for 360 days, only to bloom gloriously for five days before gracefully scattering. I believe this fleeting yet dignified cycle reflects the Japanese perspective on life. There may be a sense of personification in the way we view the cherry blossom, as if it embodies a spiritual or moral belief that, through patience and perseverance, one will eventually bloom.""
Cherry blossoms are integral to the Japanese psyche and soul. In ancient Japan, kami (deities) were said to reside in the trees. Beginning in the 800s, Emperor Saga (whose former residence is up the road from the Sano family garden at Daikaku-ji) ushered in the practice of hanami with official cherry blossom viewing parties. For samurai during the Kamakura period (1185-1333), sakura became a unifying military symbol for the warriors to fall with dignity and grace â a message echoed during World War Two for kamikaze pilots. In light of this national importance, protecting sakura and ensuring their sustainability is something Japan takes seriously.
Today, according to Abe, many of the most famous places travellers go to see sakura in Japan, such as Mount Yoshino in Nara and Matsumae Park in Hokkaido, each have a dedicated sakuramori. Interestingly, TÅemon and his family's unbroken line of Japanese gardeners may not have risen to the level of sakuramori were it not for a British botanist.
In 1902, English naturalist Collingwood ""Cherry"" Ingram became fascinated by Japanese cherry trees during his first visit to the nation, but he lamented how industrialisation and cloning had led to a decline in their diversity. In an effort to protect them, he sent 50 endangered varieties back to England and planted them in his garden. When he eventually tried to propagate the varieties back in Japan come the 1930s, including the rare Taihaku cherry that had ceased to be cultivated in Japan, the trees didn't survive long.
Given the Sano family's generational expertise, Ingram sought out TÅemon's grandfather, who developed a way to transport the trees successfully so they wouldn't sprout before arriving in Japan. From that little shipment of Taihaku trees, it is thought that tens of thousands of Tahihaku now flourish across Japan and were saved from national extinction.
TÅemon's grandfather became something of a Johnny Appleseed for sakura â taking grafts and growing saplings, venturing to far-flung places like the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin before he died in 1934. TÅemon's father then took up the mantle while training his son to continue the family legacy.
Today, travellers enjoying the mesmerising weeping cherry in Maruyama Park have TÅemon to thank, as the city asks him to care for the tree throughout the year. Visitors can also admire TÅemon's work at the Ruriko-in estate, where sakura stand in stunning harmony on the property close to the Golden Pavilion of Kinkakuji; the Katsura Imperial Villa; the Shukaguin Imperial Villa; Ninna-ji Temple garden; and, of course, at the nearby Sano family property.
Even at 97,Â TÅemon still collects information on different types of sakura and makes detailed drawings of the blossoms' anatomy from the stamen and pistils to the bracts and peduncles â all to better understand how to help sakura flourish.
""My feelings toward cherry blossoms are something that has been ingrained in my daily life,"" TÅemon said. ""My daily life follows the old Japanese way of life seikÅ-udoku, 'working in the fields when it's sunny and reading when it rains'â¦ If I am asked to preserve rare cherry blossoms, I respond by grafting or sowing seeds.""

To that end, he has successfully propagated cherry trees in the atomic bomb-ravaged soil of Hiroshima and saved a 150-year-old Oshima cherry tree in Yokohama that was destined to be cut down. In that instance, when the local community enlisted him to relocate the storied sakura 100m away to preserve an iconic view of Mt Fuji, he took careful stock of the three layers of soil surrounding the tree. Before digging, TÅemon ceremonially placed sake and rice crackers in the dirt as an apology for the disruption, added charcoal and provided an octopus offering. Also known to hug trees, TÅemon embraced the trunk tightly upon its successful replanting.
As I toured the Sano family garden, fallingÂ cherry petals fluttered to the ground like snowflakes, a phenomenon called sakura fubuki. In addition to kami, the souls of ancestors are also said to reside in the flowering cherry blossoms, connectingÂ the Sano family to their forebearers and representing the fleeting nature of each generation.Â Amid this transient beauty, the Japanese concept ofÂ ""mono no aware"" (the wistful recognition of life's ephemerality and the beauty in that impermanence) feels especially present.
""Cherry blossoms reflect the way of life of the samurai in the old days: beautiful in the way they fall with grace and dignity,"" Shinichi said. Shinichi's 38-year-old son, Tomoaki, who has started to take over day-to-day responsibilities in the family business, has one child â a daughter. It would then be possible to have the first female sakuramori in this line.
""It will depend on her decision,"" Shinichi said.
For now, though, the family is allowing the 16th TÅemon Sano to focus his attentions on what he does best.
""While my father is healthy, he will be the one to take care of the sakura,"" Shinichi said. I then asked if he felt he would one day be ready to assume the role of TÅemon Sano and sakuramori.
""I won't really know until I actually become the 17th generation,"" Shinichi said. ""I think I will truly feel the responsibility for the first time when I actually inherit the nameâ¦ I'll do what I'm asked to.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20230521-king-david-laamea-kalkaua-the-first-king-to-travel-around-the-world,The first king to travel around the world,"He had tea with the Queen, was blessed by the Pope and spread Hawaiian culture across the globe. More than a century later, a festival dubbed the ""Olympics of hula"" honours his legacy.
Silence engulfed the audience at Edith Kanaka'ole Stadium in Hilo, Hawai'i, as a group of hula dancers appeared on stage. They moved gracefully in unison, rhythmically depicting a scene of an ancient Hawaiian myth as they bellowed mele (chants). The hula performance, which was part of the annual Merrie Monarch Festival, wasn't a mere spectacle; it was a powerful celebration of Hawaiian culture â and for years, it was banned.
The week-longÂ Merrie Monarch Festival (which takes place 20-26 April 2025 and is celebrating its 62nd anniversary) has been called the ""Olympics of hula""Â and perpetuates the sacred, centuries-old practice of dancing and chanting that preserves and portrays our native Hawaiian language, history, religion and culture. Every year, thousands of Hawaiians descend on the Big Island to attend the event, while thousands more watch live broadcasts of Hawai'i's 23 best hÄlau (hula groups) compete on TV. Yet, the festival is more than just a hula contest; its dance performances, arts and craft exhibitions, and a royal parade through downtown Hilo is considered the biggest display of Hawaiian culture in the world.
""It's the one week out of the year where we celebrate being Hawaiian,"" said KÅ« Kahakalau, a Hawaiian language and culture expert. ""And it's all thanks to the undertakings of King KalÄkaua.""
Fondly dubbed ""The Merrie Monarch"", King David La'amea KalÄkaua was the last king of Hawai'i. He ruled the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1874 until his death in 1891, but his ascension to the throne was nothing short of contentious. Shortly after the death of King Kamehameha IV, whose family had ruled the kingdom since 1795, Hawai'i's legislatureÂ decided to elect a nativeÂ ali'iÂ (noble chief) instead of the king's widow. The decision incited a full-blown riot. As the queen's supporters stormed the Honolulu courthouse, British and American sailors stationed at Honolulu harbour were called in to quell the fighting and KalÄkaua took the oath of office the following day.
By the time of KalÄkaua's reign, Native Hawaiian heritage was at great risk. Christian missionaries had begun arriving on the islands in 1820, introducing diseases that killed Native Hawaiians, converting islanders away from our traditional polytheistic religion and infiltrating the political system to suppress local culture and beliefs. One of the most significant ways they did this was by banning public performances of the hula, a dance missionaries deemed ""vile heathen chants"".
KalÄkaua sought to restore a unified sense of national pride among Hawaiians, and his reign marked a period of cultural renaissance across the islands. He lived by the motto Ho'oulu LÄhuiÂ (Increase the Nation) and sought to remake Hawai'i for Hawaiians â all of which resulted in the revival of traditional customs such as language, music, arts and traditional medicines that had long been suppressed during the missionary-influenced era of his predecessors. One of his crowning achievements was preserving the hula. As KalÄkaua famously proclaimed: ""Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.""
To many people around the world, ""hula"" may conjure images of tiki bars, plastic dancers shaking their hips on car dashboards or something that only happens at beachside resorts. But long before hula was commodified and appropriated, it was a sacred dance among Native Hawaiians â an ancient practice that served as an archive of our stories, beliefs and way of life. Prior to the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, there was no written language in Hawai'i. Instead, ancient Hawaiians used oral tradition and hula to pass on their identity and culture from one generation to the next. Even when practice was prohibited, Hawaiians took hula underground, continuing to teach the forbidden dance in secret in caves and far-flung areas.
As part of KalÄkaua's Ho'oulu LÄhuiÂ policy, hula experienced a resurgence. In fact, the king's lavish two-week coronation ceremony was essentially a celebration of Native Hawaiian culture, featuring traditional music, hula and lÅ«'au âÂ all of which had previously been banned. To commemorate his 50th birthday three years later,Â ho'opa'aÂ (chanters) andÂ 'ÅlapaÂ (dancers) performed in public for the first time in years, while a parade wound its way through downtown Honolulu. Today, the Merrie Monarch Festival pays tribute to the proud sense of Hawaiian identity KalÄkaua revived.
[KalÄkaua] was deeply committed, proud and knowledgeable about his Hawaiian heritage,"" said Kahakalau, noting that the king was also the first person to have the Kumulipo (a creation chant that also includes the genealogy of Hawaiian royalty) written down.
Yet, KalÄkaua wasn't just content to revive Hawaiian customs in Hawai'i; he wanted to share the Kingdom's culture around the world. So, in 1881, the ""Merrie Monarch"" continued the proud Hawaiian tradition of long-distance seafaring byÂ spending 281 days circumnavigating the globe, becoming the first head of state to travel around the world.
During KalÄkaua's international diplomacy tour, he was greeted by the Emperor of Japan to the sounds ofÂ Hawai'i Pono'Ä«Â (the Kingdom's national anthem, which KalÄkaua had written); he proposed immigration policies with Chinese politicians; he toured the Great Sphinx with the Khedive of Egypt; he was blessed by Pope Leo XIII in Rome; he had tea with Queen Victoria of England, and he boarded a train that was struck by a bull in Spain. In New York, KalÄkaua met with Thomas Edison to discuss the possibility of getting electricity to Honolulu. In 1886, the king's wish came true.Â 'Iolani PalaceÂ (which is now a museum and the only royal residence in the United States), became illuminated with electric lights â five years before the White House did.
""He was able to build important relationships, create liaisons, and sign treaties with multiple countries [that benefitted our people],"" said Kenneth ""Aloha"" Victor, a kumu hula (master hula teacher) and designer of Kaulua'e, a made-in-Hawai'i clothing and lifestyle brand. In addition to sending envoys to Europe and Asia, KalÄkaua maintained consulates and legations in more than 130 cities across the globe. The Kingdom had 13 consulates in Great Britain alone.
Back at home, during an era of increased literacy, KalÄkaua met with traditional na kahuna (priests) and na kapuna (elders) to compile many of the ancient Hawaiian myths and chants that are portrayed through hula and mele and write them in Hawaiian. In 1888, he took things one step further and translated these stories into English for the first time in the book, Legends and Myths of Hawai'i, which he often presented as gifts to foreign dignitaries so they'd get a better understanding of Hawai'i, its culture and its people.
More like this:

â¢ A lei maker's guide to the real Honolulu
â¢ Hawaii's ancient land management system
KalÄkaua's mission to integrate Hawai'i with the rest of the world also resulted in the creation of the Hawaiian Youths Abroad Program, in which the king selected young Hawaiians whom he felt could become future leaders of the Kingdom and sent them abroad to study things like medicine, law, engineering, foreign languages and art.Â More than 100 years later, the programme's legacy still echoes across the islands: Princess Abigail KawÄnanakoa, the granddaughter of one of the students the king sent abroad, played an instrumental role in restoring 'Iolani Palace and was a staunch supporter of native Hawaiian rights until her death in 2022.
A multi-hyphenate in every sense of the word, KalÄkaua embraced modernity just as much as he valued Hawaiian culture. He was a voracious inventor, designing blueprints for tornado-proof ships, fish-shaped torpedoes, sealed bottle caps and rangefinder scopes. He even had a telephone installed that connected 'Iolani Palace where he lived and worked to his private boathouse less than a mile away, where he'd often be found hosting royal lÅ«'ausÂ for foreign dignitaries and heads of state.
For Hawaiians today, KalÄkaua is much more than just a Renaissance man. ""When KalÄkaua travelled [abroad], he promoted and shared our culture with the world,"" said Ana Kon, a Hawaiian cultural specialist based in Hilo. ""It's why, more than a century later, we continue to honour his legacy today at the Merrie Monarch Festival.""
For those unable to snag tickets to the Merrie Monarch Festival's highly coveted hula competitions, there are still plenty of opportunities to participate in the festivities. Hilo's Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium and Butler Buildings host a vibrant arts and crafts fair featuring the creations of more than 150 local artisans and brands from across Hawai'i. ""Our 'aloha wear' is a celebration of hula,"" said Victor, of his clothing, which he said honours the people, places and movements in Hawaiian culture.
Of course, KalÄkaua's legacy lives on beyond the festival. In many ways, every hula step, lÅ«'au gathering and Hawaiian-language phrase is a nod back to our last king's efforts to revive our customs at home and introduce them around the world. Visitors can experience this first hand at O'ahu's Polynesian Cultural Center, which hosts a traditional Hawaiian lÅ«'au paying homage to Queen Lili'uokalani (KalÄkaua's sister, who succeeded him until white businessmenÂ overthrew the Kingdom in 1893), while the Queen Emma Summer PalaceÂ in Honolulu offers contemporary hula lessons for adults.
On Maui, immersive experiences at theÂ Grand WaileaÂ include an E Ala EÂ oliÂ (chant) in the mornings on the beach, while interactive language lessons teach guests how to pronounce words inÂ Ê»Ålelo Hawai'iÂ (Hawaiian). Beachside resorts likeÂ Outrigger Reef in Waikiki Beach are adopting a regenerative tourism approach at its A'o Cultural Center by allowing guests to meet traditional Hawaiian navigators and canoe builders, teaching them how to use traditional Hawaiian tools and â yes â participate in hula lessons.
""It all spawns back to [King KalÄkaua's] creed,"" said Victor. ""That hula is the heartbeat of our Hawaiian people.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250418-a-guide-to-jane-austens-derbyshire-england,The stunning landscapes behind Pride and Prejudice,"As the UK celebrates the writer's 250th birthday, there's never been a better time to explore the dramatic bluffs and picture-perfect villages connected to her most famous novel.
""There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire,"" wrote 19th-Century novelist Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice, arguably her most famous novel. Indeed, its idyllic stone villages and towns, verdant valleys, deep caverns, towering gritstone edges and windswept moorlands make the East Midlands county one of the best places to enjoy England's great outdoors.
Derbyshire played a starring role in Austen's novel, shining particularly in the latter half when its heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, travels north from Hertfordshire to the Peak District and is reunited with the book's romantic hero, Mr Darcy. Joe Wright's 2005 film adaptation brought the stunning scenery to the big screen, leading travellers to flock to Derbyshire and see the sights through their own eyes.
Yet, according to Hazel Jones, editor of the Jane Austen Society's Annual Report, there is no evidence that Austen actually ever visited Derbyshire. Instead, Austen would have read romanticised descriptions in contemporary journals of the county, which experienced a Georgian period boom in tourism, and completed ""scrupulous research"", says Jones.
""We just have to trust Jane Austen's instinct that Derbyshire is the perfect county for Pemberley [Mr Darcy's home] says Jones. ""It is, after all, far enough away from Mrs Bennet.""
This year not only marks the 250th anniversary of Austen's birth but also the 30th anniversary of the adapted BBC miniseries and the 20th anniversary of the four-time Oscar-nominated film â which will be re-released in select cinemas in the UK, US and Australia starting 20 April. As the weather warms and wildflowers blanket the region, it's an opportune time to explore the many landmarks and filming locations connected to one of the world's great love stories.
Any tour of Austen's Derbyshire should begin at Chatsworth House. Fittingly, the opulent Grade I-listed estate and stables were transformed into Pemberley, the home of Pride and Prejudice's wealthy suitor, Mr Darcy, in the 2005 film.
Chatsworth sits on 1,822 manicured acres on the banks of the Derwent river, and it is home to herds of deer and sheep as well as wild animals. Owned and lived in by 17 generations of the Devonshire family, it opened its doors to the public in 1708.
Today, visitors can tour the stately home to admire one of Europe's most significant private art collections, whose paintings, rare books and historical documents span more than four centuries. Visitors will eventually come to the sculpture gallery, which fans of the film will recognise â particularly the Veiled Vestal. Keep your eyes peeled in the gift shop for a bust of Darcy's head, though, unfortunately, it's not available to purchase â or kiss!
While you could easily spend a day exploring Chatsworth's 105-acre garden, dipping your toes into the 300-year-old Cascade waterfall, winding through the giant maze or running around the Willow Tree Fountain (a brass tree that might just soak you when standing underneath it), there are plenty of free walks you can take around the estate too.
Derbyshire is home to many of England's finest aristocratic houses â including Sudbury Hall, which was used for the interior shots of Pemberley in the BBC adaption. And just a five-minute drive south of the town of Bakewell is Haddon Hall, which has been owned by the Manners family for the last 900 years. There's something magical about this country house, especially when the pale pink and red roses adorn the walls in the summer months. Wandering through the Elizabethan gardens feels like you're stepping back in time.
Film location scouts agree. Haddon Hall's medieval and Tudor architecture was also featured in Franco Zeffirelli's adaptation of Jane Eyre, The Princess Bride film, and more recently, Firebrand. Fans of the Pride & Prejudice film may recognise the wood-panelled banqueting hall, which served as the interiors of the fictional Inn at Lambton; and the parlour, which became Elizabeth Bennet's bedroom.
""There's a palpable magic at Haddon Hall, where centuries-old architecture meets the vibrant hues of summer,"" says Julie Mellor, filming coordinator at Haddon. ""Beyond its visual splendour, Haddon offers a sanctuary of learning and culture.""
Haddon runs a specialist film tour with experts who have been on the film sets, as well as variety of workshops and events ranging from art and craft sessions to ecological walks. ""It's an idyllic setting that encourages reflection and discovery, making summer 2025 an ideal time to experience the romance and elegance that define it,"" says Mellor.
According to local lore, Austen stayed in Bakewell at the Rutland Arms Hotel and wrote much of Pride and Prejudice here. Some Austen experts dispute this claim, yet she does reference the market town in the novel as Elizabeth travels through it on her way to Pemberley.

Set on the banks of the river Wye, bustling Bakewell is ideally situated between Chatsworth House and Haddon Hall. It's also the start of the 8.5-mile walking, jogging, cycling and wheelchair-accessible Monsal Trail, built atop a former Manchester-to-London railway line.
Bakewell is home to two traditional English sweet treats: the Bakewell pudding and Bakewell tart. For an authentic taste of both, head to The Old Original Bakewell Pudding Shop, which has sold the former since the 1800s (made with their secret recipe), and now sells tarts too.
In the film adaptation, Bennet's arrival in Derbyshire is marked with an iconic shot of actress Keira Knightley standing atop the four-mile-long gritstone ridge of Stanage Edge, looking out onto the vast and dramatic Hope Valley beneath her. Two decades later, many Pride and Prejudice fans scour the Edge to find the exact spot where the actress stood â so much so it's often called ""Keira Knightley rock"".
The windswept landmark's rugged terrain attracts climbers and hikers from across the country. Geologist Rob Donnelly tells the BBC that Stanage Edge's millstone grit is emblematic of the Peak District National Park (you will spot the circular stones as you travel around). ""The gritstone edges form part of the Peak District's unique landscape,"" he says. ""They are an iconic rock type in the region, having been laid down roughly 300 million years ago.""
The Edge overlooks the village of Hathersage (reached via a six-mile walk through trails and woodland or a short drive), whose heated 30m outdoor pool makes for a scenic swim.
Set in the Peak District's south-eastern side and characterised as ""celebrated beauties"" by Austen are the twin towns of Matlock and Matlock Bath. Bennet travels through both locales on her way to Pemberley, and these namesake neighbours (Matlock is slightly bigger and lies about one mile north), are great bases for a stay in Derbyshire, with good transport connections, independent shops and cafes.
The spa resort of Matlock Bath is frequently described as a seaside town without the sea. It has attracted visitors since the late 17th Century, when its thermal springs (which had previously been discovered and mined by the Romans) became used for medicinal purposes. Today, there is a historic outdoor swimming pool fed by mineral-rich natural spring water tucked around the back of the New Matlock Bath Hotel & Spa.
Austen was likely well aware of the town's famed thermal waters. When Bennet enters Derbyshire with apprehension about seeing Darcy, she says, ""But surely â¦ I may enter his county without impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."" Austen might have been referring to Matlock Bath's petrifying well â where the mineral-rich thermal water, turns objects into stone.
Matlock is also popular with walkers as it lies in a valley of the River Derwent. Pride and Prejudice fans may opt to explore the fittingly named Lovers' Walks, a series of footpaths along the riverside, or if you'd prefer something more challenging, there are also trails that go up and over the wooded cliffs. But perhaps the most famous tourist attraction is the Heights of Abraham, where you can take a mountain cable car to the top of Masson Hill, a 60-acre hilltop estate with a panoramic view of the surrounding valley and town below.
It is remarkable to think that an author who may not have set foot in Derbyshire cast such a bright light on the county. By intertwining real places into her narrative, Austen masterfully carried the reader along with Bennet on her journey through Derbyshire to reconcile with Darcy. As Jones says in her bookÂ Jane Austen's Journeys, ""What should be a truth universally acknowledged is that Jane Austen knew exactly what she was doing when she sent her liveliest heroine on the road north to Pemberley.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250417-the-baffling-purple-honey-found-only-in-north-carolina,The baffling purple honey only found in the US South,"In a quiet corner of North Carolina, bees produce a violet-hued honey so rare and unpredictable that even experts can't explain it â and that's what makes it magical.
In the Sandhills region of North Carolina, between the capital of Raleigh and the Nascar Hall of Fame in the sport-mad town of Charlotte, visitors may not even realise what a rare ecological niche they're stepping into. This is where the Atlantic once met the venerable Uwharrie Mountains, 145km inland; when the ocean pulled away, it left behind the grit that gave the region its name.
The region is one of the last homes for unique flora and fauna like the southern hognose snake and the Carolina gopher frog, both of which are endangered. What it's also known for, though, is something that has university researchers, foodies and conspiracy theorists all scratching their heads. It's a rare and coveted honey in a deep shade of aubergine-purple, and no one knows for sure what gives it the hue.
People largely travel to the Sandhills region for open-air adrenaline pursuits and laid-back rural charm â think corn mazes, trout fishing and country fair-style Americana.
The prestigious Pinehurst Golf Resort, commonly referred to as the ""cradle of American golf"", is here (don't miss its celebrated No 2 course), as is the horse riding hub Southern Pines and its abundance of equestrian trails and backcountry trekking. Kayakers and canoers flock to Drowning Creek, drawn by the scenic 13-mile route from Turnpike Road to Highway 401.
Hunting classic Southern game like white-tailed deer, wild turkey and wood ducks is popular in these parts, with extensive land preserves designated for conservation to support the pursuit. The longleaf pine forests are themselves a thing of simple beauty, and twitchers come here to search for northern bobwhite quails, bald eagles and â the star attraction â imperilled red-cockaded woodpeckers with their binoculars.
But travellers also come to the region to seek out something even more extraordinary than threatened species and unique biomes. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure.
""It is true that nobody knows what causes purple honey,"" says Paige Burns, who has a degree in horticulture and works with farmers and foresters in her role as the Richmond County Extension Director. Theories abound, both of the folklore and pseudo-scientific variety, and much like a porch swing, everybody here has one.
Burns tells me a few of the more popular speculations: that it's the alkalinity of the soil changing the honey's colour as it does hydrangeas from blue to pink; that it's wild berries surrounding the bee's territory; and, the one that sparks the most vociferous debate among locals, that it's the deep violet flower of the invasive (and wildly reviled) kudzu vine. Beekeepers in the area have reported finding the jewel-hued honey in their hives for years, but even so, its appearance is so sporadic and at the whim of chance, it continues to be a surprise when it does appear.
Don Dees, who owns and operates Dees Bees Apiary in nearby Aberdeen, North Carolina, has purple honey on his website, but it's sold out. It's impossible to pre-sale for this year's harvest since no one knows how much, or even if, the bees will deign to colour the combs in plum or in the customary amber. Instead, he invites people to check his Facebook page for updates from mid-July. His pure raw honey costs $16.50 (Â£13) for 900g. Purple honey, when he has it, goes for $75 (about Â£58) for an 85g glass jar. Talk about finding treasure; this is a limited edition in every sense of the word.
Dees' take on the phenomenon? He refutes the lore that aluminium in the terrain plays a factor and insists that kudzu isn't part of the equation, reasoning his apiary would produce it every season if so. Purple honey is most likely to arise under drought-like conditions, he says, and Dees believes that blue-black huckleberries that grow on shrubs rooted in thirst-tolerant clay feed the hard-up-for-food bees that can't locate traditional more water-dependent blooms.
However, Rusty Burlew, a master beekeeper who directs the Native Bee Conservancy of Washington State, says that a lot of circumstantial evidence points to the inky-violet flower of the kudzu, and she doubts that bees have the jaws necessary to pierce fruit for nectar. Flavour-wise, she says, ""to my untrained palate, the honey really does taste purple, in a grape-y sort of way"".
Burns tells me that she's never been one of the lucky ones to harvest the jammy-sweet treasure. ""One of the beekeepers I work with, she's probably, as the crow flies, two miles from me. I'm on the creek; she's on the creek. Obviously, we're in a very similar environment. She regularly gets purple honey; I've never gotten it."" Laughing, she adds that it's a surprise even to the bee farmers when they open the hive and find it. ""Some years you get it, and then 10 years you don't.""

And here I am, a native to the state, with no idea such a wild-foraged wonder existed. Turns out some mysteries aren't just hidden; they're hidden in plain sight. That's the beauty of travel: not just the landscapes that render you speechless or the food that rewrites the rules, but the stories you stumble into along the way. The ones that don't come with tidy explanations or easy answers. There aren't many of those left.
There's something incredible about standing under a sky unbothered by city lights, surrounded by the literal hum of a place still untamed, knowing that not even the beekeepers â who spend their days elbow-deep in the stuff â can tell you why this honey defies nature's colour wheel. Maybe we'll never know. And perhaps that's the point. Some places keep their secrets â and that's precisely what makes them worth the trip.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250416-what-its-like-to-live-in-the-happiest-country-on-earth,What it's like to live in the world's happiest country,"Finland has topped the World Happiness Rankings for the eighth year running â but the real appeal for travellers lies in the country's deeply-lived values of balance, nature and everyday contentment.
Finns tend to accept the accolade of supreme happiness, bestowed on them by the UN's World Happiness Report in March 2025 for the eighth time in a row, with a collective shrug and eye roll. But Finnish travel operators are celebrating as travellers increasingly make the connection between Finland and happiness, hoping to come and experience that Finnish brand of happiness for themselves.
However, don't expect to be greeted with howls of laughter and cheerful quips when you land at Helsinki Airport or disembark from one of the Baltic ferries in the capital's harbour. There is some truth in the perception of Finland being a no-nonsense, down-to-earth kind of nation. Generally, Finns are flattered â happy, even â to be honoured by the report's conclusions, but while graciously accepting them, they feel ""happiness"" isn't really the right word. Instead, ""contentment"", ""fulfilment"" or ""life satisfaction"" are widely considered more appropriate terms. As Finnish President Alexander Stubb recently posted on Facebook: ""No one can be happy all the time, and sometimes circumstance makes it difficult. But getting the basics right â security, freedom and equality â is a good start.""
But while the concept of happiness in Finland may be nuanced and culturally specific, it is deeply embedded in the fabric of daily life. Rather than seeking constant highs, the Finnish approach is rooted in balance, connection and quiet contentment â qualities that increasingly resonate with visitors. And for travellers, this state of being is not just something to observe but one to get involved with first-hand, through embracing the country's nature, sauna culture, food, sustainable design and lifestyle.
""We see Finnish happiness as a summary of these five elements,"" says Teemu Ahola, director of international operations at Visit Finland, ""but we don't measure or collect data to evaluate happiness as a single attraction in itself"".
To experience these tangible, authentic aspects of Finnish life that underpin its consistent happiness ranking, Ahola suggests Finnish sauna culture as an increasingly popular, most globally identifiable attraction; and stresses that Finland is a safe country, naming the risk of bumping into free-roaming reindeer in northern Lapland as one of the few potential hazards for visiting tourists. Meanwhile, he adds, a new and confident generation of Finnish chefs has earned international respect for and interest in the Finnish culinary scene.
Finland is home to the world's northernmost Michelin star restaurant, Tapio, in Ruka-Kuusamo; and the Saimaa Lakeland region was named a European Region of Gastronomy in 2024. Many restaurants across Helsinki celebrate the edible riches â mushrooms, berries, fish and game â that are accessible to all in the country's endless forests, coastal archipelagos and inland waterways through Finland's JokaisenoikeudetÂ or ""Everyman's Right"", a law that grants everyone the freedom to roam and forage.
Helsinki, where most visitors start or end their trip, offers a first-hand glimpse of this national contentment. This is a seaside city, spread over a beautiful natural archipelago and reclaimed land. It's easy to grab a city bike from one of the dozens of stands around town and head off to explore the coast-hugging cycling routes or disappear into Central Park, a belt of forest that stretches from the city centre to its northern periphery.
The endorphin boost experienced by this kind of freewheeling adventure and access to plentiful natural resources ties directly into the UN's happiness metrics of life expectancy, freedom and positive emotions. This connection can be found at the heart of SaimaaLife, a nature and wellness company in eastern Finland's sprawling Saimaa Lakeland region, run by mental health expert and guide Mari Ahonen.
Ahonen is an enthusiastic advocate of the mental balance that Finnish nature and lifestyle have to offer and leads her guests through shinrin-yoku (forest bathing), traditional lakeside saunas, wild swimming, foraging trips for mushrooms and berries and cooking over an open fire.
""We Finns can be too modest,"" she says. ""We should notice the World Happiness status in a positive way. I'm a living example of having been able to develop a business with the support that has been available for my entrepreneurship. Some people say it's a lottery win to be born in Finland.""
A lottery win, that is, in the form of life satisfaction and balance; of living comfortably and having ""enough"" in a material sense. This ceiling of expectation shouldn't be confused with a lack of ambition or resourcefulness. After all, this is the birthplace of mobile communications pioneer Nokia, the distinctive garden tool and scissor brand Fiskars and textile and clothing icon Marimekko.
Finland isn't immune from economic pressure or controversies, however, and the long, dark winters can put a strain on mental health. The Finnish idea of happiness also includes a dose of sisu: a hard-to-translate concept of resilience, fortitude, courage and grit. Finnish-Canadian author Katja Pantzar, who has written extensively about this perceived national quality, explains that it's ""a mindset that allows people and communities to work together in the face of challenges rather than give up or blame and attack others"".

She notes that the top four nations in the World Happiness Report are all Nordic countries with strong welfare systems designed to support the collective good. ""Happiness is very culturally specific,"" she said. ""In Finland, there are many examples of everyday happiness that are available and accessible to everyone, whether it's nature â every person in Finland is on average about 200m from the nearest forest, park, seashore or natural body of water â saunas, public libraries, safe and efficient public transport, free clean drinking water, education or healthcare.""
Pantzar also highlights the mood-boosting properties of contrast therapy â hot saunas followed by cold dips â as an accessible, every-day mood booster. ""It's incredibly easy to do in Helsinki, surrounded by the sea,"" she says. ""When you don't need to travel great distances or pay large fees to have a quick dip, it's easier to do more regularly, before or after work or on your lunch break.""
And while some Finns remain sceptical of the ""happiest nation"" label, most seem to appreciate what they have. ""I don't find it easy to think of Finland as the happiest country in the world,"" says pensioner Juha Roiha. ""In poorer countries like Thailand and Nepal, people seem relaxed in spite of any hardship. In Finland, you might sometimes hear people say that they'd be happier somewhere else. But within ourselves, with what we have, we're happy.""
Happy Land - Finding the Inner Finn, a travel memoir by Tim Bird, will be published by Eye Books in the UK in January 2026. It takes a ""sideways"" look at Finland's happiness status.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250416-inside-the-fortress-that-inspired-hamlet,Inside the fortress that inspired Hamlet,"As Radiohead and the RSC launch an innovative reinterpretation of Hamlet, a visit to the play's setting in Denmark brings a new dimension to the tragedy.
There's a cold wind blowing from the Ãresund Sound as I stand on a platform in front of Kronborg Castle in HelsingÃ¸r, Denmark, looking out to Sweden. At one end of the platform, a pillar-box red guard post stands beside a row of impressive cannons facing the strait. I'm not here for the view though: I'm looking for ghosts.
This windy spot is the exact location for the opening scene of Hamlet, Shakespeare's best-known tragedy. Here, two guards, Francisco and Bernardo, switch posts in the middle of the night and speak of the ghost of Hamlet's father. The castle behind me, a grand Renaissance pile built in 1574 complete with fairytale turrets, a moat and a grand banqueting hall, is where the rest of the lurid drama unfolds.
This year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting no fewer than three variations on the story: a radical adaptation using Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief as its score (from 27 April); Fat Ham, a comic tragedy that transplants Hamlet's story into the Deep South (from 15 August); and a traditional take in Rupert Goold's production starring Luke Thallon (from 8 February). For context, the last time the RSC staged Hamlet was back in 2016.
""There's something in the air right now saying that the play has resonance,"" says Tamara Harvey, co-artistic director at the RSC, noting that all three producers had approached the RSC to stage their productions in the same year.
As a play that deals with themes of generational differences and changing world orders, not to mention the sense that ""there's something rotten in the state of Denmark"" â the idea that society's foundations no longer feel secure â it's hard to miss its appeal.
Today, nothing looks rotten in HelsingÃ¸r â the modern-day name for Shakespeare's town of Elsinore. The sky is blue and the sun is glinting off a gold flag flying at the top of one of the turrets. I'm on a tour with castle host Louise Older Steffensen to uncover Kronborg's Hamlet connections. Our feet echo as we walk around the stone corridors and into the grand ballroom with its chequerboard floor and soaring wooden ceiling, as she tells me there is no evidence that Shakespeare ever visited Kronborg âÂ but he certainly knew it well.
""We have contracts that tell us that Shakespeare's colleagues visited the castle,"" she says. ""We know that the actors Thomas Pope, George Bryan and William Kempe were here for a season, performing plays for the Danish king. When they returned to England, they set up the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's company.""
They may have brought back tales of what happened within its walls. A distinctive celebration is mentioned in the play: a toast followed by the bang of a kettle drum, a trumpet, and a cannon â and it comes from a tradition followed in the castle at that time.
In a dimly lit room next to the ballroom, the tapestries from that era are on display, their gilded threads depicting mythologised kings. Long curtains hang around the queen's bedchamber and around the castle, softening the sandstone walls, dampening sound and making it a fraction warmer â as well as providing opportunities for dramatic intrigue.
Visiting the castle feels like being immersed in the play, walking down the large gallery where the silk dresses of the ladies-in-waiting would have rustled into its beautifully preserved church. It's as if the play itself has come to life, and the castle plays up to that theatricality. In the summer, special tours invite guests to participate in Hamlet-inspired murder mystery-style tours, and in the autumn, Hallowe'en tours take place in the creepy basements. Nobody, to date, has seen the ghost of Hamlet's father â but there have been other ghostly sightings, according to Steffensen and assorted castle guides.
More clues about the importance of this castle to Shakespeare emerge as Steffensen gives me a history lesson. James I married Denmark's teenage princess, Anne, in 1589. When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 and King James ascended to the throne, England had a Danish queen.
""The first quarto â written very early in 1603 â is set in Denmark,"" said Steffensen, ""but there are no specific locations in it. After Anne becomes Queen of England, we get references to the castle itself.""
King James became the patron of Shakespeare's company and their name changed from ""The Lord Chamberlain's Men"" to ""The King's Men"" in 1603. Queen Anne's castle in Denmark became an important location for the royal family and thus gained a starring role in the play.
We climb to the top of the cannon tower, a large flat space in a corner of the castle. Views reach across the moat to the yellow barracks buildings around it and to the town beyond. It's in one of these barracks buildings, the former infirmary that is now the headquarters of the town's Shakespeare Festival, where I find out more about the legacy of Hamlet in HelsingÃ¸r.
Lars Romann Engel, CEO and artistic director of HamletScenen, the castle's professional theatre body, welcomes me into a hallway-cum-gallery of Hamlet actors through the decades. In a who's who of Hamlets, black and white headshots of Jude Law, Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, David Tennant, Richard Burton and Christopher Plummer cover the walls and stairwell.
Hamlet played a part in reinventing this town into a cultural hub after its shipbuilding industry collapsed in the 1980s, as the municipality devised a way to create a producing theatre at the Unesco-listed castle. Engel set up the town's Shakespeare festival, which takes place at the castle every August, showing adaptations of Hamlet in many guises; previous shows have included Spaghetti Western versions, dark German variants by experimental theatre SchaubÃ¼ne and a sell-out staging starring Jude Law.
As well as Hamlet, the festival typically also produces a lighter Shakespeare work, often with music and other events. Both plays are performed in the open air with the castle as a backdrop; tickets book out a long way in advance and the audience typically shows up with a picnic.
More like this:
â¢ Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life
â¢ Denmark's surf town where old-school fishermen and surfers live in harmony
â¢ Copenhagen's 'CopenPay' scheme rewards tourists â but does it actually work?
A trained theatre director himself, Engel directed a very successful adaptation of Hamlet in 2008, set in the castle's courtyard with tumbledown walls and crumbling masonry â starring a young Claes Bang as Rosenkrantz â and, after a mutual decision with the local municipality, set up the festival following its success. He has been running and directing the event for the past 17 years.
""When you see Hamlet here, you know that you enter the myth,"" said Engel. ""Now you are at the epicentre of it all. It's a special thing: it was actually here that it was written for.""
Engel takes me on a tour of some of the other barracks buildings, ending in the Lapidarium, the sculpture storage room of the castle, where a full-size sculpture of Shakespeare sits beside a sleeping Viking warrior, Holger Danske. Danske is another significant figure for the castle: according to legend, when Denmark needs him, he'll wake up and come to its aid. A reproduction of this original model lurks in the gloom of the castle cellars.
Engel is in the throes of arranging this year's festival, which will take place 6-24 August and feature both Twelfth Night and Hamlet, performed by The Lord Chamberlain's Men, who take a classical Elizabethan approach to the works and perform with an all-male cast.
""This year we've taken a more classical approach,"" said Engel, ""because right now the world is edgy. When we are a little afraid, we don't like it to be upside down and we want it to be more as we know it.""
In testament to the endless ways the play can be reinvented, however, Engel also plans to put on Eddie Izzard's one-person Hamlet at the stage this year. It's often said that every minute of every day, Hamlet is being performed somewhere in the world. Shakespeare's most popular play in his lifetime has an afterlife, 425 years later, that surpasses all expectations.
""It's one of the greatest pieces of writing in the English language, dealing with the very nature of human existence,"" says Harvey. ""A play wrangling with this fundamental issue with such complexity is always going to mean different things to different people.""
Visiting Kronborg Castle, experiencing the ""set"" of the play in real life, certainly brings it to life. As I exit the castle, crossing the bridge over the moat, past the guardhouse to the grass fortifications around the castle, the sounds of marching feet echo through the sound system. I'm back in the world of the play, at the end of Hamlet, joining the march where the prince's body is taken away.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250423-the-eight-asian-sauces-to-keep-in-your-pantry,Eight Asian sauces to keep in your pantry,"From Korea's doenjang and gochujang to Hong Kong's XO sauce and East Asia's fish sauce, Asian cuisines provide hundreds of ways to flavour and season dishes.
Across Asia, myriad sauces add layers of flavour, depth and instant seasoning to dishes, far surpassing any measure of salt and pepper. From Korea's doenjang and gochujang to Hong Kong's XO sauce and East Asia's fish sauce, there are hundreds of different sauces on the market. Many of these have fermentation as a common thread, creating deeply complex flavours that are a result of patience and time. This article will guide you through some of the most common and how to use them.
This elusively named condiment originated in Hong Kong, with roots dating to the 1970s and 80s. ""XO"", which stands for ""extra-old"", is a nod to XO cognac â an aged liquor that often signifies wealth and prestige in Hong Kong. However, the semblance between the sauce and the cognac ends there, as there's no actual liquor in XO sauce. ""XO"" simply provides the connotation of luxury, hinting at the array of expensive ingredients within the jar.
The condiment, which is a staple of Cantonese cuisine, has foggy origins. Hong Kong's Sun Tung Lok restaurants have laid claim to its invention, though it's also said that it was first created in 1986 at The Peninsula Hotel's Spring Moon restaurant.
While there's no standardised XO recipe, the ingredients typically include dried scallops and shrimp, as well as garlic, red chillies and ginger. Some variations include Chinese dry-cured ham. The resulting sauce is mildly spicy, savoury and smoky. Use it as a condiment with subtly flavoured dishes such as noodles, steamed seafood like scallops and white fish, or on dim sum dishes such as rice rolls and radish cake. XO can also be used as a seasoning to braise meats and flavour vegetables.
Originating in China about 2,200 years ago, the first known soy sauce recipe was recorded in an ancient Chinese agriculture text, with records showing that some of the first versions of soy sauce were closely linked to jiang, a soybean paste fermented with meat, millet and salt.
There are many varieties of soy sauces used worldwide, including Chinese light and dark soy sauce, Hong Kong sweet soy sauce, Japanese shoyu, Taiwanese soy sauce, Korean ganjang and Indonesian kecap manis. They all consist of the same main ingredients: fermented soybean paste, wheat, yeast and salt.
Chinese soy sauce is brewed in two primary ways: light and dark. Made from the first press of fermented soybeans and aged anywhere from days to months, light soy sauce is thinner and saltier than dark soy and is used in everyday cooking for a pop of flavour. Alternatively, dark soy is made at the end of the pressing process. It is thick, dark and sweet, as it often includes molasses or caramel. It's used sparingly to add colour and roundness to dishes like stir-fries, braises and marinades.
Japanese soy sauce (shoyu), is typically made with an equal ratio of soybeans and wheat, resulting in a mild, slightly sweet flavour. It has a long brewing time and as such, it's complex and rich. Tamari, which is often used in place of Japanese soy, is made from miso (fermented soybean paste), but without wheat, making it a rich, gluten-free option that can be used in a variety of dishes.
This staple condiment is popular in many cuisines, but it's perhaps best known in Thailand where it is believed to have originated (there are conflicting stories of its origin). The sauce tastes as the name would describe â sweet and a little spicy. Primarily made of red chillies, rice wine vinegar and a sweetener like sugar or honey, sweet chilli sauce may also have notes of garlic, rice wine vinegar and fish sauce, depending on the producer.
Corn starch is usually added to create a slightly thick consistency that makes for a perfect dipping sauce served alongside crunchy, salty and deep-fried dishes such as spring rolls and chicken wings. It also makes a great glaze and adds punchy sweetness to stir-fries.
If you've been to a Chinese grocery store, chances are you've come across the Hong Kong sauce giant, Lee Kum Kee. Legend has it that oyster sauce was invented by Lee Kum Sheung in 1888 when he was boiling a pot of oyster soup and accidentally left it on the stove overnight. The next day, the soup was transformed into a thick, caramelised, gravy-like sauce â aka the oyster sauce we know and love today.
The sauce is rich, umami-filled and savoury with a hint of sweetness that's perfect for stir-fries, stews and dipping sauces. There are numerous brands on the market and even Lee Kum Kee makes two variations: original and panda oyster sauce. The ""original"" oyster sauce contains about 40% oyster extract while ""panda"" only contains 11%. Oysters naturally contain umami, which means the more oyster extract in your chosen sauce, the deeper and richer your food will taste.
Hoisin sauce is a thick, sweet, savoury sauce popular in Cantonese cuisine. The word hoisin is derived from the Cantonese pronunciation of ""seafood"" â but there's no actual seafood in the sauce, nor is it typically eaten with seafood. Instead, hoisin sauce is used for vegetable and meat stir-fries or in marinades such as char siu, a Cantonese-style barbecue pork. It's also often served alongside Peking duck as a dipping sauce, and at Vietnamese restaurants it's used as a condiment for phÃ³ (soup with noodles and meat).
The main ingredient in hoisin sauce is fermented soybean paste, combined with thickening agents such as corn starch and sweet potato powder. Other ingredients include sesame paste, sugar, rice vinegar and spices such as red chilli peppers and garlic. While peanut butter is often listed in the ingredients of online recipes, there are no peanuts in traditional hoisin sauce.
Fermented black beans (made from soybeans) were discovered in a tomb that was sealed in 165 BCE during China's Han Dynasty, making them the oldest known soy food. The fermented beans are a key ingredient in all-purpose black bean sauce, which includes soy sauce, garlic, ginger, vinegar and sometimes a sweetener like sugar. It's salty, pungent and umami-rich and a versatile ingredient/condiment that can be used in stir-fries and marinades. When used alongside aromatics, proteins and other sauces (such as soy sauce), the intense flavour of the black bean gets diluted, leaving a savoury richness that brings an unmistakable level of extra flavour to a dish. There are variations on the sauce (such as black bean garlic sauce and chili black bean sauce) that merge additional flavours into the fermented beans.
Korean gochujang is a thick, sticky, fermented red chilli paste that's savoury and spicy with an underlying sweetness. The red paste is made from gochu-garu (Korean chilli powder), glutinous rice powder, powdered soybeans, grain syrup, malt, salt and water. Traditionally, gochujang is made in the winter and fermented in sunlight for about two to six months.

Gochujang is versatile and can be used as a punchy marinade for meats, dissolved into sauces and soups and added into dips. It's a popular condiment or dipping sauce for dishes like Korean fried chicken and bibimbap (a mixed rice dish) and tteokbokki (rice cakes). Heat levels differ between brands, so make sure to taste to adjust the amount you use accordingly.
Fish sauce is an ancient condiment with roots dating back to Greece in 7th Century BCE, where it was made by fermenting small fish with salt. It's not very different in modern times, as it's typically made with anchovies or other oily fish, shrimp or even krill. It's a key ingredient in East Asian and Southeast Asian cuisines in countries such as Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam, as well as in Italy where it's called colatura. Popular dishes that owe their deliciousness to fish sauce include Thailand's pad thai (a stir-fried noodle dish) and tom yum (a hot and sour soup), Vietnam's nuoc mam cham dipping sauce and Laos' larb (ground meat salad).
To make the sauce, fish are placed in barrels with salt and left to ferment for about 12 to 18 months, resulting in a briny and fishy sauce packed with umami. While the sauce may smell overwhelmingly fishy at first whiff, the odour mellows when cooked, leaving behind a subtle, savoury flavour. Because the sauce is so pungent, small amounts go a long way, and it's advisable to taste and adjust the amount of sauce as you cook.
Add fish sauce to salad dressings, stir-fries, soups, marinades, braises and even pasta sauces for an added layer of complexity.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250417-inside-the-life-of-old-delhis-only-female-pigeon-keeper,Flying high: Delhi's only female pigeon keeper,"In the male-dominated world of Delhi's kabootarbazi, one woman's passion for her birds has earned her respect, admiration â and a place in the sky.
As dusk descends on Old Delhi, the bustling streets grow even more crowded, with pedestrians inching forward through jam-packed streets and auto-rickshaws honking impatiently. But above the chaos, a quieter ritual takes flight. On rooftops across the old quarters, kabootarbaaz (pigeon keepers) release their cherished flocks into the sky. Whistles pierce the air and calls echo from rooftop to rooftop. And the birds respond, transforming the skyline into a swirling spectacle.
Pigeon keeping in Old Delhi is more than a pastime; it's an umbilical cord to the identity of Old Delhi that's rooted in the city's Mughal heritage. ""A kabootarbaaz takes immense pride in their pigeons,"" says Ratnendu Ray, who conducts heritage walks in Delhi for the Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage (INTACH). ""It's a sense of self, cultural identity and belonging.""
The tradition of pigeon keeping, known as kabootarbazi, dates to ancient times, tracing its roots to the era of the Mahabharata (between 400BC and AD200) when the birds were kept in palaces to entertain royalty. ""Women of the court would often sit in their jharokhas (balconies) and watch the pigeons in flight,"" says author and historian Rana Safvi.
However, she explains, it was under the Muslim rulers that this pastime evolved into a popular sport.
""The sport reached its zenith under Emperor Jahangir, who likened kabutarbaazi to ishqbaazi (the art of love) and brought expert pigeon trainers to Delhi, elevating the tradition to a new level of refinement.""
Thousands of pigeon keepers across the city carry on this tradition, rising through the ranks from shagird, or trainee, eventually rising to be a khalifa. ""[They are] finally recognised by the fraternity as an ustaad â the highest level one can attain,"" says Ray.
While kabootarbazi is traditionally a man's job passed down from father to son over the centuries, Shaheen Parveen has the distinction of being the only female pigeon keeper in Delhi.
In the neighbourhood of Khawaja Mir Dard Basti, Parveen transitions through various roles in a day, from devoted wife to mother to grandmother. However, as soon as she is alone, she climbs up the bamboo stairs that lead to the rooftop of her house, high above the crammed lanes where men savour kebabs frying in small eateries.
She starts her day inspecting her more than 100 pigeons, ensuring that each one is healthy before feeding them a custom grain mix. She then trains them through timed flights, using whistles or claps for recall. Evenings involve roll calls and nest checks; she also perfects their skills for competitions.
At sunset, Parveen's voice stands out from the myriad calls of men echoing for pigeons. As she raises her voice to the highest pitch, people peer out of their windows and from their terraces to catch a glimpse of their favourite pigeon keeper.
Being a kabootarbaaz is both tradition and passion, and Parveen says that spending time with the birds brings her a sense of peace and tranquillity. ""If I don't spend time with them, I feel sick; they are like my children,"" she says.
Parveen's rise to the respected status she now holds within the male-dominated community has been far from easy.
She credits her father for her love of the sport. ""Every day after returning from school, he would take me to the rooftop to see his pigeons and that is when my love for the birds began,"" she says. However, she had to contend with the disapproval of her brother, who forbade her from pursuing the hobby. Later, she faced criticism from others who claimed it was unbecoming for a woman.
However, she persisted, driven by her love for the birds. ""When your skills are praised and the community respects you for them, you feel uplifted, then the voices of those who speak against you don't matter,"" she says. ""Let people say whatever they want to, I will continue doing what I want and what gives me peace.""
Parveen has earned widespread respect across the community for her talents. ""People see the visit of an experienced pigeon keeper to their roofs as a blessing; I receive many offers from people requesting me to bless their pigeons,"" she says with a smile. However, she usually declines these offers: ""I don't get time from my own pigeons; also it is tiring.""
Experienced pigeon keepers like Mohsin Ustaad take out time from their busy schedules to support Parveen with feed and medicine, expenses that she sometimes struggles to afford. ""I came to her terrace because I respect her and have admiration for her skill,"" says Mohsin. Parveen smiles shyly: ""It costs thousands of rupees â thankfully Mohsin helps us.""
Parveen's biggest triumph came when her pigeons won a major local race that drew hundreds of ustaads and hobbyists from Old Delhi and beyond â many of whom had trained their birds for months or years in preparation. In the race, the pigeons were released from a remote location and had to find their way back home. Judging was based on speed, endurance and how well the pigeons responded to their ustaad's calls.

Race winners are awarded trophies, cash prizes and immense respect within the kabootarbazi community. Afterwards, scores of pigeon keepers presented Parveen with gifts. ""Some even gave me money. It was like India had won the World Cup, some put garlands on me, I was nervous and happy,"" she says, showing videos and pictures of the event.
""People recognised her, she got more respect,"" her daughter adds.
Pigeon keeping has also become an attraction for travellers visiting Delhi, who are intrigued to see a way of life they may have seen in Bollywood movies but never witnessed for themselves.
Kabootarbaazi, Ray says, is governed by a rich set of social structures, unspoken rules and codes of conduct. ""Pigeon-keepers often operate within specific territories, usually based around their neighbourhood or rooftop,"" he explains. ""Venturing into territory of others is seen as disrespectful. There are also competitions and tournaments; witnessing all of it is a traveller's delight.""
His heritage walk Prayer, power and pigeon: A heritage walk and kabootarbaz introduces visitors to this world, walking through the winding alleys between houses and watching the birds soaring through the open city skies.
Content creators are also flocking to Old Delhi to capture the sight of the birds soaring and swirling in the sky. As they climb up to the terraces, seasoned pigeon keepers spring into action. They tighten their grip on the mesh used to guide the birds mid-flight with swift, practiced motions; they whistle, clap and call out in rhythmic chants.
The pigeons, mid-flight, respond in unison, veering back toward home, their wings slicing through the air in a synchronised dance. ""I've been following pages of pigeon keepers on YouTube and other platforms for some time now,"" says Imran Ahmed, who came to take photos for his social media platforms. ""Today, I'm glad to finally be among them, capturing photos and being photographed alongside these beautiful birds.""
As the day ends, Parveen climbs to her terrace and lets her birds out. When they reach a certain height, she calls them to return. They respond right away. ""I train each bird to recognise my voice, to know my call and trust me. It's a bond that you can't build overnight,"" Parveen explains, adjusting her pigeons' feed.
Though not an official ustaad yet, her skill and status are undeniable. ""These birds feel my moods, and I feel theirs,"" she says, smiling. ""In this world of feathers and sky, they know me as I know them. That's something no one can take from me.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240327-the-centuries-old-baba-recipe-made-with-96-egg-yolks,The recipe for a centuries-old Easter baba made with 96 eggs,"The baba is often served at Easter in Poland, with the most extraordinary version â the muslin baba â made from a rich dough of flour, yeast, butter and quite a lot of egg yolks.
Depending on where it's baked, the baba or babka takes on many different forms. In the US, it's a braided brioche-like bread that often has chocolate, nuts or other ingredients mixed in. Europeans might be more familiar with baba au rhum, a desert popular in France and Italy that is soaked in liqueur and served in individual portions.
But in Poland, the word ""baba"" can refer to a variety of baked goods. Some are made in Bundt pans, while others are loaf shaped. Some are more bread-like and use yeast while others more closely resemble pound cake, like the lemon baba I made for my son's birthday. And some, like the potato babka so popular in Poland's Podlasie region, are savoury instead of sweet.
[jump to recipe]
The typical yeasted baba is often served at Easter and added to the Easter basket brought to church to be blessed, with the most extraordinary version being the muslin baba named for muslin cloth because of its lightness. It's made from a rich dough that contains flour, butter, yeast and a lot of egg yolks â 96 of them for every kilogram of flour.
One food website says to ""take a deep breath"", as the home version of the muslin baba recipe calls for just 250g of flour, so you will only need 24 egg yolks. By contrast, the Easter baba recipe I usually make contains six egg yolks for 500g of flour (or 12 egg yolks per kilogram), and I already consider that to be a lot.
The original recipe for muslin baba is often credited to the 19th-Century food writer and journalist Lucyna Äwierczakiewiczowa, an extremely popular and successful cookbook writer at the time. I came across the recipe in two other cookbooks: Jak GotowaÄ (How to Cook) by Maria Disslowa, first published in 1931, and then again inÂ Old Polish Traditions in the Kitchen and at the TableÂ (published in 1979) by Maria Lemnis and Henryk Vitry, both pseudonyms of Polish musicologist Tadeusz Å»akiej, which provides fascinating insights into the life and traditions of pre-war Poland.
""The cook, the lady of the house and all the women locked themselves up in the kitchen,"" Å»akiej writes. ""They sieved the whitest of flours, mixed hundreds of egg yolks with sugar in clay bowls, dissolved saffron in vodka.""
This is not the easiest of recipes. It requires long mixing and rising times and keeping an eye on the oven during baking to prevent burning (not to mention having to crack so many eggs). In other words, making baba was serious business.
Some say that the name ""baba"" (the word for ""woman"" in Polish) referred to the fact that the dough was finnicky and moody, ""just like a woman's temperament"". And men weren't allowed into the kitchen during baking as it was thought their presence could lead to a failed, undercooked cake. While the dough was rising, it would be covered in a linen tablecloth and doors and windows were sealed to prevent drafts. After baking, the baba rested on cushions, and because it was thought to be so sensitive until it fully cooled, everyone would whisper because it was believed loud noises would cause it to collapse. Sometimes, after taking the baba out of the oven, the kitchen would be filled with sobbing: ""A burned or collapsed baba was a terrible faux pas,"" Å»akiej writes.
But one question remains, why the extreme amount of egg yolks?
""Egg yolks contain lecithin, which acts as natural leavening agent,"" says Jacek Malarski, the co-founder of Lukullus, a Warsaw-based bakery that sells the 96-egg yolk baba (or as they call it, Baba 96). ""Adding a large amount of yolks results in a tender and fluffy texture, and adding an extreme amount of egg yolks results in an extremely fluffy texture, like a cloud.""
Because of their high fat content and emulsifying properties, the egg yolks also make the baba last for longer without having to add any preservatives and give the finished product a beautiful golden-yellow colour.
In the past, serving such a rich pastry was a status symbol. ""Fat was more expensive than even the most expensive of meats,"" says JarosÅaw Dumanowski, a food historian at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in ToruÅ. The recipe also calls for 400g of butter for every kilogram of flour, which acts as carrier for the vanilla flavour. Some households even added saffron, one of the most expensive spices. ""These were exotic things from far away so that rich people could distinguish themselves from the rest,"" Dumanowski says.

â¢ Bebinca: a multi-layered egg yolk cake
When Malarski and his partner, Albert Judycki, decided to offer a baba at Lukullus bakery, they tested several dozens of versions, both old and modern, before deciding on a clear winner: the muslin baba. ""The muslin baba was beyond compare. It melted in your mouth and remained fresh for longest,"" Malarski says. They use bourbon vanilla from Madagascar and cover the Baba 96 in homemade lemon glaze. The muslin baba has been making a regular appearance at Lukullus at Easter ever since.
When I ask Malarski about the popularity of this particular baba despite it being so rich and labour-intensive, he replied: ""It's the best. If someone tries it, they never want to go back. They miss it too much.""

Adapted from Old Polish Traditions in the Kitchen and at the Table
Method
Step 1
In a heated bain-marie, beat the egg yolks and sugar (what remains after separating out 1 tsp) until white and fluffy. The original recipe calls for half an hour by hand with a whisk but with an electric mixer, 10 minutes should be enough. Set aside to cool.
Step 2
Heat up the milk until lukewarm and add the yeast, 1 tsp sugar and 1 tsp flour. Let rest until bubbly, around 5 minutes.
Step 3
Add this mixture, with the remaining flour and vanilla bean seeds or vanilla extract to the egg yolks and sugar and beat for another 10 minutes.
Step 4
Add the melted (but not hot) butter, beat for another 10 minutes, then leave the dough to rest in a warm place until doubled in size. The dough will be loose, more like a cake batter than yeast dough. (You won't be able to knead it, not by hand and not with the dough hook. Even the stretch-and-fold technique, typically used when handling wetter doughs, will fail here.)
Step 5
When it has doubled in size, carefully transfer it to a buttered 4-liter-sized Bundt pan.
Step 6
Allow it to rest in a warm spot until the dough has risen out of the form. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 170C/340F.
Step 7
Carefully transfer the baba to the hot oven and bake for 35-40 minutes but keep a good eye on it as the high amount of egg yolk and sugar may cause it to burn easily. A toothpick inserted into the baba should come out clean. Allow to cool.
Remove from the pan, then decorate with lemon glaze (a mix of lemon juice and powdered sugar to taste), or candied orange peel if you wish.
Notes
* If 24 yolks seems excessive to you, you can halve the recipe and make a smaller baba.
** Some people online have suggested decreasing the amount of yeast to 45g.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250415-chriselle-lims-self-care-guide-to-seoul,How to have a self-care holiday in Seoul,"She jets around the world for her high-profile beauty career, but her heart is in Seoul. Here are her top K-beauty experiences in town, from face lasers to body scrubs.
For Chriselle Lim â style guru, digital creator and creative director of PHLUR fragrances â self-care is a way of life. Especially when she visits South Korea, the birthplace of the viral ""K-beauty""â Â beloved for its multi-layer ""glass skin"" skincare regimens and high-tech sun creams.
""Beauty and self-care in Korea is a daily thing,"" says the fresh-faced and flawlessly stylish Lim, who spent her formative years in the glamorous South Korean capital and returns with her daughters each year. ""It's not about hitting a certain age and then taking care of your skin. You just do it since you're a very young girl. As we're trying to reverse [sun damage] here in the States, in Korea, the women have been taught to protect themselves early on. We were always embarrassed about our moms taking us around in their crazy massive sun hats and their gloves. But now I get it. I've become that lady.""
While innovative Korean products like collagen sheet masks continue to dominate the international market, Korea is also seeing an uptick in beauty tourism. Consumers can visit ""skin clinics"" for medical aesthetic treatments powered by ultra-modern Korean technologies; often not yet approved by the FDA. Adding to the appeal, patients can get several treatments â from Botox to Titanium skin lifting to liquid laser sun spot removal â in one sitting with jaw-dropping transformations and little downtime â compared to Western protocols, which require patients wait 28 days between treatments.
""I have a lot of followers that ask me for tips and where to go,"" says Lim. ""It makes a lot of sense. One, the technology is there. And two, it's so much cheaper [than the US], at least by five times. The flight there, renting an Airbnb or a hotel; it actually makes a lot of sense because you are saving money in the long run.""
Not that Lim ever needs a reason to visit Seoul. ""It's a fast-paced city that is extremely clean, chic, sophisticated,"" she says. ""Just imagine fashion and art and beauty all combined in one. It's one of those places I go whenever I'm feeling like I need inspiration.""
Here is Lim's go-to plan for a self-care holiday in Seoul.
Gangnam, the stylish district made world-famous by a certain 2012 K-pop song, is considered Seoul's K-beauty and medical tourism hot spotÂ  â and it's where Lim's self-care holidays start. First stop: Eun Skin Clinic in the affluent Cheongdam neighbourhood, south of the Han River.
""They do incredible lasers, the best I've experienced,"" says Lim. ""They speak really good English there, which is a big make or break for me because I'm not fluent in Korean. And because [the doctor] deals with a lot of English-speaking people, I think she realises that a lot of them are here to explore and have fun, so she doesn't want to be so aggressive with their face. They do a very customised approach.""
Korean skin lasers, notes Lim, are so gentle they can even be layered on top of each other to compound their transformative effects.
""It's very, very gentle,"" says Lim of her most recent visit. ""I did something called Ruby toning; helps with even skin tone and brightening. And there's another laser that I did called MeDioStarÂ®, which is brightening and tightening. And then on top of that, I did PRP [platelet-rich plasma treatment]. And then I also did microneedling and then salmon DNA. It takes maybe an hour and a half to do.""
She cautions:Â  ""The next day, if you get five to eight treatments, your skin will be slightly bruised, but it goes away within, I would say, 48 hours. [These lasers are] effective on the deeper surface level, but on the topical level, you can't really tell that you've gotten anything doneâ¦ But then after I went home, and people were like, 'Wait, did you, did you do something to your face? ' And you're like, 'Okay, I think it's kicking in'.""
Lim recommends visitors hit skin clinics at the beginning of their trip â ""first thing when they landâ¦ because these clinics like to check up on you after three-to-five days. During that downtime, you could do coffee and check out some incredible museums and do some shopping.""

As part of her downtime from skin procedures, Lim also likes to indulge in relaxing body treatments.
""There's this spa called Gogyeol,"" says Lim. ""I love this place to reset my body. They do a traditional Korean massage and scrub.""
Like Eun Skin Clinic, Spa Gogyeol is found in Cheongdam; a two-minute walk from the Gangnam-Gu Office metro station. Lim notes that Spa Gogyeol is a not a jjimjilbang (a public Korean bathhouse). ""A lot of people love Korean bathhouses [because] they do this intensive scrub where they literally scrub off all the dead cells off your skin and it just comes purging off your body. It's pretty disgusting. But [Spa Gogyeol does] that treatment in a private setting, so you can get the body scrub, the upgrade massage and a detox wrap. They literally scrub off every dead skin cell on your body, and it just feels so soft. You feel like you're floating.""
Spa Gogyeol also offers a rich menu of holistic medical treatments, working with the body's five Tae energies. ""In Korean health, a lot of it is about balance,"" says Lim. ""So they'll really analyse your body to see what they need to focus on, and they'll customise it for you.
""I think a lot of people that are on holiday just want to relax,"" she adds. ""A lot of tired mamas. It's a very calming space.""

Where Eun Skin Clinic is expressly high tech and Spa Gogyeol takes a holistic approach, Lim's next spa pick â Trinity Spa in Seoul's Yongsan District âÂ  is all about pampering and beautification.
""It's a little tricky with Trinity spa because their English isn't the best,"" says Lim. ""But I think they're working on it. They're more of a general spa; that's why I feel okay recommending it. They do everything from amazing facials, really focussing on lifting the face and focussing on your lines, and brightening and tightening to body contouring, massages. They cover it all.""
Trinity Spa's array of facial and body treatments toe the line between technology and relief â like the Real Jade Stone V-line jaw contour treatment or the lymphatic drainage leg massages â all administered in private guest rooms with cushy spa beds designed for ultimate relaxation.
""It's just a very relaxing experience for someone that wants a general spa experience,"" says Lim.

The Korean skincare craze began in the early 2010s; global cosmetic purveyor Sephora's website now features a K-beauty section and Lim herself often provides K-beauty product recommendations on social media.
So when in Korea, shop as the Koreans do.
""Everyone needs to go to Amorepacific World Headquarters,"" declares Lim. Known as the inventor of the cushion foundation, Amorepacific now also owns many popular Korean skincare companies including Sulwhasoo, Innisfree, Cosrx and Laneige. ""It's open to the public, which a lot of people don't know,"" says Lim. ""In their lobby, you can get your face scanned; a lot of people go there to get their cushion foundation customisedâ¦ they have a beauty store in their lobby, so you can experience all of their brands at once. [There's also] an interactive Amorepacific store called AMORE Seongsu. It's in this warehouse-y cement building; it's like you're walking through a store, but with a bathroom installation in front of you while you try things. Everything is technology-driven; you can get customised lip treatments, customised foundation. I could spend hours there.""
Lim adds: ""There's also the Sulwhasoo flagship store, which is just beautiful in itself.""
Sulwhasoo, a luxury skin line, is headquartered in Seoul's upscale shopping district Sinsa-dong, in a modular structure channelling a golden lantern. ""The shopping is great, and it looks like you're entering an installation,"" says Lim. ""It has two spas. You could have, like, a foot scrub [or] a therapist with the singing bowl around your abdomen.""
Lim also enjoys shopping for her favourite Korean brands at Olive Young. ""It's the Sephora of Korea,"" she says. ""They're on every corner. But the key thing is to know which one to go to. There's one in Myeongdong, which is the largest. Then the newest one is in Seongsu and it's a lot more tech-driven."" Apart from beauty shopping, the five-storey Olive Young in Seongsu houses a cafe and a skin and scalp clinic as well as professional makeup services and a ""trend pod"" showroom. ""Olive Young can be slightly outdated depending which one you go to,"" says Lim. ""But this one feels like the future of what Olive Young will be.""

To cap off a day of beauty, Lim heads straight for the hair salon. ""This is actually quite common in Korea,"" she says. ""After you get all your skin treatments, you go get your hair done.""
Lim favours ABYBOM, a massive, three-storey salon on Seolleung-ro that boasts a client roster of Korean celebs like Sandara Park. ""A lot of people that go to events get the full service of hair and makeup done,"" says Lim. ""They do amazing cuts. They style, they detoxify your scalp, if needed. They're incredible.""
Afterwards, Lim always likes to visit a cafÃ©. ""CafÃ© life in Korea is so major,"" she says. ""Between cafÃ©s and skin, you will never see the end of day."" One of her favourite stops is inside the Dosan Park Gentle Monster branch; 35 minutes outside of Seoul proper. ""Gentle Monster is a sunglass brand; they have the coolest shops ever,"" says Lim. ""It's like an art installation. Then downstairs, there is a cafe called Nudake; they have conceptual coffees and baked goods.""
Nudake CafÃ© proffers its coffees and whimsical pastries on stark countertops, like modern art displays. ""It sounds so ridiculous, but they have these tiny, tiny, tiny, miniature croissants,"" says Lim. ""They're literally the size of your pinky nail bed, but it's so good, and it's just so fun to take a photo with. [And] they have incredible coffee. It's actually quite hard to find non-dairy milks, but they have non-dairy milk there. So that's personally the reason why I like to go to that cafÃ©, to just get my lattes without dairy milk.""
""There's a lot of things that we have been doing in Korea that I feel like the world is finally noticing,"" adds Lim. ""It's something that I'm very proud of.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250415-why-all-inclusive-resorts-are-sending-guests-off-site,How resorts are rethinking the all-inclusive holiday,"Long associated with swim-up bars and endless beach time, all-inclusive resorts are rewriting the rules to meet the changing expectations of post-pandemic travellers.
When international travel resumed following the easing of Covid-19-related restrictions in 2022, Gregor Nassief, owner of Dominica's Fort Young Hotel and Dive Resort, was preparing for what many were calling the era of ""revenge travel"". With demand surging for all-inclusive holidays, he considered launching simple, one-stop-shop holiday packages. But he quickly realised that Dominica â nicknamed the ""Nature Island of the Caribbean"" â is not your typical beach destination.
""Travellers who come here don't want to do the fly-and-flop, where you sit at the beach and do nothing else,"" says Nassief. ""People come here to explore Dominica. It would be impossible for an all-inclusive offering to succeed here if we don't include the island.""
Nassief's realisation is part of a broader shift in resort travel. Long associated with swim-up-bars, buffets and endless beach time, all-inclusive resorts are adapting to meet the changing expectations of post-pandemic travellers. Many now crave both ease and adventure, seeking a frictionless stay with access to meaningful local experiences. From guided hikes and cultural outings to restaurant dinners and self-drive excursions, the all-inclusive model is expanding to include more of the surrounding destination. The shift, which began in earnest around 2022, continues to evolve in 2025 as more travellers prioritise connection, authenticity and exploration â all from the comfort of a five-star resort.
Nassief's ""island inclusive"" package launched in January 2022, offering guests not only full board and airport transfers, but a daily land or sea group excursion such as a trek to the spectacular waterfalls at Trafalgar Falls or a guided visit to lively Roseau Market. Despite requiring a five-night minimum booking and a significant upcharge (the island-inclusive package is $456 per person per night based on double occupancy, while the room-only rate starts at $302 a night), the programme now accounts for 30% of the hotel's all-inclusive leisure bookings.
A similar model drew Manila-based lawyer Kathrina Sadsad-Tamesis to Nay Palad Hideaway on Siargao, a recently trendy island in south-eastern Philippines, in 2024. With rates starting at $900 per person per night, a stay at the luxury resort includes made-to-order meals, massages and private off-property excursions like surfing classes, paddleboarding along nearby mangroves or visiting the picturesque Magpupungko rock pools.
""I like the fact that you don't need to check prices once you're there,"" Sadsad-Tamesis says, adding that she would love to see more resorts offering similar packages that build outings into their rate. To her, it encourages a more active trip. ""You don't need to think about what you are going to eat, you don't have to plan your activities, because they planned it all for you.
""Sometimes planning is the hardest part,"" she adds, ""so if the resort is already including activities, it is easier to participate.""
This blend of ease and engagement appeals to many travellers. A'Rielle Thomas, a family and honeymoons specialist at Fora Travel, estimates that 50% of her all-inclusive clients are now looking for experiences beyond the resort gates. ""They don't want just a flop-and-stop vacation. They want to interact with locals and with the destination,"" she says. Thomas believes that it's an opportunity for resorts to reimagine the guest experience â and tap into a new demographic of travellers who want the best of both worlds: a great beach resort and an opportunity for adventure.
""This is a blind spot for many resorts, because for a long time, getting guests offsite hasn't been their focus,"" she explains. ""If I'm staying at a resort but they offer a transfer and a guide to see ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡, that's a totally different value proposition and will be more enticing to someone who might not want to sit at a beach the whole time.""
But the excursions don't have to be as involved as a visit to a historical site or a day of island hopping. For some, a change of scenery for a meal could be enough, which is why Sandals launched their Island Inclusive dining programme in 2022 at Sandals Royal CuraÃ§ao. The initiative offers guests in select room categories dinner at a local restaurant, complete with transfers and a $250 dining credit. According to Jessica Shannon, chief experience officer at Sandals, this has been a wildly popular perk with a vast majority of qualifying guests taking advantage. The company now plans to bring the activation to the entire Sandals portfolio of 17 resorts.
Off-site meals are just one part of the Local Discovery initiative at Ikos Resorts, which operates seven hotels in Mediterranean hotspots like the island of Kos and the historic city of Marbella. Introduced in 2015, the initiative encourages guests to explore some of Europe's most beautiful regions for no extra cost. In addition to lunches or dinners at seafood taverns and family-owned eateries, visitors can also borrow a car for independent rides through the Costa del Sol or Mallorca's hilly interior. The Museum of Asian Art on Corfu, Pablo Picasso Museum in Marbella and Akrani winery on Kos are just some of the venues included in the brand's Culture Pass programme, which offers Ikos guests free access.

Meanwhile, in 2023 Paradisus by MeliÃ¡ unveiled their ""Destination-Inclusive concept"" for guests staying in higher rooms categories, which adds off-resort experiences to the all-in packages at many of their resort locations, from Los Cabos, Mexico, to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic and Gran Canaria in Spain. At Paradisus Palma Real Golf & Spa Resort, a guest might be whisked away on a catamaran to practice yoga on an unspoiled beach. At Paradisus by MeliÃ¡ Gran Canaria, meanwhile, staying in a superior room can include a guided hike around Roque Nublo or a visit to the Banana Museum.
According to Paula Forero, general manager of Paradisus Palma Real, hoteliers are learning that the needs of today's travellers â even those who are booking all-inclusives â have shifted as a result not just of the pandemic but also of social media. Now that travellers can easily consume content about the destinations of their upcoming vacation, they're feeling more intrepid, not wanting to miss out on the sights and sounds of the places they're scouting on platforms like Instagram and TikTok.
""Before, travellers were OK with spending seven days at a hotel, resting, enjoying, eating, not thinking,"" Forero explains. ""Now, no. Guests are more curious, because they have access to more information. They want more experiences, more adventures.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250414-south-africas-new-big-five-safari-destination,South Africa's new 'Big Five' safari destination,"Once emptied of wildlife, South Africa's Babanango Game Reserve is now home to the Big Five â thanks to a bold rewilding project led by Zulu communities and global conservationists.
Daybreak filters through the fever trees and umbrella thorns of South Africa's White Umfolozi River Valley, splintering orange light across a puckered grassland teeming with newly arrived wildlife. Bumping atop rough roads in an open-sided safari vehicle is field guide Eduan Balt, who's ""reading the bush newspaper"" â studying fresh prints on dirt trails for signs of apex predators.
Balt drives along some of the valley's 600km of roads â many built in recent years â passing bomas (enclosures) holding quarantined buffalo and a pond where hippos with giant jowls yawn into the morning air. The smell of wild anise wafts over the vehicle as it careens toward the valley floor. Then, suddenly, a lioness darts across the golden grassland to our left, muscling her way to a fallen tree where three kitten-like cubs bound into view.
These are the first lions born in this part of KwaZulu-Natal province in at least 150 years. Lions, like most native animals, became locally extinct in the decades following the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, after which the British Empire gained control of the region, turning it into farmland. Zulu communities got large swathes of it back during the land reforms that followed the fall of apartheid. But after decades of cattle grazing and illicit hunting, the area was largely depleted of wildlife.
That changed starting in 2018, thanks to an innovative collaboration between philanthropic investors, local NGOs and three Zulu community trusts, who leased lands to create one of the most ambitious rewilding projects in South Africa in more than a decade. The 20,000-hectare Babanango Game Reserve has welcomed nearly 4,000 medium- to large-sized animals since the process of game translocation â and remediating landscapes â began, in earnest, five years ago. Many, like the lions, have reproduced. So, there are now about 5,000 wild animals roaming a landscape they were largely absent from for more than a century.
German philanthropists Barbara and Hellmuth Weisser invested nearly 1 billion rand (Â£42.5m) to rewild these animals. They also bankrolled the tourist infrastructure that should support Babanango's future operational costs. ""I don't know of anyone else doing something quite like this,"" Hellmuth tells me over dinner at the Zulu Rock Lodge, one of four safari lodges now spread across the park.
The 77-year-old â a former energy executive and keen photographer â has been visiting southern Africa since the 1980s. In retirement, he and his wife wanted to find a place for a park that would uplift communities while restoring biodiversity. ""The problem for us is that there was no supermarket for finding projects,"" he recalls.
Babanango is south of Kruger National Park in a poorer region of South Africa closer to Durban than Johannesburg that wasn't historically a safari destination. It appeared on Hellmuth's radar only because the NGO Conservation Outcomes had identified a community trust, Emcakwini, looking for a partner to lease its unpopulated lands.
Hellmuth visited Babanango in 2017 and says he fell in love with its wild topography, including the boulder-strewn hills that tumble down 700m from our hilltop perch at Zulu Rock. ""We didn't want to buy somewhere where there was an existing project that had been run into the ground,"" he recalls. ""When we got here, we found a landscape that was extremely interesting.""
In 2018, the Weissers signed a contract with the Emcakwini Community Trust. Two smaller neighbouring trusts, Esibongweni and Kwa Ngono, came onboard in 2019 and 2020 respectively. All told, about three-fourths of the game reserve is now leased from these communities, who earn a rental fee and share ownership of the animals. The community trusts will also receive 25% of park profits when the project becomes solvent.
Babanango transformed into a Big Five game reserve in record time, but the process was not without its challenges. First, there was the 2,600 cows, 300 goats and 35 donkeys that the community trusts promised to remove from the land; something that didn't happen for more than three years. Then, in 2022, finally free of livestock, the park could complete its 81km perimeter fence, though much of what was initially laid was cut by ranchers and poachers. A majority of the wild animals arrived beginning in late 2022.
""It was very important, becoming a nature reserve, that we have species that were endemic to the area,"" explains Chris Galliers, conservation manager at Conservation Outcomes, which consulted on the project. ""A number of species were completely removed from the system; others like kudu, bushbucks and warthogs were still there in low numbers, but we needed to top them up for genetic purposes.""
A few leopards roamed the land, too. Yet, rhinos, buffalo and lions were all reintroduced between May 2022 and March 2023. Elephants were the last of the Big Five to arrive in June 2023. ""It was a big milestone,"" says Galliers. ""It symbolised that everything we had to do to get to that point had been done correctly.""
All rewilded animals live in bomas for several months before release to control for diseases such as foot-and-mouth. Most come from similar habitats to ensure they'll adapt and climatise as quickly as possible. There's also intense monitoring to ensure the balance of predator and prey remains intact. Efforts to discourage poaching include dehorning the rhinos (a procedure that conservationists use to increase the species' survival rates), which I spot my third day at Babanango behind fanning candelabra trees.
Galliers is the first to acknowledge that the park is a massive disrupter for the region. ""People have, for a large part of the past 200 years, been trying to get rid of these animals because of the threats they posed,"" he says. ""Now, the animals are sitting on their doorsteps again. So, it's quite a thing to try and understand.""
On my fourth and final day, I travel beyond the fence line, past browned fields trampled by cattle, to the village of Denny Dalton. Here, I meet with Thina Nyathi, manager of the African Habitat Conservancy Foundation (AHC), a registered public benefit organisation that supports Babanango with its community development work.

Nyathi, who was born in KwaZulu-Natal and is a native Zulu speaker, shows me one of the 17 solar-powered boreholes that AHC built to bring running water to neighbouring communities. She also tells me about AHC's efforts to remove invasive plants, such as black wattles, which suck up the region's groundwater. ""We see the direct impact this has on water scarcity because there are streams that were not flowing that, all of the sudden, are flowing again,"" she explains.
The foundation works with communities within a 10km radius of Babanango's fence line on everything from conservation education to agricultural support. It also runs vocational training, including classes on ceramics and Zulu beadwork so that the lodges in Babanango can sell crafts that uplift local artisans. ""It's about teaching someone to fish, and not just giving them the fish,"" Nyathi says. ""Working together means we also understand what their challenges are and support them to get to a point where they no longer need our help.""
About 75% of the staff at Babanango comes from the surrounding communities, and for many, it's their first salaried employment. Dudu Ngcobo, who works as part of the park's ecological restoration team, sent her two daughters to university, which for Nyathi demonstrates the ripple effects of higher-paying job opportunities.
The park hires locally for short-term projects, such as land rehabilitation, which helps build a greater understanding of the reserve's potential paybacks and long-term impact. The hope is that Babanango can become a kind a blueprint for other conservation areas on locally owned landscapes. ""Done right, we are able to have quite a big benefit on the environment,"" Nyathi says, ""but also the communities that surround it.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240412-thailands-cooling-rice-dish-to-beat-the-heat,Thailand's cooling rice dish to beat the heat,"The sweltering heat during Buddhist New Year calls for Thailand's cooling khao chae, a fragrant and refreshing bowl of rice delicately scented with flowers.
By the time Songkran, Thailand's new year based on the Buddhist calendar, arrives in April, the temperatures in the Southeast Asian country are soaring. The sky is typically blue and spotless, so reprieve under the shade of a passing cloud is non-existent while the humidity is as thick as a fleece blanket. One way to cool off is in the country-wide water fights that take place during the annual celebrations (this year from 13-15 April), which include water guns, buckets and coloured powder smeared onto the face like war paint. Another way to celebrate and cool off is to eat khao chae.
Khao chae (soaked rice) is an icy, seasonal treat that marks the beginning of summer in Thailand. The history of the dish can be traced back hundreds of years to the Mon people, an ethnic group that originated throughout Myanmar and Thailand and integrated into what was then Siamese society in the 16th Century.
[jump to recipe]
""The form of khao chae that we're looking at right now, especially in Bangkok, has very little resemblance to the Mon khao chae,"" says Leela Punyaratabandhu, a Thai scholar and the author of the 2017 cookbook Bangkok, which includes a recipe for khao chae. In the 16th Century, the soaked rice porridge was served in terracotta pots to keep the dish cold because ice wasn't readily available. The accompanying side dishes were also not nearly as intricate as they would eventually become.
It was within the kingdom of Siam's royal family, dating back to King Rama IV's rule in the 19th Century, that the dish blossomed into something far more complex â a metamorphosis of its humble origins. A lot of effort was made to ensure that khao chae looked visually beautiful, so side dishes included delicately carved vegetables shaped into flowers. In addition, ice, which was impossible for commoners to get at the time, distinguished kaho chae as an exclusively royal dish.
The recipe that exists now has been passed down through generations of royal cooks and aristocratic families. The dish starts by vigorously washing jasmine rice to remove all the starch. ""You have to wash the rice more than regular steamed rice so it doesn't stick together when cooked,"" explains Max Wittawat, the executive chef of New York City's Bangkok Supper Club. Wittawat grew up in Bangkok and was taught to make khao chae by culinary artist and teacher Jantararat Hemvej, who is known in Bangkok for having perfected khao chae.
Since the rice also needs to withstand being soaked for long periods without falling apart, which would render the dish cloudy, washing it is especially important. After it's steamed, the rice is submerged in ice water that's perfumed with the scent of flowers, ranging from jasmine, ylang ylang, damask roses and bread flowers. ""It's a mark of summer when the flowers bloom,"" adds Wittawat.
Punyaratabandhu has childhood memories of her grandfather using a spreadsheet to track the specific times that the flowers bloomed in his garden. ""All of this was very systematic,"" she says. It's important to pick the flowers at the precise time â typically the evening before preparing khao chae â in order to achieve the optimal fragrance. From there, the flowers are submerged in water for at least two hours to imbue their aroma.
Even the process of soaking the flowers is very intentional. If the flowers are left in the water for too long, they will bruise and go bad, leaving the water with a pungent and off-putting flavour. If they aren't steeped long enough, the bouquet will not be impactful enough to stand up to the side dishes served alongside khao chae. To enhance the dish's fragrance even further, a Thai culinary candle known as tian op may be used to smoke the flowery water.
And that's just the base of the dish. Khao chae is an experience that includes many elaborate accoutrements. ""It's not only hard to make, but it's hard to eat as well,"" says Punyaratabandhu. This is because there are a lot of pungent, salty and fishy flavours that could be unfamiliar to some. ""Shrimp paste balls mixed with fish and then dipped in egg and fried? It's a far cry from pad see ew [stir-fried noodles].""
When Punyaratabandhu began writing her cookbook, she struggled with whether or not she should include a recipe for khao chae, knowing how impractical and challenging the dish can be to prepare at home. ""I knew it was going to be a tough sell, but also it's a part of Bangkok,"" she explains. ""My job was to be faithful to whatever is happening in Bangkok.""
More like this:

â¢ The 3,000-year-old new year's celebration
â¢ The Thai noodles eaten for breakfast
Even Wittawat admits that khao chae, outside of the aristocratic society of Bangkok, was not really in Thailand's zeitgeist until the past 10 years, when many chefs began reflecting on their Thai heritage and exploring culturally significant and historical dishes. ""Before that, it was very old school and not common in restaurants,"" he says. ""But nowadays, with technology, the flowers can bloom throughout the year, and it has risen so much in popularity.""
Recently, khao chae has become a social media darling due to its myriad side dishes, like shrimp paste dumplings, elaborately carved vegetables, stuffed shallots and peppers, sweetened beef and pork jerky and delicate egg nests. It's visually stunning, especially when served in traditional Thai pots or tiffins. ""Sometimes, it's too pretty to eat,"" Wittawat says.
There is a particular way to enjoy the dish to avoid muddying the crystal-clear flower-scented water. ""You're not supposed to put all the condiments with the rice,"" Wittawat says. Instead, you should alternate eating the rice and side dishes. Vegetables and pickles can cut through the heavier flavours of sweetened beef and salty shrimp paste. ""This is the fun thing about khao chae,"" Wittawat says, acknowledging that the various flavours work in tandem to keep the meal fresh and exciting. ""You can continue eating more and more.""
Wittawat is happy that khao chae, once exclusive to the royal family and upper echelon of Thai society, is now more readily available and accessible to everyone â especially during Songkran, when Thailand is so hot. ""Thai people are returning to their roots,"" he says. ""They're appreciating their history and culture.
Khao chae recipe
by Max Wittawat
Serves 8
This is a general overview of how to make the rice for khao chae, along with two side dishes. Feel free to include additional sides to your liking.
Method
Step 1
Rinse the jasmine rice in water 4 to 5 times. Cook the rice in boiling water until half-cooked, then strain. Wash the rice in water again, using your hands to rub the rice; rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Transfer the rice to a steamer and steam until fully cooked. Let cool.
Step 2
To make the shrimp balls, blend all the ingredients (except the eggs and oil) in a blender until smooth. Pour into a large nonstick frying pan and cook until thick paste forms. Let cool slightly, then roll into small balls.
Step 3
Heat the oil in a medium pot. Dip the shrimp balls into beaten eggs, then deep-fry until golden brown. Set aside. (Reserve the oil for the green peppers.)
Step 4
Pound the coriander, garlic and peppercorns in a mortar with a pestle until smooth, then mix with the minced pork and shrimp. Season with sugar and salt. Stuff the mixture into the green peppers. Set the peppers into a steamer and steam for 10mins.
Step 5
To make the egg net,Â reheat the oil in the pot. Beat all the eggs together and strain through a sieve. Dip 5 fingers in the beaten eggs and shake into the pot of heated oil left to right, then up and down to form an egg net. When the eggs turn golden brown, transfer the egg net to a kitchen towel and place the steamed stuffed peppers on top, then roll the egg net around the peppers.Â Repeat with the remaining peppers.
Step 6
Spoon the steamed rice into bowls and pour the cold scented over it. Enjoy the khao chae with the shrimp balls and stuffed peppers, as well as sliced cucumber, green mango, scallion and lesser ginger.
Note
To make the scented water, steep jasmine, ylang-ylang (à¸à¸£à¸°à¸à¸±à¸à¸à¸²) and chommanard (à¸à¸¡à¸à¸²à¸) flowers with drinking water and (if using) smoke with a Thai aromatic candle (à¹à¸à¸µà¸¢à¸à¸«à¸­à¸¡) overnight. Once the water is infused, strain it, then chill thoroughly.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250411-songkran-the-worlds-biggest-water-fight,Songkran: The world's biggest water fight,"For three days every year, Thailand transforms into a wet and wild party. But this ancient festival is far more than just a raucous good time.
Every year from 13-15 April, Thais across the country cool off and celebrate new beginnings with what is arguably the nation's largest and most important festival: Songkran. Tied to the Thai New Year and the close of the annual rice harvest season, this annual celebration is all about purification, honouring elders and fostering a sense of renewal. However, it's most well-known among travellers as a raucous country-wide splash fest.
""The most famous part of the festival is the massive water fights,"" explained Worapa Angkhasirisap,director of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. ""People of all ages take to the streets armed with water guns and buckets.""
Viewers of the latest season of The White Lotus recently got a glimpse of this when three unaware travellers were dropped in the middle of a town-wide Songkran celebration. ""Why is everyone carrying those guns?"" one of the women asked. Within moments, the trio were being chased through the streets by water gun-wielding children and smiling revellers before seeking refuge in a convenience store, bewildered and soaked to the gills.
Despite its White Lotus portrayal, these water fights are generally a friendly and joyous part of the festivities that visitors are welcome to take part in. In fact, hordes of travellers now descend on Thailand each year to take part in what is commonly called ""the world's biggest water fight"". Yet, the festival's modern popularity among international travellers belies Songkran's deep roots.
Meaning ""to enter"" or ""move forward"" in Sanskrit, Songkran occurs when the Sun moves to the Aries constellation â the first sign of the Zodiac. Some scholars believe the Unesco-inscribed festival harks back to an ancient Hindu festival called Makar Sankranti and was adopted by the Khmer Empire that ruled Thailand in the 11th Century. Today, Songkran is all about making a fresh start, with water symbolising the washing away of the previous year and purification.
During the three-day festival, scented water is often poured atop images of the Buddha to represent renewal. It is also common for Thais to wash the hands of their elders and ask for their blessings, splash water on family and friends and give offerings to temples. ""Since most Thai people practice Buddhism,Â SongkranÂ is also a spiritual time,"" explained Kharitthakorn Sakulsupapong, sales and marketing managerof the Thailand-based Tropical VacationÂ travel agency.
Despite being a three-day national holiday, some Thai communities â such as the popular beach resort town of Pattaya â extend the party for as many as 10 days.
Because April is often Thailand's hottest month, cooling foods are typically on the menu during Songkran. ""Since April is the peak of mango season, you'll find plenty of mango sticky rice, one of Thailand's most beloved desserts,"" Angkhasirisap told the BBC. ""Another seasonal favourite is khao chae, a refreshing dish of rice soaked in jasmine-scented iced water, served with savoury side dishes â perfect for cooling down in the summer heat.""
Visitors who find themselves in the country during Songkran are more than welcome to join in on the festivities. ""Thai people are always very happy to teach tourists about their cultural traditions and will be delighted to answer any questions visitors may have [about the festival],"" said Jurairat Mongkolwongsiri, vice president of sales at Centara Hotels & Resorts in Bangkok. As with any religious festival, Mongkolwongsiri noted that it's also important to be respectful.
""Songkran is very inclusive â the water splashing is open to everyone, although it's always important to understand and respect the cultural boundaries,"" Mongkolwongsiri cautioned. ""For example, visitors must avoid throwing water on monks or elders and try not to spray water directly in anyoneâs face.""
While Thailand's cities attract the biggest Songkran crowds, Angkhasirisap says travellers venturing away from the nation's main tourist hotspots are also likely to encounter the festival.
""Bangkok and Chiang Mai are well-known hotspots, attracting huge crowds and hosting grand celebrations,"" she explained. ""[However], in recent years, Thailand has made an effort to promote celebrations in all regions, [including] lesser-known provinces.""

According to Angkhasirisap, smaller destinations have their own special twist to the holiday, with beach destinations like Songkhla and Surat Thani, being much more laidback than the party vibes found in larger cities, while provinces like Phrae, Lamphun, and Ubon Ratchathani incorporate cultural parades into the traditional festivities.
""Wherever you go, youâll find a warm and welcoming atmosphere,"" said Angkhasirisap. ""It's a truly unforgettable festival!""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250411-why-icelanders-are-happier-than-ever,Why Iceland is getting happier every year,"Iceland is one of the few places in the world where happiness is rising. Locals say the secret lies in nature, gender equality and a deep-rooted sense of resilience.
For the third year in a row, Finland has topped the 2025 World Happiness Report. While the Nordic countries traditionally fare well in the rankings, Denmark (ranked second), Sweden (fourth), and Norway (seventh) have all reported a net lower total happiness score since the survey started, measuring a slight decline in happiness over time. In fact, out of the top 20, only seven countries have been getting happier year on year â and Iceland stands out as having one of the biggest increases of them all, seeing a 9.1% boost since its measure on the first index in 2008.
Ranked the third-happiest country in the world this year (compared to 18th in 2008), Iceland scores the highest out of all countries in social support, with impressive scores in the freedom and generosity measures as well (third and fifth respectively). Despite its relatively small population â numbering just under 400,000 â the country continues to invest in infrastructure, progressive social policies and tourism.
But the thing that makes many Icelanders the happiest is something that the government has relatively little control over: the nation's otherworldly landscapes.
""From home, from work, it's very easy to get to a national park or open spaces where we can hike, walk by the river, coast or lakes,"" says Hrund GunnsteinsdÃ³ttir, author of forthcoming book InnSÃ¦i: Heal, Revive and Reset with the Icelandic Art of Intuition. She especially loves the landscape's variations and stark contrasts, from green and lush to barren and black sands.
As a geologist originally from the US, Jessica Poteet moved to Iceland specifically to be closer to nature. ""Being somewhere with volcanoes and Northern Lights and cotton candy-pink skies with snow-capped mountains in winter is a dream,"" she says. ""I never take it for granted. It's one of the key things contributing to my happiness.""
That said, residents note that winters can be long and dark, which can be a challenge â but that the summer's midnight Sun more than makes up for it. Poteet notes that on particularly sunny days, employers will often offer a ""Sun holiday"" so people can enjoy a day of hiking or skiing, depending on the season.
The country's strong social safety net also lends residents a sense of stability and ease. ""During Covid, I lost my job. I was able to go on unemployment until I found a new job,"" says Brenna Elizabeth Scheving, another US expat living in Iceland. She also was able to take advantage of the country's generous parental leave policy, where both parents are entitled to share 12 months parental leave, up to six months each, with six weeks transferrable to the other parent. The policy applies to both adoptive and biological parents, regardless of marital status or sexuality.
Kindergarten is also available to children as young as two, which enables parents to work and generate income, knowing that childcare and education are provided for.
In fact, equitable gender policies have been built into the country's DNA for decades, with the world's smallest gender gap for 15 years running, according to the 2024 World Economic Forum. This no doubt leads to a sense of happiness as well, say residents.
""The government is run by women,"" says GunnsteinsdÃ³ttir, noting that Iceland had the world's first democratically elected female president in 1980. ""I was six years old when she was elected a president, and I didn't necessarily conceive of a man being a president.""
Those gender equality gains were hard fought. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Women's Day Off, when Icelandic women went on strike for a day to underscore the lack of equal representation in politics and the labour force. ""I'm truly grateful to these women and the men who supported them,"" says GunnsteinsdÃ³ttir. ""Where you have gender equality, the social, economic and political aspects tend to be more stable and better for people and the natural surroundings. In countries with greater gender equality, people are healthier, happier and have better wellbeing.""
That's not to say Iceland hasn't had its own share of growing pains in recent years. Costs, particularly in the capital city of ReykjavÃ­k, have grown particularly high. ""The cost of living is steep, especially housing, which can be a struggle for both locals and expats,"" said Kevin Mercier, a French photographer who has lived in Iceland the past six years and chronicles his travels at Kevmrc Travel.
The high cost of short-term rentals has been partially blamed for this rise in housing expense, and tourism in general has put some pressures on the small island. The nation has been transformed by tourism over the past decade, welcoming around 2.3 million international visitors in 2024 â nearly double the 2015 numbers) and around six times the number of residents. That said, the benefits of tourism have outweighed the costs, say many residents, and as visitor numbers continue to grow, the country is adopting new initiatives to manage the impact and protect its natural resources.
""The movement around making tourism more responsible has been very grassroots and run byÂ Iceland Tourism in collaboration with local and central authorities and private companies,"" says GunnsteinsdÃ³ttir.
Iceland's infrastructure has also seen a boost from tourism. ""Finishing The Ring Road [the looped highway around Iceland that was fully paved in 2019] was great for everyone, making sometimes isolated communities now easily accessible,"" said Poteet. ""Also, the amount of tourists to the Fagradalsfjall volcano meant the government built trails in the area almost immediately. So impressive!""
Accommodations are pushing to educate visitors about sustainability and the Icelandic way of life. Family-owned property Hotel Ranga on the south coast offers a ""Live Like an Icelander"" programme, where a local guide takes guests through ancient farmsteads and lets them drink from a well that is said to promote longevity. ION Hotels, owned by female entrepreneur Sigurlaug SverrisdÃ³ttir, has committed to having a female-majority staff across its two properties, ION City Hotel in ReykjavÃ­k and the ION Adventure Hotel on Lake Thingvellir, the largest lake in Iceland.

â¢ What makes Vanuatu one of the happiest places in the world?
The number of restaurants, bars and cafes has also grown to meet tourist demand, leading to more vibrant urban centres. ""When I was growing up, you would walk the streets in ReykjavÃ­k and there was hardly anyone walking around in most of the year,"" said GunnsteinsdÃ³ttir. ""I personally quite like having people around.""
Regardless of the external factors, it may be an internal sense of adaptability and resilience that leads to Icelanders' ultimate happiness. GunnsteinsdÃ³ttir points to the ancient Icelandic word for intuition, innsÃ¦i, which translates to the ""the sea within"".
""It's the world beyond words â of vision, feelings, imagination and things that brew before they come to the surface of our attention,"" she explains. ""It also means 'to see from the inside out', which refers to having a strong inner compass that enables us to navigate the ocean of life and the world we live in.""
GunnsteinsdÃ³ttir theorises that this sense of direction comes directly from living alongside an often-unpredictable natural environment and fast-changing weather conditions. ""In recent years, we've had multiple eruptions and earthquakes. When you constantly feel the earth is shaking, it really reminds you that things can change quite rapidly,"" she says. ""When it comes to happiness, it encourages us to make the best out of what we have when things don't go according to plan.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250410-britains-tastiest-town-where-michelin-chefs-and-gingerbread-queens-reign,Britain's new foodie town with six Michelin stars,"Home to three Michelin-starred restaurants and a royal gingerbread legacy, the unassuming Lancashire town of Ormskirk is fast becoming the UK's most delicious destination.
When it comes to UK destinations for a gourmet weekend away, there's a new name on the lips of serious foodies. Forget the metropolitan streets of Chelsea, Mayfair or even Edinburgh. Britain's latest gastronomic hotspot is in the rural hinterlands of deepest Lancashire.
Holidaymakers journeying to this historic county in north-west England â a key location in the English and Industrial revolutions â would have traditionally been heading for Blackpool, the classic British seaside resort whose best-known epicurean delight is Blackpool Rock, a tooth-shatteringly tough cylindrical stick of boiled sugar and glucose syrup.
But, for those with more refined palates â or more delicate dental work â the tastiest rewards are to be found in Ormskirk, a bustling market town that was once a Viking settlement, and in Aughton, the small village next door.
It's in this small village where Mark Birchall serves as chef patron of Moor Hall, a produce-driven restaurant within the grounds of a Grade II-listed, 16th-Century manor house. And at this year's Michelin awards, he was the only chef in Britain and Ireland to have been awarded a third Michelin star. As such, he has become one of only 10 chefs in the country (and fewer than 150 in the entire world) to hold the three-star accolade, a designation signalling that, according to the tyre company's inspectors, a restaurant is worth making a dedicated journey for.
No stranger to recognition, Moor Hall was voted Best Restaurant in England in the 2023 National Restaurant Awards, and also possesses a green Michelin star for the sustainable cooking practices used to create its 18-course tasting menu. Additionally, Birchall's ""neighbourhood restaurant"", The Barn (offering more casual dining at a lower price point), is a mere 30 second stroll around the lake from Moor Hall and possesses a Michelin star of its very own too.
As if that weren't enough, less than 10 minutes' walk away is Chef Tim Allen's restaurant sÅ-lÅ which has a Michelin star as well, bringing the total to a rather stellar six in the space of less than half a mile.
So what makes the food so special in this part of Lancashire, I ask Birchall as he forages for micro herbs and other ingredients on Moor Hall's six-acre country estate, dotted with secluded luxury garden rooms where diners can stay.
""Aughton and Ormskirk have a deep-rooted connection to the land, and that plays a massive part in why the food here is so special,"" he tells me. ""The landscape, the soil, the weather â it all contributes to the quality of the produce. We're lucky to have incredibly fertile, well-draining soil, which means the fruit and vegetables â particularly leafy greens, brassicas and root veg â even the grass that feeds the livestock, are all packed with flavour.""
Indeed, the West Lancashire coastal plain between Preston and Southport is often referred to as ""the salad bowl of England"". According to the National Farmers Union, England's north-west region accounts for 15% of the country's food production, leading them to call it ""Britain's farming powerhouse"".
""The climate, too, plays its role,"" Birchall continues. ""We get just the right balance â enough rain to keep things abundant, but not so much that it drowns the land. That allows for a longer growing season, and when you combine that with generations of skilled farmers who understand how to work with the land, you get outstanding ingredients. It's that connection between produce and place that really sets the region apart.""
Allen agrees with Birchall, with whom he consulted before opening sÅ-lÅ. He has seen an influx of foodies not just from London (which is a little more than two hours away by train) but from right across the globe. ""We get people coming from America, Mexico, Norway, Finland, even Singapore,"" Allen tells me.
""But also, because we're located midway between Liverpool and Manchester â whose football teams (Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United) are massive â you get a lot of people travelling for the football. And many of them, it turns out, quite like eating Michelin-starred food.""
Perhaps unsurprisingly, these discerning fans eschew the plastic platefuls of pie and chips usually consumed on the terraces to partake of Allen's altogether more elevated offerings; dishes made with ingredients such as Louet Fessier oyster emulsion, Oscietra caviar and salt-baked celeriac (which he employs somebody to grow purely for sÅ-lÅ's seven-course tasting menu).
But this part of Lancashire offers more than the ultra-modern cordon bleu cuisine of Moor Hall and sÅ-lÅ; travellers in search of the area's deepest culinary roots may find them at the famous Omskirk Market. Held on Thursdays and Saturdays, it is one of the country's oldest (King Edward I granted it a Royal Charter in 1286) and is where you can sample the town's original claim to culinary fame: gingerbread.
As far back as 1732, recipes for the spicy baked treat were being passed down through generations of Ormskirkers. Sellers â almost exclusively women identified by their white shawls and aprons â would tout fresh gingerbread to passengers on the stagecoaches that stopped at the inns along Aughton Street on their way from Liverpool to Preston. When Ormskirk railway station opened in 1849, the women switched to targeting train passengers.
More like this:

""They would make their way along the platform, loudly knocking on all the carriage windows crying out 'Gingerbread! Who will buy my freshly baked gingerbread?',"" explains Kathryn MacDonald of the Ormskirk and District Family History Society. ""There were so many of them and they were such persuasive sellers that Ormskirk's gingerbread women became well known around the region. So when, in 1885, the Prince of Wales alighted here â he was going to a shooting party at nearby Lathom House â there was a welcome reception put on for him at the station and three of the gingerbread women were allowed to present the Prince with a gift of Ormskirk gingerbread. A few years later, when he became king (Edward VII), he'd stop the royal train at Ormskirk on his way up to Balmoral, and stock up with supplies for himself and the royal family. So, he obviously must have really liked our gingerbread!""
The white-aproned women no longer ply their wares at the station, but one baker of Ormskirk gingerbread can still be found today in the town. Mr Thompson's Bakery is a family business run by Neil Thompson, his wife Janet and daughter Lilli who bake the treats in a converted shed in their back garden.
""Back in 2010, we revived an ancient Ormskirk gingerbread recipe but made some tweaks, such as using less salt, to suit modern tastes,"" says Lilli, who mans their stall each week at Ormskirk's famous food market.
The Thompsons' bakery, which has appeared in an episode of BBC TV's The Hairy Bikers Go West, is also carrying on the town's tradition of reeling in royalty with its legendary gingerbread. Janet reveals how she and Lilli were given the honour, when Princess Anne visited Ormskirk in 2022 to open a new facility at Edge Hill University, of including some of their gingerbread in a welcome hamper.
""Has she come back since to stock up with supplies, like her great-grandfather Edward VII did?"" I ask.
""Not as far I know,"" she laughs, ""but I'd like to think there's a secret stash of Ormskirk gingerbread somewhere in one of the larders of Buckingham Palace!""
Each year the town hosts Ormskirk Gingerbread Festival which, this year, is scheduled to take place on 13 July. The family-friendly event allows locals and visitors to learn more about the town's culinary heritage, and some women dress up in white shawls and aprons to honour Ormskirk's most famous gingerbread hawkers.
It's also an opportunity to celebrate this unassuming pocket of Lancashire that has quietly become a food lover's destination in its own right â no small achievement in a country where most culinary trends tend to point south. Whether you come for the royal gingerbread, the six Michelin stars or the rich farming roots that nourish it all, Ormskirk delivers the goodsâ¦ and theyâre anything but half-baked.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250409-which-version-of-the-us-will-visitors-find,Which version of the US will visitors find?,"Recent changes by the Trump administration are affecting how US museums and institutions tell the nation's multicultural history to travellers.
In the last few months, US President Donald Trump has threatened to annex Canada; warned that the US will ""go as far as we have to go"" to seize Greenland; and imposed tariffs on all nations, effectively initiating a global trade war. But while many of Trump's most dramatic ""America first"" actions are aimed at other countries, his sweeping new policy changes are also affecting how the US tells its own multicultural story.
Several highly touristed landmarks in the US are already facing significant changes.
On 27 March, Trump signed an executive order titled Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History, arguing that there has been ""a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation's history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth"". The order took specific aim at the Smithsonian Institution, whose 21 museums, 21 libraries and many other research and cultural centres comprise the world's largest museum complex and were visited by nearly 17 million people in 2024.
""Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement,"" the order states, ""the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of divisive, race-centred ideology.""
The order threatens to bar congressional funds from institutions that espouse ""improper, divisive or anti-American"" beliefs. As an example of this, Trump cited programming from the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History & Culture, the only national museum devoted exclusively to documenting African American life, history and culture from slavery to the modern era.
Headquartered on the National Mall in Washington DC, some of the Smithsonian's many museums focus on marginalised communities in the US â including the National Museum of the American Indian,the National Museum of African Art, the National Museum of the American Latino and the embattled National Museum of African American History and Culture.
Many activists and historians have expressed outrage over the order's broader meaning and argued that it is actually a brazen attempt to do what Trump is denouncing: rewrite US history. This begs the question, which version of the US will visitors find?
""It seems like we're headed in the direction where there's even an attempt to deny that the institution of slavery even existed, or that Jim Crow laws and segregation and racial violence against Black communities, Black families, Black individuals even occurred,"" said Dr Clarissa Myrick-Harris White, a historian and Africana studies professor at the historically Black Morehouse College in a statement to the Associated Press.
This concern was echoed by the American Historical Association, whose 10,000 members represent the world's largest organisation of professional historians. In a statement co-signed by 31 organisations, the association says the executive order ""egregiously misrepresents the work of the Smithsonian Institution"", which was established by Congress more than 175 years ago for the ""increase and diffusion of knowledge"".
""The stories that have shaped our past include not only elements that make us proud but also aspects that make us acutely aware of tragedies in our nation's history,"" the statement notes. ""No person, no nation, is perfect, and we should all â as individuals and as nations â learn from our imperfections.""
Some feel Trump's targeting of the Smithsonian is part of a broader culture war he has been waging against ""woke ideology"" across many of the nation's federally run institutions. Since returning to office, Trump has worked to dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, which oversaw grant funding for numerous Native American, Native Hawaiian, Latinx and African American museums across the country; and Trump's agencies have reportedly issued a list of words to limit or disappear from government websites, like ""women"", ""Black"" and ""cultural heritage"".
Some of these references have already been removed from websites or displays of traveller-friendly landmarks. In February, Stonewall National Monument in New York City, which is run by the US National Park Service, erased references to transgender people. In March, Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia â which is managed by the US Department of the Army â scrubbed its website of any information highlighting the contributions of African American, Hispanic or female servicemembers, including removing stories about veteran and civil rights leader Medgar Evers and the Tuskegee Airmen, the US's first Black Airforce pilots. In nearby Washington DC, a two-block section of 16th Street leading to the White House with the words ""Black Lives Matter"" was recently repaved in response to threats to cut transportation funding if the plaza was not renamed.
""If you take a broad brush and say we've spent too much time talking about folks other than old white [men], then you have wiped out a lot of what actually makes America great,"" said Greg Werkheiser, founding partner of Cultural Heritage Partners, a law firm that specialises in protecting cultural heritage sites. ""A lot of places around the world have had similar challenges and have not overcome them. We have. And those lessons are not lessons of self-loathing and tragedy, they're lessons about how we keep pushing towards a more perfect union.""
Since the Black Lives Matter protests five years ago, many museums and other cultural institutions have sought to include more diverse perspectives in their exhibitions, a move that often boosted their visitor numbers. But as Werkheiser explained, the Trump administration's unprecedented exertion of influence on cultural institutions is especially problematic for those that specialise in telling stories from Black, Asian, Latinx and LGBTQ+ perspectives, since many of these places rely on federal funding to keep them afloat.
""That baseline of commitment [from the government] is essential to ensure that the ebbs and flows of private donors don't take out institutions. When we take that away, we make these institutions very unstable.""
Visitors to the US may now find that even larger museums and organisations have been forced to make sweeping changes to their programming in light of the new policies. The DC-based Art Museum of the Americas cancelled two planned exhibitions highlighting the work of Black and LGBTQ+ artists in March, reportedly in response to the administration's new diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. Meanwhile, the United States Marine Band, the country's oldest continually active musical association, recently cancelled a concert that was supposed to feature young musicians of colour. Perhaps most famously, in February Trump seized control of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, one of the US's premier arts institutions. Since Trump's takeover, a host of acts have cancelled their planned appearances in protest.
""If it didn't matter, they wouldn't try to stop us,"" said Ashley Rogers, executive director of the Whitney Plantation, the only plantation museum in Louisiana focussing exclusively on the experience of the people who were forcibly enslaved there. ""These stories that we've been telling, they explain us to ourselves. You cannot understand the United States today without understanding our history with regard to race, slavery, relationships with Indigenous people and the genocides â all of these things that are 'bad'. We have to understand them, because they explain who we are today.""
The Whitney and other nearby locations, including a centuries-old sugar-cane plantation that once housed Africans and Creole people recently lost a bid to be designated as a National Historic Landmark District, a process that had been in the works for several years. The designation would have protected the Whitney and other historical sites from outside development, a necessary move as many in the local area had long wanted to clear the path for more industrial development, according to Rogers. She added that local government officials requested to have the application pulled from consideration once the Trump administration got in office.
Both Rogers and Werkheiser expressed concern that the budget cuts Trump is imposing on cultural institutions might have long-term repercussions. They stressed that even if funding cuts and DEI restrictions are ultimately overturned in court, they may still trigger a long-lasting drop in the financial stability of smaller institutions â especially those that seek to tell stories from diverse perspectives, which may not attract as many visitors as larger, more ""mainstream"" museums. Historians, scholars, artists and others employed by cultural institutions who carry this specialised knowledge are also at risk.
""These artefacts and the sites that represent our shared history, are vulnerable to destruction and to permanent loss, but I'm also worried that the people who preserve those histories are also irreplaceable,"" said Werkheiser. ""I'm very concerned about the scholars and government employees who have devoted their careers to preserving our country's cultural heritage. Many have lost their jobs or worried that they might soon be out of work, and we know that their knowledge and expertise are vital.""

Rogers and Werkheiser stressed the importance of institutions and individuals pushing back against these policies as much as possible. They also highlighted the role of visitors in helping to support cultural institutions that tell stories from diverse perspectives, particularly in difficult times.
""What's happening at [the] Whitney, the way that this administration's policies are affecting us, that is happening in everyone's local community,"" said Rogers. ""There is going to be a local museum, a local library [near you] who is really struggling, and they need our support more than ever right now.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250407-where-to-savour-romes-hidden-jewish-food,A chef's guide to Romeâs best Jewish food,"Chef Ruben BondÃ¬ knows that Rome's Jewish restaurants serve some of the best food in the city. Here are his picks in the historic Jewish quarter.
In 2025, millions of pilgrims and tourists are flocking to Rome and the Vatican City, the historic seat of the Catholic Church, in honour of the Jubilee year. But less than a mile from St Peter's Basilica, Europe's oldest Jewish community is thriving â and continuing a rich culinary tradition dating back to when Jews first settled in Rome in the 2nd Century BCE.
For Ruben BondÃ¬, an influencer chef and member of the city's Jewish community, the tradizione giudaico-romanesca (Judaeo-Roman tradition) is not just a subset of Roman cuisine; it's one of its cornerstones.
""Jewish cuisine is the true Roman cuisine,"" says BondÃ¬, famed for filming his cooking videos on his balcony in Rome's Monteverde neighbourhood. ""Our food is very poor and simple. But it's incredibly flavourful.""
Developed over the centuries and influenced by waves of Sephardic migration when Jews were exiled from Spain and Portugal over the 15th and 16th Centuries, Roman Jewish dishes are often fried and typically feature almonds, artichokes, sour cherries, cod and preserved fish. Among these are some of the Eternal City's most beloved recipes â expressly kosher yet iconic throughout largely Catholic Italy â from carciofi alla giudia (fried artichokes) to stracotto (braised pot roast). Today, they can be savoured in the string of Roman Jewish restaurants clustered near the southern banks of the Tiber River, in what was once the city's Jewish ghetto.
""Every family has their own recipe, their own way of making a dish,"" BondÃ¬ says. ""Food is a strong presence in my home. Every Friday, before Shabbat, my grandmother would prepare the same thing â typical [Jewish] dishes like concia di zucchine [marinated fried courgettes] and abbacchio [roasted lamb] with potatoes.""
But behind the delicious recipes and family traditions is a tragic history. As a target of persecution throughout history â from 1st Century CE purges by Roman emperors Tiberius and Claudius to almost three centuries of ghetto confinement under Papal rule from 1555 to 1815 â Roman Jewish identity was forged in response to oppression, and its food is no exception.
""In the ghetto, Jews were forbidden from trading, and this influenced many of our dishes,"" BondÃ¬ says. ""Like how ricotta cheese is hidden in our tarts [so] the Pope's Guards wouldn't notice. Or our famous fish soup [brodo di pesce] made of sardines, was because we weren't allowed to buy prized fish, only anchovies and sardines.""
Today, Rome's former ghetto â sandwiched between heavily touristed landmarks like the Roman Forum and Campo de' Fiori marketplace â is a picturesque, lively Jewish quarter of meandering cobblestone alleyways, bakeries and restaurants, but it still emanates the joy and pain of its roots.
Here are BondÃ¬'s top ways to savour Rome's hidden Jewish soul.
Located at the Jewish quarter's heart, near the Tempio Maggiore synagogue and Porticus Octaviae â the 1st-Century BCE ruins of an ancient Roman portico that eventually became a fish market, and the neighbourhood's symbol â Ba'Ghetto is just about as quintessentially Judaeo-Roman as it gets... with a twist.
""They do a mix of cuisines, a bit of everything,"" BondÃ¬ says. ""Jewish Roman, of course, but also Middle Eastern and Arab Israeli food.""
Among its Roman Jewish staples is carciofi alla giudia â a delicacy that balances both freshness and fried heartiness.
The restaurant's menu features Middle Eastern and North African Mizrahi dishes, like hummus, falafel, couscous, Tunisian binik, tabbouleh, lahmacun, kebab and baklava, as well as kosher takes on pork-based Roman pasta recipes like spaghetti alla carbonara and bucatini all'amatriciana, made with dried beef.
""Their aim is to unite these [foreign] cuisines with the Jewish Roman tradition,"" BondÃ¬ says.
Ba'Ghetto, which opened in 2007 and abides by strict kosher rules, now has branches in Venice, Florence and Milan. Its main restaurant â a chic, minimalist eatery covered in Hebrew inscriptions and black-and-white pictures â does not serve any milk-based products, preparing its desserts with vegan alternatives. For dairy delicacies and desserts, you can try the nearby Ba'Ghetto Milky.

Roman food is simple and unfussy by nature and its Jewish variant is no exception; often best savoured on the go.
So when local institution Renato al Ghetto â where BondÃ¬ worked as a waiter in his younger days â realised it could replicate its success with street food, itsÂ hole-in-the-wall ""Rosetteria"" was opened, serving the best of the Roman Jewish tradition in a bun.
""Rosette are a type of Roman bap,"" BondÃ¬ says, referring to the popular rosebud-shaped bread with a distinctively crusty exterior and soft, fluffy heart; the perfect vehicle for hearty sandwich fillings. ""I'd recommend beef stracotto or Roman artichokes.""
Among the other sandwich topping options at the takeout spot, squeezed between the neighbourhood's multitude of restaurants, are the tomato-braised chicken alla cacciatora, beef jerky, lemon escalope and even a sweet soy chocolate variant, all of which come in under â¬12 (Â£10).
""It's very good,"" BondÃ¬ says. ""I advise it for anyone who wants a quick meal.""

""Meat is a strong part of our culinary tradition,"" Ruben says. ""And for meat lovers, I recommend BellaCarne.""
Located a mere block from the ruins of the Porticus Octaviae, the restaurant's name itself is particularly promising â translating literally to ""Beautiful Meat"" â and its dishes definitely live up to expectations.
""I can especially vouch for their grilled meats,"" BondÃ¬ says, which include scottadito lamb and veal chops.


But while meat in all its forms â roast, fried, stewed and braised â is the undeniable star, it isn't the only thing worth ordering.
""They have an excellent vegan crostata [tart] for dessert,"" BondÃ¬ says, made with almond paste and sour cherries.
Roman Jewish food may be humble by nature, but BellaCarne offers a decidedly refined dining experience, set in a chic, wood-panelled interior. As with other restaurants in the area, BellaCarne has also dedicated itself to street food, and you can find take-out options and lunchboxes at their grab-and-go spot, BellaCarne Street Food.

The dishes of Roman cuisine are famous throughout Italy for being hearty and expressly casereccio â homestyle, homemade.
Casalino, whose name evokes the warmth of the Italian lunch table, promises a cosy dining experience, and its oak floorings and earthy colours create an inviting ambiance.
""It's hearty, homey Jewish Roman food,"" BondÃ¬ says.
The restaurant was opened by the Zarfati family in 2021, after the opening of their successful Dolce Kosher bakery, and follows the recipes of the household matriarch, nonna Letizia.
Among its dishes are distinctive spins on local classics, such as salt-cured cod with tomatoes, pine nuts and raisins; butter and truffle tonnarelli pasta; and the must-have carciofi alla giudia. BondÃ¬ emphatically recommends Casalino's roasts, but notes that the Zarfati family tightly guards the recipe.
""It's a secret,"" he says.

While most of the quarter's restaurants follow kosher food rules (including forbidding pork and the preparation of meat and dairy products together), Il Giardino Romano has adapted the Roman Jewish culinary tradition for a secular palate.
""It's the only Roman Jewish restaurant that isn't kosher,"" BondÃ¬ says.
As its name suggests, Il Giardino Romano (""The Roman Garden"") has a green thumb â its menu focuses heavily on vegetables, from chicory and courgettes to artichokes, which BondÃ¬ calls the restaurant's speciality.
The mighty artichoke is a recurring character in many of the restaurant's takes on traditional Italian and Roman Jewish dishes that don't typically warrant its use â from fettuccine alle vongole (pasta with clams) to cacio e pepe to even more idiosyncratic pairings.
""[Il Giardino Romano] has a particularly unique dessert,"" BondÃ¬ says. ""A ricotta crostata with artichoke.""
And if the menu does not succeed in evoking the bucolic delights of the Roman orchard, its setting certainly will â the restaurant has a small brick courtyard covered in trees and hanging ivy.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250407-best-european-vacation-destinations,Europe's most exciting getaways for 2025 travel,"From romantic retreats in the Mediterranean to fresh-air-filled Alpine hikes, these are the most exciting areas of Europe to visit this year.
While much of Europe is ripe with history, culture, cuisine and breathtaking landscapes, some spots are particularly primed to welcome visitors right now.
This is not your typical all-time European getaway list; you won't find Rome or London here. Paris made the cut because of its post-Olympics peacefulness (plus the reopening of Notre Dame, an icon that has finally found its voice). Instead of a lifetime bucket list, we've curated 2025-specific picks that will make this year's holidays particularly memorable. Many of these are unsung destinations free from the overcrowding that's caused tourism upheaval â and rows with locals â in highly touristed European cities for the last several years.
These are on-the-rise areas of Europe where you can experience iconic cultural sites, spectacular hotels and outdoor adventures. From spending days on the sun-soaked Mediterranean coast to climbing the highest Alpine peaks, here are nine exciting European destinations to visit in 2025.
Puglia saw a 20% jump in international arrivals in 2024 with more than 15 million overnight stays â still a fraction of Rome's 51 million. With two international airports (Bari and Brindisi) and rising interest, now is the time to visit before word gets out much further.
""The heel of Italy's boot offers incredible value compared to the Amalfi Coast with authentic masserieÂ (farmhouse hotels) being converted into luxury properties,"" says California-based travel advisor and photographer Coco Tran, who has been researching and photographing Italy for years. ""The region's celebration of slow food, incredible coastline and Unesco sites like Alberobello make it exceptional,"" she adds. In 2025, travellers can also experience the Jubilee Puglia, a Catholic event that only takes place every 25 years, aligning with larger events in Rome.
Tran recommends booking a table at cliff-side Osteria Sant'Anna in Polignano a Mare where the morning's catch is served fresh. On warm days, take a dip at Grotta della Poesia (Poetry Cave), a picture-perfect natural swimming hole; or saunter through Lecce's Baroque-filled streets. And while it's a new year, some old favourites remain the same. Tran says Masseria Torre Coccaro remains the spot to stay, with white-washed rooms surrounded by ancient olive groves â plus villas with private plunge pools so you can soak it all in without another guest in sight.
Best time to visit: Puglia's shoulder seasons, in late spring (May-June) and early autumn (September-October), offer ideal weather and fewer crowds.
Portugal continues to attract global attention, but there's far more to this Iberian nation than Porto and Lisbon. One region finally stepping into the spotlight is the Alentejo coast, which experienced its best tourism year on record in 2024.
""Portugal's Alentejo coast is finally getting deserved attention, with its pristine beaches and fantastic wineries,"" says Tran. While many travellers tack the region onto a trip to Lisbon or the Algarve, this breathtaking section of coast is worth a dedicated journey â especially for those seeking nature, history and adventure.
The area's ""mix of coastal beauty, incredible cycling routes and overall affordability compared to many other places in Europe"" make it an ideal getaway for thrill-seekers, says Maria Elena Price ofÂ ExperiencePlus! Bicycle Tours, which hosts tours around the world, including the Alentejo Coast.
Ãvora, a Unesco-listed city with Roman ruins and medieval architecture, is ideal for history buffs; while Zambujeira do Mar offers one of the nation's most beautiful beaches. Throughout June, travellers can also take part in the famedÂ Festas dos Santos PopularesÂ (Popular Saints' Festivals), a nationwide celebration of Portugal's patron saints. Base yourself atÂ Craveiral, a boutique stay where more than 70% of the restaurant's ingredients come from its on-site farm â including the toppings on its wood-fired pizzas.
Best time to visit:Â Summer is a blast in the Alentejo, with busy beaches and hiking through theÂ Fisherman's Trail. If you prefer thinner crowds, you'll still find spectacular weather in the autumn, between September and November.
About five million people visit Chamonix a year, while a million others visit Verbier â both rightly famous for their epic snowfalls and fantastic on- and off-piste terrain. However, it's high time global travellers explored the less-touristed European peaks â specifically, Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis, three interconnected resorts that together offer 180km of skiable terrain. And while the skiing is already supreme, Mike Goar, who is the COO of mountain operations in Switzerland for Vail Resorts, says 2025 will see the investment of 110m Swiss francs (Â£89.5m) into mountain improvements such as snowmaking, meaning it's only going to get better.
However, this destination is not just for winter. In any season, you can ride the Glacier Express train through the Alpine region, take a day hike to the glacial Lago di Tom or visit the nearby Uri Alps for a multi-day cycling trip. This region offers that small Alpine village feel â including a seemingly endless supply of fondue â and fewer crowds than its better-known Swiss counterparts. Stay at the luxurious Chedi Andermatt, which offers easy access to the slopes; and look out for the Post Hotel & residences by Elie Saab, a fashion-forward hotel expected to open next ski season.
Best time to visit: Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis is a true all-season destination. You can ski from December through April, hike and bike from June through September and enjoy spring flowers and autumn foliage in between.
Cap d'Antibes is having a cultural moment in 2025, making this glamourous corner of the French Riviera worth another look. This year marks the 100th anniversary of F Scott Fitzgerald's arrival on the CÃ´ted'Azur â an event that helped shape the Riviera's Jazz Age legacy â and the literary milestone is drawing renewed attention to the region's artistic significance.
The iconic Belles Rives hotel â Fitzgerald's home for part of the 1920s â is embracing its storied past with a series of celebratory events. ""The centennial anniversary of Fitzgerald's arrival makes this legendary hotel more relevant than ever,"" says Andria Mitsakos, founder of AMPR, which represents the property.
Beyond the hotel, Cap d'Antibes hosts the Juan-les-Pins International Jazz Festival in July, when Bastille Day celebrations bring fireworks and festivities to the beaches. Later in the year, visitors can attend the Festival International d'Art SacrÃ©, one of the region's oldest music festivals. Bonus: you'll be right in the heart of everything the French Riviera has to offer, from golden beaches and dramatic cliffs to cultural sites such as the Picasso Museum and the Chapelle Matisse.
Best time to visit: The summer sun beckons A-listers, making it a great time to come for a bit of celebrity-spotting and warm waters for dipping. For cooler temps and fewer crowds, stick to April-June and September-October.
While Italy continues to grapple with overtourism, nearby Slovenia is quietly emerging as a smart alternative, offering spectacular scenery, cultural depth and fewer crowds. With Nova Gorica named a European Capital of Culture for 2025, the timing couldn't be better to explore this captivating nation.
At just under 20,720sq km, Slovenia is a ""small but mighty country"", says James Montie, branch manager at Fox World Travel, who's seen growing demand from clients looking for off-the-beaten-path destinations. Slovenia's breathtaking landscapes, ""from Lake Bled's fairytale setting to the underground wonders of Postojna Cave"", are a primary draw, he adds.

Independent travel advisor Kimberly Denison agrees that Slovenia is poised for a tourism boom and that now is the time to pre-empt the crowds ""Slovenia is a leader in wellness and sustainability, with green-certified cities, boutique eco-lodges and luxurious wellness retreats,"" she says. It also has bonafide stats to back up its green messaging, including that 60% of the country's surface area is forest and it was certified as the world's first green destination in 2016.
To explore its glorious landscapes, hike Triglav National Park, home to Slovenia's highest peak, before overnighting at Vila Bled, a historic lakeside retreat that looks like it should be a summer house for royals.
Best time to visit: The warmer months between May through September offer the greatest opportunities to enjoy outdoor adventures.
The Greek Islands are a perennial favourite, but in 2025, it's the mainland that's set to shine â specifically the outstretched fingers of the Peloponnese. Greece is investing heavily in the region this year, upgrading infrastructure like the Mycenae road network and directing funding towards sustainable agritourism and local olive producers. The result for travellers is easier access, deeper cultural connection and fewer crowds.
Of the Peloponnese's three peninsulas, Mani â the rugged middle finger â stands out. ""Far from the Cycladic island buzz, Mani is Greece's best-kept secret,"" says Mitsakos, who lives in Greece and represents a boutique hotel in Mani. ""This rugged, sun-scorched region is a treasure find for travellers seeking authenticity, serenity and deep cultural resonance."" Expect cobblestoned villages, pristine beaches and hidden coves, along with ""a deep-rooted history"", she adds. Stay at Pirgos Mavromichali, a restored 18th-Century towerÂ turned boutique hotel where whitewashed rooms overlook the bay's turquoise waters.
Elsewhere in the region, travellers can visit Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics; or relax on Voidokilia Beach on the west coast. Mitsakos also recommends traditional villages like Milea, Rigklia and Exoxhori for their vibrant folk feasts that are reviving local traditions.
Best time to visit: Greece is packed in the summer, but thanks to the mainland's slightly warmer temperatures, you can get away with a warm-weather break with fewer crowds from April to June and September to October.
Paris had quite the 2024 hosting the Summer Olympics, which means the crowds have thinned and prices dipped back down for 2025. Plus, travel here is now easier than ever; since 1 January 2025, the Paris metro system no longer relies on a complicated zone system with extra fares for the banlieues (suburbs). Today, you can use a single ticket to travel the entire network for up to two hours.
What parts of this renowned city should you prioritise? Paul Holinaty, who specialises in Central and Northern European travel at Goway, says you should hit up the neighbourhoods on the Left Bank of the Seine in particular. ""Saint Germain des Pres and Luxembourg gardens are close enough to the main sites,"" he explains, ""but nicely tucked away, where you can still find really authentic bakeries, local shops and amazing cafe culture â there's a lot of locals buzzing around the area too."" The Rive Gauche is also home to plenty of book shops, theatres and elegant boutiques, making the whole area something out of a romantic film. Travellers can also rediscover an old favourite, thanks to Notre Dame reopening its doors at the end of 2024. As for where to stay, the classic HÃ´tel du Savoir, formerly called the HÃ´tel Petit Belloy, just reopened post-reno (done by Laune Architecture) in Saint-Germain-des-PrÃ©s and is, let's just say, trÃ©s chic.
Best time to visit: Paris is a feast for the senses in all seasons. That said, it's particularly lovely in spring, from April to June, with flowers blooming and longer, sunnier days.
Tourism to Sweden has surged in recent years, driven in part by the rise of the ""coolcation"" trend where travellers seek out more temperate destinations for their summer getaways. With pristine landscapes, clean air and progressive values, the Nordic nation fits the brief perfectly. Even in the height of summer, temperatures rarely break 20C, making it a compelling alternative to the heat of southern Europe.
While many first-timers gravitate to Stockholm, the west coast remains a wilder, more rugged alternative; think granite islands, salty air and seafood straight off the boat. The long summer days and crisp nights create ideal conditions for kayaking, hiking or just soaking up the Nordic light â minus the crowds and queues of the capital.
It's also a fantastic place for sustainability-minded travellers, with Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city, recently awarded the EU's Mission Label for its ambitious plans to become climate-neutral by 2030. Check in at Hotel Pigalle, a boutique hotel with vintage flair and eco-conscious touches, including bio-cleaning products and locally sourced ingredients. If you're seeking more solitude than the city can offer, the BohuslÃ¤n archipelago beckons with low-impact adventures, island-hopping and some of the best shellfish you'll ever taste.
Best time to visit: June-August brings long daylight hours, with sunsets at 22:00 and the best weather for coastal adventures.
Albania has long been one of Europe's most underrated destinations, but that's changing fast. Thanks to relaxed visa requirements and expanded international flight routes, the country is quickly rising on the travel radar. In 2024, Albania welcomed a record 11.7 million international visitors, a surge driven in part by the global rise in interest in lesser-known Mediterranean escapes â which means that now is prime time to see this beautiful country before it books up.
""Albania is quickly gaining recognition for its mix of history, unspoiled coastline and emerging food and wine scene,"" says Denison. ""The Unesco-listed town of GjirokastÃ«r, the pristine beaches of the Albanian Riviera and the vineyards of Berat create a Mediterranean escape that is still under the radar but rapidly gaining momentum.""
New infrastructure projects are smoothing the journey (fewer potholes are always a plus). Albania is also investing in luxury accommodations, including the Green Coast Hotel near the Unesco World Heritage site of Butrint, which is set to provide unparalleled luxury nestled among the sea caves. ""Albania is poised to become a major player in luxury travel,"" Denison adds.
While hotpots like Ksamil are growing in popularity, travellers who venture just a little beyond the crowds are rewarded with clear turquoise waters that rival the Greek Islands. Inland, the Accursed Mountains' dramatic landscapes draw hikers and adventure seekers to the country's rugged north. Stylish coastal stays like La Brisa Boutique Hotel in Dhermi place you just steps from the sand; while major developments like the new Marriott in the Vlora Marina (expected to open in 2028) signal that this Mediterranean up-and-comer won't stay quiet for long.
Best time to visit: The summer months are prime time in Albania â and not yet experiencing the crowds of neighbours like Greece. The warm weather makes for ideal beach, hiking and exploring conditions.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20221204-the-us-2000-year-old-mystery-mounds,"The 2,000-year-old US mystery mounds","Constructed by a mysterious civilisation that left no written records, the massive site is now open to the public for the first time in more than a century.
Autumn leaves crackled under our shoes as dozens of eager tourists and I followed a guide along a grassy mound. We stopped when we reached the opening of a turf-topped circle, which was formed by another wall of mounded earth. We were at The Octagon, part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, a large network of hand-constructed hills spread throughout central and southern Ohio that were built as many as 2,000 years ago. Indigenous people would come to The Octagon from hundreds of miles away, gathering regularly for shared rituals and worship.
""There was a sweat lodge or some kind of purification place there,"" said our guide, Brad Lepper, senior archaeologist for the Ohio History Connection's World Heritage Program (OHC), as he pointed to the circle. I looked inside to see a perfectly manicured lawn â a putting green. A tall flag marked a hole at its centre.
That's because from 1910 through 2024, The Octagon had been used as a golf course. But on 1 January 2025, this ancient, enigmatic site reopened to visitors for the first time in more than a century.
All these prehistoric ceremonial earthworks in Ohio were created by what is now called the Hopewell Culture, a network of Native American societies that gathered from as far away as Montana and the Gulf of Mexico between roughly 100 BCE and 500 CE and were connected by a series of trade routes. Their earthworks in Ohio consist of shapes â like circles, squares and octagons â that were often connected to each other. Archaeologists are only now beginning to understand the sophistication of these engineering marvels.
Built with astonishing mathematical precision, as well as a complex astronomical alignment, these are the largest geometrical earthworks in the world that were not built as fortifications or defensive structures. And while most people have never heard about the sites or its builders, that may be about to change.
In 2023, eight of Hopewell's earthworks were inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage site. These include The Great Circle and The Octagon in Newark, Ohio, as well Ohio's first state park, Fort Ancient (not an actual fort). The other five are part of the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park: Mound City, Hopeton Earthworks, High Bank Works, Hopewell Mound Group and Seip Earthworks.
Lepper told me The Octagon and The Great Circle were once a larger, single Hopewell complex spanning 4.5 square miles and connected by a series of roads lined by earthwork walls. Walking through both sites today, there is an immediate shock of scale. The Great Circle, where the museum for Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks is found, is 1,200ft in diameter. Its walls rise up to 14ft high and are outlined on the inside by a deep ditch. The Great Circle was once connected to a square and a burial ellipse, with only part of the square still visible today.Â The Octagon sprawls a massive 50 acres and is attached to the 20-acre Observatory Circle, a large earthwork circle for gathering and rituals connected to the observation of the night sky.
""You could put four Roman Colosseums inside just The Octagon,"" Lepper told me. ""Stonehenge would fit within just that small circle now serving as a putting green."" He added that 2,000 years ago, Indigenous workers built these earthworks without modern tools, digging up soil with pointed sticks and hauling it in wicker baskets on their backs. One estimate, he noted, is that they moved seven million cubic feet of dirt.
The achievement of the Hopewell Culture, however, is not simply in creating large, precise shapes, which they did without the vantage point of hills for an aerial view. They also embedded a sort of hidden geometry within these structures. Until the mounds were measured and compared, it was thought that the builders didn't have any mathematical and geometrical sophistication, as there are no written records to testify to their level of knowledge. It was eventually discovered, however, that they made precise measurements across their earthworks and connected them in unsuspecting ways.
Lepper explained that the circumference of The Great Circle ""is equal to the perimeter of the perfect square that it was connected to"", and that ""the area of that perfect square is equal to the area of the [Observatory Circle] that's connected to The Octagon"".
He added: ""If you draw a square inside The Octagon by drawing a line from alternate corners of The Octagon, the sides of that square [1,054ft] are equal to the diameter of the circle that it's attached to [1,054ft].""
Examples of this interplay between earthworks have been found repeatedly by archaeologists. According to Lepper, that measure of 1054ft, whether halved or doubled, is found in other Indigenous earthworks across the country, and served as a common unit of measure.
While the Hopewell Culture's geometrical and mathematical knowledge astonished scholars, another level of sophistication appears when the layers are peeled back further: astronomical alignment.

In the 1980s, two professors at Earlham College in Indiana, Ray Hively (a physicist and astronomer) and Robert Horn (a philosopher), decided to pay a visit to The Octagon and its attached Observatory Circle. As astronomical monuments like Stonehenge had received great attention, they wondered if these earthworks were also aligned to a solar calendar.
Hively and Horn found no solar connections, but they then considered an alternative purpose: the lunar cycle.
""We thought deliberate lunar alignments unlikely at Newark,"" they wrote, because while the Sun can be tracked over a year, a complete lunar cycle takes 18.6 years. Even so, the lunar cycle proved to correspond to the position of the Observatory Mound at The Observatory Circle. There, one can watch the Moon rise over the exact centre of The Octagon in the distance every 18.6 years.
""Astronomical alignments are only relevant and useful if they somehow tie the celestial orbs to belief systems and understandings of life,"" said Timothy Darvill, professor of archaeology at Bournemouth University who has researched both Stonehenge and the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks. ""The ceremonies around the observation of the skyscape could well have a secondary function in terms of fostering community.""
That ancient community and culture was part of the reason for its Unesco World Heritage Site inclusion.
A Unesco site needs to show that it has ""outstanding universal value"", said Jennifer Aultman, director of historic sites and museums at Ohio History Connection which helped lead its Unesco consideration. One criterion for this, she said, ""is that these are masterpieces of human creative genius"", which is where these mathematical, geometrical and astronomical features are important. The other, ""is that they bear really exceptional testimony to the cultural tradition that produced them"".
Aultman explained: ""You really can understand something about the lives of the people and what mattered to them by looking at, and learning about, the earthworks.""
Consider the Moon, for example, which was clearly important for the Hopewell Culture. Darvill told me that, for some cultures, the ""Sun, Moon... are considered to have power over what happens on a day-to-day basis. As such, the heavenly bodies are often deified, which is how their power is justified and rationalised."" It is therefore likely that the Moon was a deity shared by those who gathered at the mounds.
""The land we know as Ohio is home to a number of extraordinary earthworks built by Indigenous residents of this region thousands of years ago,"" said Megan Wood, executive director and CEO of the Ohio History Connection. While not all earthworks in Ohio are specifically Hopewell Mounds â such as the solar-aligned Serpent Mound Historical Site in Peebles, Ohio, for example â Wood sees them all as ""icons"" of Indigenous ""cultural achievements"".
Since the Hopewell Culture left no written records, only the earthworks and the few objects retrieved from them serve as their last cultural testimony. While archaeological excavations continue on some sites, objects like ritual smoking pipes and a small stone statue of a shaman wearing a bear skin and holding a human skull called ""the Shaman of Newark"" have been found. As these earthworks were gathering places and not villages, artefacts representing the locations from where these Indigenous peoples travelled have also been discovered, like effigy pipes, a copper head plate and an obsidian knife.
However, after the Hopewell Culture gradually began to disappear starting around 500 CE, other Indigenous peoples stepped in to become caretakers of the land. One of those groups was the Shawnee Tribe, which called Ohio home before they were forcibly removed west of the Mississippi River in the 1830s.
""We may not have been responsible for building or creating them, but I know that my ancestors lived there, and that my ancestors protected them and respected them,"" said Chief Glenna Wallace of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, who believes that other tribes should have a role in the future of protecting the Hopewell Earthworks and communicating their cultural importance.
For years, The Octagon was under the control of the Moundbuilders Country Club. After more than a decade of negotiations, the OHC and the club finally reached a deal in 2024 to transfer the site's long-term lease to the historical society, paving the way for them to open the earthworks to visitors beginning this January.
For advocates of the site's preservation, the Unesco designation and opening of these mysterious mounds to the public offers a new chapter to educate visitors about Ohio's Native American history. It also means more Indigenous stakeholders, like the Shawnee, can tell that story from an Indigenous perspective for future generations.
""I just want people to know about it,"" said Chief Wallace, ""I want people to be able to see it. I want people to be able to visit it and want people to realise that it is a cultural phenomenon. That it's priceless.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250404-a-58-tunnel-slow-train-through-indias-eastern-ghats,A 58-tunnel train through India's Eastern Ghats,"Take a four-hour slow train through the Eastern Ghats to discover how a remote hill station is changing the global coffee game.
Even in December, early mornings are rarely pleasant on much of India's Andhra Pradesh coast. The air is already muggy by 06:30 as a crowd mills restlessly on platform five at Visakhapatnam (Vizag) railway station. However, these would-be passengers are no ordinary commuters, but travellers gathered for an experience. When the Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special rolls onto the platform, the crowd's relief is palpable; the two vistadome coaches at the back of the train that they've been anxiously waiting to board are air-conditioned.
Indians have only a nodding acquaintance with the concept of queues, so a mad scramble ensues as the train comes to a halt. Things settle down as it chugs out of the station and gradually picks up speed. The Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special also serves as a regular commuter service headed to the town of Kirandul in Chhattisgarh state, about 400km to the north-west, and takes about 14 hours to traverse the distance. But those in the vistadome coaches are interested only in the first leg, to Araku Valley. This serene hill station is about 120km away but takes four hours as the train winds its way through a whopping 58 tunnels cut through the Eastern Ghats. The two vistadome coaches â with their extra-large windows and rotatable seats â are designed to provide panoramic views of the area's mountain peaks and valleys and its gentle forested slopes that end in rushing rivers and streams, gorges and rocky promontories.
As the train whizzes past Vizag's neighbourhoods and suburbs, it provides snapshots of a city waking up: a vegetable vendor hauling their cart, a dog walker pulled by his dog, two bleary-eyed uniformed children clutching onto their father on a scooter to school. As the city segues into wide open fields and farmlands, the images change: smoke curls lazily into the sky from a lone thatched house in the middle of a farm, a diligent farmer urges on his oxen, a tractor hauls vegetables to the nearby market. The rhythmic clickety-clack of the train's wheels is familiar and soporific.
Less than 30 minutes after leaving Vizag, the train slows considerably and begins ascending into the foothills of the Eastern Ghats. As if on cue, most seats in the coach swing to face the windows. The train climbs, plains fall away and even the sporadic habitations clinging to the peaks vanish. Hills and mountains in the distance appear blue-grey in the tender morning sun. But even before this panorama can register, complete darkness descends as the train enters the route's first tunnel. I'm startled by the sounds of adults and children screaming, in jest of course, for the few minutes it takes for us to come out the other side.
When we emerge into daylight, the sight is jaw-dropping: a series of hillocks and gentle valleys, thickly forested, stretch out to the horizon where a haze-shrouded mountain range is just a hint of the soaring peaks to come. As I try to take in as much of the scene as possible, darkness descends again, and with it, more screaming.
On the other side is another surreal and dramatic sight: tracks bent around a hill, a green wall sloping straight up on one side, and a sheer drop on the other. The train slowly chugs forward, hugging the inner curve. The vistadomes' rear position means that the entire length of the train is visible, curling against the hill as if teetering on the edge. It then uncoils and wraps itself on the other side, trundling on a bridge built over a stream that gently flows several metres below. The bridge has no continuous guardrails, so, for a moment, it feels like the train is suspended in the air. But soon, the feeling is interrupted by darkness and more screaming, and another breathtaking view on the other side.
This sequence repeats over and over again and yet it never gets predictable or boring. Each of the route's 58 tunnels sets up anticipation for what might lay on the other side. Thick curtains of mist clinging to mountainsides or low-hanging clouds cloaking the peaks; rolling grasslands and forests spread out like someone had shaken out a giant green blanket and laid it down; deep valleys and gorges surrounded by undulating peaks; and fleeting glimpses of hamlets and habitations perched precariously on the hillsides.
We stop every few minutes to drop and pick up commuters at musical-sounding stations that could be tongue-twisters to those unfamiliar: Pendurthi, Kottavalasa, Chimidipalli, Borraguhallu, Karakavalasa. At Shimiliguda, the station proudly wears its altitude on its sleeve: 996m above sea level. Throughout the journey, there is also a continuous parade of food vendors, delectable aromas wafting from their baskets as they sell idli-vada-chutney (a common breakfast of steamed rice cake with coconut chutney), samosa, savoury puffed rice and boiled peanuts.
When the train finally rolls into Araku town, the station is crowded and noisy and the magic of the journey dissipates somewhat. But early next morning, Araku's appeal is on full display. A short walk leads to forests and coffee plantations speckled with tall silver oak trees, their trunks wrapped by pepper vines. Everything is covered in thick fog and the air is nippy, a far cry from Vizag's mugginess. The air is sappy and thick with terpenes. I catch faint whiffs of coffee and pepper.
Coffee came to Araku with the British and was grown in scattered patches of plantations. Like other coffee-growing regions in India, Araku was an ideal location owing to its combination of soil, altitude and weather. After independence from British rule in 1947, the land passed into local government hands, but decades of underdevelopment and sporadic insurgency kept the region off most investment maps. That began to change in the early 2000s.
""The local community wanted progress,"" says Manoj Kumar, CEO of the Naandi Foundation, a non-profit that works with farmers through community initiatives and sustainable models. ""So we looked around and thought since coffee was already growing in pockets, it could be expanded.""
Working with local farmers, the organisation began establishing micro-plots of Arabica coffee using regenerative agriculture. What began at around 1,000 acres in 2002 currently stands at 100,000 acres farmed by more than 90,000 families, who each own about an acre on average. Besides coffee, farmers have been encouraged to multi-crop and now produce pepper, red kidney beans, ginger, turmeric, millets, rice, vegetables, fruits such as chikoo (sapodilla), mango, custard apple and avocado.Â The result: a unique fair-trade coffee model known as Arakunomics, which won the Rockefeller Foundation's Food System Vision 2050 Prize in 2020.
But the foundation didn't stop there. In a first for Indian coffee, they ""terroir-mapped"" the beans â borrowing a concept from winemaking âÂ and classified the end product into six distinct flavour profiles under the brand name ARAKU. Selective harvesting, sustainable practices and meticulous post-harvest processes have helped the beans consistently score 91/100 on specialty coffee rankings.

""We grow about 2,000 metric tons of coffee, 98% of which is sourced by specialty coffee promoters across the world,"" Kumar says.
Travellers can explore this story at various coffee holdings in the area, but Priya Rajagopal, a coffee enthusiast and former project manager in tech, recommends the Sunkarametta Coffee Plantation, about 13km south-east of Araku, where a wooden bridge runs for a few hundred metres through the plantation, suspended above the coffee plants and flanked by towering silver oaks. ""When I went, it was the flowering season (March to May) and the plants were full of white flowers, "" she says. ""The air is filled with a sweet, jasmine-like smell.""
A short distance away, the modest but informative Araku Coffee Museum offers a primer on the journey from seed to cup. The small adjacent cafÃ© serves a robust filter brew â earthy, rich and perfect for a chilly morning in the hills.
A few days after the train trip, back in Bengaluru, I head to the sole ARAKU cafe in India (most of their production is either exported, retailed in stores or available online), which is tucked away in the tree-lined avenues of the city's Indiranagar neighbourhood. I am torn between the various options but opt for their signature medium roast. It is beautifully rich red-brown and utterly mellow on the tongue. More importantly, a subtle peppery end note immediately transports me back to Arakuâs mist-covered winding lanes, the lush green forests and plantations â and the slow, soulful train ride that led me there.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250225-a-white-lotus-actors-guide-to-thailand,A White Lotus actor's guide to Thailand,"Bangkok-born actor Dom Hetrakul plays a hotel spa therapist in The White Lotus season three. Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.
Since its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimed film productions and influential names drawing attention to its unique culture.
Today, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, from fashion to sports to entertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's series The White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink's Lisa Manobal, Patravadi Mejudhon, Tayme Thapthimthong and actor, model and businessman Dom Hetrakul join the star-studded cast.
""The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,"" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. ""We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.""
Hetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: ""Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.""
Here are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui.
Home to the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui where much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed, Koh Samui is perhaps the ultimate White Lotus set-jetting destination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.
Most visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. ""You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,"" Hetrakul says.
While its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.
Koh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. ""In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,"" he says. ""But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.""
Address: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand
Thai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. ""Over here, we eat all day, all night â daytime, office hours â we just order food and eat all the time,"" Hetrakul says. ""Restaurants have to open all day.""
While you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likesÂ Summer by Coco Tam, The Shack and Gusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt, Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish and yum tua pu(wing bean salad). ""Everything is from the local fisherman's market,"" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui â and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. ""Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns â you name it â Jun Hom makes [it].""

Whether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in the trailer.
Hetrakul's top Thai party hotspot is Ko Pha Ngan island, about 38km from Koh Samui â eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. ""[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for the Full Moon Party,"" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.
For those wary of big crowds â the parties attract thousands of attendants â Hetrakul has an insider tip. ""Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,"" he says. ""Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.""
Address: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand
About 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies the Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.
Though camping areas and bungalows are available on Ko Wua Talap, the park's largest island,Â  Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. ""There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,"" says Hetrakul. ""[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping."" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.

Connected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommended Ta Khai restaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.
""Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach â Patong beach, the bars and clubs,"" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.
""About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest called Baan Tha Chatchai,"" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. ""Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.""
Local dishes such as mee hokkien (chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. ""They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional â truly local â food,"" Hetrakul emphasises. ""They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.""
Address: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110
Thailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titled Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.
As a sports enthusiast â he practices Muay Thai â Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. ""We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,"" he says. ""If you're a fan of UFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.""
While you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand â ""there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],"" Hetrakul says â the actor recommends stopping by the Rajadamnern Stadium in his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring â the only one of its kind in the world.
The venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.

Prominently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 on Unesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his ""signature treatment.""
The Buddhist temple Wat Pho, credited as the birthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.
As home to the Watpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. ""It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,"" says Hetrakul. ""[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250404-in-search-of-greeces-once-great-jewish-city,In search of Greece's once-great Jewish city,"Once home to a thriving Jewish majority, Thessaloniki holds fragments of a lost world. One traveller's journey to find them leads to something even more powerful: living memory.
As my family admired the gleaming remodel of Thessaloniki's century-old Modiano Market, local culinary guide Smaragda Marki admitted to me that among the trendy cafes and German delicatessen, she wished it were just a little more Greek. ""I wish it were a little more Jewish,"" I responded, staring up at the colourful Easter decorations.
The newly reopened market had topped my list of places to go in Greece's second-largest city, bringing together my two favourite things to look for while travelling: good food and tidbits of Jewish history. However, Modiano left me dissatisfied on both counts. Though the building still bears the name of its Jewish architect and stands on the site of the former Talmud Torah Synagogue, little else hinted that the nut stand used to be a kosher butcher or that Jews had any other part of its past life.
Thessaloniki was once considered an epicentre of Jewish culture, one of the only cities in Europe where Jews were the majority. Known as Salonika at the time, it was part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912. The Ottoman Empire allowed Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th Century to settle there for hundreds of years. But with Ottoman power beginning to wane in the early 20th Century, Greece took over the city in 1912. Five years later, the Great Fire of 1917 devastated huge swaths of the city and left 70,000 people homeless, including much of the Jewish population. The Talmud Torah Synagogue (and 31 others) were destroyed. The one-time centre of Jewish culture and majority Jewish city received its final blow in 1943 when Nazi forces deported 50,000 Jews to Europe's concentration camps.
Eighty years later, I struggled to find traces of the community, and even finding a Jewish guide to show me around proved difficult. It wasn't surprising; Thessaloniki's Jewish community now numbers less than 1,000 people, a small population sample within which to find a niche professional tour guide. Plenty of companies offered tours of Jewish Thessaloniki, most touting bonafides by proximity to, rather than being a part of the small congregation.
Eventually, I booked through a company based in Athens because it was run by a Greek Jew. I still didn't know if my actual guides would be Jewish, though at least I could be sure they were trusted by the community.
When Elia Matalon greeted us the next morning, I let out a sigh of relief. In the lobby of our hotel, he explained that he and his wife Hella Kounio-Matalon run their tours together and they both come from families that go back many generations in Thessaloniki's Jewish community. Later in the eight-hour tour he would tell us about how his mother survived the war by hiding in homes across the border in Albania while Kounio-Matalon spoke of her father surviving Auschwitz. We began walking toward a Holocaust memorial sculpture, through a narrow alleyway where he pointed to a restaurant owned by a gentile chef who became fascinated by the city's Jewish history and now serves traditional Sephardic Jewish foods like nogada (meatballs in walnut sauce).
Much of the city's history is Jewish history. In the Ano Ladadika neighbourhood, we stared up at the city's famous broken clock, stopped by an earthquake in 1978. The building originally belonged to a bank started by the Italian Jewish Allatini brothers, 19th-Century entrepreneurs whose flour company grew to be the largest in the Balkans before World War Two.
We walked down adjacent Siggrou Street and paused in front of a 1926 mansion. Today, it houses a hookah bar, which meant we could wander into the lovely plant-filled atrium and up the grand staircase. Outside, Matalon pointed out the holes in the doorpost where a mezuzah once hung. A visible symbol of Jewish identity, the traditional decorative case holds a prayer, fulfilling the commandment to ""write them on the doorposts of your house"".
So much of visiting Jewish history around the world is like this: evidence of where we once were. Visiting the former site of the Jewish cemetery. Peering at painted-over holes and fading stars of David. Jews left their mark on Thessaloniki, but hardly in a fashion that hints to the glorious centre of Jewish life it once was. I love to imagine what it was like to live in these rich Jewish worlds, what could be if we weren't constantly getting kicked out of places.
Across the street from Modiano Market, we entered one of the city's two remaining synagogues. Because Thessaloniki's laws granted properties owned by Jews before WW2 without surviving family members to the Jewish community, the congregation owns the building, which mostly houses offices, and the synagogue on the ground floor. Marble tablets on the wall list the more than 70 synagogues that served the city's once much-larger Jewish population. The money the rent brings in allows the synagogue to pay retirees to show up to complete their minyan (the minimum number of people needed for a prayer service), a win-win situation.
More like this:
â¢ The Mediterranean's ancient gay-friendly civilisation
â¢ The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews
â¢ The tiny, idyllic island where Greeks escape the heat
Outside the building, I learned how a bench signals that a piece of Thessaloniki's Jewish culture still lives within. The decorative wooden top looks the same as any other bench, a comforting and welcoming place to sit on busy Vasileos Irakleiou, between a synagogue and Modiano Market. Below, a sturdy cement bollard telegraphs its true purpose: these surround all the remaining Jewish sites in the city, protecting them from potential violence by vehicle.
We see them again outside the only remaining pre-WW2 synagogue, the community's other house of prayer. The Monastir Synagogue escaped destruction by invading Axis forces because the Red Cross used it during the war, a story that would be slightly more heartwarming if they hadn't nearly destroyed it themselves by using it as a storehouse and stable. It has since been returned to its stained-glass and marble-walled glory.
A large tour group from a cruise, wearing headsets to hear their guide, filed in, and I browsed the tiny museum in the foyer until they left, just a few minutes later. Then Matalon and Kounio-Matalon announced that they had a surprise for us. Together, they offered to sing a song in Ladino, the ancient version of Judeo-Spanish spoken by the region's Jews: Adio Kerido (Goodbye, Beloved), a love song repurposed as a farewell to Holocaust deportees.
By the time they stepped onto the bimah, the raised platform at the front of the sanctuary, I had already seen the history for which I came: the train car parked permanently at the station in memory of the city's Jews, who were deported in similar ones; the mansions built by the thriving majority population of the 19th Century; and the lovely, solemn Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki. But as their voices joined, reverberating in the incredible acoustics of the large room, singing ""Adio, adio, kerido"", I realised I'd found something even better: a unique Jewish culture still alive.
""No kero la vida,"" they sang hauntingly, beautifully, mournfully, ""I don't want to live."" The song offered such sorrow for the departing love, but it brought me such happiness to hear, to see this moment, the kind of moment for which people travel. A moment that could never be predicted, that could never be expected, and, more than anything, that could never happen anywhere else in the world except precisely here.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250402-the-vital-tradition-of-naming-baby-gorillas-rwanda,The vital tradition of naming baby gorillas,"Mountain gorilla conservation in Rwanda is a global success story, partly due to the significance and value placed on gorillas as part of the nation's culture and heritage, with annual celebrations of baby gorillas being born.
In a sunlit spot of mist-cloaked rainforest, a black, hairy mass of muscle descends surprisingly gracefully down a thick mossy vine. The huge silverback stretches out and settles in for a thorough grooming session from a female, totally unfazed by his human admirers. Two teenagers tumble into view, beating their chests and grimacing at each other, a tangle of limbs in mock combat, while an adorable baby gorilla peers shyly from her mother's arms at the unfolding family drama.
Seeing mountain gorillas in the wild is a magical bucket list experience, but it wasn't always this way. Poachers decimated gorilla numbers in the 1960s and 70s, leaving them at risk of extinction. Then came the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Volcanoes National Park, home to most of Rwanda's mountain gorillas, became a battlefield as the civil war raged across the country, with population numbers struggling to rise above 300.
It's hard to fathom how Rwanda has managed to tackle the challenges of its traumatic past in such a short space of time, let alone become a beacon of conservation success. Yet today, mountain gorillas are the only great ape whose numbers are not rapidly descending. WWF estimates that mountain gorilla numbers have risen 3% every year since 2010, moving them in the right direction from ""critically endangered"" to ""endangered"" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species â and this success largely comes down to Rwanda's sustained conservation efforts, which include anti-poaching patrols, community engagement and regulated gorilla tourism, all of which have helped to protect habitats and ensure that local people benefit from the survival of these great apes.
Three hundred and ninety-five baby gorillas have been born since 2005 in Rwanda, and each year since then these new arrivals have been celebrated in a uniquely Rwandan way. Kwita Izina, or ""to give a name"" in the country's national Kinyarwanda language, is Rwanda's huge annual gorilla naming ceremony that honours each gorgeous fuzzy baby born in Volcanoes National Park with a meaningful moniker. The ceremony, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, is inspired by the centuries-old Rwandan tradition where families and communities would gather together to name their newborns. Since Kwita Izina began, it has played a major role in raising awareness of gorilla conservation.
""It's a great story of success to mark this progress of a species that was in decline and on the edge,"" says Praveen Moman, founder of Volcanoes Safaris and the first international tour operator to kickstart gorilla tourism in Rwanda after the genocide. ""First it was small and local and symbolic, just for the rangers and those involved in conservation. Now the government has made this an international and recognisable event to highlight conservation success.""
Rwandans place great significance on a person's name, and so the button-cute babies are given names based on their personality or events surrounding them at the time of their birth. Last year actor Idris Elba named a baby gorilla ""Narame"", meaning ""long life"", because its mother had previously lost two children; and primary school student Elvine Ineza named a female baby ""Nibagwire"", meaning ""multiply"" and chosen to wish the newly formed Sigasirie family continued growth.
Tens of thousands of people, including celebrities, conservationists and local communities, now come together at the foothills of the ancient volcanoes for the annual spectacle held every autumn (the confirmed date for 2025 has yet to be announced by the Rwanda Development Board). As well as the official ceremony, dominated by a house-high bamboo gorilla sculpture, there are hours of music, dances and performances from the warrior-like Intore dancers pounding the ground in time to drums to cultural villages showcasing Rwandan daily life.
As well as raising global awareness, Kwita Izina is also a cultural celebration of the country's collective efforts to protect the great apes and a way of saying thank you to the communities and conservationists who protect them. Irene Murerwa, chief tourism officer of the Rwanda Development Board tells the BBC that Kwita Izina serves the purpose of thanking the local community before everything else. ""It's because of the community and it's for them as well,"" she says.
Timing a visit to Volcanoes National Park during Kwita Izina is highly worthwhile, but the meaning behind it is really what's key, according to Murerwa. ""It's not just the baby gorilla naming ceremony. It's the whole aspect of visiting. Guests can take advantage to understand how communities, tourism and conservation come together here,"" she says.
A dramatic blend of striking volcanic mountains, ethereal montane forests and neat, terraced hills that roll endlessly across the countryside, Rwanda is tiny but one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Space is limited, so people living near the gorillas must have incentives to protect them. ""If you want to save the gorillas you need to focus on the people, because these are tiny, fragile habitats, surrounded by some of the most densely populated areas of the world,"" says Moman.
""Unless local people see some specific benefit from tourism and conservation, there's no reason why they should support the future of the gorillas, and equally importantly, the future of the habitat. What they need is farmland and bread on the table. From the small number of visitors, you need to make enough of an impact through the income and make sure that some of it is shared with the community.""
More than 1.4 million travellers visited Rwanda in 2023, generating a record US$620m. At $1,500 per permit, watching gorillas is an eye-wateringly expensive experience. Yet, income from gorilla tourism provides vital funding for the continued protection of the park and animals within and, crucially, 10% of the park fee revenue goes to the people who live around the park margins to help build schools and houses, improve infrastructure and sanitation, provide clean water and support health centres. This impactful funding has transformed villages and encourages stewardship of the forests.
Tourism now also provides thousands of people with livelihoods. Greg Bakunzi, founder of Red Rocks Rwanda, a social enterprise integrating tourism, conservation and sustainable community development in and around the Volcanoes National Park, says, ""Kwita Izina helped to mobilise communities and people who were interested in conservation and tourism to be a part of the growing tourism industry.""
Red Rocks Rwanda offers safari tent accommodation, gorilla trekking and many immersive activities throughout the year for visitors, and Bakunzi now also hosts the annual Red Rocks Cultural Festival that aligns with the dates of Kwita Izina and features music, poetry, comedy, art, exhibitions and talks about conservation and community empowerment.
""I wanted to create a week-long event that could also integrate community conservation when travellers come for the naming ceremony,"" he says. ""The culture of the communities are intricately tied to the natural world surrounding them. They preserve not only the Virungu Mountain environment but also the historical cultures and traditional arts of the region, gaining access to sustainable sources of income from tourism.""

Over at the Gorilla Guardians Village in the small town of Kinigi, which is also home to the park headquarters, former poachers have swapped snares for stories. Visitors can immerse themselves in Rwandan dance, craft and food, make Rwanda's potent banana beer, learn traditional skills like fire-making and archery and hear the tales of the people who used to hunt in the forest. Also in Kinigi, upscale Sabyinyo Silverback Lodge is Rwanda's first community-owned lodge. The pretty stone cottages and access to gorilla trekking provide an income for many local people and also support healthcare, infrastructure and education projects, such as building homes for widows of the Rwandan genocide and new classrooms for children.
Eunice Umumararungu, assistant manager at Sabyinyo, told me, ""Everyone's job is vital to successful conservation. From the porters, trackers and guides to research partners, rangers and those who are involved in the tree planting initiatives â they are all ensuring future naming ceremonies as the gorilla population grows thanks to conservation efforts. Kwita Izina has helped all Rwandans from various communities to understand the value of gorillas and their contribution to the country's economic prosperity.""
Cementing the region as a conservation hub is the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, which opened in 2022 just outside the park. As well as being an education and research centre for the next generation of conservation leaders, visitors can take quizzes to find out which gorilla matches their personality, leaf through Fossey's field notes in a highly realistic version of the acclaimed primatologist's research camp and explore 12 acres of beautifully landscaped grounds.
Gorilla families are doing so well now that Volcanoes National Park is being expanded to give them more space. In addition, a Conservation Master Plan, published later this year, will set out guidance for the protection and management of all Rwandan biodiversity. As people are seen as important stewards of conservation in this nation, those who will have to relocate out of the expanded national park will be supported with new livelihood opportunities and improved living conditions.
""Kwita Izina has really put our name on the map,"" says Bakunzi. ""It has brought us more global visibility and has shown people why conservation matters.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250331-italy-dolomites-the-magic-of-the-legendary-enrosadira,Where to find the world's most beautiful sunsets,"In Italyâs Dolomites, the ancient coral peaks glow pink at dawn and dusk in a rare natural phenomenon called the enrosadira â a magical moment that makes skiing here unforgettable.
Maybe it's skiing beneath prehistoric, snow-capped spires or the combination of homemade pasta and Austrian apple strudel. But the aprÃ¨s-ski scene just hits differently in Italy's Dolomite Mountains â and the ""enrosadira"" certainly has something to do with it.
This rare natural phenomenon washes over the Dolomites at dawn and dusk when the sun's rays reflect off the craggy peaks in steamy shades of hot pink and wildfire red. The revered towers and cliffs illuminate, transporting visitors back to when the ancient Unesco World Heritage-listed mountains were a coral reef ascending from the sea. And soon, these spectacular sunsets will light up for the entire world when the Dolomites co-host the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics and Paralympics. But for now, you can still catch this wild, blushing beauty without all the crowds.
It's no surprise that enrosadira translates to ""turning pink"" in the Dolomites' ancient Ladin language (the world's last spoken Latin dialect). Like many Ladin traditions, tales of these mountains have been passed down for centuries. According to local legend, the magenta, amber and violet-tinged-bedrock that arrives every morning and evening is what's left of an elf king's beloved rose garden after his daughter was taken away by a suitor. Broken-hearted, he cast a spell forbidding anyone from seeing the beauty of his magical rose garden in the light of day again â only he left out daybreak and twilight.
""Enrosadira is deeply rooted in our Ladin tradition and linked to legends, emotions and a strong sense of belonging to the land,"" says Nicole Dorigo, a Ladin living in the Dolomites' Alta Badia region in the southern part of the Tyrol valley. ""The play of lights on the mountains creates a magical and evocative atmosphere, conveying a sense of peace and connection with our homeland and the natural beauty that surrounds us.""
Of course, the vibrant rock hues can also be explained by science. Back in the 1700s, French geologist Deodat de Dolomieu discovered that the range's peaks aren't pure limestone, as many previously believed. They're made of dolomite â a rock formed millions of years ago in a continental collision that uprooted the coral reef and islands between Africa and Europe. Magnesium-rich seawater slowly transformed the limestone reefs into a pale gray and tan sediment that reflects and re-emits more light than regular limestone, explaining why these mountains shine so brightly and vividly.
""The dolomite layers were all covered by the sea in ancient times. All the sediment from the fish and mud became concrete when the water flooded around it, forming many unique rock shapes,"" says Andrea Milani, a climbing and ski guide for Dolomite Mountains tours. ""In the morning and evening when the sun goes down, with a clear sky, the mountains turn pink.""
Today these ancient sea beds have become one of the world's premier ski regions, offering 12 interconnected Dolomiti Superski resorts. So, after a day on the slopes, over long, deep snowy peaks and valleys where tectonic plates once collided, pull up a lawn chair and watch the sun rays reflect an intense mauve and deep orange. For the best show, face west at sunset or east at sunrise under a clear sky. The lower the sun sits on the horizon, the more dramatic the colours.
Apres-ski doesn't get better than Aperol spritz under enrosadira in crisp mountain air â unless you're lucky enough to find a fossilised seashell in the snow. Here are some of the best aprÃ¨s-ski spots to watch the Dolomites blush pink:
Sip an apÃ©ritif on the terrace of this luxury South Tyrolean hotel overlooking the famous Catinaccio (also called Rosengarten) mountains â the mythical setting of Ladin king Laurin's rose garden. In real life, these mountains frame Alpine meadows with a 17th-Century chapel, an old watermill and nature park. After your aprÃ¨s-ski sunset experience, dine at the resort's restaurant on fresh, regionally inspired fare.
On a candlelit Lake Sompunt, nestled between the towering mastiffs, lies Delights On Ice where tuxedoed servers on figure skates bring you Champagne, wowing you with waltz jumps, sizzles and glides as this small frozen pond reflects the rose-colored peaks at sunset. As sommeliers pour Teroldego and other South Tyrolean wines, local chefs dazzle with traditional Italian, German, Austrian and Ladin dishes like homemade silky polenta and spicy goulash. Tickets are available at the Alta Badia tourism office.

Club Moritzino is one of the Dolomites' top spots â both in elevation at 2.05km and for aprÃ¨s-ski â and has been the life of the party for more than 50 years. Here, at the summit of La Villa's Piz La Ila cable car, you get 360-degree mountain views at a gourmet restaurant, wine bar and with an afternoon DJ out on the terrace.
Located at the base of the 2026 Winter Olympics Alpine ski slope, Chalet Tofane is convenient both to the slopes and the rest of Cortina's upcoming Olympic in-town events: bobsleigh, luge, skeleton and curling. Take a seat on the stylish roof deck to watch the sunset and order the Northern Italian favourite drink, the bombardino (a hot, creamy cocktail made from egg liquor, brandy and topped with whipped cream and cinnamon).
After skiing the famous Sellaronda ski route across four Ladin valleys, finish the day at La Stua. Translated from Ladin as ""wooden living room"", this cosy restaurant with outdoor seating is perfect for watching the enrosadira. And if you want to get a little rowdy, this 1800s farm hut (the Dolomites are home to over 1,000 of these ""rifugi"") has an apres-ski party that won't stop until 02:00. Need a place to stay? Head to the nearby Adler Resort, where you can also watch the sunset before partaking in a rejuvenating spa treatment.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250401-yuki-tsunoda-f1-an-off-the-grid-guide-to-tokyo,An F1 driver's fast and furious guide to Tokyo,"Oracle Red Bull Racing's driver Yuki Tsunoda talks us through the must-see places in Tokyo ahead of his home race at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Whenever Yuki Tsunoda returns to fast and furious Tokyo after months of (literally) racing around the globe, it's the city's bountiful food options that help remind him he's home.
""When I'm back I always make a detailed plan of where I'm going to eat,"" declares the young Red Bull driver; known for being one of Formula 1's biggest foodies. ""On every single street and every single block there are so many great restaurants. The competition for food is so high as currently Tokyo has the highest concentration of Michelin star restaurants in the world.
A native of Sagamihara city, around 47km south-west of Tokyo, Tsunoda â who now lives in Milan, Italy â heads straight to Tokyo whenever he's back in Japan.Â  ""Even when I return to Japan now, which happens around three times a year, I normally stay in Tokyo,"" he says. ""That's where I can do business, enjoy the food and experience the nightlife. It's always so fun to be back there.""
Each April, Tsunoda's return to Tokyo is particularly triumphant when he races in his home Grand Prix. For Tsunoda, what separates the Japanese Grand Prix from the other tracks is the scintillating and contagious atmosphere, which he insists he ""can feel in the car"". Every time Tsunoda emerges at the Suzuka Circuit, he's greeted with a tidal wave of cheers and support that only increases when he's in the car and racing around the circuit.
The excitement was particularly vibrant at the 2024 Japanese Grand Prix, when he finished 10th to become the first Japanese drive to score points since 2012. ""As soon as I got out of the car, I could see so many people were happy,"" he says. ""With that kind of support, you just feel like a hero. You also feel extra pressure too, and responsibility. But it's a special feeling.""
After the race, Tsunoda had no shortage of ways to celebrate. As the world's most populous metropolitan area, home to more than 41 million residents as of 2024, Tokyo is constantly abuzz with energy and excitement. Visitors (and locals) get lost in its bustling markets and bask in its futuristic, neon-lit shopping and nightlife sectors, while the city's many parks, gardens and ancient temples mean there's also room for contemplation and self-reflection.
Here are Tsunoda's top ways to enjoy Tokyo â off the grid.
The city now known as Tokyo began life as a small fishing village called Edo, inhabited since ancient times. Today, its centuries of rich history are proudly on display in its captivating backdrop of modern skyscrapers set against historic temples. Each of the city's 23 wards offers unique sights â like youthful, trendy Shibuya with its iconic ""scramble"" street crossing; and Ginza, lined with elegant luxury boutiques.
When Tsunoda wants to soak up Tokyo's modern-meets-ancient scenery, he heads to Asakusa, a serene neighbourhood known for its traditional charm and for being one of Tokyo's main geisha districts. ""If you want to see the traditional side in Japan, the SensÅ-ji temple is so nice,"" says Tsunoda. Known for its majestic Hozomon Gate, SensÅ-ji is the oldest temple in Tokyo; a five-storey pagoda and Buddhist place of worship that instantly transports you to 7th-Century Japan. Visitors to Asakusa can also stroll down Nakamise-dori; one of Japan's oldest shopping streets.
And for a mile-high view of the city, Tsunoda suggests visiting Tokyo Skytree. The tallest freestanding tower in the world at 634m, Tokyo Skytree offers stunning, all-encompassing views of Tokyo and beyond. ""It's the highest building in Tokyo and you can see the whole city from there,"" says Tsunoda. Visitors can also enjoy the mammoth tower's 300-plus shops and restaurants. Reserving a ticket in advance is strongly recommended to avoid queues.

Whenever he's in Tokyo, Tsunoda always hits Osoba no Kouga in Minato City for their soba (buckwheat) noodles. Helmed by Hiroshi Kouga â who has been making soba for more than 20 years â the elegant space remains one of Tokyo's most affordable Michelin-starred soba noodle shops.
Tsunoda also insists that visitors try wagyu steak when they're in Tokyo. Translating to ""Japanese cow"", wagyu is globally regarded as premium beef for its flavour and tenderness, made rich and juicy by the distinctive marbling pattern of fat. Tsunoda insists, ""Wagyu just tastes different when it's from a cow fed in Japan.""
Tsunoda's favourite place to enjoy wagyu steak is Ukai-Tei in the upscale Ginza district, lauded for its opulent mixture of Art Noveau and Japanese design. Watching its chefs prepare dishes on a teppan grill adds to the entertainment factor.

Seafood is a staple in Japanese cuisine, taking the starring role in dishes from traditional breakfasts of grilled fish and rice to delicious, rainbow-coloured sushi.
For the best fish in town, Tsunoda heads to Tsukiji Outer Market, locally known as Japan's ""Food Town"". Located next to the historic Tsukiji Market where the city's famous tuna auctions were held for decades, the lively market is crammed with stalls selling the freshest seafood. Some of the city's most famous restaurants come here to get their fish, but the market is also packed to the brim with hole-in-the-wall spots where you can snack on some of Japan's most famous foods, like tamagoyaki (omelette on a stick), mochi (glutinous rice cake) and wagyu beef skewers. It's also where Tsunoda says you can find some of Tokyo's best sushi.
""There are many sushi restaurants at Tsukiji Outer Market,"" he says. ""And since it is a fish market, the fish is very fresh, especially in the morning when you can enjoy it right thereâ¦ It's just really great to watch people, walk around the fish market and soak up the atmosphere.""

With scores of luxury and indie boutiques, Tokyo is a shopper's paradise â and there are a variety of areas that cater to Tsunoda's eclectic tastes. ""I go to Harajuku when I want more street-style fashion that younger people wear. There's a lot there,"" he says. Located just east of Shibuya, Harajuku â known as Japan's top fashion district â is full of colourful street art, while its mass of clothing and cosplay stores, hip bars and alluring dessert shops means it's constantly buzzing with youthful vigour.
Tsunoda's first port of call in Harajuku is GR8, which is home to many of the city's up and coming designers, selling popular clothes and footwear from the US and Europe. Its neon interior and wooden entrance makes it one of the most distinct shops in the city, too. But if Tsunoda is after vintage fashion, he heads to the Shimokitazawa neighbourhood, regarded as one of Tokyo's most bohemian areas, full of music venues, cafes and clothing stores. ""That's where you'll find more casual stuff,"" he says. When in Shimokitazawa, Tsunoda shops at BABE store, a used and vintage clothing shop where you can easily spend hours looking for lost gems amidst its mass of items.
For luxury clothes shopping, Tsunoda suggests the very fashionable Omotesando district, sometimes referred to as the Champs-Elysees of the city. ""That's where you get the brand stuff,"" he says. ""The items that are higher in price and where the most famous brands are.""
Tsunoda likes jumping from store to store in the Tadao Ando-designed Omotesando Hills shopping complex. Home to high-end designer boutiques and imports from across the world, there's also the occasional vintage store and fine dining option, too.

The one drinking establishment Tsunoda always tries to frequent when he's in town is Bar Centifolia, located in the laid-back Azabu Juban neighbourhood; home to embassies as well as a smattering of bars and restaurants.
The tiny bar has an exclusive, intimate feel with just 12 seats, and its theatrical bartenders have earned the spot a reputation for doubling as a performance space â tipplers will witness staff ferociously throwing bottles into the air, using liquid nitrogen and blue fire to create a specific taste and even chopping ice with a katana.
""Its bartender Yuzo Komai recently went viral because of the drinks that he makes,"" says Tsunoda. ""A lot of famous people have started going there. A lot of tourists, too. But it's such a nice bar."" Komai's attention to detail when making cocktails, mixing each drink with surgical precision, recently saw him land the Suntory Cocktail Award Champion, one of the most coveted bartender prizes in the city.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250331-the-word-embodying-the-spirit-of-hawaii,Hawaii's ancient concept of 'mÄlama',"Meaning ""to give back"", this ancient concept is a way of life â and a tourism initiative offering travellers fascinating local experiences and perks.
I watched as smooth, purple poi streamed from the grinder, filling a large bucket in the centre of the small room. Earlier, I'd scraped away the rough skin of taro (the Pacific's answer to the potato), washing and cubing them with a knife. From a raised ledge, two men waited to grind it into the thick, starchy paste that has sustained generations of Hawaiians.
My husband, children and I were at the WaipÄ Foundation headquarters; a nonprofit on Kaua'i's lush North Shore dedicated to land conservation and reviving traditional agricultural practices. WaipÄ exemplifies the ancient Hawaiian concept of mÄlama (""to care for"") which encourages visitors to give back to the environment and local communities through activities like habitat restoration, beach cleanups or food provision. But MÄlama goes beyond eco-tourism: it's about leaving a place better than you found it. And after seeking out these experiences during a three-week stay, we found mÄlama not only improves Hawaii, it also made our time there much more meaningful.
MÄlama volunteer experiences are found across the islands. For example, on Maui, you can help restore native forests and volunteer at a nursery; while on O'ahu, visitors can clear invasive algae from Maunalua Bay, or lend a hand aboard the historic USS Missouri. In some cases, travellers booking with partnering hotels and participating in designated activities will qualify for a discounted â or even free â night atÂ dozens of hotels and resorts, including the famousÂ Four Seasons Resort Maui at WaileaÂ where the first season of The White Lotus was filmed.
We had begun the morning sipping traditional mÄmaki tea and eating homemade banana bread in the sunshine, as WaipÄ's guide, Kelsey Ke'alohilani Rogers, shared the legend of kalo (taro in Hawaiian) and how this root vegetable became an iconic part of Hawaiian culture. According to local beliefs, Earth Mother and Sky Father had a stillborn son. From the spot where he was buried, the first kalo plant grew, later nourishing their next son, HÄloa, the first human. ""This is why kalo is more than food; it's family,"" Rogers explained.
But keeping this sacred staple on Hawaiian tables is becoming harder. Land in Hawaii is expensive, and the high cost of living requires many families to work multiple jobs, which is why WaipÄ gives nutrient-rich poi away or sells it at cost to locals.
""Here, you're not just learning â you're supporting people by producing affordable food,"" Rogers added. ""Simply paying for knowledge is extractive, but this is reciprocal."" WaipÄ offers several food and farm tours, as well as a monthly volunteer morning to help with agroforestry, reforestation and removing invasive weeds.
The roots of mÄlama run deep. Hawaii is the most isolated archipelago on Earth, a volcanic cluster of eight main islands, marooned 2,390 miles south-west of California. Centuries before mass tourism, Hawaiians thrived under a sustainable resource management system known as ahupua'a. As she spoke, Rogers traced her finger along a colourful paper map showing how everything was interlinked from the mountains to the sea: what happened upland affected the reefs, waterways and forest. MÄlama 'Äina (caring for the land) has always been a deeply ingrained Hawaiian value â a fact the MÄlama programme's participants are keen to teach visitors today.
""Living on these distant islands meant we had to be self-sufficient and understand our environment,"" she said. ""The Western world was different â it just conquered and took what it needed.""
Now, generations after Hawaii became a US state in 1959 and the rise of jet travel propelled this ""Paradise of the Pacific"" to become a major tourist destination, many Hawaiians and local residents believe a return to the islands' traditional ways is long overdue.
""MÄlama today is more vital than ever,"" Rogers said. ""Too many tourists trample over our land, ignoring restrictions and damaging sensitive ecosystemsâ¦ Don't just think Hawaii is beautiful; help keep it that way. It's a shared responsibility."" As Rogers explained, mÄlama isn't about seeing or appreciating a landscape; it invites visitors to connect and contribute to it, with the idea that caring for a place fosters a stronger relationship with it.
""Most tourists leave never knowing anything about our culture,"" she continued. ""Despite what many think, it's not just about going to a lÅ«'au or surfing.""
Nearby, outside the poi mill in the WaipÄ base, I listened to the rhythmic sound of singing as Hawaiians joined hands in a piko (circle), symbolising connection, to bless the food.
As part of the initiative, we stayed at two hotels that encourage mÄlama: the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa, which offers a free fifth night if guests participate in a beach cleanup; and 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay. Both properties highlight mÄlama-focused experiences in their daily programmes, partnering with organisations like the National Tropical Botanical Garden, the Surfrider Foundation, WaipÄ and the Kaua'i Humane Society. Our youngest was especially keen to try the latter, which lets visitors adopt a shelter dog for the day and take it out exploring.
""For many, Hawaii is just a playground, a Disneyland,"" a lifeguard by the Hyatt hotel pool told me. ""A huge number of homes have become holiday rentals, pushing locals out. If tourism is going to work here, it must benefit the local community.""
After volunteering at the WaipÄ Foundation, we visitedÂ Common Ground, also on Kaua'i's North Shore â a regenerative farm that was once a sugar plantation, and which encourages mÄlama 'Äina. We joined one of itsÂ food and feastÂ tours, where guests are shown around before sharing a meal that celebrates the island's bounty.
""Monoculture plantations like sugar were run by big companies that came to our islands, stripped the soil bare, and then left,"" our guide, Sophia Reinheimer, explained. But this farm is different: here, the soil is nurtured through regenerative practices, such as planting diverse crops rather than just one. All of the ingredients used in the food served come from Kaua'i â either grown on the farm itself or sourced from nearby producers. That's rare in Hawaii, where 90% of the food is imported.
""MÄlama also means eating responsibly, choosing ocean-friendly restaurants and shopping at the many farmers'markets,"" Reinheimer added. But it extends beyond food â supporting local businesses and buying locally made souvenirs has a positive impact, too.
We also took part in a newly launched lei-making workshop in Common Ground's lush garden. As we twisted ti leaves into a lei hili (a rope-like lei), our teacher, Ivory Lloyd, shared the deeper significance behind the tradition. ""Lei making is the ultimate expression of aloha (the Hawaiian belief that all things, people and nature, are connected and deserve love),"" she said. ""It connects us to the land; we honour the plants we use and ask permission before picking them.""
Yet, like many aspects of Hawaiian culture, traditional lei-making faced obstacles. After Hawaii's 1898 annexation by the US, many cultural practices â including the Hawaiian language andÂ hula â were banned. It wasn't until theÂ Hawaiian Renaissance of the 1960sÂ that these traditions began to revive, and today, mÄlama plays a role in keeping them alive.
Maile Brown from the Kaua'i Visitors Bureau told me how the mÄlama programme began. ""After Covid, we saw how much healthier the land was without the crowds,"" she said. ""We wanted to redefine tourism, to encourage greater respect for Hawaii's people and place.""
What began as a list of participating businesses has evolved into a broader initiative, offering visitors opportunities to either volunteer during their stay, or engage with local businesses and nonprofits that embody mÄlama. Since Covid, the islands' message to visitors remains simple: come as you would into someone's home, and if you're willing, here's how you can help care for it.
""Tourism is about education,"" Brown continued. ""If you leave understanding the complexity and beauty of a place, you develop a reverence for it."" While volunteering is one way to practise mÄlama, learning about Hawaii is just as essential. ""It's about perpetuating local culture,"" she continued.Â  ""This is our kuleana, our responsibility."" Then, she added, with a smile, ""Of course, be sure to enjoy the island's beauty, the variety of activities â just putÂ mÄlamaÂ into the mix, and in your heart.""

On another day, we joined the Surfrider Foundation, which organises beach cleanups for volunteers, including tourists. We were the only non-locals, so as we collected plastic, we talked about island life. At the end, as a rainbow revealed itself above, we shared homemade cookies and cupcakes. Our sons enjoyed exploring the beach while filling hessian sacks, and, under supervision, helped to cut the discarded ropes. It was shocking to learn that more than 52 metric tonnes of debris enter Hawaii every year â much of it from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, with almost half composed of commercial fishing waste.
On our last day on Kaua'i, we went to Limahuli Garden & Preserve. While we chose to wander on our own, guided tours (Tuesdays and Thursdays at 09:00) highlight its conservation work. ""We steward a modern ahupua'a,"" volunteer coordinator Sonia Adame said. Visitors can volunteer too, removing invasive species or planting in the nursery.
After eight days on Kauai'i, we ventured to Molokai, the least visited of all the Hawaiian Islands. There are no resorts, no chain stores, no billboards â just swirling seas at the foot of some of the world's tallest cliffs, forests of flaming red Ê»ÅhiÊ»a trees and candy-coloured clapboard churches.
We travelled deep into HÄlawa Valley on the islandâs far eastern edge to visit Greg Solatario, a native Hawaiian cultural practitioner who lives off-grid on the land his ancestors have stewarded for centuries. Solatario embodies mÄlama â committed to nurturing the land and preserving Hawaiian culture. After welcoming us into his home, he led us through long-abandoned villages lost to the jungle and moss-cloaked heiau (temples).
As we approached, his son, Devak stepped out to greet us and blew a conch shell, which his father answered with another. ""This is to ask permission before entering the land,"" he explained.
But it was his parting words that lingered longest: mÄlama can, and should, be a global value, not just a Hawaiian one.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250328-the-people-boycotting-travel-to-the-us,The growing call to boycott travel to the US,"As the list of nations issuing travel warnings to the US grows, some visitors are opting to boycott it entirely. Here's why many foreigners are changing their travel plans and what this could mean for Americans.
As President Donald Trump implements sweeping new policies, issues tariffs on longtime allies and leads an immigration crackdown, some international travellers are rethinking their travel plans to the US.
The nation's stricter border enforcement has recently led to the detention of Canadian and European tourists, prompting Germany, the UK, Denmark, Finland and Portugal to issue travel warnings and advisories for the country. Now, it appears that a growing number of voices are advocating for an all-out boycott of travel to the US.
The cold shoulder has been particularly noticeable from the US's northern neighbour, Canada, which sends more than 20 million visitors to the country per year â more than any other nation. In response to Trump's proposed tariffs and repeated threats to annex the nation, former prime minister Justin Trudeau recently urged his fellow Canadians: ""Now is the time to choose Canada,"" adding, ""it might mean changing your summer vacation plans to stay here in Canada.""
The appeal seems to have caught on, as many infuriated Canadians are now boycotting US holidays. In February, border crossings were down by more than 20%, according to Statistics Canada. The US Travel Association estimates that even a 10% reduction in Canadian visitors could result in $2.1bn in lost spending and 14,000 job losses.
While some Canadians are snubbing the US because of policy changes, others say they simply don't feel as safe as they once did.
""My partner and I decided not to go ahead with our planned vacations to the US this year,"" said Canadian travel journalist Kate Dingwall. ""I worry about the border and getting stuck somehow, especially with how prickly Trump is to Canada. There's just a sense of uneasiness around visiting America at the moment.""
Keith Serry, a writer and comedian based in Montreal, Quebec, cancelled five April appearances in New York City (including four shows at the upcoming New York City Fringe festival) due to the tense political situation.
""This decision will, of course, rob me of the opportunity to share my art with many of you in New York I've grown to know and love,"" he wrote on his Facebook page. ""That said, the honest truth is that I just don't feel safe travelling to the States right now. In addition, I feel a powerful disinclination to spending my money in any way that might aid the economy of a hostile state.""
In recent months, some Canadians have faced tougher border security than ever before â even those with clean records and valid documents. One woman made international headlines as she was detained by ICE for two weeks in reportedly bleak conditions after her visa was revoked.
""We're a country that prides itself, imperfectly but intentionally, on values like inclusion, equity and human rights. When those values feel out of step with what's happening across the border, it becomes harder to justify participation,"" said Amar Charles Marouf, a Canadian citizen who works as growth strategist at the international law firm Gowling WLG. ""The political climate raises broader questions. What kind of treatment are we normalising? What assumptions are being made about who is welcome and who isnât?""
It's not that Canadians aren't traveling internationally; many are simply swapping their traditional destinations. Marouf says Mexico, South America and Europe all feel more welcoming at the moment. ""California will be there when this is all over, but I just feel like there's less risk going to Portugal instead,"" added Dingwall.
Some international properties have seen a bump in traffic, directly attributable to Canadians now spurning the US. ""In the last several weeks, we've received 10-plus leads from Canadians seeking to relocate events from the United States this summer,"" said Diarmaid O'Sullivan, director of sales & marketing at Hamilton Princess Hotel & Beach Club Bermuda. ""This is a mix of leisure travellers, including those planning weddings, and companies relocating business events. This represents an approximately 20% increase in forecasted revenue from the Canadian market.""
Interestingly, all of this is happening just as the US had been experiencing record growth in the travel and tourism sector. Marta Soligo, professor at UNLV and director of Tourism Research at the UNLV Office of economic development, points to The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC)'s 2024 Economic Impact Trends Report, which showed the US as the world's top travel and tourism market. Not only did the industry achieve an unprecedented economic impact of $2.36tn in the US, but the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projections indicate that the US economy will add more than 800,000 jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector.
""Such numbers help us understand the importance of the sector in the US, showing that a decrease in tourism from top-origin countries could significantly damage the US economy,"" said Soligo. ""The consequences of these issues can impact both large US-based corporations, such as hotel chains, and small businesses alike.""
The change in travel patterns is already having a tangible effect on the US economy. Tourism Economics recently updated its inbound US travel forecast from a predicted 8.8% growth, to a 5.1% decline, attributing the change to ""strained"" travel sentiment, ""sweeping tariffs"" and ""exchange rate shifts"" making travel to the US more expensive.
""The combination of travel bans and a reduction of US travel could have a material impact on tourism and economic development,"" said Jeff Le, former deputy cabinet secretary for the State of California and the state's federal coordinator during the first Trump Administration.
In California alone, international visitors provided more than $24bn in local economies in 2023, reports Le. ""Losing this would likely hurt both people and local government funds,"" he said. ""It is harder to measure reputational loss, but I cannot imagine active boycotts help.""

While the broad impact of boycotting travel to the US could have substantial national and governmental effects, some advocacy organisations also warn that the loss of tourism dollars is most likely to be felt by individuals.
""It's US workers and small businesses who get affected by US travel boycotts,"" said Thomas F Goodwin, leader of the Exhibitions and Conferences Alliance. Goodwin notes that more than 99% of the US business and professional events industry is made up of small businesses, and more than 80% of all exhibitors are US and international small businesses. ""When international business travellers forgo coming to the US, everyone from exposition booth builders and general service contractors to venue caterers and individual skilled labourers suffer â not politicians or the government. Boycotts have a knock-on effect on hotels, taxis, restaurants, local entertainers, high street commerce and more.""
There is also a cost that is harder to quantify: the global influence of American culture.
""Visitor numbers declining in the US sends a signal that the US is losing its soft power â the influence it once held through openness, cultural leadership and global goodwill,"" said Neri Karra Sillaman, entrepreneurship expert at the University of Oxford and author of the forthcoming book Pioneers: 8 Principles of Business Longevity from Immigrant Entrepreneurs. ""If this trend continues, it may force tourism boards or even local governments to create counter narratives to win back trust. I am not sure if it will be effective, however, since at the end of the day, it is the policies of the government that give the ultimate direction and influence perception.""
Sillaman notes that travel boycotts also have a long-term cost to culture, the economy and overall innovation. ""When academics, scientists, artists, designers and entrepreneurs start to choose other countries instead of US, the US is going to lose more than just visitors,"" she said. ""In the long term, it's going to lose its competitiveness, goodwill and it will turn into a closed society that stifles growth and innovation.""
This human impact of boycotts also shows up in a myriad of ways, noted Missouri lawyer John Beck. ""I've worked with hundreds of non-citizens over the last 15 years and seen firsthand how policies between governments can result in individuals â regular travellers, students, families â getting caught in the middle,"" he said. ""It's rarely about the politics. It's about missed weddings, lost business deals or being unable to visit a dying parent.""
Beck says he has worked with at least 80 clients who have either delayed or cancelled US travel due to real or perceived hostility over the past few years. This causes complications with split families, international companies who can't move talent quickly and lost business due to the lack of ease of movement. Even though the geopolitical stakes are high, there is a human aspect on both sides of the border.
""Most Americans have little to do with the policies that frustrate global travellers,"" he said. ""They just want safety, fairness and dignity. That's what we need to protect.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250328-the-revival-of-jordans-1600-year-old-camino,A sacred journey connecting Jordan and Spain,"In Jordan, a 50km pilgrimage trail follows the path of a 4th-Century nun who journeyed through the Holy Land â centuries before Spain's famed Camino de Santiago.
The hike begins early in the morning at Mount Nebo, a sacred mountain 610m above sea level in Jordan. On a clear day, panoramic views of the Dead Sea, Bethlehem and Jerusalem stretch across the horizon. According to the Bible, it is the last place Moses gazed upon before his death. Today, it's the first sight walkers see as they set out on their journey along the Camino de Egeria, a pilgrim route first taken by a 4th-Century nun.
The view is ""magical"", says Silvano Mezzenzana, who recently undertook the three-day hike. He recalls standing atop that peak on the Moab plateau, a dry Sun fanning out over the ridges and farmland beneath, noting that it is fascinating both in the morning when the Sun lights up the Palestinian bank and the city of Jericho, and in the afternoon when the sunset draws the silhouettes of the hills of Judah up to Jerusalem. Up there, ""you do not realise that you are on a mountain"", he adds.
Beginning on the eastern edge of the Great Rift Valley, the 50km route winds through farmland and rugged hills â a voyage that is far greener than its European equivalent, the 800km Camino de Santiago pilgrim trail undertaken by around 500,000 people each year. Following the January announcement from Jordan and Spain of a merger twinning the Camino de Egeria with the Camino de Santiago to boost their respective cultural heritage, locals hope that the newly-renovated Middle Eastern trail can become a similar phenomenon. The goal is to highlight the significance of the eponymous Egeria, the Spanish nun believed to have travelled by donkey from Jordan through Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Asia Minor to visit the holy places recounted in the Bible. She is thought to be the first woman to make the journey, which pre-dates the famed Camino de Santiago by five centuries.
The hike is typically split up into three days (though can be done as quickly as in two, or a leisurely five). The terrain is not particularly challenging, but the distance â of around 17km per day â makes the hike unsuitable for total novices.Â Last year, wide paths were fixed between the rocky valleys and hills along much of the route, ushering in what the Ministry of Tourism hopes will mark a new era for international interest in the country.
The effort is already seeing results. ""Although I have lived in Jordan all my life, walking this trail has shown me parts of the country I've never experienced before,"" says Nadeen Dabbas. She recalls the flow of the water at the Moses Springs and the Jordan Valley, where she was surrounded by fields of bananas and corn, as moments that ""made me feel alive"".
The first major landmark on day one features a small monastery built by Egyptian monks in Moses' memory, built in the latter half of the 4th Century, enlarged a century later and rebuilt in the 6th Century to a mosaic-filled basilica that still stands today. The trail then passes through the ancient city of Livias, before reaching its showpiece on day two: Al-Maghatas, or Bethany beyond the Jordan. A Unesco World Heritage site, this is believed to be the location where Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist. Pilgrims can explore Byzantine and Roman remains of chapels, churches and monasteries, along with the cave of John the Baptist, and even ""spend the second night there in one of the pilgrim houses of Bethany, just next to the Jordan River"", explains Oscar Koshebye, a guide who helped formalise the current tourist trail. The route finishes here, or at the King Hussein Bridge at the Jordan-Israel border.
While the hike offers striking natural beauty, the real draw may prove to be the woman who likely inspired it. ""Egeria's account is significant because it is one of the oldest written accounts of pilgrimage to the Holy Land that has survived â and the first incontrovertibly penned by a woman,"" says Anne McGowan, associate professor of liturgy at the Catholic Theological Union and co-author of Pilgrimage of Egeria. Egeria's work was little-known until the 1880s, McGowan adds, originally written in the form of letters to her ""sisters"" (likely holy women similar to herself). An incomplete manuscript dating to the 11th Century is currently the oldest known record of her route.
Egeria travelled during the 4th Century, when many Christians took long-distance pilgrimages â something that fell out of favour from the 7th Century until around the mid-19th (aside from a ""blip"" in the wake of the Crusades, in the 12th-13th Centuries), McGowan explains. At that point, ""travel to the Holy Land became easier once again. Going on pilgrimage aligned well with the Romantic Era's renewed enthusiasm for the personal and the subjective on the one hand and an idealised past on the other; and Protestants as a group became more intrigued by pilgrimage possibilities connected to places associated with the life and death of Jesus in a way they hadn't been previously.""
But now, with religious appetite dwindling (a study publishedÂ last yearÂ found that atheists now outnumber theists in the UK), Koshebye is hoping that a new generation can be drawn in. ""We can consider it now, after centuries of abandonment, a route for tolerance between faiths, a way to improve intercultural exchange,"" he says.
The Spanish national and keen hiker began mulling a walking route to Jerusalem five years ago. Having already walked the Spanish Camino, he mentioned his plans to his father, who likened his son's idea to the devout Egeria â who he had never heard of. Koshebye began reading about the nun and scouring old maps in search of her original route. He later made a YouTube video about his plans, was contacted by the Jordanian tourist board, and then got in touch with the Spanish embassy in Jordan â a series of collaborative efforts that led to the merger being born.
More like this:

Koshebye hopes that the partnership leads to a surge of interest in this three-day version of the hike and wants it to be extended a further 30km to Jerusalem, another stop on Egeria's route. Plans for signage along the Jordanian route and more guesthouses where walkers can rest in between are already afoot.
While steeped in religious significance, ancient routes of this kind aren't just for those intent on retracing paths drawn by scripture, McGowan says. ""Taking a very long walk still has the capacity to pull one into an inner journey. Younger people are still spiritual seekers, even if their search is typically less closely tied to traditional religious beliefs and practices,"" she believes. ""Their pilgrimages might be more oriented toward the experience of journeying itself, as it seems Egeria's was as well; she does not so much set out on a round trip to visit one particular place, for example, as to experience as many places as possible.""
With time â and a few more signposts â those involved in the project hope that Jordan's historic trail can achieve the same cultural significance as its Spanish counterpart. Mezzenzano, for one, has no doubt. ""I would not only recommend"" the trail, he enthuses, ""but I plan to repeat it"".

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250328-the-return-of-sicilys-ancient-white-gold,The return of Sicily's ancient 'white gold',"It's mentioned 17 times in the Bible and was harvested in the Mediterranean for more than a millennium. Now, a farmer is reviving this ancient ""superfood"".
It's a hot and muggy summer day in Sicily's Madonie mountains, a rugged range of ridges about 65km east of Palermo. In a field of ash trees, the buzzing of cicadas is interrupted by a voice. ""You came at the right time,"" says Giulio Gelardi, a local farmer pointing towards a white-streaked branch. ""This is the famous manna.""
Along the bark of each tree are thick lines of manna, a white mineral-rich resin referenced in the Bible 17 times that has been used as a natural sweetener and medicinal aid for centuries. Manna harvesting (the practice of cutting the bark of Fraxinus ornus trees to collect their sap), used to be a common practice throughout the Mediterranean. But in the past 80 years, urbanisation and industrialisation have led to it nearly vanishing.
For the past 30 years, Gelardi has made it his mission to put this Biblical superfood back on our tables, and today, this once-forgotten sap is being used by chefs and pastry makers in innovative ways.
Even if you've never tasted manna, you may have heard of it. The phrase ""manna from heaven"" refers to a Biblical story where a food falls from the sky to nourish the Israelites as they crossed the Sinai desert. In Exodus, manna is described as a ""flaky substance as fine as frost blanketed on the ground"". While experts disagree what substance, specifically, this passage refers to, a honey-like, flaky and frost-coloured resin named manna has been extracted from the bark of ash trees in the Mediterranean region for more than a millennium.
In the Madonie mountains â home to the 40,000-hectare Madonie Natural Park â manna harvesting dates back to at least the 9th Century when the island was under Arab rule. During the Renaissance, Sicilian farmers used to collect this sweet sap â which tastes like cane sugar with almond undertones â and sell it to merchants from around the Mediterranean, a highly profitable trade that led the Kingdom of Naples to put taxes on it during the 16th Century.
Until World War Two, manna farming was a way of life for many Sicilian families. Footage from 1936 shows local farmers harvesting the substance, which was commonly sold to pharmaceutical companies to extract mannitol, a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener and a diuretic. In the 1950s, scientists found a way to synthesise mannitol, and in the decades that followed, manna harvesting virtually disappeared.
When Gelardi came back to his hometown of Pollina in 1985 after 15 years away, he realised that one of the core components of his local culture was vanishing. ""When I was growing up, everyone knew how to extract manna,"" he explains. ""When I came back, there were less than 100 farmers who could still do it.""
Pollina is a 3,000-person medieval town that seems sculpted out of the surrounding limestone hills. As a child, Gelardi learned to harvest manna in the summer from his parents. ""Manna harvesting involved the whole family,"" he explains. Men used handmade billhooks to make thin cuts along the bark, women collected the overflowing sap using dried prickly pear stems and children turned the goopy nectar into cylindrical cones called cannoli, due to their resemblance to the popular Sicilian sweet.
According to Gelardi, the hardest part of manna harvesting is knowing when to cut the bark. Ash trees produce sap year-round but only produce enough resin to harvest during the hottest days of the year. Gelardi says if you cut the bark too early, it can cause the trees to stop making manna altogether. ""Finding out when the moment for cutting has come is a unique skill based on observation and intuition,"" he says, explaining: ""[It's necessary to] listen to each plant.""
For example, leaves turning from dark green to lighter green with yellow marks may mean that a tree has reached peak manna production. Spotting cracks in the ground near the roots can also mean it's ready for harvest, as plants produce surplus sap to overcome dry spells. When the tree looks ready, manna farmers make a shallow cut in the bark and observe the plant's reaction. If a plant is mature enough, a small amount of resin will ooze from the cut. Farmers can then proceed to make deeper carvings, as small streams of sticky manna will flow towards the roots.
""Manna harvesting is not something you can learn from a book,"" Gelardi explains. ""If we don't pass these skills down to the next generation, we would lose centuries-old local farming knowledge.""
A few months after returning to Pollina, Gelardi set out to revive the waning tradition. At first, most locals did not meet his ""manna renaissance"" with enthusiasm. ""My friends thought I was crazy. They said manna was a thing of the past,"" he says. Undeterred, Gelardi spent months learning all he could about it.
He spent time with elder farmers to refine his harvesting skills and visited Palermo's public library to study manna. ""I knew manna was used locally as a sweetener, a moisturiser and a diuretic,"" he says. ""But I learned that it could also be used to treat food intoxication, a variety of skin conditions, arthritis and cold symptoms.""
Gelardi also started to realise how manna shaped local geography and culture. For example, Gibilmanna, a nearby hill home to a famous sanctuary, owes its name to the Arab words ""gibil"" (mountain) and ""manna"". Local expressions are also shaped by manna, like the local phrase, ""vivere di mieli e manna"" (""to live of honey and manna""), meaning living an affluent life.
In 1986 Gelardi began handing out pamphlets containing facts about manna to tourists staying at a nearby resort. ""People were captivated by manna'sÂ healing properties and its impact on local culture,"" he recalls. By the 1990s, he was leading tours demonstrating how to harvest manna to international travellers. ""They started to see it as our local superfood,"" he says.
Manna is mostly composed of mannitol, a naturally sweet crystal compound,Â as well as minerals like potassium, magnesium and calcium. According to Vivienne Spadaro, a professor of botany at the University of Palermo, this thick white resin can be used as a dietary supplement to reintegrate minerals, especially potassium, and as a base for several medicines. ""Manna has been used to treat constipation, cough, sore-throats and skin wounds due to its decongestant and soothing properties,"" she says. And because of itsÂ low glycemic index, Spadaro says some manna can be used as a sweetener for diabetic people or those on hypo-caloric diets.
While leading manna tours, Gelardi developed a more efficient way to harvest the substance with far less risk of contamination from bark or insects. He created a ""clean manna"" technique by attaching a small aluminum spout to the tree so that manna flows away from the trunk along a fishing line attached to the spout. This allowed Gelardi to nearly double his manna production.
In the following years, Gelardi started selling his manna to bakers and pastry chefs, who incorporated it into everything from cannoli, wafers, flakes and chocolates.Â He also sold manna to pharmacies to make laxatives, minerals supplements and skin products. In recent years French skincare companies Biotherm and Yves Roche have used it to make skin moisturisers.
In 2002, manna from the Madonie was declared a protected ingredient by Slow Food, an international organisation that promotes endangered food traditions. By the mid-2000s, manna became a sought-after ingredient for local chefs and pastry-makers.
""I started using manna to make pandolce (fruitcake) with manna and almonds, but then realised it goes well with savoury dishes, too,"" says Giuseppe Zingales, chef at Hostaria Cycas in the nearby medieval village of Castelbuono. The restaurant offers many manna-infused dishes, including manna-crusted pork tenderloin; risotto with asparagus, bacon and manna; and wild thistle flan with manna fondue. At another Castelbuono eatery, Ristorante Nangalarruni, chefs Peppe Carollo and his daughter Francesca use crushed manna to create one of the restaurant's signature dishes: suckling pig with almonds, pistachio and manna crust.
""The key is to [use] it well,"" Francesca Carollo explains, ""A small portion of sweet-tasting manna offers a nice contrast to roast meat flavour, but too much manna can make this dish too sweet.""
Pastry chefs are particularly interested in manna. Nicola Fiasconaro, one of Italy's most famous patissiers, now produces a special edition of panettone, Italy's traditional Christmas fruitcake, made with chocolate and frosted manna, while Michelin-starred chef Davide Oldani featured chocolate-covered manna sticks as part of the menu of his Milan-area restaurant D'O from 2014 to 2016. In recent years, the Madonie's ""white gold"", as it is sometimes called, has reached a price of â¬200 per kg and has been used to make a variety of sugar-free baked goods, from muffins to biscotti.
Most chefs buy manna from the Madonie's Manna Consortium, a cooperative created in 2015 by Gelardi and other farmers to market manna products and promote manna harvesting to younger farmers.
""I grew up hearing about manna but had never learned how to harvest it,"" says Mario Cicero, who belongs to the Consortium. Born in Castelbuono, he spent years working around the world as a chef before returning to the Madonie. As part of his training, Cicero spent months with older farmers, including Gelardi. ""Giulio's taught me many tricks,"" he says, ""but he mostly passed on a contagious passion for manna harvesting."" Cicero now tends 200 ash trees in his farm near Castelbuono and hopes that more young people will take up manna harvesting.
Seeing young farmers like Cicero becoming ntaccaluori (Sicilian for ""cutters"") is what Gelardi is most proud about. As he explains: ""Every young person that learns how to harvest manna will ensure the survival of a centuries-old tradition.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250327-yotam-ottolenghi-interview-influential-katty-kay,Ottolenghi: Food is how we connect,"The famed chef and author tells the BBC's Katty Kay that it was finding academia too âesotericâ that led him to seek out a simpler path: to help the world simplify its food.
Yotam Ottolenghi's singular style of cooking has been embraced across the globe. Focusing on simple ingredients and treating food as a way to bring friends and family together, he's become a renowned chef, a best-selling author and a touchstone for home cooks looking to incorporate global flavours into their everyday rotations.
The chef, father and former philosophy student explains to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay, in her interview series Influential, that having parents who cooked helped shape his path. However, he says that it was the sense of belonging that came with cooking â not family expectations â that truly drew him in.
""There was a quiet expectation that I would probably become an academic,"" he says. ""I don't remember having a conversation, which must have happened. 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' I don't remember that.""
His parents were both in education â his father, Michael, was a chemistry professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University â but Ottolenghi notes that his folks both had experience in the kitchen.
""Food was very important. We had good ingredients, good cooking. Both my parents were good cooks,"" he says. ""My father used to cook a lot because he worked more flexible hours. My mother was a head teacher at school [...] She also cooked but he cooked even more.""
The 56-year-old chef â who has authored 11 cookbooks â tells Kay that rather than having an epiphany about his future path, he saw the kitchen as a space for curiosity and play, something that he's now passed onto his own children.
""My kids â I've got a 9 year old [and an] 11 year old â they play, you know?"" he says. ""They go in the kitchen and they make an omelette and this and that. I call it cooking as play. So, I used to do a bit of that but I wasn't obsessive about cooking.""
Before making his name in the culinary world, Ottolenghi dabbled in philosophy but found the subject matter too isolating and ""esoteric"".
""The conversation was being held amongst a group of, like, four people, you know like groundbreaking stuff but actually nobody was participating,"" he said of his time in university, where he tackled topics like the meaning of photography and what images mean to their viewers. Instead of that very specialised field, he turned his focus to something simpler, literally.
In 2018, following the success of his eponymous Notting Hill cafÃ© and shop, Ottolenghi published his fifth cookbook, Simple, distilling all the techniques and preparations that he'd become known for into something accessible and approachable.
""Food is a language that everybody understands,"" he says. What surprised him about that, however, was that the books started to eclipse the food. ""Rather than just being a book to sell and share, the publishing arm of Ottolenghi became the dog wagging the tail in this respect. The books became the main thing, almost.""
The books were a way for fans of the restaurant and of Ottolenghi's pared-down, flavour-forward recipes to access that world at home. He tells Kay that he hopes to be part of a movement to take cooking from being a chore into something healing and restorative.
""Home-style cooking and family-style serving are way more popular now than they used to be. I really put that down to, first of all, cost of living, but also Covid. In that moment, we understood that actually food should be healing rather than just one of all other activities that we do all day long that push us.""
More like this:
â¢ Misty Copeland is 'not scared' to face a career beyond dance
â¢ Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'
â¢ Entrepreneur Jane Wurwand on why 'high-touch will overshadow high-tech' in business
Fans soon saw the changes in his books, shifting from the exact recipes served at his restaurants to something less haute cuisine and more streamlined, boasting titles like Simple, Plenty and his latest, Comfort.
""I think since Simple, I have been spending more of my time thinking, 'What does it actually mean to cook this recipe?' You know, 'When do I cook â when does one cook it? How much effort goes into it?'"" he says. ""Funnily, from a grand old age talking to younger chefs, I say to them, 'Is someone actually going to cook this?' I want people to cook my food.""
That pared-down approach has even turned ""Ottolenghi"" into an adjective â used to describe food that offers high impact with few ingredients and straightforward techniques. He remains humble, brushing off the distinction and putting the focus back on his desire to make cooking comforting.
""Food really is one of those activities that shouldn't induce anxiety. It's as simple as that,"" he says.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250325-kandi-burruss-weekend-guide-to-atlanta,Kandi Burruss's weekend guide to Atlanta,"The musician, producer and Real Housewives: Atlanta breakout star loves her hometown. Here are her top local picks, from brunch at Toast to people watching at the Beltline.
Atlanta â the state capital of Georgia and the unofficial capital of the American South â started its life as a railroad terminus in 1837 and has served as a hub for American culture ever since.
Ranking among the top cities for US tourism, Atlanta consistently draws visitors with its dynamic contemporary art scene and iconic soul food, as well as its abundance of greenery and sprawling historic estates. One of the main epicentres of the hip hop industry, it has also secured its place in music history, nurturing a long line of homegrown talent â like Kandi Burruss, the Atlanta-born singer, songwriter, producer and star of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.
The future songstress was raised in the Atlanta suburb of East Point, where she attended Tri-Cities High School of Visual and Performing Arts and met the other members of R&B girl group Xscape; later going on to co-write the 1993 hit No Scrubs for TLC. Burruss joined the Real Housewives of Atlanta cast for its sophomore season in 2010, becoming a fan favourite and one of the longest-tenured housewives before leaving the show in 2024. Her latest venture takes her to New York City as she and her husband, Todd Tucker, co-produce the new Broadway production of Othello at the Barrymore Theatre, starring Academy Award winners Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal.
But Burruss is an Atlanta girl through and through.Â ""I was born and raised in Atlanta, so I am Atlanta,"" she says. ""This is home base for me.""
Her time on Real Housewives allowed her to celebrate her Atlanta roots, and chronicled meeting her husband and the birth of her son, Ace. ""It's been kind of cool to say I can go back and watch 14 years of my life,"" she says. ""It was a great experience.""
Cameras followed Burruss and her co-stars as they crisscrossed the city to attend fashion shows; local restaurants, like 80-year-old Mary Mac's Tea Room; and major landmarks like the Georgia Aquarium, which set the scene for one of the show's beloved end-of-season reunions.
Burruss owns various enterprises in town, including two restaurants and her business camp The Kandi Factory HQ (""You have to have an invite,"" she says), which put her at the heart of Atlanta's often over-the-top social scene.
""Atlanta is a vibe,"" she declares. ""Itâs a great place for work, fun, and the weather hits all four seasons; itâs such a place to be.""
Here are Burruss's favourite ways to experience her hometown of Atlanta.
If visitors are looking to drop some major coin, Burruss isn't against hitting up some of the most recognisable spots in Atlanta.
""People always go to Lenox [Square] or Phipps [Plaza] if they want to shop,"" she says.
Both malls are in the city's upscale Buckhead neighbourhood and include the designer labels that Burruss and her co-stars wear on the show, like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Dior. The Waldorf Astoria Atlanta Buckhead and the InterContinental Buckhead Altanta hotels, both located nearby, played host to the Real Housewives of Atlanta for various events, like Nene Leakes's wedding in 2013.

Atlanta has 53 restaurants listed in the Michelin Guide (and eateries like Fishmonger and Staplehouse have taken top spots on Bon AppÃ©tit's Best New Restaurants listings in recent years), but diners can also enjoy the city's iconic Southern dishes like fried chicken at The Busy Bee Cafe and peach cobbler at Ms Ruby's Peach Cobbler CafÃ© in Buckhead.
Anyone looking to refuel after a late night or keep the party going after a big celebration can opt for brunch; another reality TV standby. While Burruss famously doesn't imbibe, she's happy to recommend her favourite spot.
""If I wanted to get up and go to brunch, it's a place called Toast. They have a great brunch,"" Burruss says of the trendy eatery, found just outside of Atlanta's Buckhead neighbourhood. ""The food is really good.""
Visitors can feast on ""New American Brunch"" dishes like strawberry-shortcake French toast or fried catfish and grits, while fans of Real Housewives will recognise the restaurant as the spot where Burruss feuded with her co-star Marlo Hampton at ShereÃ© Whitfield's Keepin' it Gucci brunch in 2023.

As Burruss knows, getting a group of girlfriends together is no easy feat. So she looks for venues with good vibes and good music to accompany any tea that might get spilled (gossip) when she and her girls get together.
""My friend Rasheeda owns a place called Frost Bistro. We might hang out there, because they play good music,"" Burruss says. Fans of reality TV may also remember the restaurant from VH1's Love & Hip Hop Atlanta. Rasheeda and Kirk Frost, who have headlined the show since 2012, opened the casual Southern-style bistro back in 2020, offering a breakfast and brunch menu full of inventive cocktails and modern, stick-to-your-ribs Georgia-style dishes.
""I like the oxtail and grits, the snapper and the French toast,"" says Burruss.

Atlantic Station is a favourite for locals and tourists, thanks to its views, restaurants and family-friendly attractions.
The building was once a steel mill and has since been transformed into a collection of boutiques, eateries and apartments. Its location between Atlanta's West Side, Home Park and South Buckhead makes it easy for visitors to get to no matter where they're coming from.
""You want to go to Atlantic Station. They always have a lot of kids hanging out and playing,"" Burruss says. ""I just took my son and his friends to Skyline Park at Ponce City Market. [They] have great restaurants in that building and on the rooftop is where Skyline Park is. So, you get an amazing view of the city.""
Just 15 minutes from Atlantic Station,Â Skyline Park includes a miniature golf course, a three-storey slide, and Heege Tower, which gives riders a 360-degree view of Bucktown, Midtown and downtown Atlanta.

In a past life, Atlanta's Beltline was a rail corridor that circled the city. Now, it's a pedestrian-friendly path where Burruss goes to soak up the sun. The star notes that it attracts people from all over the city, making it prime for people-watching. Its trails extend more than 11 miles and notable stops include the Atlanta Beltline Arboretum, The Beacon and Krog Street Market. Public art is on display, too, including rotating exhibitions of sculptures, murals and performances throughout the year.
""Especially when the weather is good,"" Burrus says. ""That's a fun time, because I like to just walk and people-watch. There's stops along the way where you can eat. In the summer, I like to ride my bike on the Beltline. I think that's kind of cool and fun.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250324-star-bathing-the-next-big-thing-in-travel,Finding calm in the cosmos: A new wellness trend,"From the Yorkshire Moors in England to the South African wilderness, star bathing is emerging as a transformative wellness trend â offering awe, calm and a cosmic reset.
I lie in an empty Victorian bathtub on heather moorland in the Yorkshire Moors in England's north. Above me, more and more stars appear as the sky slowly darkens from blue to violet to navy. Beside me, in her own bathtub, my star-bathing guide Gemma leads a meditation.
""Allow yourself to be awed by the incredible sky view that you're witnessing,"" she says softly. ""Appreciate that we are here, right now, on this beautiful evening. Focus gently on the skyâ¦ and your breath. Just be.""
I feel cold and self-conscious. I am trying to suspend the part of me that is deeply sceptical because I desperately want an escape from the anxiety that has plagued the past three years of my life. A search for relief has led me to wild swimming, drumming, yoga and now to star-bathing â an emerging wellness practice that is being offered in hotels and retreats around the world.
Star bathing is not about identifying constellations, it's about losing yourself in the night sky; and a growing body of research suggests that it can help calm the nervous system, increase happiness and foster a sense of perspective.
So here I am, wrapped in blankets, on a weekend of stargazing run by Broughton Sanctuary, a 16th-Century historic house and collection of cottages located at the foothills of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, a designated International Dark Sky Reserve. There is a strong focus on the healing power of nature here â the 3,000-acre grounds are home to one of the UK's largest rewilding projects â and star bathing is just one of many activities designed to bring guests closer to the natural world.
The meditation ends and silence falls on the moors, broken by the distant hoot of an owl. I look up, trying not to think about the stressful week I've had. As the sky continues to darken, new stars appear as though by magic. My breathing slows. Suddenly I feel something shift. I realise that I am not just looking up at the universe, I am part of the universe. It is impossible not to feel awed by the vastness and beauty of the night sky above me.
The psychological benefits of experiencing awe are well documented â it has been proven to lower heart rate, increase the presence of oxytocin and reduce inflammation â and it's one of the reasons that stargazing is so good for our mental health.
""Experiencing awe regularly is deeply beneficial for our mental wellbeing because it helps us to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves,"" says Mark Westmoquette, an astrophysicist and yoga and meditation teacher who runs mindful stargazing retreats across the UK and Europe. ""As we look up at the night sky and become aware of our place within it, that sense of wonder and awe can really shift our perspective around who and what we are.""
While the mental health benefits of being in nature are well documented, it's only recently that researchers have begun to study the effects of being in a nocturnal natural environment.
In February 2024, a new Night Sky Connectedness Index was published in theÂ Journal of Environmental Psychology. It showed that a greater connection to the night sky is positively related to a person's mental health and happiness. The Office of Astronomy for Development, a joint project of the International Astronomical Union and the South African National Research Foundation, is currently researching the potential of using astronomy as a tool to improve vulnerable people's mental wellbeing, with encouraging results.
At the end of our star-bathing session, Gemma, me and the other two participants drink hot chocolate and then make our way down the hillside. We can't take our eyes off the sky, which becomes more and more dazzling the longer we look at it.
The following night, after a day spent exploring the grounds, relaxing in the spa and wild swimming in a freezing cold former reservoir on the estate, I take part in a stargazing session that is part of the annual Dark Skies Festival. After eating a two-course vegetarian meal around a bonfire in the ""fire temple"" â a sheltered wooden structure set in pretty woodland â a group of about 20 of us walk to Broughton's kitchen garden where astronomer Chris Higgins is waiting with a powerful telescope.
Higgins talks us through various constellations and planets, and we take it in turns to look at them through the telescope. I am awestruck by the sight of Venus, which appears like a crescent moon, as well Jupiter with its four moons and its light and dark bands.
The group bonds quickly â our natural reserve seems to disappear as we ooh and aah at the cosmos. It's a freezing night, but no one wants to go inside. It feels like a gift â this clear, beautiful night â and we can't stop staring at the sky. After a while, I let go of trying to understand the science and just gaze up, letting the cool light of the stars calm me. I love the idea that while almost everything on our planet has changed since the beginning of humanity, the beauty of the night sky has remained the same. I am staring up at the same view my ancestors marvelled at, and there is something deeply grounding about that.
I am hooked. When I return home, I start searching for star-bathing retreats. At the top of my wish-list is luxury off-grid retreat centre Bliss & Stars, located two hours from the nearest village in South Africa's Cederberg Wilderness Area. Launched in 2019 by Daria and Heine Rasmussen, it offers three-night star-bathing retreats, featuring guided stargazing sessions, nature immersion, mindfulness, breathwork under the stars and night hikes.
Daria tells me that many visitors have profound experiences gazing at the night sky. ""One guest, numbed by years of trauma, experienced a breakthrough while observing Saturn's rings, describing it as 'awe as exorcism' that rebooted his capacity for joy,"" she says. ""Another guest, a grieving mother, found solace in our wilderness night ventures and naked-eye stargazing, saying: 'It felt like the universe was mourning with me.'""

Also high on my bucket list is Chile's Atacama Desert, which features the world's darkest, clearest skies. Elqui Domos Hotel has been designed specifically for appreciating these pristine night skies â it features geodesic rooms with retractable roofs to allow guests to look straight up from their bed. Hotel Ranga in Iceland, meanwhile, features a state-of-the-art observatory, and offers the chance to take part in mindful stargazing from outdoor hot tubs fed by geothermally heated water.
In the Scottish Highlands, Cairngorm Excursions runs star-bathing parties, bringing people together for a night of stargazing far from any light pollution, with hot drinks, traditional stovies (a Scottish dish made from meat and potatoes), blankets and log seating. This being Scotland, the evenings also feature a gin, whisky and rum sampling experience put on by a local distillery.
Aboriginal Australians are thought to be the world's first astronomers, and a growing number of experiences offer visitors a chance to learn about Indigenous astronomy. Aboriginal-owned Ngurrangga Tours offers an overnight trip in Western Australia's Millstream Chichester National Park with an evening of camping, exploring the wilderness and learning about Indigenous star stories. In Sydney, Fantasea Cruising offers an Aboriginal Sky Dreaming Cruise on the harbour, with an Aboriginal astronomer sharing stories of the Sun, Moon and stars that have been passed down by ancestors.
For now, I go out into my Bristol garden on clear nights and lie down on a blanket. The sky is nowhere near as dark as it was in Yorkshire, and light pollution obscures many of the stars, but I find that I can still slip into that now familiar sense of peace.
Perhaps it doesn't matter how many stars I can see. As Westmoquette says: ""Even if you can only see one star â that light's been travelling across the universe for hundreds and hundreds of years to hit your eyeball at that precise moment. Against all the odds, you're seeing that ray of light. That means something.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250324-the-european-nation-where-horses-roam-free,The European nation where horses roam free,"Once considered a nuisance, herds of semi-wild horses roaming the countryside in Bosnia-Herzegovina are now drawing tourists.
The rock-strewn valleys and rugged mountains of western Bosnia and Herzegovina conceal an elusive and extraordinary sight: herds of semi-wild horses roaming freely across the landscape.
Currently totalling around 1,000 horses, these herds wander the Cincar Mountains and other areas between the towns of Livno, whose stone-built homes and mosques at the base of Mount Krug are a testament to 400 years of Ottoman rule, and Kupres, the highest city in the country. They're Bosnian Mountain Horses, descendants of domesticated horses that were released into the wild due to various reasons, from war to industrialisation, and have since been saved from extinction.
""Horses like this were once the backbone of the agricultural industry here,"" BBC Travel Show host Rajan Datar said in a recent episode on the region. ""But once tractors and modern machinery arrived, many farmers set their horses free to fend for themselves in the wild.""
Because of their domesticated roots, the horses are less wary of humans than true wild horses, which has made them a draw for tourists but alsoÂ a source of tension. In winter, they can often be found licking salt from roads in the winter, becoming a danger both to drivers and themselves. They have also been known to raid local farms for food, destroying crops and stealing water from livestock. Many locals see them as a nuisance, and some farmers have even gone so far as to kill horses found on their land. A 2009 decision to protect the herds was rescinded in 2017 due to the overwhelming cost of the damage claims.
Yet, in recent years, attitudes have begun to shift. As tourism to the country has increased in the past two decades, so has visitor interest in the animals. Their nomadic nature means that local guides are necessary to view the horses, and a host of local tourism businesses have cropped up to meet this demand, creating a significant economic impact in this rural region.
Local community organisations, such as the Environmental Association of Borova Glava, have also stepped in to help care for the animals and mitigate conflicts. For volunteers like Zeljko Kristo, a spokesperson for the organisation, the horses also serve as a symbol of how the country has healed from the war, which raged from 1992 to 1995 following the breakup of Yugoslavia.
More like this:

â¢ Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers
â¢ Are you really helping when you join an 'expedition tour'?
""Besides humans, horses also found themselves in an awkward situation because [of the war],"" he explained. ""Looking back, years have passed, and we managed to save them â but at the same time, we saved ourselves.""
For travellers interested in seeing the horses, Livno is the best place to start. The animals are commonly found roaming the hills and valleys around this part of the country, but their movements can be unpredictable. To increase the chance of seeing them, it's highly recommended that visitors hire a guide, who will be more knowledgeable about the horses' movements and habits. Local tour companies also provide transportation from town to the more remote areas where the herds can be found. What's more, many of these businesses donate some of the proceeds from their tours to the care of the animals, ensuring they can continue to roam these wild landscapes for years to come.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250321-the-unexpected-origins-of-houstons-favourite-po-boy,The unexpected origins of Houston's iconic po' boy,"It's a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.
In 2007, I was a recent newcomer to Houston, a humid Texas city on the Gulf of Mexico that felt as foreign to me as if I had moved around the globe. Unsurprisingly, this incredibly diverse city was teeming with international culinary influences. There was Mexican food from across the border; fresh Vietnamese flavours brought by refugees in the 1970s; and New Orleans-style food from people who moved here after Hurricane Katrina. Middle Eastern food was everywhere too, from vast emporiums stocked with brined olives, tabbouleh and vats of hummus to street vendors serving freshly made kebabs. But Houston's most distinctive sandwich was something entirely different: a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.
A take on the popular New Orleans-style sandwich, its Texan cousin, the Houston po' boy is layered with sliced ham, salami, provolone cheese, mayo and spicy dill pickle slices, before being slathered in chow chow, a Southern relish made of cabbage, green tomatoes and hot peppers. But what sets the sandwich apart is its creator: Jalal Antone, the Louisiana-born, Texas-raised son of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants. His version of a chow chow recipe had a bold Middle Eastern influence, swapping out traditional mustard and celery seeds for paprika and turmeric, giving the relish a striking orange hue and a deeper, spiced complexity.
Antone dreamed of starting a Middle Eastern import store but was unsure of how it would be received by Houstonians at the time. In 1962, he finally opened Antone's Import Company on Taft Street, selling imported spices, olives, hummus, falafel and tabouli. At the time, most of Houston's half a million residents were unfamiliar with Middle Eastern food. To win them over, he devised a simple but effective solution: a sandwich.
""Houstonians were eating burgers in those days,"" explains Craig Lieberman, CEO of Antone's. ""The story is that he asked his friends 'How do I sell a product to Houstonians?' They said, 'Come up with a chow chow recipe and put that on your sandwich'.""
Antone sourced French bread from a local bakery, layered it with his imported meats and cheeses and added his signature spiced chow chow. The result? A sandwich that became a Houston staple.
By the late 1960s, Antone's had become a wild success, with people flocking there from far and wide. A postcard dating from Antone's early years describes the store as a ""tempting world of foreign foods"" while a 1965 Houston Chronicle article notes that the store was stocked with cheeses, olives, eels and even squid pickled in their own ink. But what kept people coming back were the sandwiches.
Restaurant critic Alison Cook remembers eating the affordable, filling Antone's Original sandwiches as a student at Rice University in 1966, describing the experience in a 2017 Houston Chronicle article. ""It was founded to cater primarily to the local Syrian and Lebanese community, but the po' boys made it a mecca for Houstonians of all stripes. To my impressionable 19-year-old brain, the rambling Antone's space was an exotic wonderland, chockablock with foodstuffs from the Middle East and beyond, festooned with sausages and crammed with cheeses I'd never heard of. In a city where steakhouses, seafood palaces and Italian American spots ruled the dining scene, Antone's pointed the way to a wider world.""
Through the 1970s and 80s, the Houston po' boy cemented itself as a local lunchtime staple, on par with tacos and barbecue. Antone's success sent a message to the owners of other local Middle Eastern restaurants that if you sold a Houston po' boy, you could also sell everything from baba ganoush to zaatar, and a new type of sandwich was born. Inspired by Antone's, imitators like Droubi's and Kojak's built empires of their own, each with their own take on the sandwich and a slightly different spin on the signature chow chow.
""Some of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants and kind of took on their own path based on a mix of their family recipes combined with what people in Houston wanted and were familiar with,"" says Houston-based food writer Megha McSwain. ""These were really adventurous flavours for people at the time. The story of how they moved forward by creating something unique is why they've lasted so long.""
Although Antone's original import store is long gone, the Houston po' boy lives on.Â Antone's Famous Po' BoysÂ still has two locations in Houston â one insideÂ The Galleria, the city's massive megamall, and another in theÂ HeightsÂ neighbourhood, where you can grab a sandwich alongside Lebanese tabouli and dolmas.

If you can't make it to a sandwich shop, Antone's po' boys are sold in grocery stores across Texas, includingÂ H-E-B,Â Randall's,Â Kroger, andÂ Brookshire Brothers. They're even stocked in hospital cafes and at Texan universities likeÂ BaylorÂ andÂ The University of Texas. If you're looking for a taste of Antone's at home, their proprietary chow chow can be bought by the jar at local supermarkets along with their pickles.
Though Houston's food scene continues to evolve, the po' boy remains a symbol of the city's culinary melting pot â a sandwich born from Middle Eastern ingenuity, shaped by Southern tradition and beloved by generations of Houstonians.
""I can't tell you how many Texans grew up on Antone's,"" says Lieberman. ""We still use the same bread from Royal Bakery and the same recipes that Jalal created; it's a very nostalgic and beloved Texas brand.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250319-the-cook-islands-paradise-that-doesnt-want-to-be-hawaii,The Pacific islands that don't want to be Hawaii,"The Cook Islands is proving that sustainable tourism isn't just possible â it's essential. Here's how this South Pacific nation is preserving their paradise for generations for come.
Landing on Rarotonga, the largest of the Cook Islands chain felt like stepping back in time. Gazing out of the taxi from Rarotonga airport to our resort, we were immediately struck by the absence of high-rise hotels, fast-food restaurants and corporate chains. There were no traffic lights, only coconut palms lining the road, the scent of salt and frangipani drifting through the air and the jungle meeting the ocean in a seamless panorama. It felt like Hawaii in the 1960s: uncrowded, laid-back and refreshingly authentic.
Our taxi driver pointed to a low-slung resort along the shoreline. ""No building can be higher than a coconut tree,"" she said. This isn't just a local tradition but a law set in 1965 by the Cook Islands' first premier, Albert Henry, to prevent overdevelopment. She explained that only Cook Islanders can own land, ensuring that large corporations don't dominate the landscape. We looked out onto hotels blending naturally into their surroundings and white-sand beaches ringed with long green parks, all free from litter and crowds.
We soon learned that this preservation of paradise is deeply intentional. Cook Islanders have made a conscious effort to ensure that Rarotonga never follows the path of overdevelopment seen in places like Honolulu. Instead, locals have committed to conservation, low-impact tourism and sustainable practices that benefit both locals and visitors. ""People come here because it is a paradise uncluttered by overdevelopment,"" explained Jeremy Goodwin, regenerative tourism manager for the Cook Islands Tourism Corporation (CITC). ""Our sacred duty as custodians of the land is to look after our paradise.""
The Cook Islands, an archipelago of 15 islands between New Zealand and Hawaii, has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1965. With a total population of 21,000, the islands are divided into two groups: the Southern Cook Islands, which includes the more accessible Rarotonga and Aitutaki, and the remote Northern Cook Islands, made up of low-lying coral atolls. Cook Islanders have their own MÄori language, with different dialects across the islands. And while tourism is a key industry, the islanders have ensured that sustainability remains at the nation's core.
""For hundreds of years, the protection of the Cook Islands relied on the traditionalÂ Ra'uiÂ System where access to a particular resource or area is forbidden for a given period,"" explained Karla Eggelton, CEO of CITC. ""The system aims to conserve food resources and protect ecological conditions in lagoons, reefs and other marine resources.""
This philosophy persists today â and extends beyond the sea. On the northern island of Pukapuka, for example, locals have practiced sustainable living for centuries, packing up their belongings and sailing by boat to another atoll within the lagoon for seasonal periods to prevent resource depletion. They fish and farm only what they need, maintaining a delicate balance with nature.
On arrival atÂ The Rarotongan Beach Resort and Lagoonarium, staff welcomed us with a warm ""Kia Orana"", a greeting that translates to ""may you live long"". It's a unique gesture of friendship from islanders renowned for their hospitality and warmth. The resort overlooks the Aroa Lagoonarium, a snorkelling haven and a sanctuary for butterflyfish, parrotfish and angelfish. Part natural lagoon and part enclosed habitat, it is designed to support marine conservation, serving both as a coral nursery and a protected area for marine life to flourish.
As the days passed, we saw how sustainability is woven into everyday life across the islands. At theÂ Muri Night Market, a popular outdoor dinner option, we watched vendors prepare island dishes likeÂ ika mataÂ (raw fish marinated in lime and coconut milk) andÂ rukau rukauÂ (taro leaves in coconut cream), all using local ingredients. We were struck by the market'sÂ Rent-a-PlateÂ project, where visitors can borrow reusable plates and cutlery instead of using disposable plastic. Cook Islanders also promote clean water initiatives. We purchased reusable bottles from the visitor's centre and refilled them at free UV-treated water stations around the island, a project led by the Te Ipukarea Society to minimise plastic waste.
Beyond sustainable dining, Cook Islanders have taken marine conservation to a global scale. In 2017, the country established theÂ Marae MoanaÂ Marine Park, making the 15 islands the world's largest multi-use marine protected area, covering 1.9 million square kilometres. The legislation also bans large-scale commercial fishing and seabed mining within 50 nautical miles of each island.
""Marae Moana is the idea of shared space, a new concept of creating a sanctuary and the conservation effort that allows for shared, sustainable activity,"" said Eggelton.
Also offering opportunities for sustainable tourism is Aitutaki, a bucolic island neighbouring Rarotonga that's known for its snow-white sand beaches, volcanic rock, coconut palms and crystal-clear lagoons. Here theÂ Pacific Resort AitutakiÂ has launched a coral restoration project where guests can take part by affixing coral fragments to underwater mesh tables, helping regenerate the reef.
""The project is an example of Mana Tiaki or island conservation,"" explains Goodwin. ""Mana Tiaki means guardianship with a sacred purpose."" He explained that culturally, for most Polynesians, the ocean is sacrosanct. ""The beaches bring tourists to this holiday destination, but they also connect Cook Islanders to the ocean.""
As the days passed, we explored the endless powdery white-sand beaches that ring Rarotonga, from Aroa Beach where fiery, colourful sunsets painted the sky with hues of vivid orange and crimson to serene and scenic Titikaveka Beach. They were all pristine and uncrowded, lined by palm trees, parkways and picnic tables. Most were unobstructed, with no commercial buildings to obstruct the view.

At Muri Beach, we opted for a sea turtle snorkelling tour. Our guide, Eric, explained the importance of turtles to the Cook Islands economically, environmentally and culturally. Daily tour operators earn an income by taking paying passengers to see these graceful, curious creatures. Plus, sea turtles are a key indicator of coastal ecosystem health, so monitoring and preservation are vital. Eric told us about a rescuer who found a turtle caught in a fishing net. Once freed, the Te Ara O Te Onu (Cook Island Sea Turtle Society) rehabilitated the turtle, as they have done dozens of times in the past. In addition to the society's efforts, visitors are encouraged to help track turtle movement through the Citizen Science Project by taking photos and sending them into the programme.
By the time our trip had come to an end, we better understood how Cook Islanders have created a blueprint for preserving paradise by blending ancient conservation methods with modern environmental initiatives. ""It's about leaving both the people and the place better off than you found it,"" said Eggelton.
Goodwin echoed the sentiment: This is our little paradise; if we all look after it, she will look after us.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250321-female-first-travel-the-ultimate-guide,How women are driving the future of travel,"With their growing financial resources, 82% of women control travel decisions, and from solo adventure holidays to multi-generational trips, female-first travel is on the rise.
Women today are on the move. More than 64% of the world's travellers are women, with 82% responsible for making a family's travel decisions, according to Skift Research's 2024 The Woman Traveler report. Not only that, but women are also travelling in more ways and to more places than ever before.
Solo female travel is particularly on the rise, with nearly 40% of women travellers planning a solo trip in 2025, according to Skift. This trend also increases with age, as 21% of female travellers aged 55 and up prefer solo travel versus travelling with a spouse or children.
""Solo travel as a woman feels like a quiet act of rebellion. It is a radical form of self-care, a bold claim to joy and a path to self-actualisation,"" said Lauran Peoples, a director at Richmond Region Tourism. ""Solo travel allows me to move through the world for no one's benefit but my own. Every time I return, I feel more capable than I give myself credit for. I come back cooler. I come back braver. I come back more in tune with who I truly am.""
With their growing financial resources, women are also discerning, choosing destinations with safety, freedom and welcoming cultures in mind. To aid that process, we pulled together some of the most popular ways women around the world are travelling today.
Google searches for ""solo female travel"" have increased 1,000% in the past decade, as women look to book more and more trips alone. But compared to men, women have slightly different concerns when planning holidays: safety and cultural attitudes continue to rank top of mind.
According to Solo Female Travellers â a company empowering women to travel solo â 66% of female travellers mark safety as their top concern; a figure unchanged since 2020.
The company's index of more than 200 countries (based on current US/UK advisories, the current Global Peace Index and a survey ranking how solo women travellers viewed their risk while travelling) finds a few places consistently topping the list, including Spain, Australia, the Nordic countries, Thailand, the UK, Singapore, New Zealand, Indonesia and Japan. Japan, which has one of the world's lowest crime rates, ranked number one for safety and stands out as a memorable destination for many solo female travellers.
""Japan was by far the easiest country I have ever traveled in solo,"" said Georgia Fowkes, a travel expert at Altezza Travel. ""I felt this peculiar but wonderful mix of excitement and utter ease when I arrived in Tokyo. Whether in Shinjuku's buzzing chaos or Kyoto's quiet corners, the streets felt unbelievably safe, even at night.""
She found particular ease in women-only train cars and female-focussed capsule hotels. ""It all adds up to a place where you can truly let your guard down and soak it all in,"" she said.
Fiona Spinks, who writes the blog Following Fiona, echoes the survey's finding about how female travellers feel welcome in New Zealand. ""Here, it wasn't just about the views (although they're unreal). What stood out most was the people and the way travel in New Zealand often became a real community experience,"" she says. ""When I hiked through the Abel Tasman track, total strangers ended up sharing stories and food. Kiwis love chatting, and you'll gain so much insight from local conversations.""
To help support other women-owned businesses on their solo adventures Wanderful, a leading women's travel community, recently launched a map highlighting city guides around the world with women-owned shops, cafes and hotels.
""Maybe it's the wine, but I laugh more when I travel with women,"" said Kimberlee Lauer, a New Orleans-based senior account executive who travels frequently with her female friends. ""We can be spontaneous and silly together, and we find joy in our shared travel experiences, even when they go awry. I have travelled with my significant others in the past, but I don't really enjoy travelling with men nearly as much as my girlfriends!""
Whether a girls' getaway or a ""solo-but-not-alone"" trip, group travel built exclusively for women is skyrocketing. Nearly 14% of women are planning a women-only trip in 2025, according to Solo Female Travellers. The survey also found that 36% of women travelled solo on a small group trip, with 8% joining a trip with girlfriends. Road Scholar saw its enrollment in senior-focused women-only tours double in recent years.
Megan Vila, Innovation Manager for TourAxis, recommends women seek out smaller groups and female-led guides. ""Smaller group tours create a more intimate experience and offer a great way to form friendships with other travellers,"" she said. She also recommends itineraries that combine guided activities with plenty of free time. ""Women value expert guidance but also enjoy exploring at their own pace.""
Cruises have emerged as a holiday popular for women, whether already in a group or looking to make new friends. Uniworld recently launched their first women's-only river cruise departing in August 2025 throughout France.
""Group tours provide something like a tasting menu of different places, so I can see a bit of each city and decide for myself which ones I may want to come back to in the future. I can travel alone, but I'm not actually by myself,"" explained New York resident and frequent group traveller Jessie Parker. ""Get to know the other people in your tour group. There's an instant connection in your choosing the same trip at the same time, so be open to connecting with them as well, not just the location.""
Natural Habitat Adventures also expanded its women-only itineraries by 75% in 2025, noting that 30% of travellers are women travelling solo. The small, women-led group tours cover destinations like Greenland, Alaska and Costa Rica, focusing on wildlife viewing and highlighting women's history in each destination. Adventure travel continues to be a female-majority space â with women comprising 57% of all adventure travellers.
While solo travel might have once conjured an image of a young, nomadic backpacker, The Woman Traveler Report by Skift recently busted that myth. Only 4% of adults aged 18-24 planned on embarking on solo trips, while nearly 25% of those aged 65 and above planned a similar journey.
According to the report's findings, as women reach retirement age, they look forward to travelling to enjoy freedom and flexibility, escape their routines and challenge themselves. According to a 2023 study by Road Scholar, 85% of the operator's solo travellers are women, and 69% of their overall travellers are women. Barring health or mobility issues, many baby boomer women also set their sights on ""bucket list"" travel.
""With retirement came the precious gift of time, a treasure to be cherished; immersing myself in the moments that fill my heart and nourish my spirit,"" said Venida Hudley, who solo travelled to 12 African countries in 11 months and chronicled her adventures at Venida Discovers Africa. ""My passion was innovation, so I looked for out-of-the-box volunteer opportunities that fed my spirit like volunteering with an innovative fashion designer in Gaborone, Botswana, and volunteering with a business that creatively improves the environment like Gjenge Makers in Nairobi, Kenya.""
A 2025 AARP report cited Europe as the most popular destination for international baby boomer travel, with Italy, Great Britain, France, Spain and Ireland in the top positions. At Scotland-based small-group tour company Rabbie's, seniors aged 60 and over receive discounted prices, and they've seen senior women most interested in ""set-jetting"", checking out the Downton Abbey Castle or Outlander filming locations in Scotland. ""The real-life history behind these famous locations is often just as captivating as the fictional storylines they have watched on screen,â says Rabbie's CEO Hazel Rickett. ""Take Doune Castle, for example. Known to Outlander fans as Castle Leoch, it has centuries of its own stories to tell. Some driver-guides were even extras in the series, so they offer first-hand insights.""
Another growing trend has been the emergence of cross-generational travel, driven in large part by millennials and Gen-Z parents who are including both their children and their own parents on their travels. According to American Express Travel's 2025 Global Travel Trends, 58% of millennials and Gen-Z parents plan to bring their extended family on trips in 2025, up from just more than 30% of Gen-X and baby boomers.
Female-focused tour operator Pink Girls Run the World sees a high percentage of its travellers embark as multigenerational trips. ""Plan experiences that can be shared across multiple generations, like afternoon teas,"" suggests founder Tashieka Brewer. ""Over Mother's Day weekend, we're planning a special multi-generational weekend in Bristol, Virginia and we're planning for a unique wine tasting experience at a local vineyard.""
Stephanie Webb of Seesight Tours echoes the sentiment. ""Some of my most meaningful trips have been with family. I took my mom to Italy, where she finally got to see the Amalfi Coast after dreaming about it for years,"" she said. ""Travelling across generations teaches you patience and appreciation. It's about slowing down, choosing activities that suit everyone's energy levels, and focusing on shared experiences rather than just checking off a bucket list. These trips remind me that travel isn't just about the places we see, but the moments we create together.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250319-the-un-declared-2025-as-the-year-of-glacier-preservation-visit-one-safely,How to visit a glacier without harming it,"With glaciers disappearing at an alarming rate, 2025 has been named the Year of International Glacier Preservation. Here's how and where to see one responsibly before it's too late.
On an exceptionally warm July day in 2022, certified mountain guide Andrea Milani took a lunch break from rock climbing near the Italian Dolomites' Passo Fedaia ascent. As he ate pizza with two friends, helicopters circled and ambulance sirens wailed in the distance. A massive chunk (80m wide and 25m high) had just broken off nearby Marmolada glacier, triggering an avalanche of ice, snow and debris. Milani's two friends who'd finished that descent just hours before meeting him were the lucky ones: 11 climbers tragically died that day.
""Now more than ever, climate change is making glacier travel more dangerous. Rising temperatures mean the snow covering crevasses and seracs becomes less reliable, increasing the risk of hidden hazards,"" says Milani, who guides climbers, skiers, bikers and hikers of all levels safely across Northern Italy with Dolomite Mountains tours.
The reality is that one-third of glaciers could disappear from climate change by 2050 â and for Marmolada, it's 2040. This is why the United Nations has declared 2025 the International Year of Glaciers' Preservation. It has also set 21 March 2025 as the first annual World Day for Glaciers in partnership with Unesco and the World Meteorological Organization. The initiatives aim to mobilise governments and organisations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and implement climate adaptation strategies to protect the planet's 200,000 glaciers as the Earth warms faster than ever before.
""Worldwide, human-caused climate change has melted so much ice from glaciers that the meltwater has raised global sea level 8cm since 1900,"" says Patrick Gonzalez, former principal climate change scientist for the US National Park Service and assistant director for climate and biodiversity of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
Sadly, scenes like the one at Marmolada have played out across the planet time and again. Over the past two decades, Bolivia's 18,000-year-old Chacaltaya glacier, once the world's highest ski resort, has melted completely. Italy and Switzerland were forced to redraw their shared borders last autumn due to the melt of the Matterhorn in Zermatt. And at Muir Glacier in Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park, climate change has melted away a layer of ice as tall as New York's One World Trade Center.
These slow-moving, fast-retreating dense masses of ice, snow and rock that have accumulated in the mountains over centuries on every continent except Australia are glaring evidence that man-made climate change exists. If all glaciers were to melt today, sea level would increase by a half a metre, leaving entire cities underwater, devastating ecosystems and depriving two billion people of drinking water.
But travellers can still visit glaciers like Marmolada safely â they just need to know how. In fact, research has shown that seeing a glacier in nature can prompt us to protect the planet. Glaciers are now a symbol of its fragility, reminding us how, through simple cost-effective solutions like walking, biking and purchasing solar and wind energy, we can help limit global warming.
While 91% of glaciers are in Antarctica, many can be found in more accessible parts of the world, so go visit one; it's easier than ever, just make sure you proceed with caution.
Mountaineers, skiers and nature lovers from all over the world flock to the Canadian Rockies for irresistible high alpine terrain, and that includes the Columbia Icefields. Straddling the majestic Banff and Jasper national parks on the Continental Divide, it's all that's left of an ice mass that once enveloped most of western Canada's mountains. Ride the Ice Explorer to the Athabasca Glacier to walk the glass-floored Columbia Icefield Skywalk with sweeping views over the waterfalls coming from the Sunwapta Valley's glacier and the famous mountain goats of Glacier Lookout along the cliffs.
If you are bold enough to climb the glacier, go with an experienced Yamnuska Mountain Adventures guide. You'll learn about glacier dynamics, route finding and risk management on one of the largest icefields in North America. It's an adventure that demands respect and preparation, says Yamnuska mountain guide Jesse de Montigny.
""The primary danger is crevasses â deep, often hidden cracks in the ice that can be difficult to detect, especially when covered by snow,"" says de Montigny. ""Weather conditions can change rapidly, creating whiteout conditions that make navigation difficult. Proper rope systems, glacier travel techniques and crevasse rescue knowledge are essential for mitigating risk in these environments.""
Mendenhall is one of more than 100,000 glaciers in what's appropriately called the ""Glacier State"". Inside the Tongass National Forest, 19km from Juneau along the Alaska-Canada border in south-eastern Alaska, is the Juneau Icefield. It's also one of Alaska's only glaciers that can be reached for viewing by car or shuttle; start your adventure at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center.

â¢ Antarctic tourism: Should we just say no?
Since it has been melting excessively in recent years,Â rather than joiningÂ a helicopter tourÂ (a major source of carbon emissions),Â get aÂ goodÂ look at the face ofÂ glacier on a kayak tour withÂ Mendenhall Lake Kayaking Adventure. (The glacier's ice caves are no longer safely accessible.)
Note: As of 13 March, the majority of the glacier's Forest Service park rangers and staff were laid off due to federal cuts, despite the tourist season commencing in April. Meanwhile the Juneau Icefield is melting five times faster than it was in the 1980s.
It's worth overcoming your fear of heights for the ""Queen of the Dolomites"", located within Northern Italy's 12 interconnected Dolomiti Superski resorts. Take the cable car up, and whether you ride back down or ski the glacier, make a stop at Europe's highest museum to learn about World War One tunnels dug by Austro-Hungarian soldiers who lived there for months in their glacier ""Ice City"".
If you decide to brave mountaineering or climbing, be sure to hire a guide. Miliani always tells his Dolomite Mountains tour groups to stay aware and read the environment. ""Glacier mountaineering isn't just about skill; it's about preparation, experience and respect for the environment, he says. His advice? Distance yourself from the next climber (by 8-12m) moving along the rope at a steady pace and avoid sudden movements that could throw off your balance. Check the map and the weather (the colder the better), and most importantly, the avalanche forecast. Wear the right gear, pack a self-rescue kit, GPS, compass, altimeter and radio or satellite phone. And don't leave home without taking a first-aid course.
""Crevasses can be sneaky, hiding under thin layers of snow, so knowing how to spot and test them is crucial,"" he adds. ""If you're crossing a snow bridge [an arc formed by snow across a crevasse] make sure it's stable before stepping onto it. And let's not forget seracs and avalanche zones â don't hang around under them longer than necessary.""
It's just got easier to visit Chamonix's Mer de Glace (also known as Montenvers), only second in size in the Alps to Switzerland's Aletsch Glacier. This iridescent ice aqua glacier â transmitting a blue wavelength and absorbing all the other colours â has become harder to view after losing 6m of thickness a year.
Since last year, though, visitors' can now see Mer de Glace via a new gondola from a 1,913m-high panoramic platform. There's an on-site restaurant, coffee shop, museum and even an ice cave that visitors can still walk through â originally cut into the glacier in 1992 by high mountain guides and now re-dug every summer because, like icebergs, glaciers are always moving, more than ever now. Access the gondola by taking the train up the mountain from Chamonix town centre.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240330-a-local-experts-guide-to-seeing-the-most-beautiful-tulips-in-the-netherlands,Where to see spring tulips in the Netherlands,"Nienke Panis-Ringersma has made a career out of following the region's famous blooms. Here are her favourite ways to experience the season, from road trips to bulb picking.
Few images are as indelible as the sight of candy-coloured tulips bursting through the dark winter ground. But in the Netherlands â the world's largest exporter of the magical bloom â venerating tulips is a way of life. In the weeks leading from icy winter to spring, rows of flowers stud the country's landscape in technicolour streaks, most famously in the Bollenstreek ""Bulb Region"", stretching between the towns of Haarlem and Leiden, arching towards the North Sea. And with tulips come tourists; eager to experience the blooms for themselves.
We spoke to Nienke Panis-Ringersma, the lens behind the popular Dutch-based tulip photography blog, Tulips in Holland, to find the best tulip bloom experiences in the Netherlands. ""People in the Netherlands are very down to earth,"" says Panis-Ringersma, whose images and tulip facts receive thousands of likes per month on Facebook. ""They are quite used to the flower fields. You know when it's tourist season, because the roads are clogged with people on a bike who are not used to riding bikes.""
Nonetheless, Panis-Ringersma adores her nation's iconic bulb flower â enough to have made it her career. ""I think it's the excitement,"" she says. ""It starts around December when we can buy tulips in the florist shops. And around the third weekend of January, we celebrate National Tulip Day. Around 300,000 tulips are placed on the museum square in Amsterdam with a beautiful backdrop of the Rijksmuseum or the Van Gogh Museum. It's the start of many tulip festivals leading up to the start of spring. It's a magical place and I love the flower, the fragrance. Every tulip is unique. There is a great story to tell.""
Here are Nienke Panis-Ringersma's favourite ways to experience tulip season in the Netherlands.
1. Best overall: Keukenhof
""So, you ask for absolutely number one place? Visit Keukenhof,"" says Panis-Ringersma.
Established in 1949, Keukenhof Gardens is undoubtedly the most popular tulip experience in the Netherlands; its lushly landscaped ""inspirational"" tulip gardens and windmills drawing over a million visitors each year during its eight-week season. ""Around 7 million bulbs are planted by hands, not by machine, every year,"" says Panis-Ringersma, whose budding love for tulips was ignited by childhood visits to Keukenhof, where her grandfather volunteered as a ticket taker. ""It's the most beautiful spring garden in the world.""

Visitors enjoy a wide variety of experiences at Keukenhof including picnics, flower exhibitions and didactic ""whisper boat"" cruises through the gardens, where contemporary art sculptures dot the grounds. But plan ahead; Keukenhof is open for just two months, usually from the first day of Spring to the first week of May, depending on the weather (in 2025, 20 March to 11 May). ""The best time to go is the $1m question,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""It's different every yearâ¦ right now we have an extremely warm winter. I think the best time to visit for this year is around the middle of April.""
Website: https://keukenhof.nl/en/
Address: Stationsweg 166A 2161 AM Lisse

Instagram: @visitkeukenhof
2. Best cultural experience: Catching the Bloemencorso Flower Parade
To truly get swept up in the excitement of tulip season, be sure to catch the Bloemencorso Flower Parade.
""A flower parade is a very festive flower festival,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""It's about 20 different floats, marching bands, cars very lavishly decorated with all kinds of flowers, people enjoying themselves, street entertainmentâ¦ every town is a very festive atmosphere.""
The Bloemencorso parade takes place each year on the third Saturday of April, marching along the road from Noordwijk to Haarlem, through the Bollenstreek and past Keukenhof. ""It's a full day,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""People line up at least three four lines thick to see. Some people get their seats ready at least three hours before the parade to make sureâ¦ it's like a Disney parade. People are sitting down on the streets waiting for the parade to pass by.""
Panis-Ringersma's tip: watch from Noordwijk. ""Lots of people try to see the parade around Keukenhof because it passes the gardens,"" she says. ""But that's an extremely busy spot. Go to Noordwijk early in the morning. It's a beautiful seaside town.""
While waiting for the parade, feast on Dutch Stroopwafel cookies, or have lunch at Panis-Ringersma's casual Dutch dining pick, Hudson Restaurant. ""It's a very festive day,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""Every town is having markets â¦ it's an absolute must-see for people traveling to the Netherlands.""

3. Best interactive experience: Visiting a tulip farm
For those who aren't satisfied merely admiring the blooms from afar, Panis-Ringersma suggests visiting a tulip farm. ""Because everybody really wants to go into the fields, which is not allowed,"" she says. ""So, please go to a tulip farm where it is allowed!""
Panis-Ringersma's three farm recommendations are all found in the heart of the Bollenstreek. ""All three are founded by bulb growers,"" she says. ""So, they know absolutely what they are doing. They're all a very hands-on experience.""
The family-run Tulip Experience in Noordwijkerhout is Panis-Ringersma's first pick; home to nearly 1 million tulips. ""You can go to the field where you can see at least 700 different types of tulips,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""You can visit the tulip market with all kinds of products made of tulips or with tulips on it. You can pick your own tulips. It's a very fun experience."" What sort of tulip products? ""Beer with tulips, tulip vodka, tulip Aperol Spritz, soap smelling of tulips, vases, napkins with tulips, wallets with tulips,"" she says. ""If you can name it, everything with tulips.""
Alternatively, visit Tulip Barn in Hillegom just 30 minutes outside of Amsterdam, where visitors can immerse themselves in the 750,000 tulips sprawling across the farm's gardens and production field. ""They are more focused on making Instagrammable photos,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""So, for a bit younger target audience.""
Heading further south, Panis-Ringersma also likes De Tulperij in Voorhout. ""You can go together with the bulb grower,"" she says. ""You're walking into the fields. He will dig up some tulip bulbs and will show you how they are growing and what they are doing each year to make them grow. It's a very interesting environment.""

4. Best for kids: Tulip picking
For visitors with antsy kids (and a car), Panis-Ringersma loves tulip picking in the Bollenstreek. ""Not in the regular fields where you can say as you're walking, 'Oh, I like this one!'"" she says. ""No, just go to a to a picking farm and pick your own tulips.""
There are several picking farms in the Bollenstreek area, but Panis-Ringersma recommends heading to Annemieke's Pluktuin, a tulip nursery in Hillegom run by husband-and-wife team, Annemieke and Pieter. ""Pluktuin is literally 'picking garden',"" explains Panis-Ringersma. ""Tulip picking is an absolutely brilliant experience, especially when you go with children to walk into the field and get the tulip with the bulb and you can take the bulb and the tulip with you back home or to the hotel.""

5. Best for tulip aficionados: Hortus Bulborum
For Panis-Ringersma, whose passion for tulip photography led her to become an expert in tulip horticulture, the Hortus Bulborum historical bulb garden in Limmen is a sacred institute of learning.
""It's like a living museum,"" she says. ""Tulips entered the Netherlands around the 16th Century. And people loved them from the very beginning. And right now, there is one place in the Netherlands that keep the bulbs alive from the 16th Century and later on. So, this is a place where you can visit and find the oldest bulbs of the Netherlands still blooming.""
The Hortus Bulborum houses more than 4,500 varieties of historical spring bulbous plants, from tulips to daffodils to hyacinths, which are rarely cultivated in modern day. The garden's star bulbs include a specimen of Fritillaria Persica, dating to 1557, and the ancient 16th-Century tulip Duc van Tol Red and Yellow.
""So, you can visit and it's a very small garden,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""They have great apple pie! So absolutely visit and drink some coffee with apple pie over there and have a look at all the different kinds of flowers.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250314-visiting-antarctica-or-the-arctic-heres-how-to-minimise-your-impact,The ethics of visiting the ends of the Earth,"As polar tourism surges, experts warn of its environmental impact. From transport choices to local food, here's how to visit responsibly while protecting fragile ecosystems.
I first learned of Greenland's existence from a world map pinned on my childhood bedroom wall. Decades later, I finally made it to the capital, Nuuk. I'd long been fascinated by pictures of the brightly coloured wooden houses lining its rocky shores â red, yellow, green and blue against an icy backdrop. Small icebergs floated just offshore and the absence of trees gave a stark, otherworldly feel. I looked forward to experiencing the crisp, biting air, exploring Inuit art at the Nuuk Kunstmuseum and maybe, if I was lucky, spotting some seals or a passing whale.
I'm not the only one entranced by Greenland's icy beauty: between 2018-2023, tourism to the country grew by 46%, with 131,767 visitors arriving in 2023. Much of this surge is due to the increasing number of cruise ships navigating Arctic waters.
According to the Arctic Council, ships entering the Arctic Polar Code area Â â a regulated maritime zone around the North Pole â increased by 37% between 2013 and 2024. Many cruise operators, like Hurtigruten, Swan Hellenic and Ponant, offer routes encompassing Iceland, Svalbard and Greenland, with the latter expecting visitor numbers to keep growing thanks to a 2024 airport expansion in Nuuk and two more international airports set to be built by 2026.
Meanwhile on the opposite side of the planet, Antarctica is seeing a similar tourism boom. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reports a steady rise in visitors since the 1990s. In the 2022-23 season, 104,897 people visited the continent, rising to 124,262 last year. More than 80,000 of those set foot on Antarctic land âÂ an alarming statistic for conservationists who warn that human presence can disrupt fragile ecosystems, alter animal behaviour and unwittingly bring invasive foreign organisms with them.
As tourism to the poles increases, organisations like the Arctic Council, the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO) and Visit Greenland stress the urgent need to balance economic benefits with environmental responsibility. The lure of the polar regions is undeniable: the near lunar landscapes; the intensity of the blue sky on a freezing, sunny day; the thrill of fresh snow crunching underfoot; and the unique wildlife that calls these places home.
James Grecian, a marine ecologist at Durham University, UK, and scientist-in-residence at climate advocacy nonprofit Arctic Basecamp, has spent years studying polar wildlife. Last year, he was in Antarctica studying snow petrels âÂ or more specifically, their vomit.
Snow petrels' stomach oil deposits freeze into solid lumps that contain, when analysed in a lab, data on how their diet has changed over the years, and in turn, what that means about the local ecosystem. ""We can tell a lot about past conditions by taking samples from the environment, or from animals,"" Grecian explains. ""For example, the baleen plates of whales can be taken from dead animals, and the chemical signatures will tell you something about the environmental conditions or what the animal was eating.""
As a fairly frequent polar visitor, he understands the appeal of these environments â and also the impact. He notes there are choices we can make to reduce the damage to these vital but threatened regions. Polar tourism is showing no signs of slowing down, but Grecian hopes that, with increased awareness of its drawbacks, visitors can make the most ethical choices possible. Here are his suggestions on how to do that.
First of all, you'll need to weigh up your travel options to reach the polar region of your choice.
The problem with a cruise ship is that you're bringing the hotel and all the services with you,"" he says. ""I've heard stories of towns being quite unhappy about the disruption when lots of people disembark. They get all their meals catered on the ship so they won't go to the local cafes. Contrast that to planes â if you fly into an area, you're going to be staying in local hotels, you're going to be using local tour operators. The communities have a chance to benefit economically. But you need to offset that against the massive carbon emissions of planes.""
While ships may seem a greener alternative to flying, global data suggests otherwise. Aviation accounts for 2.5% of CO2 emissions globally, while shipping contributes slightly more at 3% (although most of that is from cargo ships). There's also the noise pollution issue âÂ the hum of ships' engines has been shownÂ to disrupt whales' echolocation ability.
""There's a horrible video â an animation based on real blue whale migration tracking, and it's a blue whale caught in shipping lanes,"" says Grecian. ""It's like a pinball in a machine; it keeps turning around and turning back because of the amount of noise that the ships produce.""
So what's the alternative?
""Using trains is about a 90% or 95% reduction in CO2, so from a climate perspective, a train to Norway for the fjords is a better option."" It is possible âÂ but takes much longer âÂ to reach parts of the Arctic by train, even if flights are required for some of the journey. There's direct trains to Narvik in the Norwegian Arctic from Stockholm; from Trondheim to BodÃ¸ in Norway or from Helsinki to Rovaniemi in the north of Finland.
Or you could âÂ if you have the money âÂ charter a small sailing boat. ""I know people in the Falklands who sail to Antarctica fairly regularly,"" says Grecian. ""The cost of [a private charter] probably wouldn't be far off the cost of a berth on a fancy cruise ship.""
Polar wildlife is a big draw for visitors, but Grecian cautions against disturbing the very animals people come to see.
""You must be appreciative of being a guest in that environment and try to treat it with as much respect as you can,"" says Grecian. ""There can be a tendency these days to try and get selfies with animals and that can cause a lot of disturbance. They're not used to seeing people, so give them space. You shouldn't be trying to chase them down.""
More like this:
â¢Â Will you be going on holiday toâ¦ Greenland next year?
â¢Â Antarctic tourism: Should we just say no?
â¢Â Could airships be the next cruise ships?
Grecian recommends patience. ""If you sit quietly, some animals are quite curious. I haven't seen penguins in Antarctica but I have in the Falklands, and they came within 3-4m (10-13ft). So if you're quiet and still, you might get a visitor.""
Local guides can also provide essential knowledge â plus Grecian says that sometimes it's about noticing the small things. ""Some people say you should always look up, but if you look down, you can see signs of animals. You might see footprints in the mud, or scat that will give you a suggestion of what animals might have passed through.""
That might sound drastic, but if you're visiting on land rather than on a cruise, there is a good reason to eat local products. Transporting supplies to these remote areas carries a significant carbon footprint â globally, food production contributes three billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually.
In Greenland and parts of Arctic Canada, many Inuit communities stillÂ subsistence hunt. Their hunting rights are legally protected in Canada and in Greenland, and are regulated to prevent over-hunting. ""The rights of the Indigenous population to pursue traditional hunting practices is enshrined in law,"" says Grecian. ""The meat of a ring seal or a harp seal in Greenland will have a much lower carbon footprint than imported meat or non-native crops.""
Of course, your personal comfort levels at the idea of eating seal meat are yours to decide, but bear in mind that if you're visiting a majority-Inuit region like Greenland, the alternatives are limited and local meat is the more environmentally-friendly option âÂ a study comparing the carbon footprint of imported meat and local seal in Greenland found seal had the lowest footprint compared to pork and poultry.
For the intrepid travellers planning on camping or venturing off the beaten track, it's vital to have the right gear âÂ and not just the obvious things like base layers, shoe spikes and waterproofs.
""If you're going somewhere particularly cold or out camping in more remote parts, you can hire gear in the country,"" says Grecian. Not only will it make your suitcase lighter; it'll benefit the local economy.""
But when it comes to packing for your visit, Grecian offers tips on some practical but often forgotten items. ""Nasal spray,"" he says. ""Cold environments tend to be dry, so the inside of your nose can dry out and can bleed."" And don't underestimate the strength of polar Sun â Grecian recommends taking factor 50 sunscreen. If you're camping or in other basic, remote accommodation, you might want some creature comforts, too: ""On an expedition, coffee is vital for me. On my last trip I took a moka pot and a French press!""
Grecian laughs when I tell him that, on my visit to Greenland, I didn't see a single whale. I went in October âÂ the start of winter, just as humpback whales begin their migration to the Caribbean.
""If there's a specific activity or animal you want, look up their migration patterns,"" he says. And if it's a natural phenomenon, check when it occurs. ""For instance, a lot of people go to Newfoundland in May or June [to see] grass and flowers against the backdrop of icebergs. If you want to see that you have to go at that specific time of year.""
His advice underscores a broader idea: polar travel should be guided by what's best for the natural world, not just what looks good on social media.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250314-a-second-chance-for-maltas-paradise-island-comino,A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth',"The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.
Sitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.
With more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page, Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.
""It's wonderful at this time of year,"" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. ""But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. Itâs hell on Earth.""
Luring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Cominoâs Blue Lagoon is a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.
In the December to February low season, the bayâs waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.
Backhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. ""I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.""
He's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a ""scam"". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.
In response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds, protesting what they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.
More like this:
â¢Â  Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?
â¢Â  The summer that tourism fell apart
â¢Â  Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers
The isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.
""It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,"" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. ""Many people just want to go straight there.""
But change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap â reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 4,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.
""Limiting numbers is a good start,"" he says. ""But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.""
Comino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations to combat overtourism. Venice has introduced entry fees for day-trippers, while Athens has capped daily visitor numbers to the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.
Seasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. ""They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,"" she says. ""Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.""
With the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. ""With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,"" Gatt reflects.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250314-murren-the-stunning-car-free-village-reached-by-cable-car,A stunning car-free village reached by cable car,"Throughout history, this medieval hamlet has remained relatively secluded from the outside world. But now, the world's steepest cable car whisks travellers to the 430-person village.
On a freezing day in December 2024, I took a scenic three-hour train ride from Geneva to Lauterbrunnen, an Alpine village nestled betweenÂ InterlakenÂ and the Jungfrau massifÂ in central Switzerland. I was now at the gateway to the car-free mountain hamletof MÃ¼rren.
For most of MÃ¼rren's history, residents would lead their mules three hours down to gather essential supplies in the valley before trekking back up. Then in 1891, a narrow-gauge railway opened, connecting MÃ¼rren to the nearby mountain village of GrÃ¼tschalp and a funicular that reached Lauterbrunnen. In 1965, a single-track cableway opened that could ferry residents down to another traffic-free village, Gimmelwald, above the valley.
But the day I arrived, this formerly secluded 430-person hamlet perched 1638m in the Bernese Oberland became directly connected with the outside world and valley below through the opening of the world's steepest cable car: the Schilthornbahn, which whisks travellers 775m up through some of the Swiss Alps' most jaw-dropping scenery in just four minutes.
After arriving at the Stechelberg car park, I was soon being hoisted from the valley floor up in a glass-enclosed cabin, staring down towards the storybook cottages below and surrounded by craggy mountains and snow-covered pines. The trip up the vertical MÃ¼rrenfluh rockface was so smooth that I barely noticed the 159.4% gradient (the world's previous steepest cable car, the Loen Skylift in Norway, rises 133%), until my ears started to pop.
Perched on a natural terrace at the foot of the Schilthorn summit (2970m) overlooking the Lauterbrunnen valley, MÃ¼rren is a 13th-Century village with traditional stone and timber cottages that looks like it's clinging to the edge of a cliff. Because of its unique position, engineers have never been able to connect it to the outside world by road.
""Taking the cable car to school might seem unusual to many, but it was an everyday ritual for me,"" said MÃ¼rren native Michael Abegglen. ""Most everyday necessities and services are available in MÃ¼rren, but every time we need a doctor, hairdresser or dentist, we need to go down to the valley where many of us have our cars parked.""
According to Abegglen, the village's few year-round residents have long relied on one another. ""When you grow up here like I did, you know almost everyone, and there's a strong close-knit community,"" Abegglen adds. ""Some guests are like locals, as they return to MÃ¼rren every single year.""
After checking into the Hotel Alpenruh, and admiring the awe-inspiring, 360-degree views of the Eiger, MÃ¶nch and Jungfrau peaks from my balcony, I soon discovered that â unsurprisingly â this pocket-sized, car-free village is best explored on foot.
MÃ¼rren's few streets are lined with cosy inns; rustic restaurants serving Alpine cheeses and dry sausages; bars offering evening aperitifs; and quaint souvenir shops selling postcards, fine Swiss chocolates, cuckoo clocks and cowbells. One of MÃ¼rren's main landmarks is the Hotel MÃ¼rren Palace, built in 1874 and nicknamed ""Switzerland's first palace"" after its history of hosting celebrity skiers and Hollywood actors like Rita Hayworth. Oozing elegance and grandeur, its ballroom served as a meeting point for high society back in the 20th Century. As the snow fell, I popped into the pub at the Eiger Guesthouse to warm up over a mug of glÃ¼hwein (traditional mulled wine).
Despite its diminutive size, MÃ¼rren is a major winter sports hub. This former sleepy Walser settlement transformed in the late 1800s when British skiers discovered the village and fell in love with its scenery (and slopes).
""My great-grandfather Henry Lunn first came to MÃ¼rren in the 1890s and was smitten by its breathtaking beauty,"" said Bernard Lunn, a self-proclaimed ""ski bum"" and village resident. ""He soon started bringing British tourists here to witness the glorious 'triumvirate' of [the] Eiger, MÃ¶nch and Jungfrau peaks. Later, my mountaineer grandfather Arnold Lunn and his wife Mabel started living here, and in 1922, Arnold founded the [world's] first slalom ski races. Mabel and a group of British Women established the Ladies' Ski Club here as well.""
Arnold's arrival also paved the way for the formation of the Kandahar Ski Club in 1924 and the inauguration of the country's first ski school in MÃ¼rren in 1930.A year later, the first Alpine World Ski Championships kicked off in this tiny town in February 1931.
Nearly a century later, the surrounding mountains are laced with 54km of fresh, powdery pistes connected through cable cars, funiculars and chairlifts. When snow conditions allow, you can ski 16km from the Schilthorn summit to the valley floor in Lauterbrunnen.
""A coffee at the peak and a trip down on skis with family and friends is how I love spending my winter days in MÃ¼rren,"" said Alan Ramsay, a sociable Scot who has called the village home for more than 25 years and helps organise the International Inferno, theÂ world's biggest amateur ski race held in the town annually (21-24 January 2026).
But locals say there's more to MÃ¼rren than just skiing. From June through September, the area becomes a popular paragliding destination, offering magnificent birds-eye views over the region's soaring crags, turquoise lakes and more than 70 cascadingwaterfalls.You can also stroll the flower-studded trails and meadows dotted with grazing sheep.
""The mountains are an ever-changing canvas,"" said Belinda BÃ¼hler, an avid trail runner who has lived her whole life in MÃ¼rren. ""In the winter, they wear a beautiful white coat. In the summer, the mood changes depending on whether we are having hot, rainy or foggy days. However, as winter slowly departs, you can already smell the scent of spring. As the earth starts to warm up, you see early summer blossoms and soon there are flower-filled meadows.""
BÃ¼hler's main advice for those coming outside of ski season? ""Get out into nature onto the trails. You don't have to walk too far but as soon as you're on a trail, you're alone and can savour the stillness and beauty most palpably. The air is so pure and clean. I have grown up in Murren but I always call myself a local tourist, as I still tend to stop and take photos during my hikes. What I feel, see and hear on the trails in MÃ¼rren is indescribable!""
Bernard's wife, Julia Lunn, who leads families and women on hikes in Murren added, ""People don't come here to shop or sightsee, but to experience life through skiing, snowshoeing, hiking, or simple pleasures like taking in the unrivalled views in solitude and dipping into the streams or the unspoiled Grauseeli lake.""
At Ramsay's advice, I decided to experience one of those simple pleasures for myself. After grabbing a wooden sledge from the local Intersport rental shop, I took the funicular up to the Allmendhubel mountain station (the starting point of the infamous 3km Bob Chase featured in the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majestyâs Secret Service). After a few quick practice runs, I whisked down the soft, powdery slopes of the Blumental Valley, peppered with pines and chalet-like holiday homes with a sense of wonder and a child-like grin plastered across my face.
""When growing up in MÃ¼rren as a child, I didn't realise how lucky I was because I took [this] all for granted,"" said BÃ¼hler. ""As a teenager, I even found the village too small and limiting. However, after I travelled around a bit and returned to Murren, I fell in love with it all over again, especially with the sense of freedom it gave me. Today, I often feel speechless when I wake up here and find it hard to describe MÃ¼rren, because no words seem to do its beauty justice. It is a place that needs to be experienced and felt.""
Even after just a two-day visit, I think I know what she means.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250313-lithuanias-fermented-drink-to-ward-off-a-cold,Lithuania's fermented drink to ward off a cold,"Sweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic â and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.
When Tadas EidukeviÄius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, EidukeviÄiusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.
""I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things â it was a no brainer,"" says EidukeviÄius. ""The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.""
While EidukeviÄius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity â particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce â in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.
Dating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.
""Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,"" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. ""Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria â meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.""
A traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.
""When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick â consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,"" explained Ieva Å idlaitÄ, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally FermentedÂ who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. ""In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,"" she added. ""Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.""
Josas agrees. ""Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus â like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,"" he says.
The early '80s is what Josas describes as ""the golden age of gira"" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.
""Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,"" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been ""hyped"" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.
One of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.
More like this:

â¢Â The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world
â¢Â A restorative soup made for cold season
""We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,"" says JogailÄ ÄojÅ«tÄ, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. ""For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.""
""In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,"" she continues, ""while export sales volume grew by 47%.""
Globally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.
In Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nationâs capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.
While some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. ""It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,"" says ÄojÅ«tÄ.
Instead, EidukeviÄius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.
""Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,"" EidukeviÄius adds. ""There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.""
So, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. ""Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,"" says EidukeviÄius.""It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250312-om-ali-an-unforgettable-sweet-with-a-sinister-history,A beloved dessert linked to a brutal legend,"As millions of people break their Ramadan fast, many believers around the world reach for a wildly popular dish tied to an unbelievable legend.
On a hot and sultry August evening in 2011, I sat at a table in my favourite restaurant in Kuwait City, facing the calm waters of the Persian Gulf, waiting for my iftar platter to arrive. The elaborate meal â consisting of fresh juices, stuffed dates, vegetable samosas, lamb pilaf, shish tawook (a marinated chicken kebab), local bread, coffee and desserts â was delicious.
Yet, what still lingers on my tongue and in my mind more than a decade later isn't the delightful crunch of the samosa or the sapid juiciness of the shish tawook but the sweet taste of Om Ali, a simple-but-flavourful Egyptian dessert with a surprisingly dark history.
Flash forward to 2025 and I'm standing in a small confectionery store in downtown Cairo, sharing another bowl of Om Ali, this time with my 12-year-old son, and I still can't stop drooling over the dish, despite having tried it in every Middle Eastern city I've visited during the last 14 years.
""A good bowl of Om Ali is unforgettable,"" says Nermine Mansour, a former Egyptian diplomat-turned-food writer and founder of the food blog, Chez Nermine. ""It is the perfect balance of flavours, textures and nutrition â the star of Egyptian cuisine,"" she adds.
Om Ali (also known as Umm Ali or Oum Ali) is a decadent bread pudding made from spice-infused milk, puff pastry, roasted nuts and sugar. Traditionally baked in a deep clay dish for about 20-25 minutes, it has a crunchy, caramelised coating at the top and a silky, creamy layer at the bottom, giving the dessert a unique texture. According to Mansour, the creaminess of the milk, the juiciness of the soaked puff pastry, the crunch from the nuts and the sweet earthiness lent by the clay pot come together to give Om Ali a rare appeal, making it one of the most popular desserts in Egypt.
Om Ali is also a favourite across the Middle East, particularly during Ramadan and Eid celebrations when dessert consumption skyrockets. Earlier this year, B Laban, one of the fastest-growing Middle Eastern dessert companies, posted a video of Om Ali on Instagram and thousands of people quickly swooned over it.
""I get why Om Ali is so popular. It is affordable, easy to digest and can be prepared quickly using ingredients available at home, making it equally accessible to the rich and the poor,"" says Moustafa Omran, an Egyptologist and my local tour guide in Cairo. ""Despite the fame of this dish, a question always lingers in the minds of [Om Ali] lovers: who is Ali and who is his mother, after whom this dish is named?"" Omran points out, drawing my attention to the dessert's name.
With my mouth stuffed with soaked puff pastry and my mind going nuts over the creaming pudding at El Malky, one of the most famous dessert chains serving Om Ali in Cairo, I cannot help but agree.
Om Ali, which meansÂ ""Mother of Ali"" in Arabic, is an admittedly unusualÂ name for a dessert. Yet, what's even more unusual, as many Egyptians tell me, is that it is rumoured to be named after a murderer.
Om Ali was the first wife ofÂ the first sultan of the Mamluk dynasty, which ruled Egypt from the mid-13th to early 16th Centuries. In 1250, her then-husband, Izz Al-Din Aybak overthrew the Ayyubid dynasty and established the Mamluk reign in Egypt, marrying Shajar Al-Durr, the last Ayyubid queen, to solidify his rule. The marriage was merely a political union and Al-DurrÂ had frequent disagreements with Aybak before finally deciding to murder him as he took a bath.
In a bizarre turn of events, Om Ali decided to avenge her husband's death by beatingÂ Al-Durr to death with wooden clogs. After killingÂ Al-Durr,Â Om Ali instructed her cook toÂ bake something special to commemorate her successÂ and the eponymous dessert was allegedly born and named in her honour.
As surprised as I am to learn that Om Ali's origins may be rooted in murder and betrayal, deeper research reveals that the dish's origins are even more complex, and still baffle historians.
""There are no historical records that tell us if the dessert Om Ali is connected to the murder of Al-Durr,"" says Dr Mennat-Allah El Dorry, a food historian at the American University in Cairo. ""Although we know for sure that Queen Om Ali killed Al-Durr, we do not have any concrete evidence linking the dessert to the murderâ¦ I have absolutely no idea how the narrative came about and how the dessert got its name.""
Further, the oldest recorded recipe for Om Ali comes from a more recent 19th-Century Arabic cookbook titled KitÄb nasá»Ìháº¡t al-anÄm fÄ« há»¥sn al-táº¡Ê»Äm, which adds another layer of mystery to the dish's origins and nomenclature.
Yet, according to Mansour, the 13th-Century Om Ali narrative may hold some truth. ""Egyptians have eaten a thin phyllo bread called roqaq since ancient times,"" she says. According to the book The Pharaoh's Kitchen by Magda Mehdawy and Amr Hussein, roqaq has been a staple at Nubian banquets since the 3rd Century BCE. ""So, it is quite possible that Om Ali's cook used the leftover roqaq in the palace and baked it with milk and nuts to create the iconic dessert that we all love today.""
Despite the dessert's muddled origins, its connection to the killer of Al-Durr live on in Egyptian popular culture. Today, the name Om Ali is synonymous with good triumphing over evil â in this case, the unjust queen.
""We love it because of its association with the story of the victory of justice over injustice,"" says Omran. ""Also, we [Egyptians] love stories; therefore, this dish has gained immense popularity,"" he explains. The legend continues to endure in social media, food blogs and television, such as the 2004 popular drama series Abbas Al Abiad Fi Al Yawm Al Aswad, in which famous Egyptian actor Yehia El-Fakharany recounts the legend of Om Ali to his onscreen family.
The popularity of Om Ali swells during Ramadan, as sugar-based desserts take centre stage in iftar meals around the globe, providing instant nourishment to a fasting body that has run out of glucose. ""In addition to sugar, Om Ali contains protein and calcium from milk, vitamins and fibre from nuts, and carbohydrates from bread,"" Mansour points out. ""That's why, [Om Ali] is a guilty pleasure you can easily justify. It feels like a warm hug in a clay pot filled with goodness,"" she adds. (A calorie analysis reveals that Om Ali has fewer calories compared to other Middle Eastern desserts like kunefe and baklava.)
Besides, Om Ali is an easy dessert to make. ""It requires only simple ingredients found in every Egyptian kitchen,"" Mansour adds. Depending on the size of the iftar parties, this dish can be scaled up or down, making it a favourite among chefs and home cooks during Ramadan and Eid.
Om Ali holds a special place in Egyptian cuisine because it is simple, nutritious and evokes feelings of warmth and goodness. ""The creaminess of the pudding, the crunch of roasted nuts and the story of the victory of good over bad â a bowl of Om Ali just feels right and makes me happy after a long day of fasting,"" says Omran.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250312-an-ethical-guide-to-hiking-the-inca-trail,Should tourists hike the Inca Trail?,"The fabled route leading to Machu Picchu is one of the world's most jaw-droppingly beautiful treks â but it's also plagued by controversies that travellers can avoid.
At 2,840m above sea level, the trail leaves the rushing Urubamba River that carves Cusco's Sacred Valley and winds its way uphill. It ascends past Andean cloud forests to WarmiwaÃ±usca, the infamous ""Dead Woman's Pass"" at 4,215m, before descending to the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, one of the Seven New Wonders of the World.
This is the legendary Inca Trail, South America's most popular hike and one of the world's most jaw-droppingly beautiful treks. In an effort to protect the path, which was designed and built more than 600 years ago by Inca engineers, the Peruvian government limits the number of passes available to visitors during the trail's March-to-January opening (the trail opens 31 March 2025). As a result, every year permits for the 43km hike sell out quickly as travellers try to secure one of the roughly 200 daily passes allocated daily for tourists.
Ironically, the Inca Trail's popularity contrasts with frequent protests that often leave hundreds of travellers stranded, as the porters tasked with hauling hikers' gear across the mountains petition for better working conditions. While these protests rarely reach English-language publications, the Porters' Voice Collective (an organisation aiming to elevate the rights of Inca Trail workers) released a documentary in 2024 detailing these struggles.
How can such an idyllic place hike generate so much conflict? According to the trail's Indigenous guides, the problem is a lack of law enforcement governing porters' working conditions.
Since mules are prohibited on the Inca Trail because their hooves would destroy the ancient stone paving and stairs, trekkers are required to hire porters to haul their camping equipment. Porters' days often begin at 05:00 and end after 22:00. While a 2022 law mandates that porters receive s/650 Peruvian Nuevo Soles (Â£140 or $176) for the four-day trek, very few trekking agencies abide by this and pay as little as s/350 (Â£75 or $95) per trek. Since the law was passed, trekking agency lawyers have been fighting it, and in the meantime refusing to pay the legal wage.
In addition to trekking agencies not compensating porters properly, many companies require their porters to carry more weight than the 20kg maximum that is also stipulated in the law.
""Most [male] porters carry about 30kg, and I've seen 40kg packs,"" says Natalia Amao Huillca, who has been guiding travellers along the Inca Trail since 2007. ""About 80% of the injuries I see in porters are knee injuries. The others are mostly back injuries. They frequently ask me for pain pills in the evening.""
According to Cenovia Quispe Flores, who has worked as a porter for Evolution Treks Peru since 2018, ""The law for women is 15kg,"" but she says she has seen women working for other companies carrying 25 to 30kg. To get around weight limits, many companies either send gear around the first checkpoint where porters' backpacks are weighed or simply pay those off who enforce these limits.
""In theory, the checkpoint is strict, but in practice, it's not strict for everybody,"" explains Shandira Arque Lucana, who has guided hikers on the Inca Trail since 2016. She says that big companies cut deals with people working the checkpoints but that small companies don't have enough influence to evade enforcement.
Even companies that want to play by the rules can find themselves stymied by the strict limit of 500 total people (which includes 300 non-tourist porters and guides) allowed on the trail each day. Sometimes there is extra weight but no way to add an extra porter.
""I've seen many porters working with hernias, bad knees and ankle problems,"" says Pedro, a guide who asked not to be identified by his real name. ""I know a porter who became an alcoholic because he couldn't get treatment for his injured knee. He still works on the Inca Trail, and he dulls the pain with caÃ±azo (a liquor made from sugarcane)"".
Porters also suffer from dehydration. They drink unclean water from streams and handwashing taps near bathrooms, though paying customers get filtered and boiled water.
With all this in mind, what should travellers know if they want to trek South America's most famous ruins in a responsible, ethical way? According to local guides, the first thing to remember is that there are other treks that lead to Machu Picchu.
""The Inca Trail is not the only option,"" says Liz Montesinos Pumayalle, who has worked as a guide on the Inca Trail for eight years and notes that mules are used instead of porters on all other trails. ""People who want to connect with Indigenous communities should hike the Lares Trek. The Salkantay Trek (which has two options that connect to Machu Picchu directly and other routes that connect indirectly) is best for people who want to sleep in eco-domes or lodges, rather than tents.""
Amao Huillca notes that companies who hire many female porters often treat their staff better than those who only have one or none. ""I like working with porter teams that are half women and have a woman head porter,"" she says. ""Most companies send one or two token women porters."" She says that because female porters are more inclined to go to a doctor when they're injured than their male colleagues, tourists who request women porters are more likely to trek with healthier porters.
""One way to ensure that porters are treated and paid well is for there to be women porters,"" echoes Inca Trail guide Edson Lucana MejÃ­a. He explains that it has historically been common for male porters to sleep in the dining tent, which doesn't have a floor and is often muddy. Women usually insist on individual tents, so in a team with more women, you can be sure that more porters have a decent place to sleep.
Marco Antonio CarriÃ³n, who has been guiding treks on the Inca Trail for 20 years offers other recommendations. ""Look for photos of porters with ergonomic backpacks and for reviews that mention something about how porters are treated,"" he says. ""If a company is sustainable and treats the porters well, it will show in the online reviews.""
In addition, CarriÃ³n says travellers should ask if porters are required to wear their employer's uniforms. While it may be a small detail in some cultures, for many Indigenous Peruvians, traditional Quechua clothing is an important part of their identity.
Despite allegations of mistreatment by certain Inca Trail operators, many guides and porters not only feel fulfilled, but also fortunate to work in such a stunning natural setting. ""I love this work"" says Quispe Flores. ""I like the mountains and working with my friends, the other women porters. Working in agriculture is harder and doesn't pay.""
While it isn't always easy to determine which companies follow the law and which don't, Lucana MejÃ­a has one message he wishes the many thousands of travellers hoping to hike the fabled route will remember: ""Without porters, there is no Inca Trail.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250310-alberto-angela-an-italian-cultural-ambassadors-guide-to-rome,An Italian cultural ambassador's guide to Rome,"Alberto Angela has made a career out of exploring his hometown. Here are his favourite spots to unearth Rome's millennia of secrets, from the Vatican Museums to Ostia Antica.
From the 1st-Century BCE ruins of the Imperial Forum to the Trevi Fountainâs Baroque splendour, Rome packs such an overwhelming myriad of postcard-worthy landmarks that digging through its historical layers can make any visitor feel like they've turned into an archaeologist.
Alberto Angela, a TV presenter, global ambassador for Italian heritage, art, history and culture, and a familiar face in Italian living rooms for nearly four decades knows a thing or two about his hometown's 2,000 years of history â and he's ready to help visitors discover it, especially as this year's Jubilee newly puts it into the limelight.
""Rome has two faces,"" says Angela. ""The Papal â that of the rich â and its working-class soul, the one that is closest to usâ¦ the most interesting,"" he says.
In a city where grand basilicas lie next to shady alleyways, Angela recommends exploring without cramming in too many sights â so that one can ""immerse oneself in the world of the ancients"".
Having followed in the footsteps of his famous father, Piero Angela â Italy's most well-known documentarist often called a ""national treasure"" â the younger Angela attributes his career and love of history to growing up in the Italian capital.
""You breathe history here,"" he says. ""Anyone who comes to Rome can see the same afterglow Caesar would have seen. You aren't in a place that doesn't exist anymore. Rome was rebuilt on top of its ancient structures.""
For Angela, this is what makes Rome so unique. ""The city did not cancel its history, unlike many others,"" he says. ""Living here, you understand the ancients.""
Emerging from a small market settlement on the Tiber, the city of Rome was at an intersection between the Mediterranean and mainland Europe, making it a crossroads that swelled into the worldâs first true metropolis. Angela believes that the city's immense global-reaching political and symbolic impact throughout history means everyone has a ""piece"" of Rome inside them â which is why it can have such a profound impact on those who visit it.
Here are Angela's favourite ways to experience ancient history in modern Rome.
Much of central Rome's labyrinthine urban grid is a direct heir of the former imperial capital, with public spaces like the Baroque Piazza Navona or Campo deâ Fiori piazza taking their shape from a bygone stadium and theatre, respectively.
But on the Palatine Hill, the mythical birthplace of Rome, you can actually walk on the same stones where emperors Augustus and Nero once dwelled.
""It's the place where the Caesars lived and died,"" Angela says.
As the legend goes, twin brothers Romulus and Remus received an omen from the gods and decided to lay the foundations of a new city on the Palatine Hill in 753 BCE. In the subsequent centuries, the Palatine developed into an exclusive neighbourhood of patrician villas and Imperial palaces â indeed, itâs where the word âpalaceâ takes its root.
One of the legendary seven hills of the ancient city, offering an incomparable vantage point with a 360 panorama, Palatine Hill offers what Angela describes as ""a beautiful walk"", with arguably the best views of the Colosseum â the unmistakable ""star of ancient Rome"".
Visiting the Palatine is a full immersion into the life of the Roman empire, with a plethora of impressive ruins, including the mosaic floors of Augustus's palace, Domitian's hippodrome and the balcony overlooking the Circus Maximus racecourse.

As the centre of Catholicism and one of the most important sites in Christendom, the Unesco-listed Vatican is firmly entrenched among Rome's unmissable sights. In honour of the 2025 Jubilee, tourists and pilgrims alike are flocking to Saint Peter's Basilica to walk through its Holy Door, opened for the occasion every quarter of a century.
But while much of the Holy See's architectural majesty is immediately apparent â from the Michelangelo- and Giacomo della Porta-designed designed dome of Saint Peter's all the way to the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums â some of its greatest treasures are hidden underground.
""Once in Saint Peter's, you walk on beautiful marble floorings, you look up to the Baldachin,"" says Angela, renowned for his 2015 TV miniseries Alla Scoperta dei Musei Vaticani (Discovering the Vatican Museums). ""But you can go underground. The Popes' tombs can be found underneath, but under those is the ancient Roman graveyard where Peter the Apostle himself was buried. The foundations of [the Basilica] are a graveyard.""
The Vatican Necropolis, excavated only in the 1940s, features mausoleums belonging to citizens of many faiths, as well as a cluster of tombs called ""Field Pâ, suspected by some scholars to hold the burial chamber of the Church founder himself.
""It's a trip into ancient Rome that you wouldn't expect to find [there]"", Angela says. ""It makes you understand how Rome really is.""
Visitors must book visits to the Necropolis on the official website of Saint Peterâs Basilica. The dress code mandates covered shoulders and below-the-knee clothing.

Rome has more than 900 Catholic sites of worship built over the course of the centuries. Now and then, there's one that best encapsulates the city's multi-millennial history, like Angela's pick, the Basilica of San Clemente.
""This Basilica conceals the three souls of Rome â Baroque, medieval and ancient,"" Angela says. ""Anyone who comes across it is enchanted.""
Tucked behind the Colosseum and a composite of two different churches, San Clemente â dedicated to the third pope of the same name â has been a site of worship since ancient Roman times, when it served as a temple for the Zoroastrian cult of Mithras.
The temple eventually swelled into its grand current form, featuring an intricate overlay of architectural styles â from its Renaissance courtyard and the Mannerist facade of the main Basilica, all the way to its underground, early medieval second structure, which hides ancient Roman remnants.
""The exterior is beautiful and well-maintained, from the 16th Century, with a Cosmatesque [geometric] marble flooring, and then you take the stairs and arrive at the medieval Basilica,"" says Angela. ""And you find yourself right in ancient Rome, in a Roman temple.""

From 17th-Century Villa Borghese to the Capitoline, the cityâs oldest art gallery, Rome has no shortage of museums displaying a vast array of artefacts â matched by equally colossal crowds of spectators.
While Angela certainly recommends visitors enjoy the time-worn classics, he also suggests a quieter, quirkier alternative: the Museo della Comunicazione Scritta dei Romani.
Conveniently located a mere five-minute walk from the Termini train station, the museum is found inside the Baths of Diocletian, where the majestic 4th-Century Imperial termae have survived in remarkable condition. It is also home to a curious collection of esoteric Roman artefacts, showing how the ancients dabbled in the occult.
""It's a museum dedicated to how Romans expressed themselves,"" Angela says. ""But there's a part dedicated to magic, voodoo of sorts.""
Superstition was the unspoken crux of ancient Roman life, but one that we often overlook. ""It's a world that often gets left behind, that of spiritual beliefs,"" he adds. ""They found the objects in a parking lot.""
Among the objects on display is a large copper cauldron, curse tablets (defixiones), ritual tools and even Christian spells.
""For someone coming from the station, especially if it rains, it's quite an intriguing thing to visit,"" says Angela.

The 16th to 18th Centuries were a crucial time for Rome's urban development, as the city's aristocratic families â including the Farnese, Borghese, Doria and Pamphilj â vied for social dominance through commissioning lavish building projects, all designed in the Baroque style favoured by the Papal Counter-Reformation.
""I'd advise anyone coming to visit Rome to see the palaces of the powerful Roman families,"" says Angela.
While listing a few examples â Palazzo Colonna and Palazzo Farnese among them â few rival the opulence of the Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, Rome's very own ""Versailles"", in Angela's words.
The product of an alliance of noble families, what resulted was a Baroque fantasy come to life and an impressive art collection featuring the works of many of Italy's greats, from Titian to Raphael.
Its crown jewel is its Hall of Mirrors, commissioned by Gabriele Valvassori in the 1730s and featuring whimsical frescos, gilded Venetian frescos and ornate gold-plated furniture.
""I had never been prior to shooting [a TV special] and it's truly spectacular,"" he says. ""It truly surpasses anything else.""

Many visitors coming to Rome don't know that the city has what Angela considers its very own ""Pompeii"" around 32km from the city centre: Ostia Antica.
Once Rome's sea port, potentially from as early as the 7th Century BCE, Ostia Antica developed into a bustling seaside suburb, reaching a peak of 75,000 inhabitants in the late Imperial age. While the city declined after the empireâs fall, and the coastline ended up advancing by 3.2km, much of the ancient town that once stood there has been preserved.
""You lose yourself there, you can see everything,"" Angela says. ""Bakeries, public bathrooms (latrines), homes, apartment blocksâ¦ street businesses, not too dissimilar to those of today.""
A tour of Ostia Antica can show you much of the amenities and features of ancient Roman life â from its 1st-Century BCE theatre, to its forum, public baths and necropolis.
For Angela, Ostia Antica best preserves the ""popolare"" (working-class) soul of ancient Rome â one which its newer counterpart, the beach suburb Lido di Ostia, has carried on in modern form.
Ostia Antica is a roughly 30-minute drive from central Rome, and can be reached in around the same time by taking the Metromare commuter rail from the Porta S Paolo station.

The most weird and wonderful specimens are arranged on a table in his Sun-soaked orchard. There's one shaped like an octopus with fat tentacles, a wart-covered citron the size of a newborn baby and a colourful pear-shaped fruit splattered in a tie-dye of green and yellow.
They're not at all what I was expecting, and they're not entirely safe, either. ""You will get burned,"" TodolÃ­ warns, pointing at a grass-greenbergamot. The oil is phototoxic, causingÂ  the skin to burn if it's exposed to UV light (it isn't dangerous to eat, but it is very acidic). ""Want to taste?"" he asks. I hold a slice up to the sun and eye it suspiciously; the golden segments light up like a stained-glass window. I tip my head back and squeeze drops into my mouth, being careful not to touch my lips. Eye-watering acidic needles stab my tongue. I'm reeling and wiping away tears, but TodolÃ­ is already on to the next fruit, squeezing the pearly contents of a finger lime into my hand. The little balls pop like lime-flavoured caviar in my mouth.
There are hundreds more unusual fruits to try at TodolÃ­ Citrus FundaciÃ³, a not-for-profit farm dedicated to researching and preserving rare citrus varieties. Hidden on a sleepy street in the town of Palmera, this is TodolÃ­'s passion project. He was born and raised on this farm, going on to study art history before serving as director at esteemed galleries such as Tate Modern in London and Milan's Pirelli HangarBicocca, where he works today.
Now, TodolÃ­ considers himself a fifth-generation orange farmer. He's fiercely protective of his old family farm, which is one of the reasons TodolÃ­ Citrus FundaciÃ³ came to be. In 2010, a project was launched to raze Palmera's orange groves to make room for real estate. He tried to derail it through official channels and lost. ""I was called a romantic enemy of progress,"" he recalls. But TodolÃ­ did not desist. Changing tack, he began buying plots of land. Some were abandoned patches of weeds and others were established orchards. He acquired around 4.5 hectares in total, an impenetrable fortress of precious farmland. ""When I started it was a matter of urgency, I had to save the land,"" he says.
Around the same time, TodolÃ­ was working as cultural advisor to Ferran AdriÃ , former head chef of the iconic (and sadly closed) El Bulli (once-billed as the world's best restaurant). One day, the pair visited a garden on the outskirts of Perpignan which had more than 400 types of citrus trees, some exceedingly rare. The south of France is a little too chilly for citrus, so the trees are planted in pots. In summer they bask outside, and in October the gardeners heave them into a greenhouse to keep warm. During their visit TodolÃ­ asked, ""How is it possible that they have done this amazing project with citrus, and in my area no one has done it?"" AdriÃ  replied: ""Why not do it yourself?""
TodolÃ­ was inspired. He knew Palmera had the perfect microclimate for citrus; there would be no need for pots. TodolÃ­ Citrus FundaciÃ³ is 3km from the sea and backed by a ripple of mountains. When the warm wind travels across the Mediterranean Sea, it becomes humid, and when it hits the mountains, it drops bathtubs of rain. The water trickles down the mountainside to Palmera, absorbing organic matter along the way. The fertile, nutrient-rich soil is known as alluvial soil, and TodolÃ­ is blessed with buckets of it.
Palmera's crisp mornings also help to balance the flavour of fruit, TodolÃ­ explains. ""In January it's one or two degrees in the morning and around 20C in the afternoon. That's what creates the balance between acidity and sweetness. If you're in Florida, for example, it's too hot. They're sweeter but they're bland. In Japan, it's colder so they have more acidity. Here and Sicily are the perfect areas for citrus.""
For inspiration, he turned to history's most illustrious citrus gardens. He studied the Italian gardens of the Medici family in the 1500s and opulent Arabic palaces like the Alhambra. ""For the Arabs, gardens appealed to the senses. It was a paradise on Earth, an immersive experience,"" says TodolÃ­.
Likewise, the sights, smells and sounds of TodolÃ­ Citrus FundaciÃ³ seduce visitors. Chirping locusts the size of frogs hop in the mallow and honeybees buzz between wildflowers. While licking sour juice from fingertips, there's a soundtrack of water trickling along an ancient Arabic irrigation route and the frenetic chirping of goldfinches in the aviary. The zesty scent of lemons perfumes visitors' hands for the rest of the day.

There are other farms nearby, but they don't look like this. The surrounding countryside is an orderly grid of single-crop fields, with rows upon rows of orange trees. Spain is the world's leading exporter of citrus, shipping around 4 million tonnes a year. In order to produce such vast quantities, most farms lean heavily on mono-cropping, which can leave soil depleted and plants more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. TodolÃ­ Citrus FundaciÃ³, on the other hand, is a genetic diversity bank; a motley bunch of more than 500 varieties. Some of the rarest plants include ancient Valencian orange trees used as rootstock. The grafts were made around 150 years ago and TodolÃ­ cut the scion back to allow the roots to grow freely.
""It's like Jurassic Park,"" he says. ""We can see resurrected varieties that were in extinction.""
As well as tours of the farm, the garden comes alive with events throughout the year. Poets read stanzas on a stage decorated with lemons at the annual PoecÃ­trics festival (14 June 2025), while Cine de Vanguardia is a celebration of experimental cinema.
Back on the tour, and TodolÃ­'s right-hand man Ton Gjekaj is waiting at the final tasting table. He has cut the last slices of fruit. There are wedges of passionfruit-tasting trifoliate orange, apple-sour calamansi and rosewater-scented Palestinian sweet lime, still warm from the Sun. I greedily eat them all, popping whole carpels into my mouth. I try to jot down the flavours but by now my notepad is covered in juice, my camera's buttons sticky.
There's just time to peep inside The Laboratory, a high-tech kitchen and library. This is a hub of experimentation, used by experts from around the world who come to play with TodolÃ­'s extraordinary pantry. Chefs make ice cream from bergamots; bartenders pickle lemon rind for gin and tonics; and perfumiers extract oils from nearly extinct oranges.
Agustina Basilico Miara, head of beverage at London's Toklas restaurant, has visited three times and says she always goes home with new ideas. ""It's incredible. Every time we go, we take as many people as possible from the restaurant,"" Miara says. ""Especially after being in cloudy London, to arrive in an explosion of colours is super inspiring.""
Miara uses leftover peel from the kitchen (like fragrant blood orange and chandler red pomelo) to make a tea, which she turns into a syrup. She uses it for a variety of cocktails, like her zingy take on the classic whisky highball. ""We've also done a martini with chinotto. The vodka is infused with chinotto and then we candy the fruit,"" Miara says. ""It adds another layer, like an olive brine element to the flavour, it's very aromatic.""
After flicking through some books (every mention of citrus has been bookmarked, resulting in a pleasing rainbow of Post-it notes along the spines) we conclude the tour by tasting marmalade. The most delicious is made from Borneo lemon â not technically a lemon, but a cross between a pomelo and a key lime. Delicate and creamy, the marmalade tastes like well-balanced lemon curd.
For TodolÃ­, this open-air gallery is his legacy. It's a place to challenge preconceptions, encourage biodiversity and foster local culture. ""For me, it's like a museum where you don't have to refresh the collection because it changes every day,"" he says. ""People think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago, that it's one of the oldest fruits in the world. It has been so important in literature, poetry and art.""
TodolÃ­ can see the art of citrus âÂ and from his otherworldly orchard, he's helping the rest of the world to see it too.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20190623-the-us-island-that-speaks-elizabethan-english,The US island that speaks Elizabethan English,"Native Americans, English sailors and pirates all came together on Ocracoke Island in North Carolina to create the only American dialect that is not identified as American.
I'd never been called a ""dingbatter"" until I went to Ocracoke, North Carolina for the first time. I've spent a good part of my life in the state, but I'm still learning how to speak theÂ Hoi ToiderÂ brogue. The people here just have their own way of speaking: it's like someone took Elizabethan English, sprinkled in some Irish tones and 1700s Scottish accents, then mixed it all up with pirate slang. But the Hoi Toider dialect is more than a dialect. It's also a culture, one that's slowly fading away. With each generation, fewer people play meehonkey, cook the traditional foods or know what it is to be ""mommucked"".
In an effort to put his ""America first"" stamp on the nation's speech, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order making English the country's official language. It marks the first time in the US's nearly 250-year history that the nation has had an official language. Yet, on this small 9.6-square-mile island surrounded by the swirling waters of the Atlantic, residents still speak what is arguably the most English version of English in the country â and many Americans don't understand it.
As the island's official website proudly proclaims: ""With origins dating back to the 1600s, Ocracoke brogue is about as American as it gets.""
Located 20 miles from the North Carolina mainland, Ocracoke Island is fairly isolated. You can't drive there as there are no bridges, and most people canât fly either as there are no commercial flights. If you want to go there, it has to be by boat. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, that meant Ocracoke was a perfect spot for pirates to hide, as no soldiers were going to search 16 miles of remote beaches and forests for wanted men.
William Howard was one of those outlaws, serving as quartermaster on Blackbeardâs ship Queen Anneâs Revenge. Leaving before Blackbeardâs final battle in 1718, Howard made his way to Virginia, eventually taking the general pardon offered by King George I to all pirates. But unlike some, Howard had a plan. For several decades, he dropped out of sight, only to reappear in 1759 when he bought Ocracoke Island for Â£105 from a man named Richard Sanderson, a justice and later a General Assembly member in mainland North Carolina.
Howard settled down along with some other ex-pirates and started building a community with boat pilots who had been stationed on the island to help guide merchant ships around sandbars in the area. A mainland North Carolina Native American tribe also interacted with the early settlers. The Woccon tribe had set up fishing and hunting outposts on the island, which they called Woccocock. Through misspellings and mispronunciations, it became Wokokon, Oakacock and Okercock, before finally arriving at the current version of Ocracoke in the mid-1700s. So at this point, there were Native Americans, English sailors and pirates from a variety of places all in one location. And that isolated community of just under 200 started blending words and dialects, and eventually building its own way of speaking.
""It's the only American dialect that is not identified as American,"" said Dr Walt Wolfram, a North Carolina State University professor who studied the Ocracoke dialect for more than 20 years and currently works as the director of NC Stateâs Language and Life Project. ""That's fascinating to me. You can find pronunciation, grammar structures and vocabulary on Ocracoke that are not found anywhere else in North America.""
Howard's community lived in near-isolation for almost two centuries. Electricity didn't arrive at the island until 1938 and a ferry service didn't start until 1957, leaving the islanders cut off except for the occasional supply trip to the mainland. Even today, things are a bit different for the island's 676 residents than on mainland North Carolina.
""You have to be a certain type of individual to enjoy living here,"" said Chip Stevens, an island resident directly descended from Howard and the former owner of the local hotel Blackbeard's Lodge. ""There isn't a Lowes or a Harris Teeter or any [supermarkets]. Rarely does anyone go off the island without a cooler [to bring back supplies]. You have to be almost a holistic person, capable of dealing with less of a hectic nightlife lifestyle.""
Yes, mobile phones and laptops still work here, and if you want to sit down and watch some Major League Baseball in a pub, there are plenty of options. But in many other ways, the island is a throwback to a time before internet and television. Instead of cinemas, there are outdoor theatre groups. Local teashops, spice markets and other family-owned stores take the place of chain supermarkets. Cars are allowed on the 16 mile-long island, but most people just park them and walk everywhere. The island's children all attend one school, while residents work as everything from fishermen to brewery owners to woodworkers.
""It's amazing how coming across that ferry is almost like going to a different country,"" Stevens said, sitting on the hotel's front porch. ""You feel that separation. It's a really nice feeling, being able to give your kids some freedom. When I was a kid, we'd leave [home] after breakfast, eat lunch at somebody else's house, walk to the beach, take a rowboat out in the water, and our parents never had to worry about us. We've maintained a lot of that.""
And they've still â just â maintained their unique way of speaking.
When older Ocracoke natives, or ""O'cockers"" as they call themselves, speak, the ""I"" sound is an ""oi"", so they say ""hoi"" instead of ""high"". That's where the Hoi Toider name comes from: it's based on how the O'cockers say ""high tide"".
Then there are the phrases and vocabulary, many of which are also kept over from the original British and Irish settlers. For example, when you're on Ocracoke, someone might ""mommuck a buck before going up the beach"", which means ""to tease a friend before going off the island"".
""We have a lot of words that have been morphed to make our own,"" said Amy Howard, another of William Howard's descendants, who runs the Village Craftsmen, a local arts and crafts store. ""[Hoi Toider] is a combination from a whole blend of cultures. A lot of the early settlers were well travelled, so they ran into lots of different types of people. For example, the word ""pizer"" we use comes from [a European] word which means porch. So if you're going to be sitting on your pizer, you're sitting on your porch.""
There's a long list of words in Ocracoke vocabulary that are taken from countries across the globe. ""Quamish"", for example, means sick or nauseated. It comes from the 16th-Century English word ""qualm"". Then there's ""buck"", which means a male friend. You can trace that back to 13th-Century Germany, where it originally meant a male deer, as it does in most English-speaking places today.
Locals even made up words in some cases. For example, early settler children played a game of hide and seek called meehonkey. Everyone would hide and call out ""meehonkey"" while one person tried to find them. According to island tradition, Amy told me, the kids believed meehonkey was the sound a goose made as it flew by. Then there's ""dingbatter"", which is used for anyone who isnât a native.
But with each generation, the dialect is starting to disappear. The world is coming to the island through television and the internet, as well as with the long line of tourists who show up every summer. There's also more people from the mainland moving in.
""What's happening is that some of these small dialects that thrive on isolation are dying because isolation is a thing of the past,"" said Dr Wolfram. ""They still pick up terms and vocabulary, but when a kid from the island retains a strong dialect, that was the norm and now itâs an exception.""
More like this:
â¢Â The Alabama musuem grappling with the 'Gulf of America'
â¢Â How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel
â¢Â The only land disputed between the US and Canada
In the past, kids adopted the dialect because that was the only version they heard. Now there are hundreds of dialects and languages that most will encounter before they graduate high school. In fact, as of 2024, on this island of 676 people, fewer than half actually speak with the full Hoi Toider brogue.
""Within one to two generations, it'll be gone,"" said Dr Wolfram. ""It's dying out and we canât stop that.""
Yet while the dialect may be in danger, the islanders are managing to hold onto their unique culture in other ways. In the beginning, settlers often had to come up with alternatives when they didn't have the right ingredients for a recipe. That same concept holds true today: with limited stores on the island, if you run out of supplies, you can either head to the mainland for what you need or just find a replacement.
""Ocracoke is really good at adapting,"" said Amy. ""I joke that we need to make a cookbook for Ocracoke that says what the recipe is and then what you can actually get, because almost inevitably, you get a quirky recipe and you wonât have everything you need.""
That's actually how the fig cake, which is now Ocracoke's signature dish, came to be. The story goes that in 1964, island resident Margaret Garrish was making a date cake and she had all the ingredients mixed in, except one.
""She found she didn't have any [dates], so she did what we all do and looked in her cupboard and found a jar of fig preserves,"" Amy said, explaining that figs are a holdover from the original settlers, and you can find fig trees in almost every yard. ""She threw them in the cake, mixed them up and now we have fig cakes.""
Now every year in August, the island holds a Fig Festival, complete with a fig cake bake-off, fig tastings, a square dance and traditional games like meehonkey.
But while some traditions stand strong, residents do see the island changing.
New York native Daphne BenninkÂ came to the island 35 years ago and never left. For her, the change, in some ways, reflects the same wealth of experience those original settlers brought.
""I see more and more people coming here,"" Bennink said. ""On Ocracoke, you have this kind of patchwork quilt of all people from all walks. Itâs a little bit of a melting pot.""
As for what type of culture that melting pot will create? Everyone I talked to pretty much said the same thing: no matter what changes, some things will stay the same on Ocracoke. If someone is sick, the community will pitch in. If one business owner needs help, 14 others will show up to solve the problem. The dialect may change, but the intent behind those words will remain the same.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250306-why-travellers-are-seeking-out-guilt-free-safaris,Is there such a thing as guilt-free safari?,"Electric Jeeps and carbon credits are unlikely to make up for gas-guzzling private flights and building mini towns in the remote savannah. So, what should travellers be looking for?
Fourteen Jeeps idle near the dozing lion cubs, burning fuel. The smell of petrol hangs in the morning air as a couple of guides illegally park off-road in Botswana's Chobe National Park, crushing the vegetation so their guests can get a better view. One by one the vehicles pull away towards other animals or to their lodges where their passengers will have lunch â likely flown and driven in from South Africa â before boarding a tiny bush plane themselves.
Gas-guzzling private flights and building mini towns in the remote savannah might seem at odds with one of the industry's most notable movements: green travel. Yet responsible safaris play an important role in conservation by expanding protected areas, investing in environmental research and creating economic support for local communities. Now, as the pressure of climate change rises, an increasing numbers of travellers are seeking out environmentally and socially ethical safaris that minimise their carbon footprint. According to one report by B Corp-certified travel advisor Go2Africa, interest in sustainable safaris has grown by more than 1000% over the last four years.
In response, many of the continent's largest and most popular safari operators tout carbon-neutral (and even carbon-positive) trips, swapping out traditional Jeeps with electric vehicles, installing fields of solar panels and purchasing carbon credits to make up for their guests' air travel. With them, it's promised, travellers can enjoy a guilt- and carbon footprint-free vacation.
But some sustainability experts suggest that these efforts might be a savvy attempt to tap into society's rising climate anxiety, which is at an all-time high according to a recent survey by the World Economic Forum. At best, safari operators simply know what will grab the attention of eco-conscious travellers.
""It's called green-crowding,"" says Judy Kepher-Gona, executive director of Sustainable Travel and Tourism Africa, a consulting company that helps destinations and businesses achieve their sustainability goals. ""Marketers in the tourism industry are smart. If you talk about carbon neutrality, people hear you more than when you talk about sustainability generally. It's easier to understand and, for lack of a better word, sexier â so they crowd around that term.""
The African elephant in the room: is there such a thing as a true carbon-neutral safari?
""I suppose that in a spreadsheet it might be possible,"" says Lisa Scriven, general manager of Fair Trade Tourism and Africa Coordinator of Green Destinations.
Data manipulation, loopholes and even differing opinions of what defines a ""carbon-neutral"" camp make it difficult to know how strict safari operators are being when they tout the label. For example, Scriven says that some lodges claim to be carbon neutral yet decline to calculate their Scope 3 emissions, which include everything they don't produce. In remote Africa, where every supply, guest, employee and bottle of imported Champagne must travel long distances to reach a private concession in the middle of the Serengeti or Okavango Delta, this cost can quickly skyrocket.
Both Kepher-Gona and Scriven also warn against blindly buying into the promise of carbon offsetting, which most carbon-neutral operators include automatically as a levy or offer for a fee to guests. To be effective, reputable carbon-offset programmes should be linked directly to the destination you're visiting and invest in climate justice. When in doubt about the legitimacy of a camp's initiative, Scriven suggests checking with a third-party such as Credible Carbon. In the worst-case scenario, a well-meaning lodge may not purchase their carbon credits wisely; unfortunately, the market has become rife with scams.
Even when a safari comes close to carbon neutrality, sustainability experts agree that achieving net-zero carbon emissions alone is not enough to ensure a long-term, eco-friendly future. In fact, it can distract from bigger, more relevant issues.
""I think when a business says they're carbon neutral, there's immediate awe,"" says Scriven ""It's not greenwashing because maybe they are carbon neutral. But it can be very misleading in terms of the potential burden they're placing on the destination.""
Grant Cumings, managing director of Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, agrees. ""Just because a company is climate positive, that does not mean it's taking good care of the wildlife, habitat, local people or the economy of Zambia. All these are just as important â in my view, more important.""
There's good news, however. More responsible safari brands than ever before are reducing their carbon emissions while simultaneously developing multifaceted standards that extend throughout their business. Segera, the founding member of The Long Run â a network of nature-based tourism businesses that includes some of Africa's top purpose-driven safaris such as Singita Kruger National Park and Tswalu â defines its commitment through the 4Cs framework: conservation, community, culture and commerce.
Originally a cattle ranch, the property has transformed into East Africa's largest private conservancyÂ reforestation project and a thriving wildlife sanctuary, with plans to reintroduce critically endangered rhinos in 2025. Located in Laikipia, Kenya, a region known for historic land injustices since the colonial British government pushed the Maasai out in the early 20th Century, Segera prioritises its relationship with neighbouring villages.
""Carbon neutrality is one part of sustainability, but we focus a lot more on the community,"" says Joy Juma, programme manager of the ZEITZ Foundation that spearheads Segera's sustainable initiatives. ""We empower them to be part of the value chain by providing employment opportunities, bursaries, education and medical care.""
More like this:
â¢Â How will air pollution change where and when we travel?
â¢Â Could the airship be the answer to sustainable air travel?
â¢Â Is it time to change how we buy travel souvenirs?
In addition to community work, conservation is a key standard. Protecting animals from poachers, using environmentally responsible building materials and reducing waste are a starting point, but forward-thinking brands are taking the initiative a step further with transformative biodiversity and environmental management projects. In South Africa, &Beyond Phinda are working on a pangolin reintroduction programme while workers are creating a critical buffer zone for mountain gorillas at Rwanda's Singita lodge.

With so many layered aspects of sustainability to consider, it's understandable that the average traveller might become easily overwhelmed and feel tempted to fall back on a single metric, such as carbon neutrality. To avoid greenwashing, experts suggest choosing a property that's received a recognised, well-regarded sustainability certification â legitimate organisations do independent, on-site audits at least every three years. Dr Andrea Ferry, group sustainability coordinator at Singita, also suggests checking a lodge's website for clear data about their spending on conservation and community projects. Partnering with nonprofits is another good sign.
""Lodges that have a high sustainability maturity level are likely to have a separate fund or trust that performs the conservation and community work,"" she says.
Guests must also be bold enough to ask the right questions prior to booking in order to hold operators accountable, says Kepher-Gona. ""Ask them: what are your sustainability principles? Have the claims that you make been verified by a third party? How do you measure your targets? Where is your last report? What have you done for the local community in the last 30 years?"" A legitimately sustainable property should be proud of their answers. According to Ferry, some lodges are excited to invite guests to view their recycling facilities, rainwater harvesting, solar power system and more.
Above all, camps must prioritise accountability and transparency while acknowledging room for improvement and growth. For example, Segera hopes to reduce fuel use and switch to electric vehicles for game viewing, while Singita is working towards a system to calculate full Scope 3 carbon emissions and better manage water consumption.
""Sustainability is multifaceted and it is rare to find perfect solutions,"" says Ferry. ""The more holistically one can think, the better the solution.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250307-a-wild-road-to-the-highest-city-in-north-america,A wild road to the highest city in North America,"Located on a lonely mountain plain in Colorado ski country, the silver-rush-era town of Leadville holds secrets as deep as its tunnels and old mine workings.
The highway climbs through aspen forest glinting gold in the Sun, rising through zigzag gullies, escarpments and precipices onto a high mountain plain so lonesome it seems to hum with silence. Snowdrifts huddle at the road's verges and on it goes persistently, almost gasping for air, past lonely farms beneath besieging summits.
There are many superlative road trips to take in North America, but if you find yourself on US Route 24, driving through Lake County in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, know you are on an old road to somewhere extraordinary.
Among the places on this storied route is Leadville, with a reputation often chalked up to its elevation. At 3,109m (10,200ft), it's the highest incorporated city in North America. But while the town is always in danger of being dwarfed by the surrounding landscape, the setting also reveals much mythology about Colorado's most lionised subjects: the gold rush and the Wild West.
""So many people, Americans included, are so unfamiliar with our story,"" said Katie Hild, manager of Leadville's Tourism and Visitor Center, housed today in the original red sandstone American National Bank building. ""This is a town that's been shaped by bust and boom â so much has happened here.""
The triumph of Leadville, as Hild puts it, is its many strata. The first mineral deposits were found in the area's California Gulch in 1860, and, within a year, around 10,000 prospectors had flooded the high plain, with more than $3m in ore extracted. By 1880, Leadville was served by three railroads, and between 1878 and 1884 the town had freighted 54 million ounces of silver. Soon, rich seams of zinc, iron, gold and lead were being quarried.
""Mining is our root and some of the largest pockets of precious ores on the continent have been found here,"" added Hild. ""At its peak, there were 30,000 people in Leadville, but by 1893 silver prices had plummeted and the glory days were over nearly as quickly as they'd begun.""
Exploring Leadville nowadays is a kind of treasure hunt â and much of this deep history can be absorbed in the Mining District outside town in the foothills below Mount Sherman. The Route of the Silver Kings, once the backdrop for one of the richest mining camps in the US, reveals 14 original structures and 20 sites from the era that visitors can explore on a signposted gravel road. Incredibly, the US Bureau of Mines estimates there are 1,329 shafts, 1,628 prospect holes and more than 200 miles of workings, all hidden beneath the surface.
For many, the 21-mile circuit represents more than just a charmingly loose collection of mineshafts. Rather, the ghost towns and, most dramatically of all, the buckled headframes and mining camp hoists have come to embody an idealisation of the American dream. It is telling that the names of the camps are Silver Spoon, Diamond Dolly, Upper Oro and Hopemore. But those with a silver gleam in their eyes are advised against any Indiana Jones type antics: all treasure hunting and metal detecting is strictly forbidden.
Leadville's name evokes tin-hatted miners picking through ore, but the town turns out to be equally infused with the spirit of a Wild West film set. There are around a dozen beautiful buildings that sag characterfully, bringing to mind the rootin' tootin' cowboy country of Buffalo Bill and Doc Holliday, both of whom visited during their late-19th-Century heyday. Walk south down Harrison Avenue from the National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum and on the left is the Delaware Hotel, once a premier lodging for mining magnates. A few blocks away, you see the Tabor Opera House, constructed by silver baron Horace Tabor in 1879, and where miners and madams once mingled.
Locals might tell you Oscar Wilde once performed there, while such was the fiscal boom that an additional door was built to get circus elephants into the opera house. One night, illusionist Harry Houdini is also said to have disappeared through the stage's trap door. It's easy to understand how he must have felt. Entering Leadville today feels like slipping through a portal into another time.
Perhaps the most engrossing example of the street's preserved architecture is a timber-clad landmark across the road: the Silver Dollar Saloon, where tipplers can still order a whiskey under the diamond dust mirrors at the original wooden bar from 1879.
""You couldn't label Leadville as the capital of the Old Wild West, especially when weighed against other legendary towns like Dodge City or Tombstone, but it certainly played a pivotal role during the transformative gold and silver rush eras,"" said Adam Ducharme, Lake County's tourism and economic development director. ""Walk into the Silver Dollar Saloon and you're not just stepping into a bar â it's an immersion into a living relic of this time.""
But wherever you go in Colorado in winter these days, the subject everyone is obsessed with is not silver dollars, but snowfall â and 11 miles farther along US Route 24, the next chapter in Leadville's untold history is slowly revealed.
Ski Cooper isn't Colorado's most celebrated mountain resort, but where it beats others in the state is it retains the authenticity of a mountain as it used to be. Non-profit and municipality owned, it looks out to Mount Elbert, the state's highest mountain at 4,399m (14,433ft). More than that, the landscape has the emptiness that purists seek away from the surrounding busier towns.
""Cooper is not a resort, but a place to come skiing,"" said head of operations Patrick Torsell. ""We only have three lifts â nothing compared to the mega-resorts â but Leadville locals have a strong relationship with us and our history. It's a peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches in the parking lot kind of place.""
More like this:
â¢ The US' awe-inspiring 'Highway to the Sky'
â¢ A 210km drive through 'the most beautiful place on Earth'
â¢Â An epic road trip over and under the Atlantic Ocean
Likewise, this is a mountain that covers its tracks well. For this is where Colorado's ski culture began.
The story starts with the first mountain unit in US military history, the 10th Mountain Division of World War Two. In summer 1941, its soldiers received extensive training in winter warfare on Cooper Hill, constructing what was then the world's longest draglift. Then, in the winter of 1944-1945, three of its regiments marshalled a series of surprise attacks during a surprise offensive in Italy's Apennine Mountains. It's a melancholy tale: around 1,000 soldiers were killed and 4,000 injured. And yet, their actions were instrumental in Germany's later surrender.
What many don't know is following their return to the Rockies, the 10th's veterans shaped the American ski industry. More than 66 ski resorts were managed or founded by former military personnel, including Aspen, Vail and Arapahoe Basin â and this taps into a broader strain of patriotism among locals today.
At Arapahoe Basin, during the 1953-1954 season, for instance, the unit installed the first Poma lift in the US. Then, in 1957 at Winter Park, they constructed two draglifts said to be the fastest in the world. The division's backcountry cabins, once used for deep-snow combat training, are now open to visitors to book year-round.
But that's not all. Six miles from Leadville in the Pando Valley, the 10th Mountain Division trained at Camp Hale. Sitting between sheer-sided rocky spurs and snow-daubed mountains with the Eagle River winding nearby, it was once a sprawling encampment of 14,000 soldiers, 226 barracks, 100 mess halls, three theatres, a chapel, horse and mule barns and a hospital. Little remains nowadays, but a 10-stop self-guided tour of relics snakes past ammunition bunkers, a guard shack and a field house. To be so rapidly transplanted from pistes to pistols fires the imagination.
The best story at Camp Hale concerns the CIA, which took over the base in the 1950s to train secretive special ops teams. At one time, 170 Tibetans were drafted in for secret operations against the Communist government in China. The unexpected coda is locals were told it was a test site for bombs. Nowadays, with snowshoe, hiking, biking and horse-riding trails, it is a less-assuming and simpler world away from the currents of history.
In few places in Colorado are the ghosts of the past so alive as on US Route 24. Leadville, this Wild West city in the clouds, is faithful to this picture. It then comes as a bit of a shock to head out on the road out of town, to leave the Old West and silver-rush-era mines behind in the rearview, to return to the 21st-Century of haulage trucks, roadside fast food stops and gas stations framed by the Rockies, in all their glory.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250307-six-european-walking-tours-that-celebrate-women,Five European walking tours that celebrate women,"From Manchester to ReykjavÃ­k, innovative tours are highlighting forgotten stories and re-incorporating female legacies into the popular tourist narrative.
A bouquet of white roses hangs from the bronze wrist of Emmeline Pankhurst. But her rallying stance â hand outstretched towards Manchester's former Free Trade Hall where she organised the first suffragette meetings that would change the course of British history â remains defiantly unchanged. Further bunches of white flowers, symbolising the purity of the women's suffrage movement and its fight for female political equality, have been tucked at her feet, wilting gently in the spring sunlight that filters through the city's skyscrapers. They are a reminder of the immense progress made in British women's rights since Pankhurst's early 20th-Century campaigns â and, perhaps, of how far there is left to go.
Manchester has long touted its association with the historic struggle for gender parity, yet the city's civic championing of the women who helped shape its progress is muted at best. When Pankhurst's bronze likeness (titled ""Rise Up, Women"") was unveiled in 2018, it became the first statue of a woman to be erected in a public space in the city since a monument of Queen Victoria was installed in Piccadilly Gardens in 1905. Even now, it is one of only four city-centre statues of named women, compared to 18 of men.
But a counter-revolution is quietly brewing. I'm visiting the Pankhurst statue as part of a new self-guided walking route, the Feminist Tour of Manchester, which explores little-known stories of its impactful women and historically marginalised LGBTQ+ figures.
Though the suffragettes naturally feature, it emphasises those who never became household names: for example, Mary Fildes, a trailblazing 19th-Century birth control activist; and Enriqueta Rylands, who founded the Neo-Gothic masterpiece that is the John Rylands Library, becoming the first woman to receive honorary Freedom of the City of Manchester. There's a thought-provoking stop at the Peterloo Massacre Memorial (commemorating those who lost their lives in a peaceful working-class protest for parliamentary representation and universal suffrage that turned violent); while the neon jumble of Chinatown's alleyways provides the backdrop to the story of the author and campaigner Alicia Little, whose work highlighted â and eventually helped change â the poor status of women's rights in British marital law.
""People have a feeling that there is feminist history in Manchester, but they can't pinpoint what it is,"" says Zakia Moulaoui Guery, founder of Invisible Cities, the social enterprise behind the tour, which launches this month. ""It's not too late to retrieve those stories or to have more of that representation.""
Manchester isn't the only city where under-represented women are getting their moment in the spotlight. Across Europe, feminist walking tours that uncover ""forgotten"" stories that have often been preserved in letters and diaries or handed down through word of mouth are gaining popularity. Here are five more tours re-incorporating female legacies into the popular tourist narrative.
Iceland regularly ranks at the top of the World Economic Forum's gender gap index, yet the urban planning of its capital, ReykjavÃ­k, doesn't necessarily reflect its progressive values. ""We don't even have a statue up of the first female democratically elected president in the world â there's no statue of her anywhere in ReykjavÃ­k,"" says resident Tinna Eik RakelardÃ³ttir, referring to Iceland's former president VigdÃ­s FinnbogadÃ³ttir.
Inspired by a tour she took in Ljubljana, Eik RakelardÃ³ttir launched the ReykjavÃ­k Feminist Walking Tour, unpicking 200 years of the nation's drive for gender equality and providing context from her experience as a woman in contemporary Icelandic society. The scenic walk begins in the neighbourhood of MÃ¦Ã°ragarÃ°ur before moving downtown through the capital's manicured squares, concluding at the historic school KvennskÃ³linn (ReykjavÃ­k Women's Gymnasium). Participants learn about FinnbogadÃ³ttir â who happened to be Eik RakelardÃ³ttir's neighbour growing up â alongside lesser-known women and marginalised groups whose influence on gender progress she feels should be more publicly visible. After all, she concludes: ""We should know what methods they used and let those stories inspire us.""
French gender and science researcher Averil Huck first noticed an absence of female representation upon moving to Prague and taking walking tours around the Czech capital, where just 5% of street names honouring people reference women. She began conducting her own research and launched Prague Feminist Tours in summer 2023. Her popular tour To the Roots of Czech Women's Emancipation leads participants through the city's spellbinding historic streets, taking in fabled landmarks such as the Charles Bridge, National Theatre and Old Town Square, while regaling them with the tales of those who fought for access to education, careers and voting rights in the 19th and early 20th Centuries.
She has since launched three additional tours, including one held around the festival of DuÅ¡iÄky (All Souls' Day) on 2 November, which takes place in the city's OlÅ¡any Cemeteries and pays tribute to nine of its most important female historical and cultural figures. ""We stop in front of their graves and light a little candle or leave a flower and I tell the stories of these people,"" says Huck. ""I like to do it in the fall because this cemetery is really overgrown with nature and the colours become beautiful.""
Criminals such as Jack the Ripper brought gritty infamy to the streets of London's East End in the 19th Century, yet the neighbourhood has also been home to scores of influential women â notably Mary Wollstonecraft, the writer and philosopher often dubbed Britain's first feminist; or prominent textile designer Anna Maria Garthwaite. Women of London, a tour company founded by Becky Laxton-Bass, spotlights both figures and countless other women who inhabited the vibrant neighbourhood from the 1660s through to the 1940s, analysing how they lived and highlighting the social issues they faced. ""I think it's an area of London lots of people don't really know, so it attracts both locals and tourists,"" says Laxton-Bass.
More like this:
â¢Â The female travellers who shaped the ancient world
â¢Â The women porters making history on Peru's Inca Trail
â¢Â In the steps of history's forgotten female explorers
The company also runs walking tours of Westminster and Bloomsbury, unearthing women's stories rarely relayed by traditional tours and crafting a narrative that blends historical and contemporary feminist issues. ""My hope,"" says Laxton-Bass, ""is that people realise that women's history is everywhere.""
In Paris, Julie MarangÃ© launched her first walking tour, focussing on feminist street art, after being disappointed by the French reaction to the #MeToo movement. It led to the creation of Feminists in the City, which now operates in the French capital as well as Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse and Marseille, and spotlights women through history and culture via walking tours, conferences and masterclasses. Its most popular tour is currently The Witch Hunt, Powerful Women of Paris, which uncovers the powerful women accused of sorcery from the Middle Ages onwards. Another centres on female sexual liberation in the lively streets of the Pigalle neighbourhood, delving into the rebellious and subversive feminist roots of the French can-can dance now associated with the Moulin Rouge and the story of the venue's first known female clown, Cha-U-Kao. The tours are extensively researched by MarangÃ© with the help of the historian and womenâs rights specialist Claudine Monteil, who was a close friend of the legendary feminist Simone de Beauvoir. ""We're not re-writing history, we are just telling a different story,"" says MarangÃ©. ""It's a different angle, a different perspective; really it's about making women visible in the story of humanity.""
Amsterdam's modern feminist history is inherently synonymous with the story of Anne Frank, the Jewish diarist who spent more than two years hidden in a secret annexe in the city alongside her family during World War Two and became one of the most famous victims of the Holocaust. These days, Anne Frank's House receives more than one million visitors annually â but the Dutch capital's gabled canal-front buildings have cultivated plenty of other female legends.
Many of them are brought to light on Martine Bontjes' Women of Amsterdam tour that loops through the city's historic centre, taking in the work of pioneering figures such as Lijsbeth Vaas, an 18th-Century undercover police officer. Bontjes, whose viewpoint is also inspired by her grandmother's experiences as a woman securing financial independence in post-WW2 Amsterdam, launched her popular tour in 2022 and now runs it every week. ""It's something that so many women are now connected to, since there are so many laws now under pressure,"" she says. ""I believe that this really is the time for women to come together and to share stories.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250305-the-grannies-who-saved-albanian-cuisine,The grannies who saved Albanian cuisine,"After being sealed off from the outside world for decades and experiencing a mass exodus, Albania is leaning into its culinary roots with the help of grandma chefs.
Tefta Pajenga, aged 76, is one of many pension-age TV chefs in Albania. In her nationally televised cooking show, the retired teacher instructs a younger housewife how to cook japrakÃ«, a traditional platter of vine leaves stuffed with rice and herbs.
JaprakÃ« holds a special place in Albanian hearts. It's typically prepared by families together and then shared on Christian and Muslim feast days in this religiously diverse nation. Like so many dishes in this culinary crossroads, the recipe comes from elsewhere (the name derives from the Turkish word for ""leaf"", courtesy of Albania's more-than 500 years under Ottoman rule). Yet, the ingredients are all local: dill, peppers and mint from northern Albania.
Today, Albanian grannies like Pajenga are teaching multiple generations in one of Europe's youngest-aged countries how to cook age-old dishes. That's because the Balkan nation has suffered not one, but two bouts of culinary amnesia over the past 80 years.
First, from 1946 to 1991, Albania was ruled by hardline communists who effectively sealed the small, mountainous nation off from the outside world, leading Edi Rama, the nation's current prime minister, to say it was once ""the North Korea of Europe"". During this period, cookbooks were burnt, imports were prohibited, foreign travel was banned, food was collectivised and shortages were widespread. It was a recipe for disaster.
Second, in the violent build-up and aftermath of communism's collapse in the 1990s, 710,000 citizens â 20% of the population âÂ fled Albania from 1989 to 2001 in search of work in other countries. Over time, Pajenga said that many of these emigrants forgot their grandmothers' recipes as they adapted to new countries and cultures. Between the widespread food shortages during communism and the subsequent emigration after it, by the early 21st Century, many Albanians at home and abroad had forgotten how to prepare traditional Albanian cuisine â except for women of a certain age.
Ironically, Pajenga says that the Albania's transition to democracy compounded the problem. ""During communism, people had one fixed job from 07:00 until 15:00,"" she recalls. ""When democracy came, you needed more than one job to feed the family."" Therefore, many of those who did recall how to prepare traditional Albanian dishes now no longer had the time to make them.
So, when Pajenga started her TV show in 2004, ""my audience was not for chefs but for housewives"" and also young people, ""who were lacking the knowledge or had forgotten how to make traditional cuisine"".
Albania's culinary culture has long reflected its status as a stepping stone between East and West. The Romans introduced grapes, olives and other modern Albanian staples when they took hold of the area in the 2nd Century BCE. Starting in the 16th Century, dishes like Arnavut ciÄeri (Albanian liver) spread east from Albania across the Ottoman Empire, while sutlijaÅ¡ (rice pudding) likely arrived in Albania courtesy of the Ottomans. And after World War Two, imported dishes like ajvar (a relish made from roasted red peppers, aubergine and spices) migrated south from the northern Balkans.
Some indigenous foods, like mishavinÃ«Â (a type of white, grainy cheese), cannot be found anywhere else. Its preparation method, in which curd is packed tightly for three months inside animal fat until it ferments into a piquant cheese, has been passed down by generations of transhumant herders in the Albanian Alps. Other age-old Albanian dishes include flia, a pancake with crepe-like layers brushed with cream, and byrek me mish, a Turkish-style borek laced with paprika.
Gjyste Bici, 67, learned centuries-old recipes at her grandmother's knee in Albania's northern Alps, where snowy winters can still cut off residents for months at a time. ""Even before communism there was little material published, so recipes were always passed from grandmothers to younger generations,"" she says.
Many Albanian recipes have a religious root. This was frowned upon under communism, especially after 1967, when authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha banned all religious practices.
""The dictatorship tried to destroy all religions,"" recalls Dallendyshe Xhahysa, a 91-year-old amateur chef who memorised Albanian recipes from her ancestors and made them through the country's near-half century of communist rule. According to Xhahysa, ""recipes used in Muslim and Christian celebrations never would have survived if it wasn't for the efforts of grandmothers like me"".
""We had to cook special dishes secretly during Easter or Ramadan,"" continues Xhahysa. One such dish was halva, a dense, fudge-like dessert traditionally shared on the holiest day of Ramadan, Lailat al Qadr.
""If you cooked halva over Ramadan, neighbours would spy on you in order to get a bonus from the state,"" Xhahysa remembers. So as not to attract attention, the ingredients were purchased weeks in advance. ""We would cook halva with the windows closed or curtains drawn"" to curtail the fragrant waft of sugar, nuts and rosewater.
The punishment if caught preparing a religious feast was harsh. ""We could be taken to a re-education camp for many months to be given a bad job, like cleaning a jail in a remote area,"" recalls Xhahysa, shuddering.
Extreme food shortages led to the loss of other recipes. ""Very few people were allowed to keep animals or farm land,"" explains Bici. Only those in rural areas were allowed to work a 50-sq-m plot and keep a few chickens. ""It was forbidden to own a pig or sheep.""
Everything was rationed, continues Bici. ""Each month you were allowed 10kg of potatoes and 2kg of cheese per family.""
Without easy access to ingredients or cookbooks, centuries-old recipes like tavÃ« krapi (a baked carp casserole) were largely forgotten due to the prohibition of private fishing.
When Albania's borders finally opened up in the 1990s and its national television networks were no longer controlled by the state, many grannies started using TV to revive the nation's long-lost culinary heritage.
Bici began cooking on the show The Albanian Sunday in 2007, showcasing recipes she says were cooked ""for thousands of years"", like lakror me arra (an Albanian pie often made with layered ricotta, nettles, leeks, lamb and nuts).
But while Bici and Pajenga's cooking shows were helping to revive traditional recipes, they were fighting against another tide: farmers in rural Albania were migrating to Tirana in search of work and many rural villages became ghost towns. ""Farming has still not fully recovered from what happened [in the decades after communism],"" says Pajenga.
Bici has made it her mission to ensure Albania's traditional recipes aren't forgotten a third time. The grandmother has collated age-old cooking methods in a book, Unique Cuisine of the Albanian Highlands. She also cooks mountain recipes on the TV show Histori Shqiptare (Albanian History).
""I have many requests from Instagram for old recipes,"" Bici says. ""If youngsters follow my recipe for lakror on TikTok, that's fine too.""
Xhahysa, now a great-grandmother, is also still sharing her knowledge. She started cooking with her grandmother in the 1930s and contributed recipes to Albania's first farm-to-fork restaurant, Uka Farm, a Tirana-based wine bar and agrotourism that has inspired 100 rural farm stays across Albania.
Xhahysa's recipe of fÃ«rgesÃ« (a baked vegetable dish with cheese) is a popular appetiser at Uka Farm. The farm's butter-fried peppers served with a big dollop of gjizÃ« (a ricotta-style cheese) is a taste of Albaniaâs forgotten past.
Inspired by Pajenga, Bici and other TV-cooking grannies, a 2018 event in Tirana pairing 12 grandmothers with 12 top chefs became an instant Albanian sensation, spawning several granny-meets-millennial TV shows like Gjyshet Milionere (""Millionaire Grandmothers"").
The event was hosted by one of Albania's most famous chefs, Bledar Kola, who has dedicated much of his career to championing traditional Albanian cuisine. ""Not being too cocky,"" says Kola, ""but this show started a small spark on a big fire.""
After a career working in Europe's top restaurants, including stages at Le Gavroche in London and noma in Copenhagen, Kola returned to Tirana a decade ago to present ancient Albanian recipes in a more modern way at the capital's top restaurant Mullixhiu. In the absence of cookbooks, he also picked up skills from an Albanian granny.

â¢ The Peak of the Balkans Trail: Europe's last true wilderness
â¢ A new 5,500km bike trail connecting one of Europe's most remote regions
â¢ KukÃ«s: The first city ever nominated for a Nobel Prize
Now Kola is going one step further by opening a traditional restaurant in Gjirokaster, a Unesco-inscribed city in southern Albania. At the forthcoming rural restaurant Mullixhino (which is expected to open in late 2025), the focus is squarely on Albania's age-old dishes. ""The cuisine will be garden-inspired, everything cooked on an open fire, in an open kitchen,"" says Kola.
The restaurant's recipes are an homage to Albanian grandmothers. ""We've been meeting grandmothers for coffee to come up with a great concept,"" says Kola. ""We will serve traditional food from Albania's south, influenced by grandmothers in the region.""
A new foodie almanac containing 7,000 Albanian ingredients, dishes and cooking methods â many sourced from grandmothers â is also in progress and is being co-written by Kola's brother Nikolin, alongside nine academics.
Nikolin believes the book ""will raise awareness of Albanian food, like what RenÃ© [Redzepi] did for Danish cooking"".
Thanks to grannies, Albanian cuisine is finally being reborn.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250306-japans-spectacular-island-hopping-bike-trail,Japan's spectacular island-hopping bike trail,"The 70km Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.
As I cycled along the asphalt road, the rural Japanese landscape of rolling hills merged with the sea at low tide. Rifts of sunlight gleamed dimly on the water, minutes before dusk. The small, round body of a stone-carved Jizo Bosatsu â a custodian Buddhist deity â was seated on the rocky shore, guarding people from maritime accidents. It felt like a scene from Japanese folklore.
On a month-long trip to Japan last November, I was actively looking to avoid the busy cities and experience a rural slice of the country instead. This was how I came across Shimanami Kaido, a 70km-long cycling route that links the main islands of Honshu and Shikoku, weaving through six smaller islands floating in the Seto Inland Sea, a vast body of water that spreads for 400km connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan.
For millennia, these small, mountainous islands were only accessible by boat until the Nishi Seto Expressway was constructed for road transport in 1999. The Shimanami Kaido cycle path runs parallel to the motorway, connecting Onomichi in Honshu Island to Imabari in Shikoku Island via some of the world's longest suspension bridges. Designated as Japan's first ""National Cycling Route"" in 2019, Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.
Cyclist Mei Nakamura says that the trail offers a perfect mix of rural Japan's relaxed charm with opportunities to enjoy great cuisine and fresh seafood. ""What makes the Shimanami Kaido special is that it's enjoyable for everyone,"" she explains, ""from experienced road cyclists like myself to people who usually ride city bikes."" And the slow, peaceful rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea creates a calm and welcoming vibe. ""It's one of the things I love most about it.""
Yet, it is more than just a cycling route that crisscrosses seaside villages. Yoshi Kubota, general manager of the boutique hotel Azumi Setoda in Ikuchijima IslandÂ â a key stop along the wayÂ â says that Shimanami Kaido can be a great model for addressing overtourism. Nearly 35 million tourists flocked to Japan in 2024, most of them visiting tourist sites in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. But as demand for cycle tourism grows globally, bike routes like Shimanami Kaido help bring visitors to other parts of Japan to experience a relaxing atmosphere, bucolic scenery and local culture.
""You can promote cycle tourism and encourage people to stay longer in smaller communities. It helps distribute visitors evenly while benefiting the local economy,"" Kubota says. ""When you interact with locals, you get the feeling of actually living there. And you experience the slow life on the islands.""
When I arrived at the small seaport city of Onomichi to begin my journey, I could see what Kubota was talking about. On a sunny autumn day it felt as if time had lost its meaning here. Families flocked to the harbourfront to enjoy matcha ice cream, lemonade bars lined the pedestrian alleys and narrow lanes cut through the hillside town past a series of Buddhist shrines known as the Temple Walk. As I climbed up to the famous Senkoji Temple, the cityscape unravelled before me. Cargo vessels were moored to the pier. Beyond them was a chain of jungle-studded islets, bound by the sea's vastness.
Although experienced cyclists can finish the entire 70km length in a few hours, I decided to cycle a 50km stretch over a single day. I was â quite ambitiously â armed with my experience as a child cyclist who leisurely pottered behind my father during his weekend rides in Sri Lanka. Luckily for me â and other beginners â Shimanamai Kaido is safe and easy to navigate, with luggage delivery services, rest spots, vending machines and bicycle repair shops along the way. The entire bike path is clearly indicated by a blue line painted on the side of the road, and is mostly car-free and flat with gradual inclines near the bridges with dedicated cycle passageways. Several companies offer bike rentals (including e-bikes), and cyclists can rent and drop off their bikes along the way.
Although a bridge connects Onomichi with the neighbouring Mukaishima Island, I opted for the short ferry ride between the two. When I rolled off the ferry in Mukaishima, I set off along the blue-lined pathway and rode past along the seafront, from where I could see the distant bridges of Shimanami Kaido as ferries drifted across the water. Before long, the next-door Iwashi Island came into view and I wheeled in along the circling road to my first crossing, the 770m-long Innoshima Bridge.
Over the next few hours, I took several detours through Innoshima Island. Although fit cyclists can ride up to Mount Shirataki along a steep, twisty road, many find it easier to tackle on foot. The observation deck, surrounded by 700 stone Buddhas, looks over the expressway that snakes past the green thicket before it joins the Innoshima bridge. Forested islands and the Inland Sea stretch off into the distance. It's said that the temple here was built by the Murakami Suigun, a maritime clan who controlled the trade in these treacherous sea routes from the 13th to 16th Centuries, and the island's Suigun Museum showcases their artefacts.
As I rode through Innoshima, patches of citrus groves clung to the hilly vistas, and I stopped for daifuku (Japanese rice cake) â stuffed with sweet, sour and slightly bitter local hassaku oranges â at the Hassakuya confectionery. With mild weather throughout the year and fewer typhoons, the Setouchi region (as the area surrounding the Seto Inland Sea is called) produces most of Japan's lemons. In fact, the town of Setoda on Ikuchijima Island, almost at the midpoint of Shimanami Kaido, is regarded as the origin of lemon cultivation in Japan. It's still a key production area, evident in a series of shops, restaurants and cafes that line the 600m picturesque main drag selling everything citrus-made from lemon ramen to lemon beer, tarts, cakes, juice and gelato.
After a long day, I decided to stay the night at a guesthouse. But first I headed to Setoda's Kosanji Temple. Built over a span of 30 years by the steel merchant Kosanji Kozo in memory of her mother, the temple's colourful pagoda replicates architectural styles from all over Japan and a dimly lit cave illustrates a Buddhist hell. It also houses an Italian white-marble garden called Miraishin no Oka (meaning ""eternal hope for the future"") with gleaming towers. A couple of blocks away, I soaked at the town's sento (public bath) where navy-blue mosaics cover the walls with murals of the sea.
In recent years, Setoda, like the surrounding islands, has seen a rise in accommodations, cafes and restaurants. When I spoke to Kubota later, she told me that Shimanami Kaido has helped revive the region where most locals have left for cities for better opportunities. With new businesses cropping up, she explained that some of the island's younger people are now returning home. As locals, too, frequent these establishments, it's now ""gradually transforming the town"", she says.

The next afternoon, I set off for another 9km with the plan of returning to Setoda for one more night. The palm-lined cycle path followed the coast, from where I could see, hear and feel the rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea. As I continued, other cyclists rode past and men gathered to fish. Ferries sailed. Grandmothers rode their bikes with groceries. At Setoda Sunset Beach, families came together for a weekend picnic, their laughter filling the air.
I cycled past a few scattered settlements as the road ascended through lemon farms towards the impressive, 1,480m Tatara Bridge with its long, fan-like cables. After traversing my third bridge of the journey, I entered the island of Omoshima, where I watched local families setting up their tents on a camping ground as I munched on onigiri (rice balls) inside a small wooden hut next to a convenience store by the sea.
Heading back, I reached Setoda just in time for sunset. The waterfront was brimming with people catching the last light of the day. As I settled in for homemade lemonade from a nearby cafe, I thought about how cycling here helped me see a different side of Japan filled with stunning nature and the slow, idyllic atmosphere of the islands. By then, the novice cyclist in me was already planning a return trip next autumn.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240406-kek-lapis-the-most-beautiful-cake-for-ramadan,The most beautiful cake for Ramadan,"The cake is a sublime art form, involving numerous colours and flavours commingling into an oh-so-soft and delicious cake that hides a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.
The rich, buttery aroma of kek lapis (layer cake) greets me when I walk into Seri's (short for Sharifah Zainon) small baking studio at her home near Kuala Lumpur. The alluring aroma is not surprising, given that Malaysia is gearing up to celebrate Raya, which is short for Hari Raya (the Day of Celebration in Malay), and refers to the festive occasion marking the end of Ramadan. Kek lapis is an integral part of these festivities.
Seri puts her academic training as an engineer to good use in her current career as a baker. Watching her hands spreading the batter evenly on the pan, I think that baking a kek lapis is a bit like conducting a scientific experiment. Preparing this multi-layered Malaysian cake with colourful and complex patterns not only requires knowledge and skill, but also oodles of patience, an eye for precision and a steady hand.
A degree in the sciences seems to come in handy for kek lapis bakers, seeing the elaborate designs that Karen Chai, another engineer turned baker, creates at her baking studio in a quiet Kuala Lumpur suburb. When Chai returned to Malaysia after studying pastry arts at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, she decided to focus on kek lapis, using her mother's recipe as a starting point. ""Learning about the science of baking has been very useful in making kek lapis,"" she said.
This layer cake first came to Malaysia from neighbouring Indonesia through the state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo. In the mid-19th Century, Dutch colonisers introduced the plain European spit cake â made with layers of dough deposited one by one onto a cylindrical rotating spit â to the nation then known as Batavia (now Jakarta). Indonesians added local spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg and turned it into the lapis legit, often known as the thousand-layer cake.
Upon its arrival in neighbouring Malaysia in the 1970s, Sarawakians elevated the cake to a sublime art form, involving multiple layers and numerous colours and flavours commingling into the oh-so-soft and delicious kek lapis. While the classic kek lapis often looks like a plain loaf on the outside, cutting it reveals a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.
Also called the Sarawak layer cake, kek lapis typically has a minimum of 12 layers. The cake is created by carefully adding one thin layer of batter after another onto a baking pan every few minutes, broiling (or grilling) each layer in the oven to ensure the lower layers are never burnt. The plain version alternates light and dark strips of cake batter, whereas the coloured cakes have geometric patterns that, depending on the final pattern, can involve 20 or more layers.
The final cake is cooled and then cut into strips, with different pieces reassembled using thick jam or condensed milk as adhesive. Often, multiple cakes have to be baked, and pieces from each of them are assembled to create a complex pattern. This is then wrapped up in a thin cake layer of a single colour, or arranged between two sets of plain (ie, with no colours or patterns) multi-layered cakes.
If all this sounds confusing, then imagine what it is like for the baker. Even the most experienced of them first draws these patterns on paper, clearly marking out sizes and colours, after which they get to work with the batter. A complex design can take up to eight hours to complete, with several chances for error at every step in the assembly process.
Chai explains that as opposed to other complex layered cakes, it is particularly tough with kek lapis, since the error often becomes apparent only after the baker has finished assembling the pieces, ""so all the hard work goes down the drain"".
She then shows me photos of her mother's signature 16-piece design that was born out of an error in calculation. ""She baked a few extra layers by mistake and didn't want to throw those pieces away. She just cut that up and tried to form another block, and this design came out. So this is not something that you will find from other bakers,"" she said.
Both Seri and Chai say that the long and laborious baking process is worth the reward of seeing a perfectly executed design. ""But there are no short cuts,"" Chai warned. Indeed, seeing Seri at work, cutting and sticking these long strips together with a generous lashing of raspberry jam, brings to mind a complicated jigsaw puzzle slowly taking shape. ""It's like therapy, [but] it's also fun and creative"" she said.
When I visited in mid-February, the bakers had been working non-stop for weeks, fulfilling Raya orders received through their social media channels. Back in their hometowns in Sarawak, kek lapis is part of every holiday celebration, including Chinese New Year, Raya, Christmas and the midyear harvest festival of Gawai Dayak, cutting across communal and religious boundaries.
Seri's long-term client and self-professed cake lover, Farazaila Wahet, said, ""This is an anytime cake for me, but of course for Raya, it is a must."" The Sarawak native, who moved to Kuala Lumpur more than 10 years ago, said that the satisfaction she gets from kek lapis is unparalleled, because ""the texture is heavier and the taste is richer compared to any other cake.""
Kek lapis is available in many flavours, such as chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, red velvet and pandan (a tropical plant with a strong aroma, commonly used in Southeast Asian cooking). Even popular malted drinks like Horlicks and Milo are used for flavouring. And now, artisanal bakers like Seri and Chai are trying to modernise this traditional cake to make it relevant to younger generations, while also staying true to the original recipe.
Seri, for instance, makes exquisite chocolate batik art on the top layer to make her cakes even more attractive. ""Batik is traditional to Malaysia, so is kek lapis, and I love to combine the two to create this new version,"" she said.
More like this:
â¢ A multi-layered cake from India
â¢ Norway's best cake
â¢ The centuries-old baba made with 96 egg yolks
Chai keeps experimenting not just with more complicated patterns, but also new ingredients and flavour pairings. In the past, she has created gluten-free kek lapis using coconut flour with peanut butter topping, and another unique version with fig, apricot and cinnamon.
Baking a good kek lapis requires a lot of time and high-quality ingredients, which means that they are also expensive, with prices going up to RM300 (roughly Â£50) or more for a square, one-kilogram cake. But thankfully for the small-batch bakers, this traditional cake is constantly in demand from individual clients and it's also gaining in popularity as corporate gifts and wedding favours.
These bakers are on a mission to maintain this Sarawak culinary tradition, despite all the long hours and thin margins. As Seri said, ""Every time I make a kek lapis, it feels like a piece of home to me.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250304-can-mardi-gras-go-green,The environmental heroes cleaning up Mardi Gras,"A successful Mardi Gras used to be measured by how much waste it produced. Now, the world's largest free festival is trying to clean up.
The mood is festive as I board the pink and purple Mardi Gras float. Beautiful glass beads hang from hooks lined up above my head while burlap bags full of sustainable ""throws"" â the local moniker for items thrown to parade viewers, including biodegradable glitter and colourful but sustainably packaged beignet mix â sit at my feet. A jaunty brass rendition of the song ""Do whatcha wanna"", a Mardi Gras classic, fills the air as marching bands do quick practice runs of their sets. The Krewe of Freret, the first Mardi Gras parade to completely outlaw plastic throws, is ready to roll, kicking off a party that is both one of the most beloved and one of the most environmentally damaging festivals in New Orleans.
The Mardi Gras revelry in this city is known the world over. New Orleans welcomes millions of visitors during carnival season and more than 50 parades roll down the main streets of St Charles and Canal. Local bars and music venues are packed to the walls with tourists while elaborate Mardi Gras balls and other events meant mostly for locals happen behind closed doors. All in all, nearly $900m in income comes from the festivities, according to a recent Economic Impact study â almost 4% of the city's annual revenue.
The celebration lasts for more than a month, with ""local"" parades like the dog-themedÂ Barkus, where people dress their furry friends in Mardi Gras costumes and parade them through the French Quarter, rolling as early as three weeks before the final â and most famous â parades on ""Fat Tuesday"". These often include celebrity guests, massive floats and the iconic and ubiquitous plastic beads thrown by the handful into the crowds.
Unfortunately, all this fun also leads to an equal amount of rubbish. It's estimated that Mardi Gras creates around 1,000 tons of waste every year. In 2018, 93,000lb of plastic beads were found clogging up the city's sewer system, a dire situation in a city that lies partially below sea level and whose sewer systems are needed to keep the city dry.Â After the parades, rubbish can be knee-deep in the streets, and beads and streamers hang from trees like the Spanish moss native to the area. Though the city's Department of Sanitation does an almost miraculous job of cleaning the streets between parades, refuse still makes its way into the waterways in and around the city, posing a threat to both wildlife and people.
This year, however, a coalition of grassroots organisations, and individual ""krewes"", the local groups responsible for putting on the Mardi Gras parades, are attempting a transformation with the help of the city and some supportive sponsors. From massive recycling projects to biodegradable throws, New Orleans is doing its best to clean up its act.
According to a 2020 report by the Ecology Center, the plastic used to make Mardi Gras beads is toxic, containing high concentrations of arsenic, chlorine and lead. Further, the report found strong evidence that these beads are made from recycled e-waste, plastic from electronics treated with flame retardants. The sheer volume of beads that end up in the streets and sewers raises fears that these toxins will leach into their surroundings. Indeed, the areas around parade routes have already been found to have elevated lead levels and some of the chemicals found in the beads have been linked to increased cancer risk.
For a city that's both at major risk of flooding and located in what's known as Cancer AlleyÂ âÂ an 85-mile stretch along the banks of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge where residents have higher rates of cancer due to pollution from nearby petrochemical and manufacturing plants âÂ continuing to throw a massive party that stands to increase the risk of both may seem ill advised. However, the tradition of cheap plastic throws in some ways fuels the entire event.
""It is the largest celebration in the world, but who pays for it?"" asked Brett Davis, founding director of Grounds Krewe, one of the nonprofits spearheading the movement to make the festival more sustainable. ""It's the parading organisations and the krewes themselves. They do it with membership dues, they do it with balls and fundraisers, but more and more over the last 20 years [they do it] by importing huge quantities of cheap parade throws and selling them to all the people in their krewe for like a 600% markup.""
As Davis explains, the cheap beads are sold to locals or visitors who want to climb aboard a float and throw these trinkets to the crowds. And these sales fund the parades themselves, as it's the krewes, not the city, who put on Mardi Gras. A strict rule against any corporate advertising, intended to keep it feeling like a community event, makes it difficult to divest from the practice of selling plastic beads to members as throws.
And there's more at stake than just a free street party. Mardi Gras, and the traditions that take place in and around the festival, are part of the fabric of the city.
It's hard to overstate the importance of Mardi Gras in the larger culture of the New Orleans. Media representations of the event often focus on the drunken debauchery of Bourbon Street; however, most of the event is quite family friendly and something the entire city gets involved in. The Uptown parades, which take place on St Charles Avenue during the day, are crowded with children playing and elderly neighbours resting in lawn chairs waiting for the next float to pass by.
""Having the perspective of riding on a float and throwing what we're considering just junk beads to a young childâ¦ and their face lights up. It just brings tears to your eyes,"" said Linda Baynham, the Director of Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility at the New Orleans Ernest N Morial Convention Center.
She says the practice of throwing to the crowd can be meaningful despite the mess it causes. ""I like some beads,"" she added, showing off a small collection of purple, green and gold throws she'd already caught from passing floats that weekend. ""If you get this much from one parade, there's nothing wrong with that. If there's no beads, it gets to be a little disappointing.""
It's easy to see why locals and visitors are hesitant to give up the experience of ""playing catch with a city"", as several float riders put it. There's a community-building aspect to Mardi Gras that's hard to put into words, and for many, losing the traditions and celebrations that make up carnival season would feel like losing a major part of the city's soul. Simply outlawing throws altogether would likely lead to massive pushback from residents.
For Suzannah Powell, a producer and performing artist who serves as a sustainability advisor to the Krewe of Freret, part of her job was figuring out that balance between tradition and sustainability when making decisions about what is allowed on the floats and what isn't.
""We [still] have those plastic cups, which are everywhere. I'm a member of the plastic pollution coalition and in our ideal world, those things aren't even present. However, I actually advised that we should keep those as an offering because they're culturally such a huge thing,"" she explained. ""They're a sought-after throw and people like to keep them and have different ones across different years. In terms of trying to make a cultural shift, I thought that those cups are specifically a really great example of the bridge that we're crossing. You can't just come in and start swiping everything up with a machete. You have to make concessions for where people are actually at.""
So, what is the solution? Is it possible to make changes that will preserve the important cultural and financial benefits of Mardi Gras while also mitigating the extreme impact it has on the local environment?
One of the krewes that marches in the Boehme parade, one of the local parades that rolls through the French Quarter during the earlier part of the carnival season, is the Krewe of Recyclists. The group dresses up as comedic versions of recycling-themed superheroes, including Hans Can-Crusher, played by Kevin Fitzwilliam who is the founder of Atlas Beads, an organisation that distributes eco-friendly alternatives to plastic beads. Created as a pun based on Hans and Franz from Saturday Night Live, the character crushes cans with his muscles for recycling along the parade route to the amusement of party goers.
But New Orleans' recycling heroes are not just fictional characters created for carnival. The coalition of organisations, volunteers and sponsors that make up the Recycle Dat Initiative are working to help Mardi Gras, and the city of New Orleans, maintain both its traditions and the environment for years to come.
Started three years ago by Davis, Recycle Dat began as a handful of local volunteers with small recycling stations set up along the St Charles parade route, but has expanded exponentially since then, offering an alternative to the efficient, but less meticulous clean up done by the Department of Sanitation, which sends everything they capture to the landfill.
More like this:

â¢ The New Orleans landmark that almost became Napoleon's retirement home
â¢ A 'crazy town looking to go fossil free': Sweden's wooden city that was green before Greta
Last year, Recycle Dat collected 4,302lb of aluminium cans, 4,288lb of glass and around 12,697lb of beads and throws. Now with a new larger, more visible set up, they expect those numbers to be even larger. This year, the programme launched Recycle World, an interactive recycling station on St Charles and Louisiana Avenues where festival goers can drop off their unwanted throws and rubbish, volunteer to help sort cans, bottles and throws for recycling and even participate in an art project created out of recyclable materials gathered on site.
Grounds Krewe are also instrumental in making sure alternatives to plastic beads are available to krewes during the season. The organisation offers a variety of sustainable throws, including jambalaya mix, soap and biodegradable glitter, to name just a few â all of which can be individually branded according to the krewe's themes.
For those still interested in throwing necklaces, Atlas Beads offers handmade creations by a women's collective in Uganda; their beautiful beaded necklaces, bracelets and earrings, lovingly spun from discarded magazine paper, are much more likely to be prized by parade-goers than left behind as rubbish.
In the end it's the krewes who decide which throws to use, but even there, a sustainable groundswell seems to be taking hold. This year was the first time that the Krewe of Freret completely outlawed plastic beads from their floats, opting instead to throw glass beads and other more useable items, a move they say garnered massive support from the community.
""The reaction [to Freret banning plastic beads] was huge,"" Powell said. ""It actually sent ripples around the city. The [krewe's] website shut down that day because there was so much traffic and this was the biggest year that the Krewe of Freret has ever been. They had to add two additional floats just to accommodate the new members.""
Not only did their actions encourage more members to join the Krewe of Freret, the grassroots movement to green carnival may also have inspired one of the largest Mardi Gras krewes, the Krewe of Rex, to experiment with using more sustainable throws, such as stainless-steel cups, wildflower kits and natural fibre tote bags. The Krewe of Rex are known as the ""King of Carnival"" because so many of the Mardi Gras traditions started with them â including the tradition of throwing beads â so their use of sustainable throws this year is a massive sign that things are changing.
Over two days, traversing the city of New Orleans from Uptown to the French Quarter, everyone I spoke to was thrilled to learn about the efforts to make Mardi Gras more sustainable. One visitor, who described wading through waist-deep debris to retrieve a dropped phone, was particularly enthused. There was also widespread interest, and ideas, regarding potential new kinds of throws, with suggestions ranging from local art to food to books.
Green or not, it's clear that no one wants to see the end of Mardi Gras. The question is whether this movement can catch on in time to make an impact on an already beleaguered urban ecosystem. Fitzwilliam believes the artists and activists working on the issue are on track to make it happen in classic New Orleans style: ""Garnering support for a more environmentally friendly Mardi Gras is best accomplished by simply having more fun than the other side.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250228-the-irish-island-where-you-go-to-disconnect,The Irish island where time stands still,"Located off Donegal's coast, this car-free isle was last inhabited full-time in the '70s. Now, locals are resurrecting a lost way of life â and adventurous travellers are welcome.
Friday night on Owey Island and it's like we've been time-warped into the Ireland of years gone by. Smoke from burning turf fills the air as the small cluster of locals potter in and out of their well-maintained houses, sharing freshly caught fish and odd jobs. Friendly dogs roam free and chickens strut about. And as the roar of the sea and rustling of the reeds harmonise with warm, convivial chatter, it's hard to believe this lively haven lay dormant for decades.
Located off the coast of west Donegal in the Atlantic Ocean, the remote island of Owey (or Uaigh in Irish, meaning ""cave"") is approximately 15 minutes by boat from Cruit Island, which is joined to the mainland via a short car bridge. There is no ferry service to Owey, visitors can only access the island by kayak or private boat. There's also no electricity or running water, so only the distant lights twinkling from the mainland hint of civilisation â and modern-day pressures â further away.
Last inhabited full-time in the 1970s, the island was home to around 100 residents and about 30 families at its pinnacle. But the lure of modern conveniences on the mainland led to a dwindling population, with the last remaining islanders leaving in 1977 and the place lying abandoned for more than 25 years.
I was spending a long weekend on Owey with the Wild Women of the Woods (Northern Ireland), an organisation of more than 4,000 members that aims to connect women from all over Ireland to experience nature and adventure together in wild, untamed settings. Outdoor enthusiast Rachel Pedder, who set up the organisation, wanted to bring the group ""somewhere that was off the beaten track and not generally accessible"".
She explained: ""It is hard to get to. At any of the other islands you can rock up at on a ferry and have a dander about and stay, whereas Owey it very much belongs to the community. You have to be very respectful of the fact that it's really their island and as long as you respect that, then they are welcoming."" she added.
Paul Cowan, one of the first wave pioneering Owey's renaissance, spent his teenage years on Owey, having moved here with his family in the early 1970s to escape the unrest on the streets of Belfast at the height of the Troubles.Â ""My mother's from Rutland Island, which is the next island to it,"" explained Cowan. ""The Troubles had got really bad and my father thought the best way out was to buy a house on an island. That was it. We all moved [to Owey].""
Having since returned to Belfast to marry and settle with their own families, Cowan and his brother decided to take their kids on a boat trip to Owey in the early 2000s for a change of scene.
Despite finding the island deserted, with many of the old cottages and outhouses turned to ruin after more than 25 years of neglect against the Atlantic breeze, the brothers saw the potential in the place as a peaceful escape from their busy, city lives. Along with some of their other siblings (there are 12 of them altogether) they set about fixing up the old family home and started building new houses.
Seeing fresh life breathed into the place, other descendants of the island, who like Cowan had spent time there throughout their youth, were inspired to return and fix up the old properties in an attempt to return Owey to its former glory. Resurrecting the dilapidated houses was no easy task, however, with all supplies having to be brought over by boat. But around 20 homes are now standing, with a seasonal community of 20-30 people living here during the warmer months. There is also one hostel that sleeps up to six people (and a spot for wild camping), but no shops or other facilities.
Owey's isolation is what attracts both locals and travellers. The seasonal community are passionate about keeping the island untouched by present-day conventions. Visitors are generally wanting to disconnect from the fast pace of life elsewhere or seeking adventure, with the rugged landscape attracting kayakers for the sea caves and rock climbers for the sea cliffs, as well as hill walkers.
Six of our 14-strong group were staying in Owey Island Cottage Hostel, which islander Niall McGinley opens up to visitors in summer, and others were camping in the next-door-neighbour's garden.
The hostel was once McGinley's grandmother's home and the last house on the island to be lived in, so it has weathered the decades of neglect better than most. Still retaining much of its original furniture, the cottage has two bedrooms off the main living space, where there's a gas stove, table and chairs and an open fire for everyone to gather around in the evenings. Befitting how the islanders have always lived, amenities are limited to a compost toilet in an outhouse, just a stroll away at the back of the cottage.
One local, Frankie Gallagher, calls the island home because it's the birthplace of his father, and after growing up in Scotland, he now divides his time between Owey (weather permitting) and the Donegal mainland. ""Certainly we would never be looking to get electricity into the island because we can actually do well around it,"" he said.
Alongside using gas and solar for heat, light and power, the islanders use tanks on the roof to collect rainwater. This allows Gallagher to have a gas shower in his home with the water pump running off solar. ""But it is slightly limited because there's only so much water that you can store so you have to be conscious about how long you're in the shower,"" he added.
Gallagher says this simpler lifestyle means sunsets are spectacular, with no light pollution and highly visible star constellations. He said apart from the occasional roar of a quad bike, the greatest noise pollution is from a corn crake, a rare â and noisy â bird that was once native to the island and often returns in summer.
The hostel is about 10 minutes on foot from where the boat docks, and after picking my bed for the night (with the help of a couple of curious free-range chickens) I sauntered down to the nearby ravine for a dip, catching the last of the sun as it glistened across the water.
The car-free island measures just more than 300 acres in total. The southern end is grassy and fertile with a small harbour for boats to berth. Steep steps from the pier bring you to a dirt path leading to the ""village centre"" where all the homes are built on either side of a long, narrow, gurgling stream, backed by undulating hills as far as the eye can see.
Fragments of the olden days remain in the form of crumbled stone ruins, including the old schoolhouse (there was once a school, a shop and a post office on the island) alongside signs of new life, like wheelbarrows and fishing tackle interspersed among vegetable plots and flowerbeds.
By contrast, the northern end of the island is exposed, rocky and barren â too rough to live on â with jagged cliffs jutting out from the sea caves that give the island its name, accompanied by vertiginous sea stacks rising majestically from crashing waves buffeted by the northern winds.
A highlight of my trip was an adrenalin-fuelled kayaking tour of the sea caves with Selkie Sailing, a family-run business where husband and wife team, Gareth and Amanda Doherty, guide large groups across the water from Cruit Island on sit-on-top kayaks. We spent an exhilarating three hours on Saturday afternoon negotiating the waves around the rocks on the environs of the island, squeezing through soaring granite structures and meandering in and out of crevices so cinematic it was like we were extras in a movie.
To enjoy this unspoilt beauty in a more laid-back way, on Sunday afternoon, our group went in search of a clifftop lake, hidden amongst the rocks at the back of the island with a panoramic view of the sea. It's where one of the islanders told us they often go for a wash and a dip. To reach it, we climbed wild path north of the hostel, ascended a grassy hill that led to a plateaued cliffside and then carefully made our way down glistening pink and grey granite to discover the lagoon in all its glory.
Plunging into shiny, black freshwater flanked by moss-covered rocks, we swam, washed and laughed â engulfed by the surreal beauty of being in a clifftop lake overlooking the ocean. I surprised myself by how relaxed I felt around people I'd only just met and a sense of peace enveloped me. We were blissfully marooned together on island time. Our roles as mums, grannies, professionals and partners were whisked away with the Atlantic wind. There was nowhere to be and nothing to rush for.

Our last night on Owey was similar to the other evenings on the island: we prepared vegetables outside the cottage while the sun went down, cooked on the gas stove in candlelight and feasted on bean stew and wine around the campfire where the small group of locals â who we'd got to know over the course of the weekend â joined us for more revelry and a rapturous sing-song.
Sitting outside, watching the flames of the fire dance in the wind and listening to a group rendition of the Rare Auld Times, one of my campmates turned to me and said, ""We're winning aren't we?"". Even though I'd only met her a couple of days before, I knew exactly what she meant: the fresh air, the island's stories relayed through song, the stars so visible in the night skyâ¦ the peacefulness of Owey.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250227-the-300km-route-shining-a-spotlight-on-sri-lankas-tea-history,A 300km hike into Sri Lanka's lush Highlands,"The recently opened Pekoe Trail, which runs for more than 300km through tea plantations, villages and forests, tells the story of Sri Lanka's complex and chequered tea history.
The sun is bright and harsh on my face when I stop to admire the view â okay, to catch my breath â at the top of the steep path. How is it that just 20 minutes ago, the skies were grey and moody with the threat of an imminent downpour? In Sri Lanka's central highlands, the weather may be capricious but what remains unchanged is the sprawling expanse of tea estates in every direction.
This region is where the bulk of soothing Ceylon tea comes from. And the recently opened Pekoe Trail, Sri Lanka's first long-distance hiking trail that runs for more than 300km through tea plantations, villages and forests, tells the story of Sri Lanka's complex and chequered tea history. This hiking trail, divided into 22 stages, begins in Sri Lanka's second largest city of Kandy, close to the area where Scotsman James Taylor first planted tea in the country in the mid-1800s. After a long and circuitous route, it finally ends in the hill town of Nuwara Eliya, whose cool climes and misty slopes are said to have reminded the British colonisers of Blighty (Britain).
The trail has existed in patches since those initial days of tea cultivation in Sri Lanka, beginning as basic mud tracks that were used to transport the leaves to factories and then onward to domestic markets and Colombo port for export. For Pekoe Trail founder and sustainable tourism consultant Miguel Cunat, creating this multi-stage, multi-day hike was a labour of love, involving nearly 10 years of research and exploration.
""My initial objective was to promote Sri Lanka as a world-class hiking destination,"" says the Spaniard and long-time Sri Lanka resident, who was keen to put the small island back on the tourism map after a disastrous spell with Covid and the subsequent economic crisis. His efforts came to fruition with the official opening of the Pekoe Trail in late 2023, with initial funding from the European Union and USAID.
""The trails are fairly easy, at low elevation and open all through the year. In that sense, this hike is for everyone,"" he explains. That means everyone, including novice hikers such as myself, have the option to stay in a hotel near the trail and go out on exploratory day hikes within a single stage. I also come to understand later from my trail guides that most visitors choose to do this instead of attempting the trail in its entirety.
And although tea is the common thread stitching this story together, each stage has its own unique elements â a colonial-era cricket club here, a seasonal waterfall there, statues of brightly coloured village deities, Anglican churches with brilliant stained-glass windows, distant views of a sharp peak or clusters of wildflowers blooming in the midst of a barren stretch. Cathy Cruse, a 62-year-old Australian hiker who recently set a record by completing the entire trail in seven days, agrees, saying, ""You've got the tea plantations and then you're going into thick jungle and then pine forests, and then at one stage I thought I was walking through Australia, with all the tall eucalyptus trees.""
Cunat's objective was also to bring tourist attention and money into the hinterlands and hill towns located away from the popular coastal destinations of Sri Lanka's south or the Buddhist Cultural Triangle of Anuradhapura, Sigiriya and Dambulla. Cruse, who is married to a Sri Lankan, says that she has visited Kandy and Nuwara Eliya several times but never had a chance â or indeed, a reason â to explore the more interior parts of the tea country.
As Cunat walked along the various trails, he also began to see a larger picture emerging from the network of villages and communities along the way. ""Along with nature, there is so much history and living heritage, with local fairs and festivals, and opportunities to see how [rural Sri Lankans] live and work,"" he says. And it is this aspect I most enjoy about my hikes â I am never too far from civilisation, be it a local temple or a tea factory, and I get to have regular interactions with friendly plantation workers and curious children everywhere. It is perhaps why Cruse stresses how safe the trail is for solo or women hikers. ""When I pick a trail, I'm looking for somewhere safe that a woman can tackle on her own and not feel intimidated. Not once did I ever feel nervous of my surroundings or my guides on the Pekoe Trail,"" she says.
The history of tea in Sri Lanka is inextricably linked with the Indian-Tamil plantation workers brought by the British. Their descendants â mostly women â still form the backbone of the lowest levels of tea production. Dressed in frayed button-down shirts and thick long skirts to protect from leeches, they spend their lives picking the finest leaves from the bushes. I see them walking up and down the tea estates, their hands nimble with years of practice, their necks bent with the load of the bamboo baskets tied to their heads, into which they carefully toss the leaves.
The women beam in delight when I speak to them in Tamil. ""Tell me about India,"" third-generation tea picker Sathyavathy demands, when I stop to chat with her group during their mid-morning tea break in the Bogawantalawa area, known as the ""Golden Valley"" due to its fine quality of tea. ""Is it beautiful?"" Like many of her peers, she has distant family back in the small towns of Tamil Nadu in South India but has never visited the country.
My initial hikes take me through stages seven and eight near Hatton in the heart of the tea country, dotted with old factories that still process tea using dated technology, and boutique hotels repurposed from massive bungalows once meant for estate managers. My guide here is Dharsharuban Rathnasingham, a young man whose grandparents and mother used to work in these very tea plantations.

Ruban â as he likes being called â is passionate about sharing the stories of his people, Indian Tamils who populate the villages and towns around the various stages of the Pekoe Trail. As we walk, he stops to point out the elements distinctive to tea plantation life, like the ""line rooms"", cramped barrack-style quarters where large families lived together (and still do, in some places); and the statues of fierce Tamil protector deities placed at major crossroads or beneath trees, often depicted riding a horse or wielding a scythe.
From Hatton, I take the famed Colombo to Badulla train to Ella, from where I attempt to tackle stages 15 and 16 over the next several days, taking in the viewpoint known as Ella Rock and the picturesque nine-arch railway bridge. Here, the tea goes in and out of view, with some stretches taking me over active railway tracks and others on paths shaded by tall eucalyptus and pine trees. The Pekoe Trail may be long and even tough in parts, but it is never boring or monotonous.
As Cruse says, ""There were just so many 'wow' moments during the hike, where you come around a corner, and the whole valley would just be laid out below and I would have to stop and just stare.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250228-wismar-the-scenic-german-city-that-inspired-a-horror-classic,The scenic German city that inspired a horror film,"More than a century after its medieval centre served as the backdrop of Nosferatu, a new Oscar-nominated remake is putting this Gothic city back on the map.
I gasp. A gaunt vampire with menacing fingernails on the prow of a schooner looms before me, sending a chill up my spine.
I'm standing before the Wassertor gate in Wismar, a windswept gabled and red-brick Gothic city on northern Germany's Baltic coast. I had been wandering the cobblestone streets leading from the harbour towards the city's medieval, Unesco-inscribed centre, when my eye caught the small plaque bearing a stylised vampire that stopped me in my tracks.
I've come to Wismar to trace one shadow of Germany's dark past â the legacy of my German Jewish grandfather, Berthold Levi, who left behind a secret love child when he escaped Nazi Germany in 1937. But in retracing his steps and visiting my half-cousins, I've stumbled upon another shadow: that of Count Orlok, a vampire who terrorised these very streets more than a century ago. That's because Wismar isn't just a fetching medieval city; it's also the legendary setting of director FW Murnau's 1922 masterpiece Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.
Soon after I come face to face with the pint-sized vampire, my half-cousin Katharina leads me towards two other markers commemorating where Murnau shot some of cinema's most haunting scenes in this 13th-Century city: one at the sprawling Marktplatz square, where an ornate pavilion-like tower rises overhead; and another near the modest Holy Spirit Church, home to a beautiful garden.
A loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the silent film follows German real estate agent Thomas Hutter on his journey to Transylvania to meet Count Orlok. The vampire, mesmerised by Hutter's blood and a photograph of his wife Ellen, follows him back to the fictional ""Wisborg"" (Wismar), where he spreads plague and death until Ellen sacrifices herself, luring the vampire into the lethal rays of dawn.
The film's success, however, came at a cost. Stoker's widow sued the production company for copyright infringement and German courts ordered every copy ofÂ NosferatuÂ to be destroyed. Yet, like Count Orlok himself, the film refused to die: a few copies had already been made and were circulating in Europe.
And still,it refuses to rest. Robert Eggers' reimagined 2024 Nosferatu film, starring Lily-Rose Depp and Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd, breathed new life into the eternal tale. While Prague's Barrandov Studios stand in for Wismar, the adaptation honours Murnau's nightmarish vision and is up for four Academy Awards on 2 March.
Nosferatu's reach even extends to my current lodgings. In my half-cousin Alexander's home, a coffin greets visitors in the foyer, daggers and a taxidermy bat adorn the wall and fake spiders and cobwebs cling to every surface. I'd initially dismissed it as some kind of quirky goth aesthetic, but after eyeing the Nosferatu plaques, I wonder: is it an homage?
I'm quickly realising that, more than a century later, Wismar still relishes its role as the real-life setting behind one of horror's most enduring tales.
Today, Wismar remains refreshingly crowd-free, welcoming mostly Germans to enjoy the brief Baltic summer. Its tourism season begins in March with Herring Days (15-30 March 2025), when ""the whole market square smells of fried herring"", says the head of Wismar Tourism, Sibylle Donath, drawing locals out like fresh blood for Count Orlok.
One of the few times in recent memory when visitors did flock to this relatively quiet, 44,000-person city was in 2022 when Wismar (and much of Germany) celebrated Nosferatu's centennial with creativity and gusto. A Berlin museum hosted on-site blood donations. Konstanz held a lakeside production. In the nearby city of LÃ¼beck, where parts of the film were also shot, an illuminated Nosferatu-themed window installation was displayed in the warehouses that Count Orlok intended to purchase.
In Wismar, the city organised guided bat walks and the film was screened more than 50 times across many landmark venues. At the 13th-Century St George's Church, a Nosferatu theatre experience attracted 4,000 visitors. The city also launched Nosferatour, an immersive outdoor theatre production that's expected to return in 2026 where visitors follow towering papier-mache puppets through the city's medieval streets. And Festspiele, a classical music festival that organises about 190 concerts annually in the surrounding Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, hosted an extraordinary open-air event and screening in the harbour where Count Orlok's ship arrives.
""The harbour scene in Nosferatu is iconic,"" Ursula HaselbÃ¶ck, the director of Festspiele, told the BBC. ""Wismar's maritime history and old Hanseatic architecture create a very special atmosphere. You can almost imagine Nosferatu creeping through the streets â it's definitely best explored in daylight!""

â¢ Where people drink beer for breakfast
Now, just three years after the centennial, Wismar is gearing up to welcome even more Nosferatu fans. ""The new Nosferatu film [is reawakening interest] in the Hanseatic city of Wismar,"" Donath said. ""We are expecting tourists from abroad and also younger German-speaking guests. We are prepared: we have English-speaking guides and all people working in [the] tourism sector speak English too, as [do] many inhabitants.""
Nosferatu-themed tours of Wismar with an English-speaking guide are available upon request from March through October. For an especially memorable experience, Donath recommends Â requesting a guide in costume carrying a coffin. Visitors can also retrace Orlok's footsteps through a two-kilometreÂ self-guided walking tourÂ that extends from the Marktplatz square to the harbour.
Of course, there's more to Wismar than Nosferatu. Situated at the southern tip of the Baltic Sea and a member of the Hanseatic League (a medieval network of maritime traders spread across central and northern Europe) Wismar's connection to the sea remains strong. Today, it's a major German shipbuilding hub.
""The water connects, but it also divides,"" says Donath, noting how the city's position has shaped its destiny from a powerful Hanseatic port to a former Swedish territory. The city was under Swedish rule from 1648 to 1803 (a legacy still visible in its Baroque architecture) and celebrates its multicultural heritage in an annual Swedish Festival each August.

After tracing Orlok's footsteps through Wismar's half-timbered homes, Katharina and I hop aboard the Poeler Kogge ""Wissemara"", a floating museum that's a replica of a 14th-Century Hanseatic cog ship. These boats, carrying up to 300 tons of freight, fuelled the Hanseatic League's economic power and propelled the growth of North and Baltic Sea cities.Â (The Wissemara offers a number of educational sailing journeys, including three-hour cruises of the Wismar Bay and sailing to the island of Lieps to see seals.)
After learning how to tie sailing knots from the crew, I look back to the harbour. For a moment, it is easy to imagine Nosferatu's culminating scene, when Orlok's vessel drifts into Wismar's port, plague-infested rats are released and Orlok carries his coffin through the Wassertor towards Hutter's home. As the water shimmers in the late-afternoon sun and the brick-red harbour turns tangerine, I'm reminded of what Donath told me: ""We would love to share our city with more of the world.""
Perhaps soon, it will.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250228-the-soca-kings-guide-to-trinidad-and-tobago,A soca musician's guide to Trinidad and Tobago,"Soca musician Machel Montano shares his recs for enjoying his home nation during Carnival season and beyond.
Trinidad and Tobago, a twin-island nation in the southern Caribbean renowned for its annual Carnival celebration (3-4 March 2025), has far more to offer visitors than just massive parades.
The birthplace of soca (a musical genre blending calypso, African, Caribbean and South Asian rhythms), Trinidad and Tobago stuns with its incredible beaches, lush rainforests and diverse wildlife. But despite the islands' dynamic music and festival culture, locals' favourite pastime is liming â simply hanging out.
We asked Trinidadian native and ""King of Soca"" Machel Montano for the best ways to lime on his home islands. ""We are an island country of party and style,"" says the award-winning singer, songwriter, producer and actor. ""We celebrate through struggles and strife and especially celebrate our joys. Everything is a reason to come together.""
No matter which island youâre on (itâs about a three-hour ferry ride between the two), you can expect to feel a lively spirit. ""Trinidad and Tobago are two pieces of one puzzle but they give you different experiencesâ¦ so you get the best of both worlds,"" says Montano. ""Trinidad is where you come to experience the Carnival culture and steelpan orchestras, while Tobago, with its blue water, white-sand beaches and relaxed attitude, is somewhere you can chill and unwind.""
Local island culture reflects the country's history of colonisation. ""Our style developed through the cultural influences of Spanish, English, French, Dutch, Caribbean, African and Indo-Trinidadian communities interacting with each other over timeâ¦ we really blur the lines of culture,"" Montano says. ""We are a 'douglarisedâ nation, meaning weâre a true mix of African and Indian cultures. We donât just live side by side; we share our food, fashion, music and traditions.""
Here are Montano's favourite ways to experience Trinidad and Tobago.
For Montano, the best food in Trinidad and Tobago is found in the streets.
""Our most famous street food, doubles [curried chickpeas served on two fried flatbreads, topped with condiments like mango chutney and tamarind sauce], is available on nearly every corner. Itâs a food that [harks back to] our cultural roots. Itâs affordable, tasty and something we're known for internationally."" His pro tip: find a vendor selling fresh coconut water, as locals do. ""Coconut water is the perfect pairing with any meal!""
When pressed to name a sit-down dining experience, Montano cites the Breakfast Shed: ""You know when youâre looking for good food, youâre always looking for your grandmotherâs cooking? We call it the Breakfast Shed, but itâs not really a shed. Itâs what you would call a modern-day food hall. They cook only local dishes with what we like to call a 'sweet hand'; this means they use the best seasonings. Everything is so tasty.""
Montano recommends ordering the callaloo, which is a popular Sunday dish in Trinidad and Tobago. ""[It's] a mixture of bushes [dasheen bush, also known as taro leaves] with okra and spinach and all these different things in there."" He also recommends trying traditional stews, curries, pies or plant-based ingredients like pigeon peas: ""We call those plant-based dishes 'ground food'. Healthy food.""
Montano especially loves people watching at the Breakfast Shed: ""There are a lot of people from every walk of life, from salespeople to shopkeepers to students. Everyone is always rolling up to the Breakfast Shed.""
Address: JFXP+M8M, Wrightson Rd, Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago
Music is a way of life in Trinidad and Tobago, whether you're catching a live soca performance or simply hanging out at a dive bar. Montano enjoys visiting Kafe Blue, a calypso jazz cafe in Port of Spain, also known as Kaiso Blues CafÃ©. ""Itâs owned by one of our favourite musicians, Carl Jacobs, who was one of the biggest producers and singers in Trinidad and Tobago when I was growing up,"" he says. ""You can see some of the greatest musicians in Trinidadâ¦ people like Leston Paul, a great jazz musician. You can also see calypso and reggae there, and pop music and even gospel musicâ¦ It's a nice place to hang out with people and chat.""
Another classic musical experience is visiting a panyard, a communal rehearsal space for steelpan bands. ""Even though pan music [music played on the steelpan] is associated with Carnival, travellers can also come to the islands anytime and visit a panyard,"" says Montano. ""Some of them are not active during the year, but a lot of them are, like Renegades and All Stars and Invaders and Phase 2. You might pass and hear some calypso or some soca or even some classical music being played. Youâll hear all sorts of contemporary pop songs being played, too, because these bands tour the world."" He adds: ""Nowhere else in the world would you be able to walk into an orchestral rehearsal and be a part of it and have a little lime.""

Trinidad and Tobago is famous for its lush beaches, like Montano's pick; Maracas Beach, a tropical escape on Trinidad's north coast, about a 45-minute drive from Port of Spain through the leafy green Santa Cruz mountains; found in Maracas Bay.
""It's surrounded by beautiful mountains and the breeze is cool, so it brings serenity to a lot of people,"" Montano says. ""The people watching is always a delight as wellâ¦ people are always having fun there.""
He also notes that it's one of the most popular spots on the islands to get bake and shark, an iconic Trinidadian street food sandwich made from fried shark and fried bread and topped with condiments ranging from cucumbers to pineapple to ""special things"" like shado beni (""like a cilantro sauce"", Montano explains). There are multiple places to get it, Montano says, including Richard's Bake & Shark and Patsy's Bake & Shark. Just be sure to top it with whatever speaks to you most. ""Everyone has their own way of doing it,"" says Montano. ""Itâs all about your personal preference.""

Hitting the beach isnât the only way to commune with nature in Trinidad and Tobago. Montano recommends spending time in the Northern Range; a lush string of mountains running throughout northern Trinidad that covers about 25% of the entire island.
""There are amazing forest reserves, hiking trails and waterfalls there that offer a peaceful yet breathtaking experience,"" says Montano, who suggests paying close attention to the birds. There are more than 430 different species of birds in the Northern Range, not to mention more than 100 species of mammals including red howler monkeys, ocelots, and deer. âThe Northern Range is really ideal for nature lovers,"" says Montano.
Also known as Independence Square, the street vendor- and busker-lined Brian Lara Promenade runs through Port of Spainâs downtown area and is a fun spot to sit and people watch. ""Itâs named after one of our most famous cricketers and is always buzzing with people,"" says Montano.
Once youâve absorbed the rhythms of Trinidadian life, Montano suggests strolling to Queenâs Park Savannah, a 260-acre urban park. ""Youâll see lots of joggers, food vendors and the 'Magnificent Seven' [a group of seven colonial mansions],"" Montano says. ""[It's] a great mix of daily life and cultural heritage.""
Carnival is ""the heart and soul of our culture"", says Montano, so make it a point to visit while it's happening â traditionally the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday. ""Visitors can play mas (join in with a costume), meet incredible people, taste authentic local foods and immerse themselves in music and dance. Itâs a full spectrum of art, expression and unity that showcases the creativity of our people.""
To make the most of Carnival, Montano suggests heading to Trinidad and Tobago one week before the big celebrations and making sure to wear festive attire. ""The parties start the [week] before Carnival Monday, and continue every night right into Jâouvert,"" he explains. Known as the kick-off to Carnival, Jâouvert is a lively celebration that begins before sunrise on Carnival Monday morning in which partygoers dance through the streets covered in paint and mud and other substances. To do it right, wear clothes you donât mind ruining, advises Montano. ""Itâs the most fun to be dabbed in paint and powder and sometimes even chocolate,"" he says. ""Then you go home around 06:00 or 07:00, take a shower, take some rest and get back out on the road for what we call 'Monday Wear', which is when you usually wear a designer swimsuit and a little bit of your Tuesday costume.""
On Tuesday, revellers dress up ""proper"" with feathers, beads and other ""fancy-looking, bright-looking, colourful-looking costumes,"" says Montano. Whatever you do, he advises, be wary of heels. ""You want to wear flats, because itâs all about jumping and waving and dancing. And having fun.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250227-is-there-no-such-thing-as-italian-cuisine,Is there no such thing as Italian food?,"Italian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world â often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.
Food is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity â so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.
Alberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.
Grandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish.
Grandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.
The idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.
Grandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.
The Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the ""new world"", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.
However, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. ""It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,"" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth â popularised by social media â that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.
Pizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is ""a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top"", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had ""an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor"".
It was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became ""red"". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off.
Scholars call this process ""the pizza effect"": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.
Grandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier â a smaller wheel with a black rind â is now only made in Wisconsin.
The shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator.
With the new products and brands also came marketing. ""Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,"" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.
Grandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.
""Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,"" says Grandi, ""it is our identity."" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future â that's why they ""invent the past"".
In less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for ""true"" recipes and ""correct"" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called ragÃ¹ alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.
""I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,"" says Grandi. ""Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',"" he adds. ""Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.""
Social media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat ""their"" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like ""carbonara is not an opinion"" and ""you break spaghetti, you break my heart"".
Content creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food ""blasphemy"", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation â with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.
The popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.

""Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,"" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. ""For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,"" she adds. ""In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.""
Grandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.
As social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.
""We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,"" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. ""We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250225-the-quiet-massachusetts-towns-that-sparked-a-revolution,The quiet towns that sparked US independence,"Two hundred and fifty years ago, several small farming communities rose up against the British and helped form a new nation. Now, the towns are gearing up to party like it's 1775.
On 19 April 2025, Lexington, Concord and two other neighbouring towns north-west of Boston will mark the 250th anniversary of the chilly spring day in 1775 when Massachusetts militiamen faced off against British forces in a clash that launched the US on a path to independence.
The fateful die was cast when Paul Revere arrived on horseback to the small farming community of Lexington to warn leaders that British soldiers were marching from Boston to seize colonial military supplies stored in Concord, a few miles down the road. When the British arrived, they found a small force of local militiamen, known as Minutemen, waiting in the dawn light.
No one knows who fired the first shot, but when the skirmish was over, eight Minutemen lay dead, along with one British soldier. The British forces marched on to Concord where they met a larger force of Minutemen by the North Bridge. After fierce fighting and significant losses on both sides, the British retreated. Marching back to Boston, British troops faced a running battle as the towns of Lincoln, Lexington and Menotomy (now Arlington) had mustered their militias to mount an organised resistance.
The American War of Independence had begun.
Every year, the events of 19 April are celebrated with various historical reenactments and other special events in these small Massachusetts towns. But with additional celebrations planned in honour of the 250th anniversary, organisers are expecting this year's festivities to draw more travellers than ever before to what many call ""the birthplace of American liberty"".
This year's festivities kick off on 18 April with a commemoration of Paul Revere's famous midnight ride to Lexington, followed by a reenactment of the Battle of Lexington the following morning. On 21 April, an event honouring the opening shot of the Battles of Lexington and Concord will take place at Concord's North Bridge, while a host of special exhibits, lectures and parades will take place throughout April.
Two and a half centuries after shaping American history, Lexington's colonial heritage remains a defining presence, offering year-round visitors a window into the past. The Lexington Battle Green, where the Minutemen met the British forces, remains the centre of the quiet, 34,000-person community. A statue of farmer-turned Minuteman captain John Parker stands at one end, facing the direction from where British troops approached. Elsewhere, a stone marker on the Lexington Battle Green is engraved with the words Parker is said to have uttered to his men: ""Don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here."" A memorial obelisk marks the spot where the Minutemen killed in the battle were reburied after being moved from their original graves in the nearby Old Burying Ground.
Nearby, the Lexington Visitors Center provides an overview of the events of 19 April along with a detailed diorama of the battle. From April through October, Liberty Ride trolley tours whisk travellers from the Visitors Center to historical sites in Lexington and Concord along the Battle Road that connects the two towns.
Next door to the Visitors Center, Buckman Tavern, where the Minuteman gathered before the clash, is one of three historic houses maintained by the Lexington Historical Society. The other two include Munroe Tavern, which was occupied by retreating British soldiers after the battle; and the Hancock-Clarke House, where patriot leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams were staying when Revere arrived to sound the alarm.

""Buckman Tavern really gives you a good overview of the battle, but also what life was like in 1775,"" said Lexington High School student Sabrina Bhattacharjya, who runs the history website Lexington250.com. ""My personal favourite is the Hancock-Clarke House. You kind of get to hear the kids' experience of the [American] Revolution. Elizabeth Clarke was a 12-year-old girl who wrote everything down that night in her diary, because she watched the midnight ride and Battle of Lexington out [of] her bedroom window.""
Monroe Tavern, in contrast, presents the perspective of the British, who used it as a field hospital during their retreat. ""It asks my very favourite question, and that is: who [were] the real patriots that day?"" said Craig Sandler, president of the board of the Lexington Historical Society, noting that British soldiers viewed the colonists as rebelling against their rightful king. ""The [British] were noble in their own way. You can't tell the story without both sides because it doesn't make sense.""
Just before the anniversary in April, the Lexington Historical Society will open a new museum in the Lexington Depot, a long-empty former train station built in 1846 in downtown Lexington. The museum will tell the story of the town through Revolutionary-era artefacts and other items that have been off-view for decades.
In addition to a larger-than-usual parade, filmmaker Ken Burns is scheduled to visit both Lexington and Concord on 17 April to present his new documentary series The American Revolution. Lexington's anniversary celebrations will also include a visit from approximately 250 members of the US Army's Old Guard and a dramatic landing on Lexington Green by the Golden Knights, the US Army Parachute Team.
From Lexington, the British marched on to Concord through the town of Lincoln, along today's Battle Road. Much of the route they took is now part of Minute Man National Historical Park, as is the battle site at the North Bridge near downtown Concord. Visitor centres in Lincoln and near the North Bridge in Concord are good starting points to learn more, with educational films to set the stage. The park also incorporates several historic houses from the Revolutionary period and conducts anniversary reenactments of the Battle of Concord and other dramatic events of 19 April, including the capture of Paul Revere.
This year, the park is holding special events throughout April to mark the 250th anniversary, the highlight of which will be a Battle Road Tactical Demonstration on 19 April, where costumed interpreters will recreate battle tactics and the fighting that took place as the British retreated towards Boston.
""It will be the largest living history event of all the 250th events in this area. We have over 750-800 living historians that will be joining us for a whole day of events,"" said Minute Man park ranger Jim Hollister. ""On the night of the 12th, we're doing an evening programme at Hartwell Tavern portraying the ride of Samuel Prescott, who escaped capture after Paul Revere was captured by a British patrol, and he brings the alarm to the town of Lincoln.""
Concord's Visitor Center also offers guided tours focusing on the Revolution, including one called A Fight for Freedom: Patriots of Color. Stops include the historic Wright Tavern where Concord Minutemen gathered early on 19 April and British troops later established their headquarters. The town is also developing an app-based augmented reality tour that will be available this spring.
""The idea is that you get superimposed on an object,"" said Concord Tourism Manager Beth Williams. ""Walk into the Wright Tavern and a 3D figure could come up like a hologram and say, 'Oh, when I was 12, I worked as a barmaid in the Wright Tavern.' It gives another layer to the history, certainly to a younger demographic that is more used to getting content in that way.""
Nearby, the Concord Museum has an extensive collection of artefacts related to the Revolution. ""We're able to narrate the events of the day essentially minute by minute, with objects that were actually there and that participated. The interpretive material is drawn from the words of participants to the degree that we're able,"" explained curator David Woods.
Beyond visiting the museum and the historic site at the North Bridge, Woods recommends an exercise in observation and imagination. ""Standing in the centre of town,"" he said, ""look around for 18th-Century structures. Any one that you can see, it's reasonable to suspect that there were supplies stored there. You can go up on to the Old Hill Burying Ground, stand right where [British officers] Colonel Smith and Major Pitcairn stood looking at the North Bridge sizing the thing up. There was a mountain of supplies in Concord and they didn't find it.""
Asked why the events of Lexington and Concord continue to resonate with visitors, Hollister said, ""It's a very accessible story. The main actors weren't great generals and warriors â they were ordinary people just like us: men and women who were confronted with a crisis and had to decide what's worth fighting for. That's something I think every generation has to confront as they move through history in their own time.""
""It's this feeling that this was the start. This was the first shot,"" added Bhattacharjya. ""We are a nation of immigrants. That first shot on the battlefield is what brought so many people here, and that's how we've grown as a country. All the inventions and all the greatness of America, it all started because you had a first shot.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250224-how-trumps-new-policies-could-change-travel,How Trump's new policies could change travel,"As the new US president makes massive governmental cuts, issues tariffs and leads an immigration crackdown, domestic and international tourism faces unprecedented changes.
In the United States, a new presidential administration always comes with policy shifts. But the dizzying speed with which President Donald Trump has issued executive orders and made sweeping federal changes during the first month of his second term has much of the world wondering what the long-term impacts of these changes might be, and what else is yet to come.
By threatening and instituting tariffs on longtime allies, moving to overhaul the US immigration system, promising ""mass deportations"" and empowering unelected billionaire Elon Musk to fire thousands of federal employees and potentially shutter entire agencies established by Congress, Trump has come out swinging in his second act. And while these policy shifts are likely to have far-reaching social, political and economic implications, experts say they will also have a huge impact on the US travel industry.
""From immigration rules to trade wars, these changes will make travel to and within the US a lot more complicated and way less appealing. It's like putting up a giant 'Do not enter' sign just as the world is getting back into full travel mode,"" said Kristin Winkaffe, founder of travel firm Winkaffe Global Travel. ""If you make it harder for people to get visas, fewer people will come â it's that simple.""
This already appears to be playing out with the US's northerly neighbour. As Trump continues to threaten tariffs against Canada, even proposing annexing the entire nation, some Canadians have started boycotting US travel. The US Travel Association has warned that a 10% reduction in Canadian visits could result in more than $2bn in lost spending and 14,000 job losses.
Yet, the new administration remains confident that its policy shifts will benefit travellers. ""President Trump has entrusted this team to work tirelessly to reaffirm American's [sic] complete confidence in the safety of our transportation systems,"" newly appointed US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. ""Our focus remains on ushering in a golden age of transportation while prioritizing the Department's core mission of safety and delivering innovative projects that move America.""
While the full scale of Trump's policy changes are yet to be seen, experts and travel professionals are keeping a close eye on the specific ways they may reshape travel. We spoke to some of them to find out how these impacts might affect domestic and international travellers.
Perhaps no mode of travel has been more scrutinised in recent weeks than the aviation industry. In the past month, four fatal plane crashes in the US have led confidence in air travel to drop from 71% of Americans believing air travel is safe in January 2025, to 64% in February, according to a recent AP survey.
Trump's recent policy changes aren't likely to improve this number. Air traffic control staffing was already under pressure nationwide and has been indicated as the cause of near-misses. Yet, even after investigations into the recent crash in Washington DC that killed 67 passengers found that air traffic control staffing was not at normal levels, Trump's administration began firing hundreds of Federal Aviation Administration employees last week. He has also fired the heads of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Coast Guard, and disbanded the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, leaving some wondering if aviation safety would continue to be a federal priority.
The State Department also suspended all processing of passports with the X identity marker, leaving many non-binary Americans potentially cut off from international travel. More than 15 countries â including Australia, Canada, Colombia and India â allow citizens to amend their gender to non-binary or third gender, so it is yet to be determined how these visitors will be treated upon entry.
In addition, more than 200 TSA employees have been laid off so far, and many expect screening times â especially among international visitors â to go up. Some LGBTQ+ travellers, in particular, are concerned about how recent policy changes will affect air travel.
""States like Texas, which is a hub for two of the three major US carriers, are looking at enforcing bathroom use in all public buildings (including airports) along the lines of the binary sex you were assigned at birth,"" said Lindsey Danis, creator of outdoor travel blog Queer Adventurers. ""Trans people would have to choose between complying with a law that would force use of the bathroom that aligns with their former gender or breaking the law and possibly being targeted for being in the 'wrong bathroom'.""
With Trump threatening to tariff Canadian oil starting in March, experts expect gas prices to rise as much as $0.15 per gallon, potentially putting a damper on holiday road trips. Some believe that the president's focus on increasing domestic oil and gas production may temper the effects of tariffs on domestic gas prices, but that may take longer to see at the pump.
Even those with electric vehicles may have more trouble charging. Earlier this month, the Trump administration paused the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program, a clean energy initiative that had allocated billions of dollars for states to create electric car charging stations since 2021.
Those hoping to drive to or through one of the US's spectacular national parks may also face extra challenges. President Trump recently fired 1,000 national park workers, leaving many to suspect that the staffing shortages will result in maintenance issues, shorter visitor centre hours and fewer amenities for travellers. Yosemite National Park, for instance, has already delayed its summer campground reservations.
Similarly, federal funding for train travel seems to be an area that the Trump administration has eyed cutting. As part of recent spending freezes (some of which were temporarily rescinded recently), the US Department of Transportation is under scrutiny, in particular for its rail-related spending. Experts think this is likely to affect the $22bn in annual Amtrak funding, the development of high-speed rail corridors and intercity passenger rail service and grants for railroad safety programmes (which work to improve dangerous railroad crossings).

â¢ The only land disputed between the US and Canada
â¢ The Overseas Highway: The US's 'floating highway'
It's not that rail is universally under attack, but some suspect that Trump may be looking to further privatise the industry. ""Right now, there's a bigger push for private companies to take the lead in rail investment, which could bring fresh ideas and innovation but also raises questions about accessibility,"" said public policy advisor Justin Goldsberry. ""Will ticket prices rise? Will service improve, or become limited in certain areas?""
The leisure and hospitality industry is one of the US economy's biggest sectors, employing more than 10% of the American workforce. But policy uncertainty hasn't been good for business, especially from international business travellers.
""The US is one of the largest markets for business events (especially exhibitions), and leading US shows rely on a solid share of international and overseas attendees,"" said Kai Hattendorf, CEO at the global business events company HTF and former CEO of UFI The Global Association of the Exhibition Industry. ""Policy uncertainty is disruptive for the sector, as event businesses crave predictability as they are planning years out, working with destinations and all actors from the travel and hospitality ecosystem.""
He points to tech event CES in Las Vegas this past January when visitors from certain countries, including China, were down significantly. Hattendorf is noticing a growing number of events reportedly cancelled due to funding pulled from US government agencies and divisions as they enact new policies.
Other experts expect that as Trump's immigration crackdown looms, restaurants, hotels and â by extension â travellers are likely to feel the effects.
""The hospitality industry, one of the largest employers of immigrant workers, will take a direct hit if work visas like the H-2B become more restricted,"" said Neri Karra Sillaman, entrepreneurship expert at the University of Oxford and author of the forthcoming book Pioneers: 8 Principles of Business Longevity from Immigrant Entrepreneurs. ""Post-pandemic labour shortages nearly brought the industry to its knees. If we see another round of restrictions, expect rising costs, declining service and economic losses in major travel hubs like New York, Miami and Los Angeles.""
President Trump's executive order focusing on ""foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats"" also put visas for foreign nationals in jeopardy. The order directs the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to implement enhanced vetting for both visa applicants and those currently in the country in order ""to ensure that those aliens approved for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans or [its] national interests"".
This means delays for those applying for visas, and visa appointments are likely to be delayed or suspended. Legal experts suspect particular scrutiny of those from high-risk countries, and most suspect a similar travel ban as was enacted in 2017 to be enacted once more.
""For international travellers, heightened visa scrutiny and extended processing times could mean fewer visitors and billions in lost tourism revenue,"" said Sillaman. ""If the US makes itself a harder place to visit or do business, the rest of the world isn't going to wait. Other countries â Canada, the UK, Australia â are already rolling out policies to attract the talent that America risks turning away.""
This could be especially problematic because the US is entering what policymakers are describing as a ""mega decade"" of sporting events. In 2026 the US will co-host the FIFA World Cup in 11 American cities, followed by the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028, the Men's Rugby World Cup in 2031, the Women's Rugby World Cup in 2033 and the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2034. Yet, a recent report by the US Travel Association put it bluntly: ""We're not ready to host the upcoming mega decade of events that will draw millions of domestic and international travellers.""
As US Travel Association CEO and president Geoff Freeman writes, slow visa processing times are the ""single biggest deterrent to visiting the US"". According to the State Department, wait times for visitor visas from certain nations such as Colombia can run up to 700 days, making it impossible for many travellers to attend next summer's FIFA World Cup. According to an Oxford Economics study cited in the report, if unaddressed, these days could result in a loss of nearly $19bn in spending in the next two years.
""America is staring at a historic opportunity,"" Freeman stated. ""The question is whether we will seize the moment or fall maddeningly short.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250221-the-baltic-express-central-europes-new-hop-on-hop-off-train,Central Europe's new hop-on hop-off train,"The Baltic Express bursts out of the Czech capital on a crisp winter morning. As the sky lightens, medieval Prague is streamed through the train's windows like a Netflix trailer. From armchair seats in private compartments, a city of Rococo castles and wide boulevards appears: the ""Paris of the East"", mostly unscathed by Nazi occupation in the 1940s or socialist planning in the 70s. Moments later the train hums through a timeless Czech countryside. Onion-domed churches and frozen fishing lakes scroll past as the train sprints north.
The recently launched route from Prague to Gdynia on Poland's Baltic coast operates four times daily, and takes travellers directly into Central Europe's most vibrant and less-touristed cities that were previously tricky to get to. It will entice international travellers who want to combine a city break with a rural experience, followed by a holiday on the beach.
The term ""Baltic Express"" is an ambitious misnomer. Think of this new 878km connection not as one of the speedy plane-killer routes trending in recent years â like London to Amsterdam or Istanbul to Ankara â custom-built to compete with budget airlines. Instead, the eight-hour trip promises a scenic history tour through overlapping empires via some of the Czech Republic and Poland's most buzzing cities, including Gdansk and Poznan. Best of all, this highly affordable and experiential journey allows passengers to hop-on and hop-off wherever they choose.
My own journey started in Prague's HlavnÃ­ NÃ¡draÅ¾Ã­ station. From outside, the terminus looks like a cathedral to train travel with twin cupolas rising from its roof like Roman temples. The station was built in 1871 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which ruled Central Europe, laid train tracks around the empire as a way of weaving all trade and security through the empire's capital of Vienna.
Inside the station, NÃ¡draÅ¾Ã­ HlavnÃ­'s main departure hall was decorated when the Czech Republic wasÂ under Soviet domination and is a socialist rainbow of primary colours. Yet unbeknown to most passengers, one floor above sits an original waiting room styled in Art Nouveau, while a soaring dome in this higher level overlooks Romanesque statues and polished brass rails. In 2024, the fancy Foyer CafÃ© opened in an adjoining salon, serving Czech riesling and viennoiserie pastries high above the hoi polloi. It's a fine way to start a continental meander.
After just one hour aboard the Baltic Express, I make my first hop-off stop at Pardubice. The 100,000-person city exudes Czech charm. The old town square is Prague-esque, with church steeples shaped like space rockets and townhouses coloured every shade of pastel. Pardubice's Austro-Hungarian townhouses are as fancily familiar as in every empire city: Sarajevo, Brno, Lviv. Yet I can count that day's tourists on one hand.
Ironically, statues in Pardubice commemorate the birthplace of Czech aviator Jan KaÅ¡par. In 1911, KaÅ¡par flew south from Pardubice to Prague, following the railway tracks now used by the Baltic Express. The mechanical efficiency of aviation has competed with the romanticism of rail ever since.
I rejoin the Baltic Express an hour before sunset. The topography rises towards the Polish border in an undulating green sheen. First oak woods, feral deer and icy streams. Then pine forests, hunting lodges and deep snows as the train climbs into the quickening night. As Europe has become borderless, only a choral chirp from passengers' cellular networks welcomes our train to Poland.
I share my seating cabin with a woman named Marta Kortas who works in Gdansk's data analytics industry. ""The train has made a new connection for me because I have friends in Prague and southern Poland,"" she tells me. The region of rural Silesia flashes past in the dark, where passengers can get off for thermal springs and salt mines. Kortas lived here during Covid lockdown. ""I even dreamt I could move back and use the train to commute to my office a few days per month. Direct connections between Prague, Wroclaw and Poznan makes that dream much easier.""

Around 20:00, I alight, alongside Polish business commuters, to spend the night in Wroclaw, Poland's historical third city. For nearly a century before 1945, Wroclaw was the German-speaking city of Breslau, and its Teutonic-Gothic train station was designed by a Prussian architect. After World War Two, however, Poland's borders shifted west and the train station formerly known as Breslau Hauptbahnhof was renamed Wroclaw Glowny â although direct services still run to Berlin on tracks laid by the German Empire more than a century ago.
I wake up to Wroclaw's whirling snow and reboard the Baltic Express for the third time, strolling along the length of the eight-carriage train to gauge the passenger make-up. There are bike racks and bench tables, a dining car and coffee bar, occupied by everyone from Polish grannies to Czech work-from-homers. It's the mix anticipated by Jan HrabÃ¡Äek of Czech national rail operator ÄeskÃ© DrÃ¡hy, whom I speak to en route.
""We already have a connection from Prague to Budapest and Warsaw,"" says HrabÃ¡Äek, who helped develop the Baltic Express route. ""So the idea of the Czech and Polish transport ministers was to connect the quickest possible route from Prague and Wroclaw to the sea."" Tourism, not business, will be the key summer driver: Czechs used to drive south to Croatia for holidays, says HrabÃ¡Äek, but now it's expensive. ""Czech people 'found' Poland as a destination because the beaches are great and the weather has become warmer.""
The joy of the Baltic Express is that it affords a few hours in destinations one might otherwise overlook, like the Polish spa town of KÅodzko or the medieval city of Leszno. I make my penultimate pitstop in Poznan, a Polish cultural capital that has an old town square as pretty as any imagined in a Disney fairytale.
I start in the square's Military Museum, where rakish Napoleonic tunics and dashing air force costumes â Polish soldiers knew how to dress â tell of a darker story. Poland has only enjoyed 50 years of independence in the last two centuries due to Austro-Hungarian, Nazi and Soviet occupiers, which makes the safeguarding of the country's culture during difficult times even more impressive.
For example, the interiors of the Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help look like a darkly atmospheric Vatican with a ceiling as kaleidoscopically intricate as a FabergÃ© egg. I learn that the Nazis turned the basilica into a warehouse before it was restored after World War Two. Meanwhile, Poznan's magnificent brick brewery, Stary Browar, a city in itself, was mothballed during the Soviet era. It has been reborn as a cultural space and shopping hub near the train station.
At lunchtime, I embark on my final leg towards Gdansk. As a board the train, a conductor I met the day before gives me a nod of welcome. The Baltic Express is starting to feel like home.
The cosiest space is the dining car. A chef grills fresh goÅÄbki (pork-stuffed cabbage leaves), her assistant spoons out pumpkin barley with kale and the waiter decants bottles of ÅomÅ¼a beer. The train catering company WARS holds a special place in Polish hearts, having catered on international rail routes from Irkutsk to Istanbul since 1948. It's a long way from a British Rail sandwich.
A fellow diner is marketing consultant Karolina Paszkiewicz. ""The trains Poland had 10 years ago were slow and cold,"" she recalls. The train to Gdansk, where Paszkiewicz's clients are based, used to take nine hours from her hometown of Wroclaw. ""Today it's four and half,"" smiles Paszkiewicz, as she munches on a Polish apple pie. ""After you've eaten and opened your laptop, it's time to get off.""
We're nearly at the end of the line. Outside, the landscape freezes and flattens. A whirl of seagulls intimates that we're descending towards the sea. The natural port of Gdansk has been Poland's window on the world for seven centuries. As a member of the Hanseatic trading league, the port city exported goods around the Baltic Sea between Hamburg, Riga, Bergen and Bremen. Visible from our slowing train are handsome wharf houses where beeswax, amber and furs could be winched up from passing ships.
In Gdansk, history is inescapable. The train terminal is a mirror of Colmar station in France's Alsace region, both designed by German architects when Imperial Germany governed these parts. The city's Museum of the Second World War shares how the first shots of one of Earth's greatest conflicts were fired right here. Finally, the European Solidarity Centre highlights Gdansk's shipworkers' role in helping to bring down Soviet communism decades later.
What makes the Baltic Express special is its sense of interconnectedness. It's a Czech-Polish train, travelling on tracks laid by Austrians and Germans that offers the freedom to eat, sleep and explore en route. Experiential train travel has a new destination.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly noted that KÅodzko is in the Czech Republic. This has now been fixed.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250220-koh-mak-the-tiny-island-thats-redefining-travel-to-thailand,A tiny island that's redefining travel to Thailand,"With season three of The White Lotus drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand.
As season three ofÂ The White Lotus prepares to thrust Thailand's islands into the global spotlight, drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand. Here, a speck of an island named Koh Mak has quietly positioned itself as a model for sustainable tourism, offering a rare vision of what the future of travel in Thailand could be.
Heading towards Koh Mak's southern shores by speedboat, my first impression was disarmingly simple: golden sand curving into clear shallows while coconut palms leaned towards the sea as though caught mid-bow. There were no high-rises, no blaring beach clubs. Instead, low-slung bungalows peeked through the trees and bicycles outnumbered cars on the island's quiet roads.
I checked into the Makathanee Resort next to the jetty and studied a map to get my bearings. Just 16 sq km in size, Koh Mak is flat apart from a few gentle hills, perfect for exploring by bike. Eager to tap into the island's slow rhythm, I pedalled north-east through plantations of rubber trees and coconut palms to Laem Son beach. Here, I found little more than a shack made of coconut trunks and fronds and a few deck chairs facing a blissfully empty stretch of sand. I ordered a coconut shake and enjoyed a delicious half hour soaking up the silence before heading across to the settlement of Ao Suan Yai. Even here, there was little to detract from the island's natural beauty, just several tastefully designed, low-key resorts tucked away behind a white-sand beach and a line of palms all leaning at the same angle towards the sea.
As I completed my brief tour, I was amazed to realise that during my bike ride I had seen no international hotels or shopping malls, no McDonalds or KFCs and not a single 7-Eleven, which seem to be on every street corner throughout the rest of Thailand.
Promoted by the Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT) as the country's first low-carbon destination, Koh Mak has become a testing ground for how small islands can thrive without sacrificing their soul to mass tourism. Unlike its larger, better-known neighbours Â­âÂ party-friendly Koh Chang to the north and exclusive Koh Kood to the south â Koh Mak is charting a slower, quieter course. Its approach, driven by the island's long-time landowning families, has earned international recognition for sustainable tourism. But it is the lived reality that truly sets it apart. This is not an island clinging to an imagined past; it's one that is actively shaping a different kind of future.
While many Thai islands fall under the jurisdiction of the Thai government, Koh Mak remains in the hands of five families, descendants of a civil servant named Luang Prompakdee who purchased the island's coconut plantations in the early 20th Century. Yodchai Sudhidhanakul, president of the Koh Mak Tourism Club and one of Prompakdee's descendants, told me that this tight-knit ownership structure has been key to protecting the island's tranquil character and encouraging slow tourism.
""It's not that we don't want tourists; in fact, many residents depend on tourism,"" Sudhidhanakul said. ""But we hope to attract a particular type of visitor â those who are respectful of others and appreciate the benefits of a quiet life.""
In 2018, residents formalised their vision in the Koh Mak Charter. The agreement bans vehicle ferries from docking at the island, restricts motorbike rentals to 70% of room capacity, prohibits loud music after 22:00 and noisy water sports like jet skis, and bans the use of foam or plastic containers.
""We never worried about overtourism,"" said Sudhidhankul, ""as our available accommodation has remained at a steady 750 rooms, but we wanted to be part of the low-carbon initiative. Thus, most resort owners use renewable energy where possible and make efforts to recycle and dispose of waste responsibly.""
This ethos extends beyond policy. Local initiatives like the Koh Mak Coral Conservation Group offer snorkelling trips where visitors can learn how to propagate corals using recycled PVC pipes. Waste disposal is a collective effort, with regular beach cleanups coordinated by Trash Hero, a voluntary group with the motto, ""Every week we clean, we educate, we change"". And at the island's coconut plantation, visitors can learn how to harvest coconuts and make cold-pressed coconut oil, while tie-dye workshops teach traditional fabric-dyeing techniques using natural pigments.

I spent the next few days earnestly practising slow-life activities: reading in a hammock, snoozing in a deck chair, swimming and taking long walks along the beach looking for shells. Unfortunately, most of what I found would only be of interest to the Trash Heroes â plastic bottles, old shoes and torn fishing nets. There were plenty of other activities to choose from, including diving and snorkelling trips, kayaking, paddle boarding, classes in massage and cooking, Thai boxing and yoga.
I took part in a game of disc golf (aka frisbee golf) and joined a tie-dyeing workshop, where I made a shirt that gave me a great sense of accomplishment. Workshop leader Rodjamarn Sirirut showed us a display of more than 20 natural dyes made from local plants such as indigo, malabar, mango, mangosteen and coconut shell; impressive evidence of the island's natural diversity. These pursuits made a change from lounging at swim-up pool bars or stuffing myself at buffets as I might have done if I had been staying at an international resort.
One day I joined a snorkelling trip to Koh Rang, an island to the west of Koh Mak that is part of the Koh Chang Marine National Park. On the boat I chatted with Rong Rong Zhu, a former research scientist in the US who now spends most of her time on Koh Mak. ""When I travelled in Asia in 2018, I found Koh Mak to be a very walkable and bike-friendly island,"" she said. ""I was able to rent a house with a beautiful view and now I have many digital nomad friends who spend half the year here.""
Koh Mak is not immune to the challenges facing small islands. Plastic debris still washes up on its shores, swept in by ocean currents. And while the island's co-working hub, Koh Mak Campus, set up by Sudhidhanakul in 2020, encourages longer stays and digital nomads, balancing tourism and development remains a delicate task. ""We want to attract seasonal inhabitants, and we need to develop more expertise in the use of renewable energy."" Sudhidhanakul told me.
Yet, as I slipped into the island's rhythm â cycling from one beach to another, sipping coconut shakes under palm trees and chatting with residents who spoke of their home with both pride and protectiveness â it became clear that Koh Mak offers something increasingly rare in Thailand.
It is a reminder that a different kind of tourism is possible, one that doesn't require sacrificing a place's spirit for progress. As the speedboat carried me back towards the busy mainland, I found myself hoping that Koh Mak's quiet revolution might inspire others to follow its lead.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250221-a-samba-queens-guide-to-rio-de-janeiro,A samba queen's guide to Rio de Janeiro,"Mayara Lima is famous for her hypnotising samba style. Here, she shares the best samba experiences in Rio, from traditional school events to samba circles.
Brazilians often say that ""everything ends in samba"", but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that samba never ends â at least not in Rio de Janeiro, one of the places where the musical and dance genre is said to have originated. Aside from providing entertainment, samba has played a crucial role in shaping Rio's lifestyle, including taking a central role in its Carnival celebration â the most renowned in the world.
More than just a genre, samba is a cultural phenomenon that helps drive the economy, with more than 150 official rodas de samba (samba circles) across the city. At these lively gatherings, musicians sit in a circle while crowds of hundreds â or even thousands â of spectators sing along, creating an electrifying atmosphere. Meanwhile, escolas de samba (community-based ""samba schools"" that organise the world-famous Carnival parade with its giant floats and thrilling costumes) elect a rainha da bateria (queen of the drums) who leads the school's bateria (drum section), captivating the crowd and forging a powerful connection between the musicians and the audience.
But the energy of samba can be felt in Rio all year round. Even outside Carnival season, events like samba school street rehearsals offer a vibrant and immersive experience. We askedÂ Mayara Lima, a rainha de bateria (drum queen) at PararaÃ­so do Tuiti, one of Rio's most renowned samba schools, how to experience the city's rich samba culture during Carnival and beyond.
Lima knew from an early age that dance was her calling, and she joined a samba school at age 10. ""I had studied other rhythms, such as ballet and jazz, but I decided to be fully dedicated to samba,"" she says.
Lima is a proud carioca â a Rio native. ""To me, Rio is far more than just a city,"" she says. ""What makes Rio so unique is the way it combines breathtaking natural beauty â its beaches and trails â with the energy of a vibrant, urban metropolis, where every neighbourhood has its own distinct charm and history."" She adds: ""[But] you can't talk about Rio without talking about samba, can you? Their histories are intertwined.""
Ahead of the 2025 Carnival, which runs from 28 February to 8 March, here are five of Lima's favorite samba experiences in Rio.
Rio's samba school parade is a global spectacle every Carnival season. Of the more than 70 samba schools, only a select few belong to the elite group that takes centre stage, parading down the SambÃ³dromo MarquÃªs de SapucaÃ­ during the festivities â but the schools promote several events during the year that take place in the quadras (samba school headquarters), which play a key role in strengthening ties between the schools and the local community.
Cariocas and visitors of all ages come to samba schools to watch rehearsals, participate in feijoadas (a traditional feast of black beans and pork) and enjoy live performances of the school's samba anthem; a new one is chosen each year to serve as the narrative musical thread for each performance.
""There are 12 main samba schools [in Rio], which means 12 opportunities to experience samba,"" says Lima. ""While there's no fixed schedule for events, something is always happening. Each school hosts feijoadas several times a year. They feature guest performers playing not just samba, but also pagode [a type of samba/subgenre of samba] and carioca funk.""
For Lima, the GrÃªmio Recreativo Escola de Samba AcadÃªmicos do Salgueiro samba school holds one of Rio's best feijoadas. ""It's a thrilling event, it often happens in the first Monday of each month,"" she says. But her favourite type of samba school event is undoubtedly street rehearsals. ""As Carnival approaches, we hold street rehearsals every Monday in front of the samba school before heading inside to continue practicing,"" she says. ""It's amazing!""
Each school announces its events on social media. Street rehearsals are free, but other events, such as feijoada feast and samba circles, usually require a ticket.

Pedra do Sal â a sloping set of stone steps found in Morro da ConceiÃ§Ã£o, known as Rio's ""Little Africa"" â is believed to have been the birthplace of samba in the early 20th Century. When the area served as a market for enslaved people and the unloading point for salt (sal in Portuguese) shipments, it also became a gathering place for enslaved Africans, who came together to honour their deities and play the instruments that became part of samba's DNA, like the pandeiro (tambourine).
During the day, Pedra do Sal's rich history attracts small groups of tourists eager to understand Rio's past. But as the sun sets, the streets fill with vendors and hundreds of visitors drawn to the city's most famous roda de samba.
Once held only on Monday nights, the event grew so popular that organisers expanded it to four nights a week, from Friday to Monday â though Monday remains the busiest night. The music spills over Pedra do Sal's famous steps, creating an electrifying, open-air celebration.
""Pedra do Sal attracts such a diverse crowd â you'll find people from all over the city, from different backgrounds, and loads of tourists too,"" says Lima. ""It's a great mix, and that reflects in the music. Samba is the essence, but you'll hear other rhythms too.""

In the city's northern zone, 21km from the historic Copacabana beach, hundreds of samba enthusiasts gather at the Pagode do Chinelo roda in the Pilares borough, right next to the renowned samba school Caprichosos de Pilares.
Like most rodas de samba, the gathering started with modest expectations â just a group of friends meeting every Monday for a cold beer and some samba â but the samba do Chinelo quickly became a sensation and is now one of Rioâs official rodas de samba, attracting locals and celebrities alike, and has since evolved into a professionally structured event.
""This is one of those places everyone goes to. It's a given that it'll be packed every Monday, with plenty of famous faces in the crowd. Sometimes you even see singers like [Grammy winner] Ludmilla performing â it's really cool,"" says Lima.
The event kicks off at 18:00 and carries on into the late night. Pagode do Chinelo is also the perfect spot to experience different samba styles. ""It's a great place to enjoy a more melodic samba, which is slower, or samba partido-alto, which is faster and more upbeat. It's brilliant fun,"" says Lima.

4. Best for experiencing classic samba: Cacique de Ramos
The northern zone of the city is also home to one of Rio's most traditional rodas de samba.
Founded in the 1960s, Cacique de Ramos became famous for its legendary samba gatherings, where some of the genre's most celebrated artists first rose to prominence. Often described as the ""headquarters of samba"", it has played a pivotal role in shaping Rio's Carnival culture.
""This is where you'll find classic samba,"" says Lima. ""Cacique de Ramos is the birthplace of many greats, including Arlindo Cruz, Zeca Pagodinho and Beth Carvalho. If you want to experience that unique energy, this is the place to go.""
The samba takes place every Sunday in Cacique de Ramos samba hall, making it an ideal option for those looking to enjoy a lively evening without a late finish. ""Since it's on a Sunday, Cacique de Ramos wraps up around midnight,"" says Lima. ""So if you need to be up early the next day but still want to make the most of your weekend, it's perfect. It's definitely one of my favourites.""

BarÃ³dromo is a well-known samba venue among cariocas and a favourite gathering spot for samba enthusiasts. The walls are adorned with Carnival costumes and masks, immersing guests in the samba atmosphere the moment they step inside.
""It's always buzzing, absolutely packed,"" says Lima. ""It's a bar with a proper traditional samba roda, where people clap along to the beat â it's such a great vibe. The whole place is dedicated to samba, and that's what makes it so special.""
The venue is open from Tuesday to Sunday, with samba sessions every night, ranging from performances of traditional samba to live sets from samba school baterias.
BarÃ³dromo is a popular venue that frequently fills to capacity, occasionally leading to slower service. However, the lively atmosphere and infectious energy of the crowd create a fully immersive experience, with the music at its heart.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250220-hageslag-dutch-sandwich,The sweet Dutch sandwich that makes no sense,"There's a pervasive belief in the Netherlands that this unconventional meal helps lift the national mood.
""I think I'm an addict, basically,"" says Marije Nicklin, who grew up on the Dutch island of Terschelling. The Dutch expat, who has been based in West Yorkshire, UK, since 2002, is obsessed with hagelslag, carefully rationing the packets her parents post to her and the bag-loads she brings back on the ferry. ""I've got quite a lot in storage,"" she says. ""I do start to twitch when I see the end is coming.""
Translated as ""hailstorm"", hagelslag are crispy, oblong-shaped sugar strands, just a few millimetres long. They are most commonly chocolate-flavoured and coated in a shiny glaze. In a supermarket in any other country, you'd likely see them in the cake toppings section reserved for a special occasion, but in the Netherlands, where more than 14 million kilograms of hagelslag are consumed per year, many people eat them every week, sprinkling them liberally onto buttered bread as a quick breakfast, snack or lunch. The hagelslag sandwich (broodje hagelslag) is surely an anachronism in this age of sugar awareness, but there's a pervasive belief in the Netherlands that this unconventional meal helps lift the national mood.
Good hagelslag is crunchy on impact but then melts in the mouth. Each season sees new variations appear in the shops: little bunnies for Easter, for example, or orange hagelslag for Koningsdag, an annual orange-themed street party to celebrate the King's birthday. The small packs seen in many hotel breakfast buffets are ideal for novices, and a few years back, one supermarket even experimented with pick 'n' mix. Whichever variety you choose, the habit is widespread, with an estimated 750,000 hagelslag sandwiches consumed each day.
Strictly speaking, hagelslag is a sugar-based vermicelli sprinkle that is chocolate or fruit-flavoured, but the name has become associated with other cheerfully packaged sugary toppings found on the same supermarket shelf, such as curly vlokken (chocolate flakes) and muisjes, sugar-coated aniseed seeds that look like tiny mice and are typically served on beschuit (rusks). In the 17th Century, aniseed was thought to aid lactation and help the womb contract, and pink or blueÂ muisjes on beschuitÂ are still served today to celebrate the arrival of a baby.
For Nicklin, whose favourite variety is the puur (dark chocolate), the crunchiness is very important. ""It's the bite with hagelslag. I don't think you can get that with any other spread,"" she says. ""It still makes me feel happy."" She bats back any suggestion that this sweet sandwich is messy to eat, explaining that her family use high-sided plates to catch any stray strands, which she insists are returned empty. ""It's a crime to leave any on the plate,"" she says.
The first sugary toppings, in the form of aniseed muisjes, are thought to date to the late 19th Century when Cornelius Rutgerus de Ruijter sold them from his bakery in Baarn in the province of Utrecht. The brand, now known as market leader De Ruijter, expanded their production to factory-made fruit hagelslag in 1928 and chocolate hagelslag and flokken in the 1950s.
Even Dutch royalty loved the sugary treat. King Willem III made the brand a purveyor of the court in 1883. And in 1985, under Queen Beatrix, De Ruijter received the Koninklijk (royal) predicate, an honour, a spokesperson from parent company Kraft-Heinz told BBC Travel, which ""can only be carried by Dutch companies who have been officially recognised for their important position within their discipline, are at least 100 years old and are considered of national importance"". Quite a fanfare for a modest chocolate sprinkle.
On an industrial estate in Tilburg â a short distance from the border with Belgium, wheresprinkles are commonly called muizenstrontjes (mouse droppings) â an immense but unremarkable building houses the world's largest hagelslag factory. Photographer Jordy Leenders from Eindhoven is one of the lucky few who has seen inside. Commissioned in 2018 to take photographs of its inner workings, he said he felt, ""like I was Charlie, being invited to the chocolate factory for a tour"".
Having gone through a machine that rid him of dust and disinfected his hands and arms, Leenders, kitted out in ear defenders and factory scrubs, emerged into a space filled by what he describes as a kind of ""indoor rollercoasterâ¦ crisscrossing the room"" made up of ""mazes"" of vast conveyor belts moving the hagelslag through different stages of preparation to perfect their size, texture and shape.
""Though the smell of chocolate is strong in the early stages when you're working with a raw material, it's the noise that really hits you,"" he says, describing the sound of the hagelslag being emptied from the silos ""like pouring 2,000kg of rice into a bucket"".
He notes that one of the most memorable sights was the extrusion process, which creates ""a very long string of hagelslag that they break off and cut"" before spraying it with a fine mist of sugar to give it its appealing gloss. Leenders was astounded by the ""absurd scale"" of the factory and the complex processes required ""in order to deliver a decoration to put on your sandwich"". ""When you have it in your hands, you're thinking that it is pretty simple,"" he says.
For newcomers to the Netherlands, it's the foodstuff itself that can be baffling. Colleen Geske, who moved to Amsterdam from Canada in 2005, has a clear memory of the first time she encountered hagelslag. Her first employer in the Netherlands shared a cafeteria with various tech, finance and law firms. ""Every lunch hour, I would see these tables of men in suits that were eating what I could only describe as the lunch of a four-year-old,"" recalls the author of Stuff Dutch People Eat and co-host of the Stuff Dutch People Like podcast. ""They were all with cartons of milk and having their bread with hagelslag. To me, it was such a bizarre sight.""
""Hagelslag tells us a lot about the Dutch,"" Geske adds. ""When you strip it away, the Dutch are not pretentious at all. They don't care what people think of them oftenâ¦ They're not over-analysing this, thinking: Is this healthy? Is this for children? They're just indulging in a relatively simple pleasure.""
Hagelslag occupies a special place in a cuisine, which is in general, ""quite practical, quite basic"", she adds. ""Hagelslag is the one kind of sparkly, shiny, interesting, funny, kind of quirky thing about a Dutch meal.""
More like this:
â¢Â Is the future of French cheese at stake?
â¢Â Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl
â¢Â A restorative soup made for cold season
But the tradition of eating this illogical little lunch is not all about the taste, she notes. ""I think, personally, that it's also this feeling of nostalgia that the Dutch have around eating hagelslag. It's like that one thing that you grew up with as a kid that you're still 'allowed' to do as an adult."" Due to its high sugar content, her own children are only allowed it at weekends. They're very specific about how it must be made, telling Geske: ""No, you need more butter and you have to put way more hagelslag on, and it has to be evenly distributed to the very edges...""
Leenders admits that the Dutch are eating ""basically a crushed chocolate bar on their sandwich"", which, he says, ""doesn't really make sense if you're looking at it from a nutritional perspective"". But that has never put him off. ""I've been raised in the Netherlands so I'm a frequent hagelslag eater,"" he says. ""I don't think you will encounter any Dutch household without at least one pack of hagelslagin their kitchen cabinets.""
As far as Leenders is concerned, there's nothing childish about hagelslag. ""It's for all ages,"" he insists. ""I know people over 60 who still start their day with a sandwich with hagelslag on top of it.""
""I struggle to get it in my head why they think it's for children,"" agrees Nicklin. ""My dad always had hagelslag on his bread. And she can't think why anyone would think a hagelslag sandwich makes no sense: ""If that's what they believe, then they're obviously not Dutch.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250219-the-illegal-church-at-the-heart-of-us-history,The 'secret' church at the heart of US history,"In the heart of what was once Britain's largest colony in the New World, a ""secret"" church reveals how Black people lived and worshipped in the US's earliest days.
The peal of a church bell cuts through the humid air in Williamsburg, Virginia. It's not just a call to worship; it's a declaration of resilience, faith and freedom. Since the United States' founding in 1776, African Americans have gathered at First Baptist Church, making it one of the nation's oldest continuous Black congregations.
Founded in 1632, Williamsburg served as the political and cultural capital of Britain's largest colony in the New World from 1699 to 1780. Today, Colonial Williamsburg â a 301-acre historic district featuring more than 600 restored and reconstructed homes, shops and taverns â is sometimes hailed as the ""world's largest living history museum"". Exploring its cobbled streets and interacting with its costumed interpreters offers a rare opportunity for visitors to time travel to the US's earliest days.
Williamsburg's taverns and government halls are where the US Founding Fathers debated the course of a new nation. Meanwhile, free and enslaved Black people â who comprised more than 52% of the town's population â toiled in its kitchens, built its homes and grew okra, basil and peanuts in its fields. They cooked the meals at King's Arms Tavern, crafted the bricks that line Duke of Gloucester Street and transported dignitaries in horse-drawn carriages, helping to shape the culture and foundation of what would become the United States.
Yet, it was illegal for Black residents to worship in a church without white supervision. ""We did it anyway,"" said Connie Harshaw, president of the Let Freedom Ring Foundation, which works to conserve First Baptist Church's buildings and artefacts.
The church, founded by free and enslaved African Americans at the height of the American Revolution, is one of the first independent Black congregations in America. Its existence reveals how Black Americans were actively shaping their own destiny, even as they were denied basic human rights. Yet, for too long, the nation's foremost site of early American history offered only a fleeting acknowledgement of this story, mirroring the US's broader failure to reckon with its past.
Worshippers first met in secret, gathering on nearby plantations and later in a secluded, densely wooded area known as Raccoon Chase, where a historical plaque now stands. In 1776 â the same year the Declaration of Independence ironically proclaimed ""All men are created equal"" â the loosely knit congregation formalised itself as the Baptist ""African church"".
By 1805, a white landowner offered congregants a swampy plot on Nassau Street where they built their first meetinghouse. Although a tornado destroyed the church in 1834, the congregation, then 500 strong, rebuilt a larger brick church on the same spot in 1856. Women raised funds to purchase a bell for the steeple, which called worshippers to service for decades before falling into disuse.
By the 20th Century, the thriving congregation was now called First Baptist Church, but new threats emerged. Beginning in 1926, businessman and philanthropist John D Rockefeller Jr and Reverend Dr WAR Goodwin planned Williamsburg's restoration, focusing only on structures central to the settlement's Anglican and white colonial past. First Baptist Church didn't fit that vision, and the building was demolished, paved over for a bus depot. The congregation relocated yet again to nearby Scotland Street in 1956.
Today, Colonial Williamsburg's restored and reconstructed buildings are designed to represent life in early America, but for generations, the site failed to incorporate the stories of African Americans, who shaped and built the colonial capital.
""We've always had African American interpreters in costume,"" said Janice Canady, African American Community Engagement Manager at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and a descendent of the church's early members. ""But telling the fuller story has been a struggle. People aren't always comfortable with the truth,"" she said.
Part of the challenge with uncovering that truth was that much of Williamsburg's Black history was passed down orally, making it difficult to pin down hard facts. In 2016, a dedicated steering committee was formed to document First Baptist Church's history and secure its rightful place in Williamsburg's narrative. One of the committee's first initiatives was restoring the church's early bell that hadn't rung since segregation. ""It's the sound of freedom when it rings,"" Harshaw said.
When the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture opened in Washington DC in 2016, the 500lb relic â fittingly known as the Freedom Bell â travelled to the nation's capital, where it was rung by President Barack Obama and four generations of a family descended from enslaved people for the dedication ceremony.
In the years since, the committee has worked to convey that the bell, the church and everything they represent isn't just Black history; it's America's history.
""History happens only once,"" Harshaw said. ""We were all here at the same time, the same place. We may have had different experiences, but we have a shared history.""
What started as a search for early church records, photographs, bibles and communion sets soon became something bigger. The Let Freedom Ring Foundation was formed and, partnering with Colonial Williamsburg, they excavated the paved-over bus depot on Nassau Street. What followed was an unexpected archaeological discovery.
In 2020, excavations unearthed a trove of artefacts extending beyond the church that reveal how Williamsburg's early African American community lived in the face of slavery.
""One example is animal bones from meals being eaten on-site,"" explained Jack Gary, executive director of archaeology at Colonial Williamsburg. ""People were coming together, worshiping all day, eating together. And remains of the food they were eating were left behind.""
Analysis revealed the remains of pork, beef and poultry, but also wild game like opossum, raccoon and muskrat. ""When we shared these findings with church descendants, one cousin mentioned their family still eats muskrat today,"" Gary said. ""It's cool to make that connection, what we see in the ground and modern community.""
But the most profound discovery was the burial site: 62 intact graves.
""We exhumed three to confirm their ancestry,"" Harshaw said. ""DNA tests and analysis confirmed they were of sub-Saharan descent. They are believed to be early congregants of the church.""
In a solemn ceremony in autumn 2024, Williamsburg dedicated dozens of grave markers to these early congregants â many of whom are directly related to area residents who still attend First Baptist Church today. Efforts are now underway to reconstruct the wood-framed meetinghouse on its original foundations. Perhaps most importantly, many feel that Colonial Williamsburg is making meaningful strides to integrate the experiences of Black residents into the settlement's broader story. In doing so, visitors come away with a more holistic understanding of how enslaved and free Black people shaped life in early America.
Organisers are hoping the First Baptist Church's restoration will be complete by 2026 in time for its 250th anniversary. The church's original foundations will be protected below a new modern wood-framed meetinghouse, and a glass portal will allow visitors and worshippers to peer down on some of the original bricks. Oral histories, documentary research and archaeological evidence will combine to honour First Baptist Church's story.
Nearby, another significant restoration is underway: the Bray School. Operated from 1760 to 1774, this London-funded Anglican charity taught free and enslaved Black children how to read while reinforcing the fictitious narrative that slavery was divinely ordained. Relocated nearby to the College of William & Mary in 1930, it moved to a new spot on Nassau Street within Colonial Williamsburg's historic area in 2023, adjacent to First Baptist Church's first permanent site. Now being restored to its original state, the Bray School adds yet another layer to Williamsburg's evolving historical narrative.
More like this:
â¢ The Alabama museum grappling with the 'Gulf of America'
â¢ The first free Black town in the US
â¢ The first Black American global superstar
In 2023, the US Congress approved an African American Heritage Trail in Williamsburg, another touchstone that will share the unheard side of the town's history. Together, these projects are ensuring that the Black experience is central to the visitor's experience.
That history continues to unfold at the modern First Baptist Church on Scotland Street, home to one of the region's most diverse congregations. Everyone is welcome to attend services, as well as to see artefacts documenting the church's rich history â including visits by civil rights leaders Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who preached from the pulpit; Rosa Parks; and Opal Lee, the ""grandmother of Juneteenth"".
And, of course, the Freedom Bell is there. Visitors are invited to ring it, just as generations before them have done.
""In spite of and because of it all, we still stand,"" Harshaw said. ""We're dressed up every Sunday, and we're not going anywhere.""

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250218-jasper-canadas-remote-but-accessible-dark-sky-sanctuary,The Canadian town under a sea of stars,"Spanning 11,000 sq km of protected, pristine wilderness, Jasper National Park offers a one-of-a-kind destination for stargazers.
It's a balmy October evening and an overture from the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra Strings hushes a buzzing crowd. Dusk has fallen in Jasper National Park, and I'm snug under a blanket, gazing up at a sea of stars amidst the Milky Way's glow. Just below, snow-dusted peaks rise towards the heavens and the clear, glacial-blue waters of Lac Beauvert blend into the inky darkness.
Symphony Under the Stars is one of many events at the annual Dark Sky Festival (17 October to 2 November 2025) held in Jasper National Park, one of the world's largest and most accessible dark sky preserves.
Designated as a Dark Sky Preserve in 2011 by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC) and spanning 11,000 sq km of protected land where minimal to no light pollution is allowed, Jasper isn't just one of the best places to stargaze; it's also an ideal spot to see the Northern Lights.Â And as experts predict that 2025 ""will mesmerise"" with one of the greatest aurora displays in 20 years, there's never been a better time to explore this quiet corner of the Canadian Rockies.
Unlike other Dark Sky Preserves in Canada and the USÂ that have little to no infrastructure or lodging, the eponymous 4,700-person town of Jasper â located within the preserve â allows travellers easy stargazing access. According to Tyler Burgardt, an astrophysicist and general manager of the Jasper Planetarium, what makes Jasper so unique is visitors can drive right in. Located roughly 3.5 hours from Edmonton and Calgary, the town's hotels and locally led stargazing tours means star-lovers don't need to rough it.
""You get to see something you don't get in other [accessible] places, which is the ability to see thousands of stars, even from the middle of town,"" Burgardt said.
His favourite tour is one offered in summer, where guests visit the planetarium and then take a twilight stroll down to a peninsula located on Lac Beauvert. Ringed by rugged peaks and hauntingly silent, the only sound you may hear is the soft ripple of wind on the water. Burgardt estimates the Northern Lights are visible here roughly every 10 days to two weeks. ""It's just absolutely beautiful,"" he said. ""It's a really cool way to truly experience the nighttime side of the Canadian Rockies.""
The quaint, alpine community is committed to ensuring that minimal artificial lighting is visible by installing streetlights that point downwards and have a softer glow than regular lights. As Burgardt notes, Jasper's location within the national park, and surrounded by the Unesco-designated Canadian Rocky Mountains, also provides a natural barrier from the artificial light created by nearby cities.
According to the RASC, the goal of a dark sky designation in a community is to promote ""low-impact lighting practices, to improve the nocturnal environment for plants and wildlife, to protect and expand dark observing sites for astronomy and to provide accessible locations for naturalists and the general public to experience the naturally dark night sky"".
Phillipa Gunn, public relations and communications officer for Parks Canada, said Jasper National Park initially met some of the requirements from the RASC needed to become a Dark Sky Preserve prior to its official designation, including accessible observation sites where visitors can view the sky.
""Jasper National Park is an ideal location for a Dark Sky Preserve as 97% of the park is a designated wilderness area, free of light pollution,"" Gunn said. Parks Canada has also continued to expand its dark sky interpretation programmes, while working with the town and private partners to ensure all the street fixtures in the townsite are dark-sky compliant. As a result, when driving to Jasper at night, it's nearly impossible to tell a town is even located in the vast blackness that envelopes the area.
In July 2024, a series of devastating fires ripped through Jasper, causing the ""jewel of the Rockies"" to close for several months. The park reopened last autumn in time for the Jasper Dark Sky Festival â albeit just on a smaller scale. But with 2025 marking the festival's 15th anniversary, Naji Khouri, director of destination development for Tourism Jasper, says this year's festival will be bigger than ever before. Plans include a drone show where 200 synchronised drones put on a light display, notable guest speakers (Bill Nye has previously attended), planetarium stargazing sessions and a portable telescope and tent at the base of the Jasper Sky Tram.
""We invite space or science enthusiasts, aurora chasers and anyone that is fascinated by the dark sky and wants to learn more about it. We have unique experiences that are really of interest to a wide range of people, including families,"" said Khouri. And locals want people to know that Jasper isn't only open for the Dark Sky Festival, but for business as usual, with more than 80% of local businesses back open since the blaze.
After hiking the Sulphur Skyline trail to experience sweeping views of the Fiddle River Valley and Utopia Mountain, paddling on the ""pearl necklace"" that is Maligne Lake or exploring the Pyramid Lake Overlook by day, visitors should also seek out stories of the stars from an Indigenous and cultural lens.
The Indigenous people of Canada have long utilised the night sky in all aspects of daily life: theÂ starsÂ and constellations served as guiding lights for their ancestors and the sky was used as both a clock and calendar, indicating when to plant, hunt and work the land. TheÂ starsÂ are also intrinsically linked to First Nations' spiritual identities and are connected to the legends of the past.
Matricia Bauer of Warrior Women, an Indigenous- and women-owned business run by Bauer and her daughter, offers a fireside stargazing tour in Jasper that is based around Indigenous creation stories. Being of Cree descent, Bauer recognised the importance of decolonising her own education and that included learning about the Cree Star Chart and the Indigenous constellations that came to rest in the kisik (sky), in Cree.
""[The Cree Star Chart] made sense of the world around me, it made sense of the Northern Lights,"" she said. ""I understood who Star Woman was. I understood why we come from the stars and why we return to the stars.""
In Cree culture, there are different Star Beings, and Star Woman is one of them. According to Bauer, Star Woman saw the Earth â where humans lived â and she gave up her Star Being to come to ""Turtle Island"" (North America) . When she became pregnant with twins, this was the start of the First People. At the end of her life, she was granted three wishes and one of the wishes was that she could return to the sky.

â¢ The only land disputed between the US and Canada
â¢ The last places on Earth to see truly dark starry nights
""And so, when we see the Northern Lights, we call that the Cipayuk,"" said Bauer. ""It means ancestors dancing, or ghosts dancing. It's reminding us that there is another realm that exists, that we get to stay in for the rest of our lives. It's when we go back to the Star World where we came from.""
As Bauer recants stories with songs, she also tells me about Spider Woman, the one who is weaving our fates in the dark sky that soars above us. She then recounts the story of the coyote, tricking the wolves and bears into the sky so that he could create his own constellation. A story that takes place in winter, to be told in winter, when the days are short, the nights are long and the fire becomes a place to gather.
To Bauer and many First Nations residents in and around Jasper, the stars, also known as achakosak, are considered relatives: ""Every constellation, every star has a beautiful song, has a beautiful story, has a beautiful place in our culture.""
There are many more stories that Bauer wants to tell for visitors, and many more conversations to still be had under the black cloak of Jasper's night sky. The snap, crackle and pop of the fire is an accompanying beat to the drum that she plays, and her voice dances towards the place where she knows she will one day return.

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250217-is-it-time-to-change-how-we-buy-travel-souvenirs,Is it time to change how we buy travel souvenirs?,"The BBC looks into the psychology behind travel souvenirs: why we buy them, their impact on local communities and the planet, and how we can shop more thoughtfully.
On a recent backpacking trip through the Himalayas, my bruises became the truest souvenirs. Three months later, many of the contusions remain â stubborn scars with no intention of fading. More personal than anything I could have bought, they carry a backstory only I can tell, and I know exactly where they came from, with no hidden costs to the planet or people. Perhaps that's why, over time, my desire for typical souvenirs has faded. I now value experiences over objects â looking for meaning in what I bring back rather than just another trinket.
But maybe that's just me. Two out of three Americans bring back a souvenir from their travels, with US sales topping $21bnÂ (Â£16.7bn) in 2022. The souvenir industry has drawn criticism for its reliance on mass production and cultural appropriation. Still, it remains to be an often-overlooked side of tourism's impact. Frequent flyers face scrutiny, but trinket collectors rarely do. Innovative ways to preserve memories remain largely unrealised. And when a friend hands me a fridge magnet stamped with their latest destination, I cringe. What does it really mean to take home a piece of a place, and at what cost?
Humans have always had a penchant for collecting things. The Romans brought home spices, animal skins and rare artefacts to commemorate their travels and conquests. In the 18th Century, iconic locations like the Rome's Colosseum and Stonehenge in England were plundered by souvenir-seekers.
With the rise of industralisation and capitalism, a lot changed: the world became more connected, tourism boomed and profits took centre stage. But the human need to remember stayed. ""Looking at a souvenir can bring back happy emotions as the brain links it to positive experiences,"" said Vaishnavi Madarkal, a psychologist and therapist based in India. ""This connection can happen with anything â [whether it's] an object, music or a smell.""
The word ""souvenir"" comes from French, meaning ""memory"" or ""remembrance"". But the allure of souvenirs goes beyond memories. According to Madarkal, often it's the dopamine rush of retail therapy or cultural gift-giving norms. Take Japan's omiyage tradition, where travellers bring back small edible gifts for friends, family and co-workers. I, too, have picked up presents like saffron and pimentÃ³n in Spain or seaweed chips in Thailand, wanting to share my travels with loved ones.
For many, souvenirs go beyond tangible reminders and material gifts â they satisfy a deeper need to say, ""I was there!"" ""At the core of our actions is a desire to feel heard, seen and validated,"" explains Madarkal. ""The same holds for why we may buy souvenirs.""
But how does this fit into a world already overwhelmed by excess? ""The era of innocent tourism â where it was seen as a benign and universally positive force â ended around 2015,"" says Justin Francis, co-founder of Responsible Travel, a UK-based travel agency specialising in ethical tourism. ""In Europe and America, protests against overtourism are growing. People are realising their vacations can leave lasting impacts on others' homes.""
Yet, while travellers today are more aware of their impact, souvenirs have been somewhat left behind. With 25 years in the travel industry, Francis offers a macro perspective. ""Though we haven't fully shifted yet, things have changed,"" he said. ""I've often witnessed travellers examine products, and ask, 'Where did this come from?'""
In a world flooded with mass-produced items and fake markets, this question is crucial. A 2022 report by the Australian Government's Productivity Commission found that up to 75% of souvenirs marketed as ""Indigenous"" in Australia were counterfeit, with boomerangs and didgeridoos traced to Indonesia. Meanwhile, more than 70% of Thailand's popular elephant pants are made overseas. The battle of pashmina shawl artisans against cheaper, mass-produced alternatives is also well known.
""In the Leh market [in Ladakh, India], about 95% of fabrics sold as pashmina aren't genuine,"" says Sonam Angmo, co-founder of Lena Ladakh Pashmina, a slow textile brand focused on preserving the pashmina legacy while supporting local artisans. ""[The fake fabric] is mass-produced in places like Ludhiana and Punjab then brought to Ladakh by outsiders.""
A genuine pashmina shawl can cost upwards of 30,000 rupees (Â£280) due to the effort of raising goats in harsh climates and handcrafting the shawls. But for many travellers, this price is out of reach. As a result, some shops sell imitation shawls for 3,000-5,000 rupees (Â£27.4-Â£45.7), with most customers simply seeking a pashmina ""bought in Ladakh"" and giving little regard to its origins.
The high cost of genuine pashmina has driven demand for counterfeits, with the profitability of fake or ""semi-pashmina"" ensuring a steady supply. Angmo aptly calls this a ""vicious cycle"" that impacts local communities dependent on tourism. Frustrated by the difficulty of selling authentic items, some artisans resort to purchasing fake fabrics or working with mechanised looms. ""It's how they feed their families,"" Angmo explains. This may create a dilemma for shoppers: while purchasing counterfeit goods might seem to support local retailers, the true cost is often borne by artisans who rely on time-honoured craftsmanship.
One thing is clear: the desire to immortalise our travels isn't going anywhere. What's more, many communities, like those around busy tourist sites like Angkor Wat in Cambodia or Petra in Jordan, have thrived by turning souvenirs into a source of livelihood. Perhaps it's not about avoiding souvenirs entirely, but about making responsible choices.
It used to be easier to spot genuine local souvenirs. In places like Fez, Morocco, travellers could expect every leather good in the medina's souks to come from the city's iconic tanneries. But today's knockoffs are so sophisticated that even experts may struggle to distinguish them.
Besides, most souvenirs are small, portable and affordable â qualities that make them appealing. This explains why many of the world's most popular souvenirs fit this mould. Meanwhile, sellers are more aware of consumer mindfulness, often marketing items as ""handcrafted"" or ""recycled"", though the truth can be far from the label. When so many forces are at play, even the best intentions to be mindful and responsible can become difficult to uphold.
More like this:
â¢Â  The new museum trend helping us regain our lost attention
â¢Â  How will air pollution change where and when we travel?
â¢Â  What makes a tourist attraction?
So, how can you buy souvenirs that are ethical, sustainable and meaningful? Sonam and Francis both agree: ask questions. ""Be curiousâ¦ it's not just about buying or choosing carefully, it's about rejecting and explaining why,"" said Francis. ""You could say, 'This sculpture is beautiful, but I'm concerned about its environmental impact.'""
Srishti Tehri, a mindful traveller and content creator, emphasises being patient when souvenir hunting. She loves magnets for their daily visibility, but not just any magnet. ""I try to find the most interesting ones and put them on my wall of fame â my fridge,"" she says. ""I go the extra mile for unique designs or to support an artist. The generic ones are mostly ugly and feel like a scam."" I agree. My rule: if every shop carries the same design, it's likely mass-produced.
Another way to ethically shop is to support reputable cooperatives and fair-trade markets. For instance, Women in Hebron features embroidered products and handicrafts by Palestinian women. Bangkok's Artist House, a centuries-old Thai wooden home, sells live portraits and wooden Muay Thai figurines and even offers opportunities to create your own souvenir.
Many countries now certify authentic local goods, too. In India, genuine pashmina shawls bear GI (Geographical Indication) tags; Australia uses the black-and-red Indigenous Art Code logo; and the SÃ¡mi Doudji label in Nordic countries guarantees items are made by SÃ¡mi artisans.
Intentions also matter. I no longer buy souvenirs on every trip â for myself or others. When I do, I ensure they're meaningful. Sometimes, I even ask friends what they want instead of guessing. Tehri echoes this: ""I never buy the same thing for everyone. My love language shifts â some prefer something utilitarian; others love collectables.""
A good souvenir doesn't always have to be bought or tangible. When you think beyond ""souvenirs"" and more about what sparks memories, the possibilities get exciting. Maybe it's a letter sent from your destination, a well-kept travel journal, or even something salvaged â like beer caps or ticket stubs. Some travellers capture the sounds of their adventures while others take home tattoos. Join a cooking class, and you can take home a souvenir that keeps giving â new culinary skills.
Ultimately, there's no universal rule for what makes a ""responsible"" souvenir; it's a personal decision we each make. But next time you're grabbing a quick airport trinket or ticking off your gift list, pause and reflect.
""We live in a world of faceless transactions,"" says Francis. ""If you think back to the Silk Road, trade was personal. You met the seller, exchanged something of value and that made the trade meaningful."" Souvenirs, he believes, offer a chance to reclaim that intimacy. By buying directly from the maker, witnessing their craft and cutting out middlemen, you experience what Francis calls ""the purest form of commerce"".

https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250214-the-fearless-lionfish-huntresses-of-the-caribbean,The fearless lionfish huntresses of the Caribbean,"Two women are working to save the coral reef from the invasive lionfish, using it as a sustainable teaching tool and cooking it into everything from tacos to fish and chips.
Curacao is facing an ecological challenge: the invasiveÂ lionfish. The venomous lionfish have brown, red and white zebra-like stripes, fleshy tentacles and long, fan-like fins. They are native to the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, butÂ sometime in the late 1980s they were introduced to the warm tropical waters off Florida's Atlantic Coast. Although the exact cause of this is unknown, it's theorised that they were released from marine aquariums. By the early 2000s, they had reached the Caribbean coastline and Curacao's coral reef, where diving significantly contributes to the local economy and employment.
Lionfish are not a welcome species anywhere because they reproduce at an alarming rate; females release aboutÂ two million eggs per yearÂ and as they grow, they eat smaller native fish and marine life that protect coral reefs.Â This behaviour creates an imbalance thatÂ disrupts the reef's ecosystem. The presence of lionfish impacts both diving tourism and the commercial fishing industry, withÂ research showing that even in a short period of time, the presence of lionfish can reduce a native reef fish population by 79%.
But what is problematic has become a catalyst for innovative adaptation and environmental responsibility. Through food, art and education, the unique but complicated relationship between Curacao and its lionfish is being tackled by two local women, Helmi Smeulders and Lisette Keus.
Smeulders left her law career in the Netherlands in 1998 and relocated to Curacao, eventually becoming a chef, diver and conservationist.Â But what did a lawyer-turned-chef know about hunting the invasive lionfish, sustainable fishing and the importance of protecting the reef for future generations? Turns out not much, until she teamed up with local diver Keus, who taught Smeulders (along with other women on the island) how to find and capture the lionfish to help save the coral reef. ""I showed [chefs] how to clean them, gave [them] recipes and gave batches [of the fish] for free to restaurants to practise with,"" says Keus.
After coming across the fish during dives years earlier, Keus decided to dedicate herself to controlling its population. She excelled at catching it and became known as somewhat of a lionfish whisperer as she always seemed to know exactly where to find the elusive creature.Â In 2012, she started trying to sell the fish to restaurants.
At first it was a challenge. No one wanted to buy (or eat) the fish because they were believed to be poisonous (they're actually only venomous; the fins on their back sting when touched and can cause swelling and pain). ""Everyone was afraid of [the fish] and they didn't know if it was safe to touch or eat,"" she says.Â ""I had my cooler full but I found myself throwing pounds of fish back into the ocean because I couldn't sell it. ""
Keus devised a way to make the fish palatable to local chefs. ""I explained that lionfish are an invasive species, so by cleaning it safely and serving it, they were actually helping to protect the local Curacao ecosystem,"" she says.
As Keus's lionfish business grew, she wanted to address another issue: waste. After removing the venomous, spiny parts of the fish, only about 20% of each lionfish was left for consumption. Keus started asking restaurants for the fish fins back to make jewellery. She opened a retail store calledÂ Lionfish CaribbeanÂ in 2016, located in Kura Hulanda Village, selling hand-made lionfish jewellery and providing education and training to divers and tourists about the invasive species. She also opened a tasting room serving lionfish tacos and fried lionfish and chips.
Their tagline? ""We eat them to beat them.""
Smeulders is also a big proponent of cooking lionfish, which she first started doing in 2013 when she cooked at a large dinner reception for the King and Queen of the Netherlands during their visit to Curacao. With a reputation for using exclusively local ingredients, Smeuldersâ decision to include the lionfish was not only logical, but a beneficial and sustainable menu choice.
Smeulders reached out to Keus and other divers with a request to catch as many lionfish as possible for the dinner. Then? ""I did what I do best: I served a plate of small bites with a modern Caribbean flair,"" she says. Her poached lionfish, prepared with a rich and buttery hollandaise sauce and hint of lemon, was the standout. Because lionfishÂ is a white fish with a mild, delicate flavour that's somewhere between cod and lobster (and a good source of omega-3 fatty acids) ""it helped capture the essence of the island's unique cuisine,"" says Smeulders.
Beyond cooking lessons and full stomachs, Smeulders shares her own dives and lionfish hunting adventures with her students and has become a fearless lionfish huntress in her own regard. She uses the lionfish to teach about sustainability and environmental responsibility, encouraging people to consider the ethical side of consuming the fish that's given up its life. She hopes it reminds people of their own role in the food chain, fostering a direct relationship with the environment and the cycle of life.Â She's written two cookbooks and also offers Chef's Table events where people can watch Smeulders and her team work.

""Some of my favourite recipes to use lionfish are flavourful ceviches,â Smeulders says. ""I also like it as a tartare, tacos and I use the bones to make a good stock."" She goes on to explain, ""we can use the spine as well because it's protein. We heat the spine for 20 minutes at 200C and it neutralises the venom. You can use [the spine bones] as little scores [picks]"".
These two dynamic lionfish huntresses are fearless to no end. They each admit to being addicted to the thrill of it. ""If you wake up and realise it's a day you get to go lionfish hunting,"" says Smeulders, ""then it's definitely going to be a good day.""
