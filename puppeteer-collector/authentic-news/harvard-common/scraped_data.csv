https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/the-pain-of-muscle-strains,The pain of muscle strains,"Most people follow a commonsense approach to soothing sore muscles: take it easy and maybe pop an over-the-counter pain remedy. In a day or so, the pain usually goes away. But what if it doesn't improve? Or if the pain becomes quite severe and affects mobility? Or if other symptoms appear? If so, then you may have a muscle strain, sometimes called a pulled muscle, which requires special attention.
        Stretched to the limit
        A muscle strain occurs when muscle fibers are stretched beyond their limits or forced to contract too strongly. They often strike the shoulders, neck, abdominal area, back, hips, and legs.
        ""Strains often occur when muscles are fatigued, overused, or not properly warmed up,"" says Dr. Robert Shmerling, former clinical chief at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's Division of Rheumatology. ""An imbalance between weak and strong muscles can also cause a strain.""
        The risk of muscle strains is high during sports activities with quick start-and-stop motions, like tennis or basketball. But they can also happen from a single movement (such as using a too-heavy dumbbell), repeated motion (like the back-and-forth movement of raking leaves), or something as ordinary as stepping off a curb.
        Soreness or strain?
        You can tell the difference between regular muscle soreness and a strain by pain location and healing time. For instance, pain in a large area, such as your entire back, is likely caused by sore muscles. Pain in one specific area of your back could be a strain. If the pain eases after a few days, you probably have sore muscles. However, if the pain has not improved after several days — or if it has worsened — that's likely a sign of a significant muscle strain.
        Muscle strains can have a spectrum of symptoms. Besides increasing pain, they can include severe soreness, swelling, throbbing, weakness, tenderness, and bruising. There are three grades of muscle strains, based on their severity:
        Grade 1 (mild). Only a few muscle fibers are stretched or torn. Although the injured muscle is tender and painful, it has normal strength.
        Grade 2 (moderate). This strain has more injured fibers and more severe muscle pain and tenderness. There is also mild swelling, noticeable loss of strength, and sometimes a bruise.
        Grade 3 (severe). This strain tears the muscle all the way through, sometimes causing a ""pop"" sensation as the muscle rips into two separate pieces or shears away from its tendon. Grade 3 strains are serious injuries that cause significant loss of muscle function and considerable pain, swelling, tenderness, and discoloration. Because grade 3 strains usually cause a sharp break in the normal outline of the muscle, there may be a noticeable dent or gap under the skin where the pieces of muscle have separated.
        
          
            
              
                Prevent muscle strains
                Here are some ways to reduce the risk of muscle strains when exercising:
                
                  Do a five- to 10-minute dynamic warm-up, such as power walking or a series of leg swings, lunges, and arm circles.
                  Increase the intensity of your exercise program gradually. Never push yourself too hard or too soon.
                  Always use the correct technique when you lift heavy loads.
                
              
            
          
        
        Home treatments
        You can treat most mild to moderate strains with home remedies. Begin with the RICE method (rest, ice, compression, and elevation), which also can be speed up the healing of regular sore muscles.
        Rest. Rest the injured muscle (and take a temporary break from exercise and sports activities).
        Ice. Apply an ice bag or gel pack wrapped in a cloth to the affected area for 15 to 20 minutes three or four times a day at least two hours apart. Don't apply ice directly to the skin; instead, put the ice in a towel or plastic bag before placing it on the sore area. Ice helps reduce swelling and inflammation. After a day or so, alternate between ice and heat.
        Compression. Wrap the area in an elastic bandage. Make sure the pressure is snug but not too tight.
        Elevation. For leg or arm muscle soreness, raise the affected limb to a level above your heart.
        ""Take over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, unless you've been advised by your doctors to avoid them,"" says Dr. Shmerling. The usual choice is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve). Acetaminophen (Tylenol) eases pain but does not help with inflammation; people commonly take it when they want to avoid the side effect of an upset stomach common with NSAIDs.
        Only take the recommended dose, and check with your doctor if you need more pain relief, especially if you have a history of heart, liver, stomach, or kidney disease. People also can try drugstore pain relief gels or creams. ""There is no strong evidence to explain how they work, but they're thought to alter the body's pain perception,"" says Dr. Shmerling. Other remedies for mild to moderate strains include these:
        Stretching. Gentle stretching promotes healing by re-establishing the normal length of the muscles.
        Massage. Gently massage the injured muscle for 30 seconds at a time using your hands, a foam roller, or a tennis ball. This promotes the normal breakdown and repair of muscle tissue.
        Hydration. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Water can aid recovery by helping cells flush out waste products.
        If symptoms don't improve after a week or if they become more severe, seek medical attention, as you may have a grade 3 strain or another problem.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/what-should-be-my-cholesterol-goal-with-a-family-history-of-heart-disease,What should be my cholesterol goal with a family history of heart disease?,"Q. 
          I'm a 70-year-old man with a family history of coronary artery disease. I currently take a low-dose statin. My recent LDL number is 105. Should I aim for a lower number?
        
        A. My situation is similar to yours. I have some family members who died young secondary to coronary heart disease, and I run a high total and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. I exercise regularly and try to follow a Mediterranean-style diet.
        About 15 years ago, my doctor recommended starting a statin. Even at a low dose, I experienced more aches and pains than I had previously. I stopped the statin, but in retrospect, I now doubt that the muscle aches were related to the drug.
        Eight years ago, I had a chest CT scan unrelated to any heart issues. My lungs were fine, but the scan showed calcium deposits in my arteries, including the coronary arteries that feed oxygen and nutrients to the heart. That was a game changer. Calcium gets deposited into fatty plaques that accumulate in the arteries. I knew this indicated that my risks of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke were significantly elevated. I immediately began taking the maximum dose of rosuvastatin (Crestor). Interestingly, I had no muscle aches, even with the high dose.
        In general, the lower your LDL cholesterol number, the lower your risk of developing heart disease. My high risk and need for a high-dose statin became apparent after the CT scan. But what about you and the millions of men with a similar family history or a somewhat elevated LDL level?
        Here's the discussion I would have with a man like you, who has a higher-than-ideal LDL level and is asking about increasing his statin dose or might not be on a statin yet.
        If you desire to maximally reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, aim for an LDL level of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). This means lifestyle changes, including a healthier diet and more physical activity. But you might also want to talk with your doctor about starting a low-dose statin or raising the dose if you already take one.
        An alternative is to have a coronary artery CT scan to get your coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. The test calculates the amount of calcium deposited in your coronary arteries. A zero score means a very low risk of trouble, and a high score means you might aim for an LDL level of 55 mg/dL or lower (the European Society of Cardiology recommendation for people at very high risk).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-faster-more-accurate-way-to-diagnose-heart-disease,"A faster, more accurate way to diagnose heart disease?","If you experience a short-lived squeezing sensation or discomfort in your chest when you exercise or feel stress, one possible cause is insufficient blood flow to your heart. Known as stable angina, this condition indicates you may be at risk for a heart attack.
        To diagnose (or rule out) potential heart problems, doctors used to start with a stress test. This test monitors the heart's electrical activity, muscle function, and blood flow patterns while the heart is under stress from exercise or medication. But there's a downside: stress tests only detect when a person has one or more severely narrowed arteries (typically more than 70% blocked) that restrict blood flow, triggering symptoms and abnormal findings during the test.
        ""We now know that most heart attacks occur not from those serious blockages but when smaller, nonobstructive plaques rupture and form a clot that triggers a heart attack,"" says Dr. Ron Blankstein, a senior preventive cardiologist and director of cardiac computed tomography at Brigham and Women's Hospital. An alternative test, called coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), creates a three-dimensional image of the heart and its blood vessels. The image reveals both obstructive and nonobstructive plaque, he explains. Growing evidence suggests that CCTA may improve how cardiologists find and treat heart disease (see ""How high-tech heart scans may clarify heart attack risk"").
        
          
            
              
                How high-tech heart scans may clarify heart attack risk
                Advances in x-ray and computing technology have enabled us to see increasingly detailed images of the body, including the arteries of the heart. In 1999, the first use of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) combined just four cross-sectional images, each called a slice. Modern multi-detector scanners now generate more than 64 slices, and some — known as photon-counting CT scanners — operate at faster speeds and provide better resolution. These higher-quality images can now more accurately predict who might benefit from medications to detect early coronary artery disease and prevent its progression, thereby reducing the odds of a heart attack.
                In 2018, a study called SCOT-HEART compared standard care (which typically included stress testing plus recommended medications) to standard care plus CCTA. While early results showed that people who had CCTA scans were more likely to undergo additional procedures in the first year after their scan, the number of procedures had evened out between the groups five years into the study. However, those in the CCTA group were more likely to be taking preventive drugs and were 41% less likely to die of cardiovascular disease or to have had a heart attack.
                Ten years into the study, 56% of the CCTA group were taking medications (including aspirin and statins) to reduce their risk of a heart attack compared to 49% in the standard test group. What's more, the rate of nonfatal heart attacks was 28% lower in the CCTA group compared with those who had standard tests. The findings were published Jan. 25, 2025, in The Lancet. ""It's the first study to show that the type of test used to evaluate chest pain may have a direct impact on a person's health outcomes,"" says Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Ron Blankstein.
              
            
          
        
        What is CCTA?
        CCTA uses a special CT scanner to take multiple, high-speed x-rays to create three-dimensional views of the blood vessels and other heart structures (see photos). Before the scan, you receive an injection of contrast dye into your arm or hand that ""lights up"" the blood vessels. You may also be given medications to slow your heart rate and widen your blood vessels. During the scan, you lie on a table that moves through a donut-shaped opening in the scanner. While the preparation and setup may take up to an hour, the actual scan lasts just seconds.
        CCTA has a ""Class 1"" indication and an ""A"" level of evidence — the strongest possible recommendation — for use as a first-line tool to evaluate people with chest discomfort or those coming to the emergency room with chest pain, says Dr. Blankstein. Most cases of chest pain seen in emergency rooms end up having nothing to do with the heart, so CCTA can be helpful to rule out a possible heart attack in people who may be at risk for one. However, the test is more commonly used to assess people with stable angina.
        The most common symptom of stable angina is a feeling of pressure, tightness, or squeezing in the center of the chest that typically subsides within a few minutes. Some people feel discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, and some may feel short of breath (what doctors refer to as dyspnea).
        Advice about CCTA
        ""There's tremendous excitement about increasing the use of CCTA. But the benefit depends heavily on the quality of the image, and not all scanners are the same,"" says Dr. Blankstein.
        Certain people aren't good candidates for CCTA. These include people who have a very high heart rate that can't be effectively lowered with medication, or a very high body mass index (40 or higher). Both conditions can hinder image quality. Some people should avoid the test because they have an allergy to the contrast material.
        People with known coronary artery disease may be less likely to benefit from CCTA because the results might not change how they're treated, says Dr. Blankstein. But as the technology advances, repeat scans might one day help physicians see how well specific therapies are working and if adjustments are needed.
        Future refinements?
        Two medical device companies, HeartFlow and Cleerly, use artificial intelligence to analyze CCTA results in greater detail. In theory, quantifying the exact amount of plaque a person has — especially the nonobstructive type — could further refine a person's risk calculation. But we don't yet know whether that information adds any value on top of a visual inspection of the scan, Dr. Blankstein says. Still, the current CCTA technology helps doctors provide a more personalized approach to preventive cardiology. ""In general, the more plaque someone has, the more likely we are to suggest aggressive therapies,"" he says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/a-three-pronged-approach-to-exercise,A three-pronged approach to exercise,"There's no question that getting regular exercise ranks as one of the leading strategies — if not the best one — for preventing heart disease. All forms of physical activity, even in small doses, can make a difference. But if you're looking to optimize your cardiovascular health, a regimen that includes three types of movement may be the way to go, according to a 2024 review article in Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine.
        The foundation of this exercise triad is moderate-intensity aerobic (cardio) exercise like brisk walking, one of the go-to options for meeting the federal activity guidelines (see ""Exercise recommendations and examples""). Moderate activity benefits your heart by burning calories and boosting metabolism, which helps control weight. But you can reap additional benefits by adding vigorous aerobic activity (the type that really gets your heart pumping) along with muscle-strengthening exercises.
        
          
            
              
                Exercise recommendations and examples
                Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity (or an equivalent combination of the two). Do strength training at least two days per week — even 10 to 15 minutes per session can be effective.
                Your age, baseline fitness level, and health conditions all affect what workout is best for you. Ask your doctor for help creating a safe three-part workout to optimize your heart health.

        How aerobic exercise helps
        ""People who run or do similar types of vigorous exercise may have experienced a 'runner's high' either during or after their workout,"" says Dr. Tim Churchill, a cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. That's because your body releases feel-good chemicals known as endorphins and endocannabinoids in response to intense exercise.
        Any kind of aerobic exercise, whether moderate or vigorous, also helps dampen the body's ""fight or flight"" response, which plays a role in chronic stress and anxiety. Aerobic exercise also spurs the release of adrenalin and related hormones that stimulate receptors in the heart to beat more frequently and forcefully. Over time, the heart becomes more efficient, requiring less effort to send blood through the body. And as more blood circulates through the body, blood vessels expand slightly and become more flexible.
        Why muscle-building matters
        Including muscle-building exercises in your weekly routine has a synergistic effect with aerobic exercise that can further enhance your heart health. Strength training can make your body more efficient at burning fat for energy. It also helps improve how your body responds to insulin, the hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels, Dr. Churchill says. That can help prevent or improve diabetes, a potent risk factor for heart disease. Strength training also promotes the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and widens blood vessels. ""Your arteries are then better able to relax, which helps to maintain normal blood pressure,"" says Dr. Churchill.
        As the review article notes, combining strength with moderate-intensity and some vigorous aerobic exercise leads to greater reductions in resting heart rate, blood pressure, body weight, and body fat percentage than doing single forms of exercise. ""Exercise clearly improves a lot of specific markers related to cardiovascular disease. But when you add up all those individual effects, it still only accounts for about 50% of the overall health benefit related to doing regular physical activity,"" says Dr. Churchill. The elusive remaining 50% is why the decades-long quest to create ""exercise in a pill"" will probably never materialize, he adds.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/not-just-another-headache,Not just another headache,"Mia delivered a baby and went home feeling fine. Within a week, however, she developed a persistent headache. She brushed it off for two or three days, reasoning that she was sleep deprived. But her head hurt even worse when she had to cough or bear down, and then her vision went wonky, seeming blurry.
        Fortunately, Mia made a prompt doctor's appointment. The culprit? A clot in one of the veins of her brain, which increased pressure in her skull and triggered her headache.
        Mia's situation is unusual, since only a tiny fraction of headaches indicates something is seriously amiss, Harvard experts say. Far more common are the harmless headaches that happen to people every day. About 4% of American adults report ""being bothered a lot"" by headaches in the past three months — with women three times as likely to report the problem as men, according to the CDC.
        Some people power through headaches, even severe ones, because they're convinced they shouldn't complain about such a common issue. But certain sensations tend to tip people off when they're not having a run-of-the-mill headache.
        ""In general, people know their headaches really well,"" says Dr. Paul Rizzoli, division chief of the Graham Headache Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital. ""With that in mind, any changes to your typical pattern of headaches could be worth paying attention to.""
        Red flags
        If headaches are happening more frequently or getting progressively more painful, it's time to see a doctor. The following signs also increase the risk that a headache stems from a worrisome underlying cause.
        You also have other symptoms. Watch for fatigue, fever, night sweats, or double vision. ""These types of symptoms can happen if you have an infection or increased pressure in the brain,"" says Dr. Linda Wendell, chief of neurology at Harvard-affiliated Mount Auburn Hospital.
        You're over 50 and your headaches have changed. Maybe you never had them before, and now you get them regularly. Or they're happening in a different area of your head. ""As we get older, there's a higher probability that new headaches are associated with other problems,"" Dr. Wendell says.
        Your headaches get worse when you lie down, after exercise or sex, or when you cough. These activities temporarily alter the pressure inside your brain, leading to pain. While this might be due to various causes, doctors will need to rule out a tumor or other reasons for increased pressure inside the skull, Dr. Wendell says.
        Your pain doesn't respond to simple remedies. Most headaches recede if you take a nonprescription pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), or naproxen (Aleve), or if you drink some water and lie down for a nap. ""In general, you should get some relief from over-the-counter pain medication; if not, contact your doctor for advice,"" Dr. Wendell says.
        Emergency signs
        Some distinct symptoms can't wait for a doctor's appointment. If any of these occurs, call 911 or head to an emergency department immediately:
        A ""thunderclap"" headache. So named because the pain arrives suddenly and violently, ascending in seconds, this can sometimes occur with bleeding in the brain or a variety of other serious causes. ""A thunderclap headache is sometimes referred to as the worst of your life,"" Dr. Wendell says.
        Headache with fever and a stiff neck. This combination often signals meningitis, a potentially life-threatening inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. ""This isn't the same as coming home from work with tight muscles on one side of the neck and a tension headache,"" Dr. Rizzoli says. ""It's dramatic. You'll feel terrible.""
        Headache with neurological symptoms. Vision changes, difficulty speaking, or numbness and weakness may suggest a stroke, as does confusion, sleepiness, or other signs of altered mental status. ""Regardless of whether or not you have a headache, any new neurological symptoms — especially when they affect one side of the body — constitute an emergency,"" Dr. Wendell says.
        Sudden headache with vomiting. While this duo often occurs during a migraine, in some cases it can also indicate a much more serious condition, such as a ruptured aneurysm or other reason for bleeding in the brain.
        Headache after a blow to the head, such as from a fall, auto accident, or sports injury. ""Most people know to get evaluated if they hit their head and then get a headache,"" Dr. Wendell says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/treating-high-blood-pressure-may-help-lower-risk-of-cognitive-decline,Treating high blood pressure may help lower risk of cognitive decline,"People with high blood pressure can greatly reduce their risk for cardiovascular disease by aggressively driving down their blood pressure numbers. A study published Feb. 11, 2025, in Neurology suggests the effort may have another benefit: reducing the risk of cognitive decline. Researchers used data from the SPRINT study, which compared intensive treatment to standard treatment of systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) among people with high blood pressure.
        SPRINT's researchers focused on 9,361 patients over age 50, who were randomly assigned to a systolic blood pressure goal of either less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) — intensive treatment — or less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment). After seven years, those who had undergone intensive treatment had an 11% lower risk for mild cognitive impairment compared with people who had received standard treatment. The findings suggest that keeping blood pressure closer to 120 mm Hg may be more beneficial for brain health.

Everyone's heart function was tested with cardiac PET scans. CT scans measured the amounts of fat and muscle in their chest. From these measurements, researchers calculated the participants' ""fatty muscle fraction"" — the ratio of intermuscular fat to total muscle plus total fat — to quantify how much fat was stored within each person's muscles.",Matthew Solan,"May 1, 2025"

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sedentary-work-may-contribute-to-insomnia,Sedentary work may contribute to insomnia,"People with sedentary jobs — an estimated 80% of the workforce — have a much higher risk of experiencing insomnia compared with people who are active at work, according to a study published online Jan. 7, 2025, by the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology.
        Researchers surveyed nearly 1,300 people twice over a 10-year span, inquiring about their job schedules and physical activity levels while at work. They also asked about participants' sleep habits, identifying three sleep health categories: good sleepers, catch-up sleepers, and insomnia-like sleepers. Compared with active work, sedentary work was 37% likelier to lead to a variety of insomnia symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep, interrupted sleep, and frequent daytime tiredness. The findings also indicated that workers who fall into a pattern of poor sleep due to their job design can end up stuck in such unhealthy patterns for many years. Insomnia-like sleepers, for example, reported their symptoms persisted 10 years later, at the end of the study.
        People with sedentary jobs who move their bodies during the workday can help protect themselves against developing longstanding sleep problems, study authors said.
