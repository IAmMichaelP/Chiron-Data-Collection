https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/the-pain-of-muscle-strains,The pain of muscle strains,"Most people follow a commonsense approach to soothing sore muscles: take it easy and maybe pop an over-the-counter pain remedy. In a day or so, the pain usually goes away. But what if it doesn't improve? Or if the pain becomes quite severe and affects mobility? Or if other symptoms appear? If so, then you may have a muscle strain, sometimes called a pulled muscle, which requires special attention.
        Stretched to the limit
        A muscle strain occurs when muscle fibers are stretched beyond their limits or forced to contract too strongly. They often strike the shoulders, neck, abdominal area, back, hips, and legs.
        ""Strains often occur when muscles are fatigued, overused, or not properly warmed up,"" says Dr. Robert Shmerling, former clinical chief at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's Division of Rheumatology. ""An imbalance between weak and strong muscles can also cause a strain.""
        The risk of muscle strains is high during sports activities with quick start-and-stop motions, like tennis or basketball. But they can also happen from a single movement (such as using a too-heavy dumbbell), repeated motion (like the back-and-forth movement of raking leaves), or something as ordinary as stepping off a curb.
        Soreness or strain?
        You can tell the difference between regular muscle soreness and a strain by pain location and healing time. For instance, pain in a large area, such as your entire back, is likely caused by sore muscles. Pain in one specific area of your back could be a strain. If the pain eases after a few days, you probably have sore muscles. However, if the pain has not improved after several days — or if it has worsened — that's likely a sign of a significant muscle strain.
        Muscle strains can have a spectrum of symptoms. Besides increasing pain, they can include severe soreness, swelling, throbbing, weakness, tenderness, and bruising. There are three grades of muscle strains, based on their severity:
        Grade 1 (mild). Only a few muscle fibers are stretched or torn. Although the injured muscle is tender and painful, it has normal strength.
        Grade 2 (moderate). This strain has more injured fibers and more severe muscle pain and tenderness. There is also mild swelling, noticeable loss of strength, and sometimes a bruise.
        Grade 3 (severe). This strain tears the muscle all the way through, sometimes causing a ""pop"" sensation as the muscle rips into two separate pieces or shears away from its tendon. Grade 3 strains are serious injuries that cause significant loss of muscle function and considerable pain, swelling, tenderness, and discoloration. Because grade 3 strains usually cause a sharp break in the normal outline of the muscle, there may be a noticeable dent or gap under the skin where the pieces of muscle have separated.
        
          
            
              
                Prevent muscle strains
                Here are some ways to reduce the risk of muscle strains when exercising:
                
                  Do a five- to 10-minute dynamic warm-up, such as power walking or a series of leg swings, lunges, and arm circles.
                  Increase the intensity of your exercise program gradually. Never push yourself too hard or too soon.
                  Always use the correct technique when you lift heavy loads.
                
              
            
          
        
        Home treatments
        You can treat most mild to moderate strains with home remedies. Begin with the RICE method (rest, ice, compression, and elevation), which also can be speed up the healing of regular sore muscles.
        Rest. Rest the injured muscle (and take a temporary break from exercise and sports activities).
        Ice. Apply an ice bag or gel pack wrapped in a cloth to the affected area for 15 to 20 minutes three or four times a day at least two hours apart. Don't apply ice directly to the skin; instead, put the ice in a towel or plastic bag before placing it on the sore area. Ice helps reduce swelling and inflammation. After a day or so, alternate between ice and heat.
        Compression. Wrap the area in an elastic bandage. Make sure the pressure is snug but not too tight.
        Elevation. For leg or arm muscle soreness, raise the affected limb to a level above your heart.
        ""Take over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, unless you've been advised by your doctors to avoid them,"" says Dr. Shmerling. The usual choice is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve). Acetaminophen (Tylenol) eases pain but does not help with inflammation; people commonly take it when they want to avoid the side effect of an upset stomach common with NSAIDs.
        Only take the recommended dose, and check with your doctor if you need more pain relief, especially if you have a history of heart, liver, stomach, or kidney disease. People also can try drugstore pain relief gels or creams. ""There is no strong evidence to explain how they work, but they're thought to alter the body's pain perception,"" says Dr. Shmerling. Other remedies for mild to moderate strains include these:
        Stretching. Gentle stretching promotes healing by re-establishing the normal length of the muscles.
        Massage. Gently massage the injured muscle for 30 seconds at a time using your hands, a foam roller, or a tennis ball. This promotes the normal breakdown and repair of muscle tissue.
        Hydration. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Water can aid recovery by helping cells flush out waste products.
        If symptoms don't improve after a week or if they become more severe, seek medical attention, as you may have a grade 3 strain or another problem.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/what-should-be-my-cholesterol-goal-with-a-family-history-of-heart-disease,What should be my cholesterol goal with a family history of heart disease?,"Q. 
          I'm a 70-year-old man with a family history of coronary artery disease. I currently take a low-dose statin. My recent LDL number is 105. Should I aim for a lower number?
        
        A. My situation is similar to yours. I have some family members who died young secondary to coronary heart disease, and I run a high total and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. I exercise regularly and try to follow a Mediterranean-style diet.
        About 15 years ago, my doctor recommended starting a statin. Even at a low dose, I experienced more aches and pains than I had previously. I stopped the statin, but in retrospect, I now doubt that the muscle aches were related to the drug.
        Eight years ago, I had a chest CT scan unrelated to any heart issues. My lungs were fine, but the scan showed calcium deposits in my arteries, including the coronary arteries that feed oxygen and nutrients to the heart. That was a game changer. Calcium gets deposited into fatty plaques that accumulate in the arteries. I knew this indicated that my risks of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke were significantly elevated. I immediately began taking the maximum dose of rosuvastatin (Crestor). Interestingly, I had no muscle aches, even with the high dose.
        In general, the lower your LDL cholesterol number, the lower your risk of developing heart disease. My high risk and need for a high-dose statin became apparent after the CT scan. But what about you and the millions of men with a similar family history or a somewhat elevated LDL level?
        Here's the discussion I would have with a man like you, who has a higher-than-ideal LDL level and is asking about increasing his statin dose or might not be on a statin yet.
        If you desire to maximally reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, aim for an LDL level of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). This means lifestyle changes, including a healthier diet and more physical activity. But you might also want to talk with your doctor about starting a low-dose statin or raising the dose if you already take one.
        An alternative is to have a coronary artery CT scan to get your coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. The test calculates the amount of calcium deposited in your coronary arteries. A zero score means a very low risk of trouble, and a high score means you might aim for an LDL level of 55 mg/dL or lower (the European Society of Cardiology recommendation for people at very high risk).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-faster-more-accurate-way-to-diagnose-heart-disease,"A faster, more accurate way to diagnose heart disease?","If you experience a short-lived squeezing sensation or discomfort in your chest when you exercise or feel stress, one possible cause is insufficient blood flow to your heart. Known as stable angina, this condition indicates you may be at risk for a heart attack.
        To diagnose (or rule out) potential heart problems, doctors used to start with a stress test. This test monitors the heart's electrical activity, muscle function, and blood flow patterns while the heart is under stress from exercise or medication. But there's a downside: stress tests only detect when a person has one or more severely narrowed arteries (typically more than 70% blocked) that restrict blood flow, triggering symptoms and abnormal findings during the test.
        ""We now know that most heart attacks occur not from those serious blockages but when smaller, nonobstructive plaques rupture and form a clot that triggers a heart attack,"" says Dr. Ron Blankstein, a senior preventive cardiologist and director of cardiac computed tomography at Brigham and Women's Hospital. An alternative test, called coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), creates a three-dimensional image of the heart and its blood vessels. The image reveals both obstructive and nonobstructive plaque, he explains. Growing evidence suggests that CCTA may improve how cardiologists find and treat heart disease (see ""How high-tech heart scans may clarify heart attack risk"").
        
          
            
              
                How high-tech heart scans may clarify heart attack risk
                Advances in x-ray and computing technology have enabled us to see increasingly detailed images of the body, including the arteries of the heart. In 1999, the first use of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) combined just four cross-sectional images, each called a slice. Modern multi-detector scanners now generate more than 64 slices, and some — known as photon-counting CT scanners — operate at faster speeds and provide better resolution. These higher-quality images can now more accurately predict who might benefit from medications to detect early coronary artery disease and prevent its progression, thereby reducing the odds of a heart attack.
                In 2018, a study called SCOT-HEART compared standard care (which typically included stress testing plus recommended medications) to standard care plus CCTA. While early results showed that people who had CCTA scans were more likely to undergo additional procedures in the first year after their scan, the number of procedures had evened out between the groups five years into the study. However, those in the CCTA group were more likely to be taking preventive drugs and were 41% less likely to die of cardiovascular disease or to have had a heart attack.
                Ten years into the study, 56% of the CCTA group were taking medications (including aspirin and statins) to reduce their risk of a heart attack compared to 49% in the standard test group. What's more, the rate of nonfatal heart attacks was 28% lower in the CCTA group compared with those who had standard tests. The findings were published Jan. 25, 2025, in The Lancet. ""It's the first study to show that the type of test used to evaluate chest pain may have a direct impact on a person's health outcomes,"" says Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Ron Blankstein.
              
            
          
        
        What is CCTA?
        CCTA uses a special CT scanner to take multiple, high-speed x-rays to create three-dimensional views of the blood vessels and other heart structures (see photos). Before the scan, you receive an injection of contrast dye into your arm or hand that ""lights up"" the blood vessels. You may also be given medications to slow your heart rate and widen your blood vessels. During the scan, you lie on a table that moves through a donut-shaped opening in the scanner. While the preparation and setup may take up to an hour, the actual scan lasts just seconds.
        CCTA has a ""Class 1"" indication and an ""A"" level of evidence — the strongest possible recommendation — for use as a first-line tool to evaluate people with chest discomfort or those coming to the emergency room with chest pain, says Dr. Blankstein. Most cases of chest pain seen in emergency rooms end up having nothing to do with the heart, so CCTA can be helpful to rule out a possible heart attack in people who may be at risk for one. However, the test is more commonly used to assess people with stable angina.
        The most common symptom of stable angina is a feeling of pressure, tightness, or squeezing in the center of the chest that typically subsides within a few minutes. Some people feel discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, and some may feel short of breath (what doctors refer to as dyspnea).
        Advice about CCTA
        ""There's tremendous excitement about increasing the use of CCTA. But the benefit depends heavily on the quality of the image, and not all scanners are the same,"" says Dr. Blankstein.
        Certain people aren't good candidates for CCTA. These include people who have a very high heart rate that can't be effectively lowered with medication, or a very high body mass index (40 or higher). Both conditions can hinder image quality. Some people should avoid the test because they have an allergy to the contrast material.
        People with known coronary artery disease may be less likely to benefit from CCTA because the results might not change how they're treated, says Dr. Blankstein. But as the technology advances, repeat scans might one day help physicians see how well specific therapies are working and if adjustments are needed.
        Future refinements?
        Two medical device companies, HeartFlow and Cleerly, use artificial intelligence to analyze CCTA results in greater detail. In theory, quantifying the exact amount of plaque a person has — especially the nonobstructive type — could further refine a person's risk calculation. But we don't yet know whether that information adds any value on top of a visual inspection of the scan, Dr. Blankstein says. Still, the current CCTA technology helps doctors provide a more personalized approach to preventive cardiology. ""In general, the more plaque someone has, the more likely we are to suggest aggressive therapies,"" he says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/a-three-pronged-approach-to-exercise,A three-pronged approach to exercise,"There's no question that getting regular exercise ranks as one of the leading strategies — if not the best one — for preventing heart disease. All forms of physical activity, even in small doses, can make a difference. But if you're looking to optimize your cardiovascular health, a regimen that includes three types of movement may be the way to go, according to a 2024 review article in Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine.
        The foundation of this exercise triad is moderate-intensity aerobic (cardio) exercise like brisk walking, one of the go-to options for meeting the federal activity guidelines (see ""Exercise recommendations and examples""). Moderate activity benefits your heart by burning calories and boosting metabolism, which helps control weight. But you can reap additional benefits by adding vigorous aerobic activity (the type that really gets your heart pumping) along with muscle-strengthening exercises.
        
          
            
              
                Exercise recommendations and examples
                Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity (or an equivalent combination of the two). Do strength training at least two days per week — even 10 to 15 minutes per session can be effective.
                Your age, baseline fitness level, and health conditions all affect what workout is best for you. Ask your doctor for help creating a safe three-part workout to optimize your heart health.

        How aerobic exercise helps
        ""People who run or do similar types of vigorous exercise may have experienced a 'runner's high' either during or after their workout,"" says Dr. Tim Churchill, a cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. That's because your body releases feel-good chemicals known as endorphins and endocannabinoids in response to intense exercise.
        Any kind of aerobic exercise, whether moderate or vigorous, also helps dampen the body's ""fight or flight"" response, which plays a role in chronic stress and anxiety. Aerobic exercise also spurs the release of adrenalin and related hormones that stimulate receptors in the heart to beat more frequently and forcefully. Over time, the heart becomes more efficient, requiring less effort to send blood through the body. And as more blood circulates through the body, blood vessels expand slightly and become more flexible.
        Why muscle-building matters
        Including muscle-building exercises in your weekly routine has a synergistic effect with aerobic exercise that can further enhance your heart health. Strength training can make your body more efficient at burning fat for energy. It also helps improve how your body responds to insulin, the hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels, Dr. Churchill says. That can help prevent or improve diabetes, a potent risk factor for heart disease. Strength training also promotes the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and widens blood vessels. ""Your arteries are then better able to relax, which helps to maintain normal blood pressure,"" says Dr. Churchill.
        As the review article notes, combining strength with moderate-intensity and some vigorous aerobic exercise leads to greater reductions in resting heart rate, blood pressure, body weight, and body fat percentage than doing single forms of exercise. ""Exercise clearly improves a lot of specific markers related to cardiovascular disease. But when you add up all those individual effects, it still only accounts for about 50% of the overall health benefit related to doing regular physical activity,"" says Dr. Churchill. The elusive remaining 50% is why the decades-long quest to create ""exercise in a pill"" will probably never materialize, he adds.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/not-just-another-headache,Not just another headache,"Mia delivered a baby and went home feeling fine. Within a week, however, she developed a persistent headache. She brushed it off for two or three days, reasoning that she was sleep deprived. But her head hurt even worse when she had to cough or bear down, and then her vision went wonky, seeming blurry.
        Fortunately, Mia made a prompt doctor's appointment. The culprit? A clot in one of the veins of her brain, which increased pressure in her skull and triggered her headache.
        Mia's situation is unusual, since only a tiny fraction of headaches indicates something is seriously amiss, Harvard experts say. Far more common are the harmless headaches that happen to people every day. About 4% of American adults report ""being bothered a lot"" by headaches in the past three months — with women three times as likely to report the problem as men, according to the CDC.
        Some people power through headaches, even severe ones, because they're convinced they shouldn't complain about such a common issue. But certain sensations tend to tip people off when they're not having a run-of-the-mill headache.
        ""In general, people know their headaches really well,"" says Dr. Paul Rizzoli, division chief of the Graham Headache Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital. ""With that in mind, any changes to your typical pattern of headaches could be worth paying attention to.""
        Red flags
        If headaches are happening more frequently or getting progressively more painful, it's time to see a doctor. The following signs also increase the risk that a headache stems from a worrisome underlying cause.
        You also have other symptoms. Watch for fatigue, fever, night sweats, or double vision. ""These types of symptoms can happen if you have an infection or increased pressure in the brain,"" says Dr. Linda Wendell, chief of neurology at Harvard-affiliated Mount Auburn Hospital.
        You're over 50 and your headaches have changed. Maybe you never had them before, and now you get them regularly. Or they're happening in a different area of your head. ""As we get older, there's a higher probability that new headaches are associated with other problems,"" Dr. Wendell says.
        Your headaches get worse when you lie down, after exercise or sex, or when you cough. These activities temporarily alter the pressure inside your brain, leading to pain. While this might be due to various causes, doctors will need to rule out a tumor or other reasons for increased pressure inside the skull, Dr. Wendell says.
        Your pain doesn't respond to simple remedies. Most headaches recede if you take a nonprescription pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), or naproxen (Aleve), or if you drink some water and lie down for a nap. ""In general, you should get some relief from over-the-counter pain medication; if not, contact your doctor for advice,"" Dr. Wendell says.
        Emergency signs
        Some distinct symptoms can't wait for a doctor's appointment. If any of these occurs, call 911 or head to an emergency department immediately:
        A ""thunderclap"" headache. So named because the pain arrives suddenly and violently, ascending in seconds, this can sometimes occur with bleeding in the brain or a variety of other serious causes. ""A thunderclap headache is sometimes referred to as the worst of your life,"" Dr. Wendell says.
        Headache with fever and a stiff neck. This combination often signals meningitis, a potentially life-threatening inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. ""This isn't the same as coming home from work with tight muscles on one side of the neck and a tension headache,"" Dr. Rizzoli says. ""It's dramatic. You'll feel terrible.""
        Headache with neurological symptoms. Vision changes, difficulty speaking, or numbness and weakness may suggest a stroke, as does confusion, sleepiness, or other signs of altered mental status. ""Regardless of whether or not you have a headache, any new neurological symptoms — especially when they affect one side of the body — constitute an emergency,"" Dr. Wendell says.
        Sudden headache with vomiting. While this duo often occurs during a migraine, in some cases it can also indicate a much more serious condition, such as a ruptured aneurysm or other reason for bleeding in the brain.
        Headache after a blow to the head, such as from a fall, auto accident, or sports injury. ""Most people know to get evaluated if they hit their head and then get a headache,"" Dr. Wendell says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/treating-high-blood-pressure-may-help-lower-risk-of-cognitive-decline,Treating high blood pressure may help lower risk of cognitive decline,"People with high blood pressure can greatly reduce their risk for cardiovascular disease by aggressively driving down their blood pressure numbers. A study published Feb. 11, 2025, in Neurology suggests the effort may have another benefit: reducing the risk of cognitive decline. Researchers used data from the SPRINT study, which compared intensive treatment to standard treatment of systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) among people with high blood pressure.
        SPRINT's researchers focused on 9,361 patients over age 50, who were randomly assigned to a systolic blood pressure goal of either less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) — intensive treatment — or less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment). After seven years, those who had undergone intensive treatment had an 11% lower risk for mild cognitive impairment compared with people who had received standard treatment. The findings suggest that keeping blood pressure closer to 120 mm Hg may be more beneficial for brain health.

        Researchers surveyed nearly 1,300 people twice over a 10-year span, inquiring about their job schedules and physical activity levels while at work. They also asked about participants' sleep habits, identifying three sleep health categories: good sleepers, catch-up sleepers, and insomnia-like sleepers. Compared with active work, sedentary work was 37% likelier to lead to a variety of insomnia symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep, interrupted sleep, and frequent daytime tiredness. The findings also indicated that workers who fall into a pattern of poor sleep due to their job design can end up stuck in such unhealthy patterns for many years. Insomnia-like sleepers, for example, reported their symptoms persisted 10 years later, at the end of the study.
        People with sedentary jobs who move their bodies during the workday can help protect themselves against developing longstanding sleep problems, study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/will-diverticulitis-heal-on-its-own,Will diverticulitis heal on its own?,"Your doctor spotted diverticula in a previous colonoscopy, but you never thought the little pouches in your large intestine (colon) would turn into little devils. Now pain in your gut is telling you something is wrong. Do you have diverticulitis, and will it get better without medical care?
        How it happens
        Diverticula develop when weak spots in the colon lining bulge outward, creating little pouches or potholes. They more often form in the sigmoid colon, which runs down the left side of the pelvis and then joins the rectum.
        ""Most people never have a problem with them. They're extremely common: they are present in about 70% of us by age 80,"" says Dr. Alexander Goldowsky, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        But sometimes diverticula bleed, or they become inflamed or infected, a condition called diverticulitis.
        Recognizing diverticulitis
        Diverticulitis tends to cause pain in the lower left part of your abdomen. ""It's not typical tummy trouble. It's a different kind of pain that can be significant and severe,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        Although diverticula rarely cause symptoms, diverticulitis can cause bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool. If a diverticulum is infected, you might have a fever, chills, or vomiting in addition to pain.
        ""If it's the first time you've had this kind of pain, reach out to your doctor right away,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""If you have a history of diverticulitis and you develop mild symptoms, let your doctor know. He or she may just recommend temporary dietary changes and taking it easy. But if things aren't improving, call your doctor again.""
        Don't put off calling; an infected diverticulum can form an abscess (pus-filled pocket) that can extend to other tissue in the body and become life-threatening. In rare cases, that new colon pain may indicate cancer.
        Diagnosis
        After you've alerted your doctor about gut pain, you'll need to go in for a physical exam. This exam can involve checking your abdomen for tenderness and the rectum for signs of blood. You  might need blood and stool tests.
        But the main way to diagnose diverticulitis is with a CT scan, typically after a special type of contrast dye is injected into your vein. ""If we see inflammation surrounding one or more diverticula, we can determine that you have diverticulitis,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        Treatment
        Can diverticulitis heal on its own? ""Yes, it can, and for that reason, we don't always prescribe antibiotics. We reserve them for diverticulitis in people with an abscess, a significant amount of inflammation, symptoms that aren't improving, a suppressed immune system, frailty, or other health problems — such as liver or kidney disease,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        Care at home, with or without an antibiotic, includes rest, a clear liquid diet (see ""A liquid diet for diverticulitis""), and acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain. You might want to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), which can add to gastrointestinal discomfort.
        For severe diverticulitis, you might need to be hospitalized for a few days, getting antibiotics directly into a vein. If you have an abscess, you might need surgery to clean out the infection.
        
          
            
              
                A liquid diet for diverticulitis
                When you have diverticulitis, you might need a clear liquid diet, to give your colon a break from digesting solid foods.
                A liquid diet can include clear drinks and foods, such as water, broth or bouillon, black coffee, plain tea, clear juice (apple, white grape), clear soft drinks or sports drinks, Jell-O, or popsicles.
                There's no need to stay on a liquid diet for more than 48 hours unless recommended by your doctor.
              
            
          
        
        Getting better
        Healing from diverticulitis requires commitment. If you're taking an oral antibiotic, make sure you stick to the medication schedule. If you're on a liquid diet, avoid cheating.
        Once symptoms begin improving, you can move to a low-fiber diet. It includes animal protein (eggs, cheese, fish, poultry); certain cooked vegetables (carrots, green beans, potatoes, pumpkin, yams, or squash); low-fiber fruits (bananas, peaches, pears); and (if your doctor says it's okay) low-fiber breads such as white, sourdough, or refined wheat breads. Stay away from spicy, fatty foods and alcohol.
        If you feel up to it, it's okay to exercise, but go easy on yourself. ""Avoid abdominal exercise. Go for a walk or do some arm exercises with small dumbbells,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""If you feel uncomfortable, take a break."" And buckle in: it could be 10 days before your symptoms go away completely.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/new-insights-about-the-risks-from-a-hole-in-the-heart,"New insights about the risks from a ""hole"" in the heart","About one in four people has a flaplike opening between the two upper chambers of the heart (see illustration). Known as a patent foramen ovale (PFO), this common anatomical variation only rarely causes any symptoms. Most people with a PFO never know they have it, and the condition is usually harmless.
        However, PFOs can raise the risk of stroke, especially in people who are prone to blood clots or who experience pressure changes inside their hearts for various reasons. The larger the PFO, the higher the risk of stroke. And growing evidence suggests that people with large PFOs also face a higher risk of vascular dementia, says neurologist Dr. MingMing Ning, director of the Cardio-Neurology Division at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""We're excited to now explore possible new interventions to lower this risk,"" she says.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
                In the womb, all fetuses have a small opening called a foramen ovale in the wall between the left and right upper chambers of the heart (the atria). This opening allows blood to take a shortcut within the heart rather than following a longer path through the lungs, which cannot work until they are exposed to air. With a newborn's first breath, the foramen ovale starts to close. It usually seals completely within a few months. But in about one in four people, that doesn't happen, which results in a variation called a patent foramen ovale (patent means open).
              
            
          
        
        The PFO-stroke connection
        Having a PFO, especially a larger one, is linked to a higher risk of ischemic strokes (those caused by a clot blocking a blood vessel). What's the connection? Normally, the network of blood vessels in the lungs traps and destroys small clots and other harmful substances moving through the bloodstream. But in people with a PFO, venous blood can leak across the heart from the right atrium to the left atrium. If that blood contains a clot, it can travel directly to the arteries that send blood throughout the body. A stroke can occur if that clot lodges in an artery supplying the brain.
        In addition, by allowing unfiltered harmful substances into the circulation, a PFO may make clots more likely to form, which also contributes to the higher risk of stroke, says Dr. Ning. Other factors that increase clots can further compound a person's risk. These include obesity, sleep apnea, and pregnancy, as well as uncommon genetic conditions such as protein C/S deficiency and factor V Leiden. Being immobile for long stretches of time, including during long-distance travel, can also raise the risk of clots.
        Under pressure
        Situations that cause pressure shifts in the chest can speed up blood flow through a PFO, causing a clot to shoot through the opening, says Dr. Ning. Bearing down while holding your breath — for example, when you're pushing through a bowel movement, lifting a very heavy weight, or giving birth — can augment this phenomenon.
        PFO-related strokes increased during the COVID pandemic, probably related to two reasons: First, COVID triggers an inflammatory response that activates the body's clotting system. Second, people with serious lung damage from the infection often had a tube inserted into their windpipe to help them breathe. ""The pressure changes during intubation can 'pop open' the PFO, potentially pushing a clot into the circulation,"" says Dr. Ning.
        The dementia dimension
        The blood circulating in someone with a large PFO contains higher levels of potentially harmful substances. Over time, an accumulation of these substances may contribute to vascular dementia. Dr. Ning and colleagues are exploring the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, with an eye toward possible ways to prevent it.
        Finding and treating PFOs
        When doctors suspect someone has a PFO — usually following an unexplained stroke — they may recommend a specialized heart ultrasound and a bubble study, which involves injecting a solution with air bubbles into a vein. If the bubbles travel to the left side of the heart, that suggests the person has a PFO. While most people don't need treatment, those with a history or high risk of strokes or blood clots may need clot-preventing drugs, such as aspirin or blood thinners, or a special procedure to close the opening.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/appendix-pain-could-it-be-appendicitis,Appendix pain: Could it be appendicitis?,"We all experience abdominal pain in our lives. But what type of abdominal pain signals appendix pain or appendicitis? Since appendicitis requires urgent medical attention, knowing the symptoms and when to seek help can be lifesaving.
        What is appendicitis?
        Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch attached to the large intestine. While the role of the appendix is unclear, inflammation of the appendix can lead to swelling, pain, and, if left untreated, rupture. Because of these risks, appendicitis is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention.
        According to Dr. Robert H. Shmerling, senior faculty editor at Harvard Medical School's Harvard Health Publishing, ""If it's appendicitis, the pain is unlikely to go away on its own. No one with symptoms strongly suggestive of appendicitis should try to tough it out at home.""
        Symptoms of appendicitis
        Typically, appendicitis starts with abdominal pain near the belly button. Within a few hours, the pain shifts to the lower right side of the abdomen, where the appendix is usually located.
        This pain intensifies over time. It tends to worsen when you press on it (and is often even worse if you quickly stop pressing), when walking, taking deep breaths, coughing, or sneezing. Although many people refer to it as ""appendix pain,"" the discomfort is more accurately described as ""abdominal pain"" because conditions other than appendicitis can cause similar symptoms.
        Additional symptoms of appendicitis may develop in some people. These include:
        
          loss of appetite
          nausea and vomiting
          fever
          abdominal swelling
          inability to pass gas
          diarrhea or constipation.
        
        Symptoms can vary among individuals. While appendicitis typically causes pain in the right side of the abdomen, in some people, the appendix is not in the usual location, affecting how their symptoms present.
        What other conditions could mimic symptoms of appendicitis?
        Appendicitis could be mistaken for other conditions that can cause similar discomfort, particularly in the lower right side of the abdomen. Some conditions that might be confused with appendicitis include:
        
          severe irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
          gastroenteritis
          
            constipation
          
          bladder, urine, or pelvic infections
          ovarian cyst rupture
          ectopic pregnancy.
        
        Potential causes of appendicitis
        In many cases, the cause of appendicitis is not apparent. Possible causes of appendicitis include:
        
          Blockage. The appendix may be obstructed by hardened stool, a foreign object, or a tumor.
          Infection. Bacteria, or occasionally other infectious agents, may cause inflammation and swelling of the appendix wall.
          Inflammatory bowel condition.Crohn's disease or other forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may lead to inflammation of the appendix.
        
        When to see a doctor for appendix pain
        Appendicitis is a medical emergency. ""Most abdominal pain is not due to appendicitis,"" says Dr. Shmerling. ""But if a person experiences the typical symptoms — especially persistent, worsening pain that moves over to the right lower abdomen — they should seek immediate medical attention and have a prompt in-person evaluation.""
        Delaying treatment can lead to complications such as rupture of the appendix, inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis), abscess, sepsis, and even death.
        To diagnose appendicitis, your doctor will review your medical history, ask you questions about your bowel movements, and assess your current symptoms. Your doctor will also perform a physical exam, checking for pain in the lower right abdominal area.
        Certain tests can help your doctor make an accurate diagnosis of appendicitis. These tests may include:
        
          a blood test to look for signs of infection
          a urine test to check for urinary tract infection or kidney stones.
        
        If your symptoms, physical exam, and initial tests point to appendicitis, imaging tests such as CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI can help your doctor confirm the diagnosis.
        Treatment for appendicitis
        The standard treatment for appendicitis is surgical removal of the appendix, known as an appendectomy. Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency worldwide.
        In some cases, particularly mild ones, antibiotics may be used as an initial treatment and the infection may respond well to antibiotics alone, making surgery unnecessary. ""It used to be the case that if appendicitis was the question, emergency surgery was the answer,"" explains Dr. Shmerling. ""But research has demonstrated that some people with appendicitis can forego surgery and do well with just antibiotics and supportive care such as intravenous fluids and pain medicines.""
        Because of the availability of imaging to confirm the diagnosis before surgery and the recognition that nonsurgical treatment can be safe and effective once the diagnosis is established, fewer people have unnecessary surgery for suspected appendicitis.
        Ongoing research is exploring which patients can safely avoid surgery based on factors like symptom severity, CT scan results, overall health, and age. Despite these advancements, surgery remains the primary treatment for most cases.
        Surgery to remove the appendix is often done laparoscopically. This type of surgery, which is performed using small surgical incisions and a camera, can lead to a quicker recovery.
        Appendicitis is a serious condition that should never be ignored. If you experience persistent or worsening abdominal pain, seek immediate medical attention. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications and maximize chances of a smooth recovery.",Jenette Restivo,"April 17, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-stress-busters-to-help-your-heart,5 stress busters to help your heart,"Easing stress is one key to a healthier heart
        Stress that persists day in and day out — whether from a traffic-choked daily commute, unhappy relationship, or heavy workload — has been linked to a wide range of health issues. Many people know first-hand that chronic stress can negatively affect mood, sleep, and appetite. But you may not know that chronic stress can harm your heart –– or understand what you can do to counter its effects. 
        How does long-term stress harm the heart?
        Chronic stress leads to persistent low-grade inflammation in the body, which increases the risk of heart disease. Mood, sleep, and appetite changes brought on by the constant hum of stress can do so, too.    
        And stress may influence your risk of heart attack and other heart conditions in more subtle ways. For example, when under stress, some of us eat unhealthy food or lack the energy or time to exercise. Stress can also trigger heart-damaging behaviors such as smoking and drinking too much alcohol.
        5 great ways to destress
        Breaking the connection between chronic stress and heart disease requires finding tools that can help you cope with stress and aim for healthier habits. These five simple tips can help you do just that.
        
          Tap into laughter. Laughter has been found to lower levels of stress hormones and reduce inflammation in the arteries. Silly shows, corny jokes, and funny animal videos all count!
          Meditate. Finding time for a simple combination of inward-focused thought and deep breathing reduces heart disease risk factors such as high blood pressure. Meditative practices like yoga, tai chi, mindfulness, and prayer can also relax the mind and body.
          Try activity. Every time you are physically active, whether you take a walk or play tennis, your brain releases mood-boosting chemicals called endorphins. Short bursts of exercise can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. And exercising regularly not only helps you ease stress, it also protects against heart disease by lowering your blood pressure, strengthening your heart muscle, and helping you maintain a healthy weight.
          Unplug. It's impossible to escape stress when it follows you everywhere. Cut the cord. Avoid emails and TV news. Take time each day — even if it's for just 10 or 15 minutes — to escape from the world.
          Find ways to destress. Simple things, like a relaxing bath, listening to music, spending time in nature or on a favorite hobby, can give you a much-needed break from the stressors in your life.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-saw-palmetto-treat-an-enlarged-prostate-202504163094,Can saw palmetto treat an enlarged prostate?,"Marketed as a natural remedy for an enlarged prostate, saw palmetto is a top-selling dietary supplement. It's extracted from berries that grow on saw palmetto palm trees, which are native to the southeastern United States.
        By one estimate, more than a third of all US adults who take supplements use saw palmetto specifically. Some evidence suggests that saw palmetto has anti-inflammatory properties, and its use as folk medicine dates back over a century.
        But experts at Harvard say men should view its supposed benefits for prostate health skeptically. ""Saw palmetto is unlikely to harm you, but it probably won't provide any major benefits either,"" says Dr. Heidi Rayala, an assistant professor of urology at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        BPH and the potential effect of saw palmetto
        It's common for men to develop an enlarged prostate, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), when they get older. BPH impedes urinary flow through the urethra, causing obstructive symptoms that can worsen with time.
        Just how saw palmetto might act on the prostate to improve symptoms isn't entirely clear, however. Some evidence suggest it mimics the effects of certain drugs used for treating BPH, including 5-alpha reductase inhibitors such as finasteride (Proscar), which shrink the prostate gland.
        In the US, no herbal supplement is approved as BPH treatment. The American Urological Association cautions that studies backing saw palmetto for treating enlarged prostates have numerous flaws, including short durations and a lack of placebo controls. Most of the supporting evidence comes from small studies paid for by companies that sell dietary supplements.
        What do randomized clinical trials show?
        The best-conducted research shows no benefits from saw palmetto for BPH. During one study, 225 men with moderate to severe BPH were treated with either a placebo or 160 milligrams (mg) of saw palmetto, taken twice daily for a year. The investigators detected no difference in outcomes, but they also acknowledged that doses tested in the study may have been too low to produce measurable effects.
        So, during a larger subsequent study, researchers tested higher doses of saw palmetto ranging up to 320 mg given three times a day. Nearly 370 men ages 45 and older were randomized to treatment or placebo groups. After year and a half, men in both groups reported feeling either no worse or a little better. Remarkably, 40% of the placebo-treated men said symptoms had improved, suggesting the simple act of taking a pill could have something to do with the supplement's perceived benefits.
        Dr. Michael Barry, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, led the study. He urges men to consult with their doctors before trying saw palmetto, mainly to rule out other potential causes of urinary obstruction, which can include bladder or prostate cancer. And saw palmetto may interfere with the blood's clotting ability, making it risky for men who take blood thinners.
        Recent results and comments
        The latest evidence on saw palmetto and BPH comes from a Cochrane Review of 27 placebo-controlled studies enrolling a combined 4,656 participants. Results published in 2024 showed no improvement in urinary symptoms or quality of life from taking saw palmetto (alone or with other herbal supplements) over durations ranging up to 17 months.
        ""If the ingredients in these herbal products worked well for urinary symptoms, drug companies would have already had them approved by the FDA as a medicine that insurance companies would have to cover,"" Dr. Rayala said. ""It's okay to take them, but just be cautious about spending too much of your own money on these alternatives.""
        ""It is easy to understand why so many find taking a naturally occurring supplement for treating urinary difficulties in middle age appealing,"" said Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases. ""However, evidence of effectiveness with saw palmetto is lacking, and its use for BPH and other common urinary symptoms without a full evaluation of the potential cause should be discouraged.""",Charlie Schmidt,"April 16, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/tips-to-leverage-neuroplasticity-to-maintain-cognitive-fitness-as-you-age,Tips to leverage neuroplasticity to maintain cognitive fitness as you age,"As we age, maintaining cognitive fitness becomes increasingly important. The brain's ability to adapt and rewire itself — known as neuroplasticity — plays a crucial role in keeping our minds sharp.
        While aging can bring natural changes to the brain, engaging in specific activities and lifestyle choices can help preserve and even enhance cognitive function. Understanding neuroplasticity and incorporating brain-boosting habits into daily life can support mental agility and overall brain health.
        What is neuroplasticity and what's the connection to cognitive fitness?
        Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt throughout life by modifying its structure, functions, or neural pathways.
        Dr. Andrew E. Budson, Chief of Cognitive & Behavioral Neurology at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System and chair of the Science of Learning Innovation Group at Harvard Medical School, explains, ""Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to learn, remember, and change when it is appropriate for the circumstances."" This adaptability allows the brain to reorganize itself in response to learning, experiences, and environmental influences.
        Cognitive fitness — the ability to think, learn, and remember effectively — depends on a healthy and adaptable brain. By actively engaging in behaviors that support neuroplasticity, you can strengthen cognitive function and potentially reduce the risk of age-related decline.
        Keys to cognitive fitness
        Maintaining cognitive fitness involves a combination of mental, physical, and social activities. Each of these factors plays a role in supporting neuroplasticity and promoting lifelong brain health.
        A healthy body supports a healthy brain. This means it is important to manage your health conditions.
        Lifestyle choices are also crucial. Maintaining cognitive fitness as you age is best achieved by combining these key approaches:
        
          Eat a brain-healthy diet.
          Engage in regular physical activity.
          Prioritize quality sleep.
          Challenge your brain.
          Nurture social connections.
          Manage stress.
        
        How physical activity supports cognitive health
        Exercise is not just beneficial for the body — it also has a powerful impact on the brain. Neuroplasticity is closely linked to the production of neurotrophins, a group of proteins that play a vital role in brain cell growth and function. Among the key neurotrophins involved in neuroplasticity is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Research suggests that lower levels of BDNF may contribute to cognitive decline, affecting memory, concentration, and learning ability.
        Dr. Budson highlights that aerobic exercise plays a critical role in promoting neuroplasticity, as it triggers the release of brain growth factors. He states, ""From the perspective of the body, we know that brain growth factors are released when we engage in aerobic exercise, so that is critically important.""
        The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. Greater cognitive health benefits are seen at higher levels.
        Physical activity — both aerobic exercise and strength training — also increases blood flow to the brain and reduces stress and inflammation. Together, these changes improve mood, memory, focus, and processing speed, helping to preserve cognitive function and potentially reduce the risk of dementia, particularly in older adults.
        Nutrition and brain health
        A nutritious diet plays a significant role in maintaining cognitive function. Although the brain makes up only 2% of body weight, it utilizes 20% of the body's energy.
        The Mediterranean diet has been associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline. This diet  emphasizes fruits, green leafy vegetables, whole grains, fish, legumes, nuts, and healthy fats like extra virgin olive oil.
        Another diet — the MIND diet —  incorporates elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets. According to a study published in the journal Neurology, it may slow cognitive decline compared to other eating patterns. The MIND diet emphasizes plant-based foods and limits consumption of animal products and saturated fats. It highlights green leafy vegetables, nuts, berries, poultry, and fish.
        On the flip side, high-fat, high-refined-sugar diets have been linked to decreased BDNF and neuroplasticity. Avoiding excessive sugar and processed foods can also help maintain mental clarity and prevent inflammation that may contribute to poor brain health.
        Challenge your brain to boost neuroplasticity
        Just as physical exercise strengthens muscles, mental challenges help keep the brain sharp. Research shows that engaging in diverse, stimulating activities supports brain health by promoting neuroplasticity.
        Lifelong learning plays a key role in cognitive fitness by strengthening neural connections and enhancing cognitive reserve — the brain's ability to maintain function despite aging or disease. This reserve builds over time through education, career experiences, and mentally engaging activities, acting as a defense against cognitive decline.
        Dr. Budson suggests engaging in learning-based activities such as taking an adult education course, picking up a new hobby, or even reading books that introduce new concepts. ""Meeting new people and learning about them is a great way to enhance neuroplasticity, as is traveling to a new place,"" he adds.
        By regularly challenging your mind, you can strengthen neural pathways and support long-term brain health. Here are some additional ways to keep your brain active:
        
          Try something new. Learning a new language, instrument, or skill (like painting or cooking) forms fresh neural connections.
          Challenge yourself. Increase the difficulty of puzzles, games, or reading material to continuously build cognitive reserve.
          Mix up mental workouts. Avoid routine by incorporating different activities like strategy games, creative hobbies, and problem-solving exercises.
          Engage in cultural and social activities. Attending concerts, museums, or plays stimulates the brain and encourages deeper learning.
          Travel and explore. Visiting new places, even locally, enhances brain plasticity by exposing you to novel experiences.
          Enjoy music and movement. Playing an instrument, dancing, or even listening to music supports cognitive and emotional well-being.
        
        Prioritize sleep for brain health
        Quality sleep is essential for cognitive function and memory consolidation. During sleep, the brain processes and stores information, clears out toxins, and repairs neural pathways.
        Dr. Budson explains, ""There is now a tremendous body of evidence that memories are consolidated during sleep. Memory consolidation is the process of short-term memories turning into long-term memories."" He highlights that sleep not only strengthens important memories, but also helps regulate emotions and integrate new knowledge with prior experiences, making it crucial for neuroplasticity.
        Despite common belief, your sleep needs don't decrease as you age. Adults in their 70s and beyond still require seven to nine hours per night. However, changes in sleep patterns can make it more challenging. As you get older, you may fall asleep and wake up earlier, struggle to drift off, or experience more frequent awakenings during the night. It's fine to take a short nap during the day, which counts toward your total sleep.
        Try these sleep-improving strategies:
        
          Stick to a schedule. Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, even on weekends.
          Get morning sunlight. Exposure to natural light early in the day helps regulate sleep cycles.
          Exercise regularly. Physical activity improves sleep quality, but avoid intense workouts close to bedtime.
          Watch your diet. Eat a light dinner and avoid caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, and nicotine before bed.
          Limit screen time. Turn off electronics at least an hour before bed to reduce blue light exposure.
          Create a sleep-friendly environment. Keep your bedroom cool, dark, quiet, and comfortable.
          Establish a bedtime routine. Engage in calming activities like reading, stretching, meditation, or deep breathing.
        
        Chronic sleep deprivation can impair concentration, decision-making, and long-term brain health. If you regularly struggle to fall or stay asleep, talk to your doctor to identify the cause and explore the best treatment options.
        Reduce stress for a brain boost
        Chronic stress can take a toll on brain function by increasing levels of cortisol, a hormone that can damage neurons and inhibit neuroplasticity. However, practicing effective stress management techniques can help protect cognitive health and support long-term brain function.
        One particularly effective approach is mindfulness meditation. Research suggests that regular meditation promotes structural and functional changes in brain regions responsible for attention, emotional regulation, and memory. While research is ongoing, meditation is believed to support neuroplasticity by fostering the growth of new brain cells and connections, potentially mitigating the harmful effects of stress.
        In addition to meditation, other stress-reducing strategies include deep breathing exercises, listening to music, and spending time in nature. By incorporating these techniques into daily life, you can help reduce stress while supporting overall brain health and cognitive function.
        Social engagement and mental sharpness
        Staying socially connected is essential for preserving memory and cognitive function as you age. Research shows that those with active social lives are less likely to experience cognitive decline compared to individuals who are more isolated.
        Engaging in conversations and interactive activities stimulates key mental processes like attention and memory. Regular social interaction helps reinforce neural connections, slowing age-related decline and potentially delaying dementia by strengthening cognitive reserve.
        To support brain health, consider these engaging ways to stay socially active:
        
          traveling to new places
          attending cultural events such as theater, concerts, or art exhibitions
          joining social or retirement groups
          spending quality time with family and friends.
        
        By making social engagement a priority, you can help protect cognitive function while enjoying meaningful connections and experiences.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","April 2, 2025"

The effect was thought to be short-lived, but a study published online Dec. 10, 2024, by the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity suggests it may last a full day.
        Scientists gathered data from 76 men and women, ages 50 to 83, who wore activity trackers for eight days and took cognitive tests each day. On average, people did about an hour of moderate-to-vigorous exercise, five hours of light activity, and nine hours of sedentary time each day. Moderate-to-vigorous exercise included activities that raised the heart rate, such as brisk walking, dancing, or walking up and down stairs.
        When comparing activity levels with memory test results, the researchers found that any amount of moder-ate-to-vigorous physical activity was associated with higher scores on memory tests on the following day regardless of time spent in sedentary behavior or light activity. In particular, participants showed better working memory and episodic memory (memory of events).
        Exercise increases blood flow to the brain and stimulates the release of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and dopamine, which help a range of cognitive functions, according to the researchers. These neurochemical changes have been understood to last up to a few hours after exercise, but the new findings suggest they may last longer.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/understanding-the-different-types-of-brain-attack,"Understanding the different types of ""brain attack""","A network of large and small blood vessels deliver oxygen and nutrients throughout your brain. If something disrupts that blood supply, brain cells begin to die. The resulting injury — known as a stroke — may be so small that it goes unnoticed. Other times, the damage is so extensive, the consequences include devastating physical and mental challenges.
        Recognizing the warning signs of a stroke and taking action can be lifesaving (learn how from the American Stroke Association). But being aware of the different types and causes of strokes may help you fine-tune your efforts to prevent them in the first place.
        You may have heard a stroke referred to as a brain attack. ""It's not a bad term to use, because the word 'attack' conveys the urgency and importance of timely action,"" says Dr. Alexis Roy, acute stroke director at Harvard­affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. When talking to her patients, though, she prefers to describe strokes according to their underlying causes, which fall into two main categories: ischemic and hemorrhagic.
        Ischemic strokes — which result from a blockage inside one of the brain's arteries — are by far the most common, accounting for 87% of all strokes. Three common subtypes of ischemic stroke are described below. Hemorrhagic strokes, also known as bleeding strokes, usually result from a ruptured blood vessel (see ""What is a hemorrhagic stroke?"").
        
          
            
              
                What is a hemorrhagic stroke?
                
                  
                
                
                  Ischemic strokes result from a blockage inside a brain artery, while hemorrhagic strokes occur when a blood
			vessel ruptures.
                
                About 13% of all strokes are hemorrhagic strokes, which occur when a weakened blood vessel leaks or ruptures and bleeds into the surrounding brain. Sometimes referred to as bleeding strokes, they include two main types based on their location: intracerebral hemorrhages (which occur deep within the brain) and subarachnoid hemorrhages (which occur between the brain and the skull).
                In addition to advanced age, factors that raise the risk of hemorrhagic strokes include poorly controlled high blood pressure, smoking, heavy alcohol use, head injury, and the use of illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin. People who need to take an anticlotting drug also have an increased risk.

        Large-artery atherothrombotic stroke
        These strokes occur when a blood clot forms in one of the large arteries supplying blood to the brain, usually due to a buildup of fatty plaque (atherosclerosis). Most commonly, the plaque ruptures and a clot forms on the surface. The clot then breaks loose, travels to a narrower part of an artery, and gets stuck, cutting off the blood supply. ""The carotid arteries, which run up both sides of the neck, are a common location for the plaque buildup that leads to these strokes,"" says Dr. Roy. The large arteries that branch out from the base of the skull are another frequent site.
        The atherosclerosis responsible for these strokes can also accumulate in the heart's arteries, raising the risk of heart attacks. That's why same healthy lifestyle habits endorsed by the American Heart Association can reduce your risk of both serious conditions. For anyone who's already had a heart attack, taking a daily low-dose aspirin (if your doctor recommends that) may help prevent both strokes and subsequent heart attacks.
        Cardioembolic stroke
        These strokes occur when a clot that has formed in the heart travels through the bloodstream until it lodges in an artery to the brain. One prime cause of embolic stroke is atrial fibrillation (afib), which affects about one in 15 people ages 65 and older. During afib, the heart's upper chambers (atria) quiver rapidly instead of contracting forcefully, leading some blood to linger in a chamber instead of flowing smoothly through the heart. Blood most commonly pools within a tiny, pouchlike extension called the left atrial appendage, eventually forming clots that may break free and move out of the heart up to the brain.
        Strokes caused by afib are among the most serious because the clots that form inside the heart tend to be large and to lodge in larger brain arteries. That translates to a bigger area of brain cell damage, Dr. Roy explains. It's why most people with afib need a clot-prevention drug, such as apixaban (Eliquis) or rivaroxaban (Xarelto).
        Small-vessel strokes
        Although larger strokes tend to correlate with worse outcomes, the location also matters. ""Some small-vessel strokes cause very little damage — only about a half-inch in diameter. But if it affects an area critical for movement, a person might lose function on one side of their body, leaving them unable to walk,"" says Dr. Roy. This unpredictability is one reason many people find strokes so confusing, she adds.
        In fact, you can also have a ""silent"" ischemic stroke. It causes no noticeable symptoms because the damaged area is small and occurs in a part of the brain that doesn't control any vital functions. However, these small-vessel strokes sometimes cause temporary balance problems or clumsiness in an arm or leg that people may attribute to another cause. And if people accumulate a number of silent strokes, the damage can manifest as memory lapses and other cognitive problems. Over time, these problems may evolve into vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease.",Julie Corliss,"April 1, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-cancerheart-disease-connection,The cancer–heart disease connection,"Thanks to advances in cancer detection and therapy, people with cancer are living far longer than in years past. Nearly 20 million people in the United States — about 6% of the population — are cancer survivors. ""Despite what you might assume, these people are actually more likely to die of heart disease than from cancer-related complications,"" says Dr. Anju Nohria, director of the cardio-oncology program at Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center.
        One reason is that certain cancer treatments can cause cardiovascular complications (see ""How cancer therapies may harm the heart""). But the two diseases share many root causes. For example, tobacco use is widely known to raise the risk of both heart disease and cancer. And some experts believe obesity (a known contributor to heart problems) may soon surpass cigarette smoking as the No. 1 preventable cause of cancer. Other health issues linked to heart disease — diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure — are also associated with cancer, as described in a review titled ""Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer: A Dangerous Liaison"" in the March 2025 issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology.
        The common threads
        In people with diabetes, high blood sugar damages blood vessels and nerves that control your heart, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular problems. The resulting inflammation can also create an environment that favors tumor growth, and elevated blood sugar levels may help fuel the growth of malignant cells, Dr. Nohria explains. Likewise, excess blood cholesterol — a key component of artery-clogging plaque — may also hasten growth of cancer cells.
        High blood pressure's role in heart disease is clear: the relentless pounding of the blood against the artery walls also promotes plaque formation, and the resulting narrowing of the arteries only worsens the problem. The observed connection between high blood pressure and cancer isn't as well understood, but it may arise from alterations in blood flow, increased inflammation, and other factors.
        Finally, people who've had a heart attack or heart failure appear to develop cancer more frequently than the general population, recent studies suggest.
        
          
            
              
                How cancer therapies may harm the heart
                The risk of heart problems during or after cancer treatment depends on the type and amount of drugs or radiation you receive and how healthy your heart was before the treatment. Older chemotherapy drugs called anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, which are used mainly to treat leukemia and lymphoma, can impair the heart's pumping ability. So can trastuzumab (Herceptin), a breast cancer therapy first approved in the late 1990s.
                More recently, many novel therapies that help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells have been developed. One promising type, known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, could potentially be used to treat half of all cancers, says Dr. Anju Nohria, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. But sometimes, these drugs trigger an autoimmune reaction that attacks various organs, including the heart. In about 1% of cases, this leads to myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), which is often mild but sometimes very serious. ""What we don't yet know is whether the chronic, low-grade inflammation that these drugs cause might increase a person's future risk of heart attack and heart failure, as some preliminary studies suggest,"" says Dr. Nohria.
              
            
          
        
        If you have cancer or heart disease
        If you're diagnosed with cancer, ask your doctor whether your planned treatment might lead to cardiovascular problems. This is especially important for people ages 65 and older and anyone with risk factors for heart disease (such as high blood pressure or diabetes), who may want to request a referral to a cardio-oncologist.
        ""When we see people who've undergone treatment for cancer, we try to identify and modify their risk factors for heart disease as much as possible,"" says Dr. Nohria. Many cancer survivors get CT scans as part of their treatment and surveillance. If these scans reveal calcium deposits in their coronary arteries, they may benefit from cholesterol-lowering drugs to limit their risk of a heart attack. Likewise, people with heart disease should be sure to follow cancer screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society.
        People with serious health conditions sometimes adopt a fatalistic view and abandon healthy lifestyle efforts, says Dr. Nohria. Others view their diagnosis and recovery as a new lease on life and do everything they can to stay healthy — an approach she actively supports.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/exercises-that-go-easy-on-the-bladder,Exercises that go easy on the bladder,"The high-impact exercise you once loved no longer seems to be a good fit, now that stress incontinence has crept into your life. Maybe you leak urine if you swing your tennis racket with force or do any high-spirited jumping in an aerobics class. The discomfort, hassle, and embarrassment might make you want to give up on your routine. But simple solutions can keep you in action.
        Exercise and incontinence
        Stress incontinence is characterized by the leakage of small amounts of urine when you do anything that puts pressure on the bladder, whether that's coughing, laughing, or exercising.
        The leaks are the result of weakened pelvic floor muscles. These muscles normally help you hold in urine, bowel movements, and gas. ""Ideally, the muscles would respond to increased pressure by contracting to prevent leakage. But with stress incontinence, the muscles don't respond properly,"" says Emily Walsh, a pelvic floor physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Weak pelvic floor muscles can result from aging, pregnancy, childbirth, certain surgeries, medication side effects, garbled messages between the muscles and the brain, weak abdominal or hip muscles (which work with the pelvic floor muscles), or conditions that cause you to strain the pelvic floor muscles (such as constipation).
        Try these exercises
        You need aerobic exercise (the kind that works your heart and lungs) for good cardiovascular health. Since high-impact aerobic exercise is demanding on pelvic floor muscles, consider low-impact aerobics with gentler moves.
        For example, instead of playing tennis, play pickleball (avoid lunging for the ball or running across the court); instead of going for a run, go for a brisk walk; instead of taking Zumba classes, take ballroom dance lessons.
        Other types of low-impact exercise that won't overload pelvic muscles include swimming; cycling; and seated aerobics, boxing, or dance.
        Physical therapy
        ""If your goal is returning to high-impact activity, consider working with a pelvic floor physical therapist. We can tailor treatment to the symptoms you're having and the activities you want to do,"" Walsh says. Treatment might include any of the following.
        Kegel exercises. Your therapist can help you identify your pelvic floor muscles and strengthen them. One way to do this is called a Kegel exercise. All it involves is squeezing like you're trying to stop the flow of urine or hold back gas, holding the contraction for about 10 seconds, relaxing, and repeating.
        Abdominal and hip exercises. ""By strengthening abdominal and hip muscles, you're also strengthening the pelvic floor, since there's overlap among the muscles,"" Walsh says. Examples include bridges, planks (see ""Move of the month""), and clamshells (lying on your side with your knees bent and raising and lowering only your top knee while keeping your feet together).
        Breathing exercises. ""A lot of people hold their breath while exercising, but that puts increased pressure on pelvic floor muscles and weakens them,"" Walsh says. ""A helpful cue is exhaling with exertion. Breathe out at the hardest part of the exercise, which will give you more intense contractions of the abdominal and pelvic floor muscles.""
        
          
            
              
                Move of the month: Modified plank
                
                  
                
                Doing a modified plank can strengthen abdominal and pelvic floor muscles. Place your forearms on a table or counter with your hands clasped and your shoulders aligned over your elbows. Step back so your body is straight, like a plank. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Hold for 15 to 60 seconds, take a break, then repeat.

        Other tips to help
        Practicing the following strategies can also help you cope with stress incontinence during exercise.
        Prepare for leaks. Wear absorbent ""bladder leak"" underwear or an absorbent pad. You'll stay comfortable and will be able to keep exercising.
        Empty your bladder just before exercising. This is easy to do at home. If you're exercising elsewhere, it helps to locate bathrooms in advance.
        Squeeze during exertion. Walsh suggests doing a Kegel-style contraction as you exert yourself with force — as you swing a racket, for example.
        Stay hydrated throughout the day. You might be inclined to avoid drinking a lot of fluids, hoping to reduce urine leaks. But that can lead to dehydration, which can cause confusion, fatigue, and falls — problems you always want to avoid, especially during exercise.
        Talk to your doctor. If you continue to leak during exercise, consult your doctor about other incontinence treatments, such as medication or surgery.

        It's natural to be concerned about memory loss. ""This can stem from seeing family members or friends who've received a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, or it might come from noticing cognitive changes over time,"" Dr. Buss says.
        That doesn't mean your thinking skills are faltering. Small memory lapses can be normal with aging. This includes things like forgetting someone's name briefly (feeling that it's on the tip of your tongue) or walking into a room and momentarily forgetting why you walked in.
        ""We worry more about large memory lapses, such as forgetting parts of conversations or recent or upcoming events, changes in the ability to speak or understand, or changes in focus or organization that affect your day-to-day life. Any decline in your ability to do complex tasks such as managing medications, working, driving, cooking, or managing finances would also be cause for concern and evaluation,"" Dr. Buss says.
        Crucial steps to cope
        A healthy lifestyle is essential for handling stress of any kind and for maintaining brain health as we age. What does a healthy lifestyle involve?
        ""Physical activity is one of the most important factors. It promotes healthy cognitive aging, reduces stress, and helps with sleep and mood,"" Dr. Buss says. ""We also strongly recommend that you stay socially engaged, connecting with friends and family regularly. Cognitive activities such as reading, puzzles, games, or listening to music are also vital for maintaining brain health, and are especially powerful when paired with social activities.""
        Sleep is also key to brain health. You need a full night's sleep (at least seven to nine hours a night) to help the brain cement information into memories and flush away waste associated with Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Buss advises prioritizing sleep hygiene and maintaining a consistent bedtime.
        You should also eat a healthy diet, stop smoking, and get underlying conditions (especially high blood pressure) under control.
        Managing stress will also help your brain. Meditation, yoga, tai chi, deep breathing exercises, and mindfulness (being present and engaged in each moment) can trigger the relaxation response — the opposite of the stress response. ""Treating any associated anxiety and depression can help, too. It can improve focus, sleep, and your motivation to engage in healthy lifestyle activities,"" Dr. Buss says.
        Try these memory strategies
        You might also feel less concerned about memory lapses by using practical strategies to retain information.
        ""For example, when you meet a new person, use their name in conversation right away to help you remember it,"" Dr. Buss suggests. ""Also, keep a single, central calendar and refer to it regularly; that's easier than keeping information in multiple places.""
        She also recommends always placing your keys or glasses in a designated spot; taking your medication at the same time each day; and using notebooks, address books, and other tools to organize and store information for fast retrieval, rather than relying entirely on your memory.
        When to seek help
        ""Feel free to bring up concerns to your doctor, who can help you figure out what's normal and what requires more investigation,"" Dr. Buss says. ""Consider involving loved ones in these discussions; perhaps they've noticed memory lapses you're unaware of. But don't wait if you're worried. It's possible that you just need a quick memory screening and a talk with your doctor about lifestyle factors to improve your memory.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/coping-with-heart-disease-and-arthritis-together,Coping with heart disease and arthritis together,"A lifelong exerciser, Steve cycled, lifted weights, and played pickup basketball into his late 60s, when he had a partial left knee replacement to treat his osteoarthritis. Within a few months, he was back at the gym riding a stationary bike and using the weight machines three to four times a week. He downs some ibuprofen if his knees or other joints start to ache, and he takes two daily blood pressure drugs.
        His 73-year-old neighbor Marjorie, who survived a heart attack nearly a year ago, has osteoarthritis in her hips. Her doctor has been encouraging her to exercise, but she finds walking uncomfortable. Her medications include low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent blood clots, rosuvastatin to control her cholesterol, and metformin to manage her diabetes.
        Like Steve and Marjorie, many people with cardiovascular conditions also deal with painful joint damage from osteoarthritis. Regular exercise benefits both conditions, but joint pain can make certain types of exercise difficult. What's more, some popular pain relievers for arthritis interact with common cardiovascular drugs — with potentially worrisome repercussions. Here's what you need to know if you're coping with both of these health problems together.
        Exercise advice
        Steve's current exercise regimen makes good sense and will benefit both his heart and his joints. ""Using a recumbent or stationary bike is much easier on your joints than walking,"" says Jim Zachazewski, a physical therapist and athletic trainer with Mass General Brigham Sports Medicine. When you walk, every step puts a load on your joints equal to twice your body weight or more, he explains. Other low-impact exercise machines like ellipticals or stair steppers are also good choices.
        However, many people like walking because it's convenient and affordable. Note that walking on a concrete sidewalk puts more pressure on your knee and hip joints than walking on a softer surface such as grass, dirt, or wood chips, says Zachazewski. ""Another good option is to walk around the track at a local high school. The rubberized surface is shock-absorbing and even more forgiving to joints,"" he says. Some exercise facilities also have indoor walking and running tracks. Be sure to wear well-fitting, cushioned athletic shoes when you exercise, he adds.
        For people like Marjorie, aquatic exercise can be a great option. Because you're buoyant, moving through water takes the stress off your joints, while the added resistance provides a challenging muscle workout. Don't like to swim? Try walking or jogging in water that's at least waist-deep. ""You can also wear a flotation belt in deep water and bicycle your legs,"" says Zachazewski. If you have shoulder arthritis, stand in neck-deep water and hold an empty, capped soda bottle in your outstretched hand. Moving the bottle up and down and from side to side under the water can be an effective upper-body exercise, even for people who've had shoulder surgery, he says. For more information, see ""What makes water workouts so worthwhile?"" in the August 2023 Heart Letter.
        If you're having any issues creating an exercise routine, ask your doctor for a referral to a physical therapist. He or she can help you design an activity program you can tolerate and, if needed, recommend assistive devices such as braces, canes, or walkers that can help you be more mobile.
        Medication management
        To treat pain and inflammation, many people with osteoarthritis rely on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and the prescription drug celecoxib (Celexa). ""But NSAIDs cause the kidneys to hold on to salt and water, which can also raise blood pressure. And studies show a link between these drugs and a higher risk of heart attack,"" says Dr. Robert H. Shmerling, senior faculty editor for Harvard Health Publishing and former clinical chief of rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        For someone like Steve whose blood pressure is well controlled, taking ibuprofen or another NSAID a few times a week is unlikely to cause a problem, especially if it makes regular exercise and activity more tolerable. However, he should check his blood pressure periodically to make sure it's not rising.
        But Marjorie would be better off taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain instead of ibuprofen, Dr. Shmerling cautions. That's because she's already taking low-dose aspirin to prevent a second heart attack. Ibuprofen can interfere with aspirin's anti-clotting activity, possibly negating its beneficial effect for the heart. However, you can avoid this possible problem by waiting at least 30 minutes after taking the low-dose aspirin to take ibuprofen or naproxen (or alternatively, taking either NSAID at least eight hours before the aspirin).
        NSAIDs also increase the risk of bleeding, which ranges from minor problems (such as noticeable bruising) to more serious complications, such as bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract or, in rare cases, the brain. This risk is even greater for people on clot-preventing drugs such as apixaban (Eliquis) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), which are prescribed to people with atrial fibrillation and other cardio­vascular problems.
        If oral NSAIDs irritate your stomach, you can try a topical version instead. Diclofenac is an NSAID that's available without a prescription as a topical gel (such as Aspercreme Arthritis Pain Relief Gel and Voltaren Arthritis Pain Gel). It works best for arthritis in smaller joints and joints near the surface of the skin, such as in the hands, knees, ankles, and feet. It may be less effective for deeper joints, such as the hip and shoulder.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/fasting-before-lipid-test-usually-unnecessary,Fasting before lipid test usually unnecessary,"Q.
          Do I need to fast before my cholesterol test?
        
        A. For most people, the answer is no. Here's the backstory: For decades, we've told people not to eat or drink (except for water and medications) for eight to 12 hours before a cholesterol test. This was based on the thought that a measurement done after fasting would provide a more accurate assessment of all the lipids (fats) in the blood, including LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. However, studies show that the differences between fasting and non-fasting values for cholesterol are usually negligible.
        An analysis using data from a clinical trial of 4,100 people compared the results from lipid tests done with and without fasting. The LDL (bad) cholesterol values were only about 4 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) higher when people weren't fasting. Because the cholesterol guidelines focus on LDL, whether you are fasting won't matter for determining whether your LDL is at goal. So if people come to my clinic and they've had breakfast or lunch, we go ahead and take a blood sample.
        But triglycerides are another story. After you eat, your body immediately converts any excess calories from food into triglycerides, which are then stored in fat cells. In addition, any saturated fat you eat is broken down into smaller fatty particles called chylomicrons, which enter the bloodstream and further contribute to a temporary rise in triglycerides. Some people have high triglyceride levels, which is more common among those who are overweight or have diabetes or prediabetes (and some people have inherited a tendency for this problem). For these people, not fasting can often lead to very high triglyceride levels. So anyone who has ever had a high triglyceride level should always fast before a lipid test. This will provide a more accurate assessment of their triglyceride value, which is then used to inform treatment recommendations.
        If a person's triglycerides are higher than 150 mg/dl on a fasting lipid test, that is linked to a higher risk of heart attack or related cardiovascular issues. Treatment starts with diet and exercise but may include medications, although the latter are usually reserved for people who have heart disease or are at high risk for it, including those with diabetes.
        When I see a new patient, I look back at their earlier lipid test results. If most of their triglycerides are within the normal range (below 150 mg/dL), I tell them they don't need to fast before their blood test. But if some of their values are high, I ask them to fast. Because fasting can be challenging if you can't schedule a morning blood test, ask your doctor if not fasting is an option for you.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-white-noise-really-help-you-sleep-better,Can white noise really help you sleep better?,"Some people find that the neutral sound of white noise helps them sleep better. But is there evidence to support this? And what about other noise colors?
        What is white noise?
        White noise has been compared to the static from a radio that isn't tuned to a specific station. Technically, the term ""white noise"" refers to noise that contains all frequencies of the sounds that people can hear, in equal parts. (Frequency is the rate at which sound waves vibrate.)
        Can white noise help you sleep better?
        Studies on the benefits of white noise for sleep have yielded mixed results. Some studies have found it helped people sleep better, possibly by masking outside noises and serving as a cue to fall asleep.
        ""A study in infants and children showed that white noise may reduce heart rate and respiratory rate, effectively lulling an individual to sleep,"" says Dr. Sogol Javaheri, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and physician in the division of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
        However, a systematic review published in Sleep Medicine Reviews found white noise had little beneficial effect on sleep.
        What's more, according to Dr. Javaheri, white noise may interrupt important stages of sleep, such as REM sleep or deep sleep, and affect hearing if it is too loud.
        If you use a white noise machine for sleep, try moving it to a corner of your bedroom and keep the noise level no louder than that of a background conversation. Turn on your white noise machine just before getting into bed. If your machine has a timer, experiment with having it play only as you fall asleep rather than all night long.
        Other noise colors for better sleep: Pink noise and brown noise
        While white noise is the best known, it's not the only ""color"" noise that's been used to enhance sleep. Pink noise has more intense, lower frequencies that make it sound deeper than white noise. Examples of pink noise are the sounds of rain or a waterfall.
        Some studies have found that pink noise can enhance deep sleep in older adults and improve cognitive performance. In addition, research suggests that pink noise may decrease time to fall asleep and improve sleep quality. However, these results were achieved under experimental conditions in which researchers adjusted pink noise timing during the night.
        Another color noise — brown noise — reduces higher sound frequencies even more than pink noise and is described as grainier or rougher. For example, brown noise can be compared to ocean waves crashing, while pink noise is more like a gentle rain.
        ""More data is needed to determine what role pink and brown noise may play in sleep, such as what volume and duration would be of most benefit,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""For now, I would not recommend pink or brown noise continuously, but rather use it for a set time if it helps you fall asleep more quickly.""","Lisa Catanese, ELS","March 31, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-is-prostatitis-and-how-is-it-treated-202503253092,What is prostatitis and how is it treated?,"Prostatitis, or inflammation of the prostate, is more common than you might think — it accounts for roughly two million doctor visits every year. The troubling symptoms include burning or painful urination, an urgent need to go (especially at night), painful ejaculations, and also pain in the lower back and perineum (the space between the scrotum and anus).
        Prostatitis overview
        There are four general categories of prostatitis:
        Acute bacterial prostatitis comes on suddenly and is often caused by infections with bacteria such as Escherichia coli that normally live in the colon. Men can suffer muscle aches, fever, and blood in semen or urine, as well as urogenital symptoms. Acute inflammation can cause the prostate to swell and block urinary outflow from the bladder. A complete blockage is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Depending on symptom severity, hospitalization may be necessary.
        Chronic bacterial prostatitis results from milder infections that sometimes linger for months. It occurs more often in older men and the symptoms typically wax and wane in severity, sometimes becoming barely noticeable.
        Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, also called chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), is the most common type. CPPS can be triggered by stress, urinary tract infections, or physical trauma causing inflammation or nerve damage in the genitourinary area. In some men, the cause is never identified. CPPS can affect the entire pelvic floor, meaning all the muscles, nerves, and tissues that support organs involved in bowel, bladder, and sexual functioning.
        Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis is diagnosed when doctors detect white blood cells in prostate tissues or secretions in men being evaluated for other conditions. It generally requires no treatment.
        Both acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis can cause blood levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to spike. This can be alarming, since high PSA is also indicative of prostate cancer. But if a man has prostatitis, then that condition — and not prostate cancer — may very well be the reason for the rise in PSA.
        Prostatitis treatments
        Fortunately, research advances are leading to some encouraging developments for men suffering from this condition.
        Antibiotics called fluoroquinolones are effective treatments for acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis. A four-to six-week course of the drugs typically does the trick. However, bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones is a growing problem. An older drug called fosfomycin can help if other drugs stop working. PSA levels will decline with treatment, although that process may take three to six months.
        CPPS is treated in other ways. Since it is not caused by a bacterial infection, CPPS will not respond to antibiotics. Medical treatments include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, alpha blockers including tamsulosin (Flomax) that loosen tight muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, and drugs called PDEF inhibitors such as tadalafil (Cialis) that improve blood flow to the prostate.
        Specialized types of physical therapy can provide some relief. One method called trigger point therapy, for instance, targets tender areas in muscles that tighten up and spasm. With another method called myofascial release, physical therapists can reduce tension in the connective tissues surrounding muscles and organs. Men should avoid Kegel exercises, however, which can tighten the pelvic floor and cause worsening symptoms.
        Acupuncture has shown promise in clinical trials. One study published in 2023 showed significant improvements in CPPS symptoms lasting up to six months after the acupuncture treatments were finished. Mounting evidence suggest that CPPS should be treated with holistic strategies that also consider psychological factors.
        Men with CPPS often suffer from depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues that can exacerbate pain perception. Techniques such as mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy for CPPS can help CPPS sufferers develop effective coping strategies.
        Comment
        ""An accurate diagnosis is important given differences in how each of the four categories of prostatitis is treated,"" said Dr. Boris Gershman, a urologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School. PSA should also be retested after treating bacterial forms of prostatitis, Dr. Gershman added, to ensure that the levels go back to normal. If the PSA stays elevated after antibiotic treatment, or if abnormal levels are detected in men with nonbacterial prostatitis, then the PSA ""should be evaluated in accordance with standard diagnostic approaches,"" Dr. Gershman said.",Charlie Schmidt,"March 25, 2025"

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/common-causes-of-cloudy-urine,Common causes of cloudy urine,"Cloudy urine is often nothing to be overly concerned about. But you should let your doctor know about it if it persists, especially if you have other symptoms. Here's a closer look at what it could mean, and what to do about it.

What should urine look like, and what do we mean by ""cloudy"" urine?

Cloudy urine looks, well, cloudy. ""Normal urine should be transparent and light yellow,"" explains Dr. Robert Shmerling, Senior Faculty Editor at Harvard Health Publishing. Cloudy urine looks milky or hazy. ""If you poured it into a glass, you wouldn't be able to easily see through it.""

Common causes of cloudy urine

Here are some reasons why you may notice cloudy urine:

Low acid. Urine is made up of water, salt, and waste products. Normally, these components combine to create urine that ranges from a slightly acidic pH level to slightly alkaline. But in some circumstances, such as persitent vomiting or eating certain foods, your urine can become more alkaline than usual, says Dr. Shmerling. And the more alkaline the urine, the cloudier it appears. ""We do sometimes see cloudy urine among vegans, since a diet high in fruits and vegetables raises your urine's pH level,"" he explains.

Urinary tract infection (UTI). If you have a UTI, white blood cells and even small amounts of blood may appear in your urine and cause it to look cloudy, says Dr. Shmerling. If it is a UTI, you'll usually have other symptoms like painful and frequent urination.

Dehydration. ""If your urine is very concentrated, it may appear cloudy because it's dark yellow or, if you're really dehydrated, almost orange,"" explains Dr. Shmerling.

Diabetes. If your diabetes is not well controlled, sugar can build up in your urine and make it appear cloudy.

Sexually transmitted diseases. STDs like trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia can cause cloudy urine in men or women.

Certain medications. Blood thinners such as warfarin have been linked to blood in the urine, which can make it look cloudy. Certain medications, such the antibiotic rifampin, can cause the color of urine to change, giving it a cloudy appearance, notes Dr. Shmerling.

Kidney disease. Cloudy urine can sometimes be a sign of kidney disease, especially if it's accompanied by small foamy bubbles. It can also indicate kidney stones, although kidney stones usually cause additional symptoms like abdominal or flank pain and vomiting.

Prostate problems. ""If you have a prostate infection, white blood cells can build up in your urine,"" explains Dr. Shmerling. If your prostate is inflamed, that can cause problems too. ""It can damage the urethra, the tube that allows urine to leave your body,"" he says. ""If it's injured, blood and other debris can enter urine and make it look cloudy.""

When to see a doctor for cloudy urine

If you notice cloudy urine but otherwise feel fine, there's no need to be overly concerned, says Dr. Shmerling. Since it could be caused by dehydration, make sure to drink plenty of liquids.

But if cloudy urine lasts more than 24 hours, or it goes away only to come back, call your doctor. They can run a urine culture and blood tests to try to pinpoint an underlying cause, like a UTI or diabetes.

There are also some situations where you should contact your doctor right away, stresses Dr. Shmerling. These include:


	severe or persistent pain when you urinate
	blood in your urine
	fever
	abdominal or flank pain (this could indicate a kidney stone).",Hallie Levine,"March 19, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/mold-in-the-home-identifying-and-treating-the-issue-to-prevent-health-problems,Mold in the home: Identifying and treating the issue to prevent health problems,"Mold is a type of fungus, a group of organisms that also includes yeasts and mushrooms. Mold thrives in wet places. Outdoors, it forms on damp surfaces like rotting logs or wet leaves. Inside, it can grow in damp areas like bathrooms, basements, or kitchens. If your home has experienced a flood or you have leaky pipes, your house is more likely to develop mold.

Mold in your home can cause health problems. Here's a look at symptoms of mold exposure, and how to identify, treat, and prevent it.

Symptoms of mold exposure

Most molds aren't harmful, reassures Dr. Nicholas Nassikas, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. In fact, some molds are even used to make foods like cheese and yogurt, or medications like penicillin.

But some people develop symptoms such as a runny nose, itchy eyes, and coughing after exposure. ""Mold exposure can cause inflammation anywhere along the respiratory tract,"" Dr. Nassikas explains. If you have mold allergies or asthma, you may have an even more severe reaction, he adds.

Health risks of prolonged exposure to indoor mold

For those who are allergic, symptoms such as itchy, runny nose, coughing, and even wheezing can occur when outdoor mold levels are high, or if you're exposed to indoor mold, even for a short period of time.

Chronic exposure to indoor mold can cause additional, sometimes severe health complications, says Dr. Nassikas. These include:

Asthma. Childhood exposure to household mold raises the risk of developing asthma, according to a study published in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. When researchers looked at over 40,000 children in the U.S., they found that almost 11% of those in homes where they were exposed to mold had asthma, compared to 7% of kids who were not exposed to mold in their homes.

Mood changes. A review of 19 studies published in Environmental Health Perspectives found that prolonged exposure to mold increased stress, depression, and anxiety in both adults and children.

Immune system changes. Research suggests that chronic exposure to indoor mold is associated with elevated levels of chemicals in the body, like C-reactive protein (CRP), that signify the presence of inflammation.

Black mold

Black mold is one of several different types of mold. There are even many different types of black mold. But when people talk about black mold, they're usually referring to Stachybotrys chartarum, or S. chartarum. (Stachybotrys chartarum was previously known as Stachybotrys atra.) This type of mold grows and spreads on materials that contain cellulose, like paper, wood, and drywall.

S. chartarum made headlines in the 1990s, when research suggested an association between black mold and lung hemorrhage in infants. ""The link is controversial — it's not clear that S. chartarum was the cause,"" stresses Dr. Nassikas.

Even though black mold symptoms have gotten a lot of attention, black mold itself doesn't seem more dangerous than other types, adds Dr. Nassikas. ""Prolonged exposure to any type of indoor mold may cause problems like asthma, lung inflammation, and cognitive and mood issues,"" he says.

How to identify mold

If you have mold, it's often obvious. ""You'll usually see it, or smell it,"" says Dr. Nassikas. Look for fuzzy, discolored, or slimy patches in areas where there's a lot of moisture, like your bathroom, window moldings, your refrigerator door seal, or around air conditioners. Another tip-off is a musky odor, adds Dr. Nassikas. If you can't identify where it comes from right away, look behind and underneath surfaces like carpets, wallpaper, cabinets, and walls.

You may have heard of mold test kits, but the CDC doesn't routinely recommend them. The best thing to do is remove any mold if you see or smell it.

Common causes of mold growth in homes

""The number one cause of mold growth is water damage,"" says Dr. Nassikas. ""If you see water, chances are there's mold there as well."" Some common ways this can happen include:


	roof leaks
	excessive moisture in the bathroom
	high room humidity
	leaking water pipes
	water pooling near the foundation of your home.


Mold remediation: When to call a professional for mold removal

If you think you have mold, the first step is to call a professional to solve the underlying problem, says Dr. Nassikas. If you have mold from a leaky pipe, for example, you'll want to have a plumber come to fix it.

If the moldy area is smaller than a three-foot-by-three-foot patch, you can get rid of the mold yourself. The CDC recommends the following: Use soap and water, or a bleach solution with one cup of laundry bleach mixed with one gallon of water to scrub mold off hard surfaces. Dry completely. Open all the windows and doors for good ventilation, and wear rubber boots, gloves, and goggles while cleaning. You may need to throw away absorbent or porous materials like carpets or ceiling tiles, which cannot be thoroughly cleaned.

If the area is larger than about 10 square feet, or if you've had a major flood in your home, it's best to bring in professional mold remediation. Look for a mold removal company or professional who is certified by any of the following:


	National Environmental Health Association (NEHA)
	American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA)
	Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration Certification (IICRC)
	American Council for Accredited Certification (ACAC).


Your state may also be able to provide names of professionals in your area.

Preventing mold growth in the home

The best way to prevent indoor mold growth is to clean up and fix any water damage as soon as possible. If you see condensation or wet spots on walls, call a plumber who can help you find the source of the hidden leak. Other things you can do:

Regulate humidity levels in your home. If you regularly see condensation on your windows, it may be a sign that your home has high humidity levels. You can buy a hygrometer at your local hardware store to measure humidity in your home. If it's above 60%, use dehumidifiers. Ideally, you want to keep indoor humidity between 30% and 50%.

Run exhaust fans. Run the bathroom fan when you shower to prevent excess moisture. If you don't have an exhaust fan, open the window instead. Cooking can also raise humidity levels. Use your stove's exhaust hood to draw moisture out of the kitchen. If you have a clothes dryer, make sure it's vented to the outdoors.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/should-you-be-sleepmaxxing-to-boost-health-and-happiness-202503063090,Should you be sleepmaxxing to boost health and happiness?,"If you've been on TikTok lately, you know it's hard to avoid countless influencers touting a concept called sleepmaxxing. Their posts provide tips and tricks to get longer, better, and more restorative sleep. And why not? Sleep is considered a pillar of good health and is related to everything from brain health to cardiovascular health, and even diabetes.
        But what exactly is sleepmaxxing? And how likely is it to deliver on claims of amped-up energy, a boost to the immune system, reducing stress levels, and improving your mood?
        What is sleepmaxxing?
        Depending on which social media platform you happen to be looking at, the recommended strategies for maximizing sleep differ. Tips include:
        
          taping your mouth shut while sleeping
          not drinking anything during the two hours before bedtime
          a cold room temperature
          a dark bedroom
          using a white noise machine
          not setting a morning alarm
          showering one hour before bedtime
          eliminating caffeine
          eating kiwis before going to bed
          taking magnesium and melatonin
          using weighted blankets
          getting 30 minutes of sunlight every day
          meditating daily for 30 minutes.
        
        Does any research support sleepmaxxing?
        A thorough search through PubMed, PsycNet, and Google Scholar reveals zero results for the terms ""sleepmaxx"" and ""sleepmaxxing."" But wait — this certainly doesn't mean that some influencer-recommended strategies are not evidence-based, just that the concept of sleepmaxxing, as a defined package, has not been scientifically studied. But yes, some of the strategies — including one uncomfortable, though popular, choice — lack evidence.
        Can mouth-taping improve your sleep?
        TikTok users have claimed that taping your mouth while you sleep has benefits, such as reducing snoring and improving bad breath. A team from the department of otolaryngology at George Washington University was prompted by all of the social media buzz on the topic to review research on the impact of nocturnal mouth taping. Spoiler alert: the authors note that most TikTok mouth-taping claims aren't supported by research.
        If you do snore, it's important to discuss this with your medical team. Even if taping your mouth reduces your snoring, it can't effectively treat a potential underlying cause of the snoring, such as allergies, asthma, or sleep apnea.
        Sleepmaxxing or basic sleep hygiene?
        Many strategies recommended by sleepmaxxers are essentially what sleep experts prescribe as good sleep hygiene, which has plenty of research backing its value. Common components of sleep hygiene are decreasing caffeine and alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, sleep timing, reducing evening light exposure, limiting daytime naps, and having a cool bedroom.
        While tips like these help many people enjoy restful sleep, those who have an insomnia disorder will need more help, as described below.
        Melatonin, early bedtime, weighted blankets, and — kiwi fruit?
        Other strategies suggested by sleepmaxxers are based on limited scientific data. For example:
        
          Taking melatonin is recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to treat circadian rhythm disorders such as jet lag. But it's not recommended for insufficient sleep, poor sleep quality, or difficulty with falling asleep or staying asleep.
          Is it healthier to be asleep by 10 p.m.? One video that garnered more than a million views claims it is. While it is important to maximize morning sunlight exposure and minimize evening light exposure to regulate circadian rhythms, there is such variability in how much sleep someone requires and individual chronotypes (not to mention varying personal and professional responsibilities!) that it is difficult to state there is an ideal bedtime for everyone.
          While intriguing research has been done on weighted blankets, there is no convincing evidence that they are truly effective for the general adult population.
          Overall, it's important to be cautious about the impact of the placebo effect on how someone sleeps. An analysis of more than 30 studies showed that roughly 64% of the drug response for a sleep medication in insomnia patients could be due to the placebo effect. A key takeaway is that studies that are not randomized controlled trials — such as this small study on 24 people suggesting that kiwi fruit may improve sleep — should be interpreted with a grain of salt.
        
        Could you have orthosomnia?
        The expectation of flawless sleep, night in and night out, is an unrealistic goal. Orthosomnia is a term that describes an unhealthy pursuit of perfect sleep. The pressure to get perfect sleep is embedded in the sleepmaxxing culture.
        With more and more people able to access daily data about their sleep and other health metrics through consumer wearables, even a person who is objectively sleeping well can become unnecessarily concerned with optimizing their sleep. While prioritizing restful sleep is commendable, setting perfection as your goal is problematic. Even good sleepers vary from night to night, experiencing less than desirable sleep a couple of times per week.
        It is also noteworthy that some of the most widely viewed recommendations on TikTok are not supported by scientific evidence.
        Do you really need to fix your sleep?
        A good first step is to understand whether or not there is anything that you need to fix! Consider tracking your sleep for a few weeks using a sleep diary, and pair this data with a consumer wearable (such as a Fitbit or Apple Watch). Both imperfectly capture sleep data when compared to the gold-standard tool sleep experts use (polysomnography, or a sleep study). However, combining the information can give you a reasonable assessment of your sleep status.
        Regularly getting restful sleep can indeed boost health and mood. And all of us can benefit from following basic sleep hygiene tips. But if it takes you 30 minutes or more to fall asleep, or if you are up for 30 minutes or more in the middle of the night, and this happens three or more times per week, then consider reaching out to your health care team to seek further evaluation.
        There are effective, nonmedication treatments that are proven to help you sleep better. One example is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which can dramatically improve insomnia symptoms in a matter of weeks.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/investigating-memory-loss,Investigating memory loss,"It can be scary not knowing if sudden memory lapses or other cognitive changes are just a natural aspect of aging or an early sign of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI falls between the cognitive decline associated with aging and the more serious signs of dementia. With MCI, some changes are noticeable but usually do not impede the ability to carry out daily functions.
        ""It's not unusual to be forgetful at times as you age, but if memory issues are more noticeable, it's always best to get checked out and undergo a cognitive test,"" says Sara Weisenbach, a neuropsychologist with Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""There are ways to slow the progression of cognitive decline or treat issues that could be causing memory lapses, but the sooner you can identify a problem, the better the outcome.""
        See your doctor
        Your first step is to see your primary care physician to discuss your symptoms, review your overall health and concerns, and assess any family history of dementia. An ideal time for this may be at an annual wellness visit. (Don't rely on results of online cognitive tests, as many are unreliable and may not offer an accurate evaluation, says Weisenbach.)
        Before your visit, make a list of your specific cognitive concerns to share with your doctor. Also, bring a family member or friend to your appointment. Their support can help ease your nerves, and they can provide their own observations. An in-office cognitive screening test lasts from five to 15 minutes. The test might include
        
          repeating a list of words immediately and then again after a short delay
          recalling personal information like addresses or birthdays
          naming objects in a picture
          answering questions about recent events
          drawing a clock to assess spatial orientation.
        
        ""The results might indicate a potential problem, but they usually are not sufficient for a formal MCI diagnosis,"" says Weisenbach.
        
          
            
              
                Senior moments or red flags?
                It can be difficult to gauge when memory issues need medical attention. But you probably should consult your doctor if you experience any of the following:
                
                  frequent episodes of forgetfulness, like not recalling a recent conversation or missing appointments
                  frequent trouble retaining new information, like a phone number or address
                  errors in paying bills or taking medications
                  difficulty finding your parked car, trouble finding your way in familiar areas, or minor car accidents.
                
              
            
          
        
        Additional testing
        Based on your test results and your doctor's assessment, you may be advised to undergo further testing and evaluation. If the results hint at memory loss or another cognitive issue, or if your doctor needs more information, the next step might be blood tests, which can help to rule out reversible causes of cognitive impairment, such as low vitamin B12, iron deficiency, or an underactive thyroid.
        The doctor may also recommend one or more brain imaging studies. An MRI scan can look for structural changes in the brain, like loss of volume and changes in blood flow. A PET scan can look for amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, one of the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's disease.
        Your doctor also may recommend a neuropsychological evaluation with a specialist like a neurologist or neuro-psychologist. This sit-down visit can last a few hours and explores your cognitive issues in more detail, such as when they began and the circumstances around them. For example, are you having trouble finding the right words when speaking? Do you regularly misplace your keys and phone? Can you not recall a conversation from the previous day?
        ""All this information can help determine if the issues are a sudden phenomenon or have worsened over time,"" says Weisenbach. ""A neuropsychologist can also help determine which cognitive skills are strong and which ones are more challenging."" Other factors are also considered when evaluating the test results. For instance, lower-than-expected scores can be influenced by medication side effects or mental health issues like depression, anxiety, or grief.
        Even if the neuropsychological examination does not suggest MCI, your doctor or neuropsychologist can help address any issues that may be related to your mental lapses. ""This initial screening also provides a baseline for future reference in case other memory issues arise or your situation worsens over time,"" says Weisenbach. ""If the results from the tests are inconclusive, you might be monitored for 12 to 18 months and then re-evaluated.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-heart-disease-trigger-that-lurks-inside-bone-marrow,A heart disease trigger that lurks inside bone marrow,"Every day, stem cells in our bone marrow churn out tens of thousands of progeny that replenish the white and red blood cells that circulate throughout the body. But as we age, spontaneous genetic mutations can arise in these bone marrow cells. These mutated cells then make multiple copies (clones), a process known as clonal hematopoiesis.
        By age 70, about 10% to 20% of people have clonal hematopoiesis, and the prevalence of this condition rises steeply with increasing age. Although it can predispose people to leukemia and related cancers, most people with it remain cancer-free and never even know they have clonal hematopoiesis. But over the past decade or so, scientists have discovered that one form-called clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP)-is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
        Dr. Peter Libby, the Mallinckrodt professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, has published numerous articles about CHIP. In 2020, he established one of the nation's few CHIP-cardiovascular disease clinics at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Below, he explains more about this burgeoning field of study.
        
          Q.
          What causes the mutations that occur in people with CHIP?
        
        A. These mutations are not the type that we inherit from our parents, which are known as germline mutations. Rather, they are somatic mutations, which arise later in life spontaneously or due to environmental factors. We're exposed to environmental mutagens like air pollution, cosmic radiation, and chemicals throughout our lives. That's a major reason why these mutations accumulate and become more common with age. Many cases of cancer are thought to stem from somatic mutations. In fact, there are more than 40 such mutations linked to leukemia, a blood cancer that typically affects white blood cells. But because you need at least three distinct mutations in the same clone to develop full-blown leukemia, rates of this cancer are less than 1% per year among people with CHIP.
        
          Q.
          What's the connection to heart disease?
        
        A. The link was discovered more than a decade ago by Dr. Benjamin Ebert, who is now CEO of Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. While researching the origins of leukemia, he found people without leukemia who had just one or two of the leukemia-associated mutations. It turns out that some of these mutations increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. That's why we refer to these cells as having ""indeterminate potential,"" since they may never cause overt disease.
        Some of these mutations relate clearly to inflammation, a well-known contributor to the formation of fatty plaque inside arteries. But different mutations have different mechanisms of action, and people can have different burdens-that is, amounts-of mutated cells. This diversity means it's going to be devilishly hard to do rigorous clinical trials, but we're working on it.
        Several large, long-term studies of heart disease have included genetic testing that reveals CHIP. Based on these data, it's been estimated that CHIP is associated with a twofold increase in risk for coronary artery disease and a more than 2.5-fold increase in risk for stroke.
        
          Q.
          How do people discover they have CHIP?
        
        A. Routine screening for CHIP is not currently recommended for healthy people. CHIP is most commonly discovered during genetic testing for cancer or blood-related disorders, such as smoldering myeloma, a precancerous condition marked by a buildup of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow. People with a family history of cancer may also undergo testing for CHIP. Some very health-conscious people pay to have their entire genomes sequenced and then find out they have CHIP.
        
          Q.
          How do you treat people in your CHIP clinic?
        
        A. At present, there aren't any proven specific therapies for CHIP. I reinforce the importance of a healthy diet and regular exercise, as I do for everyone I counsel. Unless a person has signs or symptoms of a cardiovascular problem, we don't recommend routine stress testing or imaging tests. But people with CHIP likely benefit from careful monitoring and aggressive treatment of all heart-related risk factors, such as blood pressure and cholesterol.
        
          Q.
          What are your hopes for the future of this field?
        
        A. We're learning so much biology and fundamental science that has helped us understand the links between aging, heart disease, and cancer that were unsuspected just a few years ago. The hope is that as we discover more, we'll develop genetically directed therapies to address the various specific mutations that cause CHIP.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/boosting-breast-cancer-survival,Boosting breast cancer survival,"For a deceptively basic question, the answer held profound implications: could women with early-stage but high-risk breast cancer — which is deemed more likely to spread — improve their odds of avoiding a recurrence and living longer just by taking daily aspirin?
        Harvard researchers decided to find out. As part of a 534-location clinical trial that tracked participants for up to six years, they studied more than 3,000 women (average age 53) who were treated with standard therapies for their cancer. Half were randomly assigned to also take 300 milligrams of aspirin once a day, while the others took a placebo.
        But the researchers' hopes were dashed — prompting an early end to the trial — when it became clear there was no difference in survival or recurrence rates between the two groups. The analysis, published May 28, 2024, in JAMA, came after some observational studies—which can't produce results as robust as clinical trials — had suggested that women with breast cancer who took aspirin seemed much less likely to die from the disease.
        ""This is one of those scientific questions a lot of people wanted answered,"" says study co-author Dr. Wendy Chen, a breast oncologist at Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""The good news about a negative study is it shows that it doesn't make sense to continue barking up this tree.""
        Silver linings were scarce, however. ""I was disappointed, yes, because I would have loved to find a simple, inexpensive way to improve breast cancer survival rates,"" says study co-author Dr. Michelle Holmes, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""It would have been wonderful if it worked, because aspirin is inexpensive and available all over the world, in many places where people can't afford expensive cancer treatment.""
        Hunger for information
        Scientists sometimes hesitate to publish research with negative findings, but this study's publication should help guide women to more effective therapies and perhaps overall better health. While the clinical trial may have shown aspirin couldn't help women with breast cancer avert recurrence or improve survival, several other evidence-backed measures might accomplish those goals, Harvard experts say.
        Many women are hungry for such guidance. An estimated 310,000 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2024 and more than 42,000 died of it, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). Though more than nine in 10 patients with breast cancer are diagnosed at an early stage, about one-quarter will eventually die of metastatic cancer (that is, cancer that has spread elsewhere in the body).
        The risk that breast cancer will come back is based on many factors, including the type and stage of the initial malignancy. About two-thirds of breast cancer cases are diagnosed at a localized stage, before the cancer has spread outside the breast, according to the National Breast Cancer Foundation. Nearly all women diagnosed while their breast cancer is still localized will be alive five years later.
        It's natural for women with breast cancer to want to investigate anything they can do — in addition to treatment — to lower the odds of the malignancy returning. ""Obviously, everyone wants to improve their survival and decrease their chance of recurrence, but it's important to understand what's evidence-based and what isn't,"" Dr. Chen says.
        What helps—or doesn't
        Dr. Chen and Dr. Holmes highlight lifestyle factors linked with better or worse breast cancer survival odds:
        Exercise. Considered the strongest tool in the breast cancer survival kit, physical activity can lower the odds of dying from the disease by about 40%. Exercise is believed to reduce the body's levels of insulin and estrogen, two hormones that can fuel cancer cell growth. It can also promote weight loss, which can lower the odds of cancer recurrence and death (see more below).
        Women who exercised at least 2.5 hours each week either before or after being diagnosed with breast cancer deemed at high risk of spreading were significantly less likely to die or have their cancer come back over the next 15 years, according to a 2021 study of 1,340 women in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
        Exercise might also boost the immune system's ability to halt any cancer progression. ""But in all of medicine, exercise is kind of the silver bullet. It seems to make every illness better,"" says Dr. Holmes.
        Weight control. Evidence suggests being overweight or obese during or after breast cancer treatment increases both the risk the cancer will return and the risk of dying from the disease. Part of the reason is that fat tissue ""holds"" estrogen — which can fuel breast cancer — more effectively than lean tissue. Obesity can also ramp up damaging inflammation.
        ""We do know being at a healthy weight leads to better cancer and overall survival compared to people who are heavier,"" Dr. Chen says. ""Body composition — not just what you weigh on a scale — is also important. Focus on building muscle mass, not just on losing weight.""
        Diet. While no specific foods have been identified that help lower the odds of breast cancer recurrence, studies indicate that survivors who eat more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, poultry, and fish tend to live longer than those with diets heavy in refined sugar, fat, and red and processed meats, according to the ACS.
        ""The benefits of a healthy diet are not confined to just breast cancer,"" Dr. Holmes says. ""The evidence for eating a healthy diet and preventing many other diseases is very strong.""
        Soy products such as tofu and soy milk once fell under scrutiny because they contain compounds called isoflavones, which can mimic estrogen in the body. But soy products haven't been found to increase breast cancer recurrence rates and may lower them, the ACS says. ""The concern that soy products might stimulate tumors and cause recurrence has been pretty thoroughly debunked,"" Dr. Holmes says.
        Alcohol. Much scientific evidence backs the notion that drinking alcohol — even as little as a few drinks per week — raises our risk of developing breast cancer. But the link between drinking and breast cancer recurrence isn't as clear. The ACS recommends that women who have had breast cancer ideally avoid alcohol or at least limit their consumption to no more than one drink per day. ""My take is that you certainly shouldn't start drinking if you don't already drink, and you should balance your risk based on your overall health,"" Dr. Holmes says.
        Supplements. Wouldn't it be ideal if popping a supplement could help lower the chances that breast cancer will progress or prove fatal? But there's no evidence that's the case, according to the ACS. ""Most supplement use doesn't seem to be harmful, but it's not clear if it's helpful,"" Dr. Holmes says. ""It's better to get your micronutrients like vitamins and minerals from a healthy diet rather than a pill.""
        Smoking. There's nothing healthy about smoking, the top preventable cause of death in the United States. It's also clear that women with breast cancer who've smoked face higher odds of dying from their malignancy. And women who quit smoking after being diagnosed with breast cancer enjoy higher odds of survival over all. ""To decrease your risk of cancer death, nothing is better than not smoking,"" Dr. Chen says.
        Treatment trumps all
        It's not always clear how various lifestyle measures help women with breast cancer avoid recurrence or death from the cancer itself. But these approaches almost certainly improve their ability to keep other potentially deadly conditions at bay or manage them more effectively, Harvard experts say.
        For example, while physical activity and weight control appear likely to help people with breast cancer avoid dying from it, ""of course they also help lengthen life and help people avoid high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes,"" Dr. Holmes explains.
        The lifestyle changes that promote better outcomes with breast cancer are ""kind of a one-size-fits-all,"" she says. ""You may be helping your breast cancer, and you're definitely helping your overall health.""
        Ultimately, however, a woman's treatment plan contributes most to her ability to fight breast cancer, Dr. Chen says. Someone undergoing treatment can arm herself with knowledge by asking her doctor why various approaches have been selected for her. Typically, therapies are tailored to each woman based on specific characteristics of her cancer, including the stage, tumor size, cell type, whether it has spread, and her overall health.
        ""When I look at patients who do best, it's usually those who follow through with their treatment plan,"" Dr. Chen says. ""Adherence to treatment is clearly shown to improve outcomes. If you only do half your treatment versus 100% of it, you're not going to do as well.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/can-dark-chocolate-help-you-avoid-diabetes,Can dark chocolate help you avoid diabetes?,"As if we need another reason to love chocolate, a Harvard study suggests that eating the sweet treat is tied to lower risks of diabetes. But the particular type of chocolate matters, according to the findings published Dec. 7, 2024, in The BMJ. Scientists evaluated the self-reported dietary and health information of about 112,000 healthy middle-aged people who were followed for more than 30 years. Compared with people who rarely or never ate chocolate, those who had at least five ounces of dark chocolate each week had a 21% lower risk of developing diabetes. There were no significant diabetes risk reductions among people who ate milk chocolate. In fact, that treat was tied to weight gain, which can eventually boost diabetes risk. What's the magic of dark chocolate? Even though it has about the same amount of saturated fat and calories as milk chocolate, dark chocolate is lower in sugar and much richer in flavanols — plant chemicals known to have health benefits, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, plus cardiometabolic perks — changes that help your body pump blood and use food for energy. The authors suspect that the flavanols might offset the effects of dark chocolate's fat and sugar content, although more research is needed to confirm this.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/is-it-time-for-a-cpap-checkup,Is it time for a CPAP checkup?,"Ever since your obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis, you've tried to use your continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine faithfully each night. Hopefully, it has restored your ability to sleep without snoring, coughing, choking, or suffering dozens of pauses in breathing per hour. And perhaps it helps you feel more alert, awake, and productive, and has begun to lower the risk of dangerous consequences related to sleep apnea, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and depression.
        But the gentle hum of the CPAP device doesn't guarantee that the therapy is working effectively; like a sensitive medication regimen, it needs to be assessed and monitored regularly.
        What is CPAP therapy?
        CPAP therapy prevents your upper airways from being blocked by throat muscles that relax too much during sleep. The therapy involves a small bedside compressor that pumps a forceful stream of air through a tube and into your nose via a mask you wear all night. A standard CPAP machine delivers a fixed air pressure, while an auto-CPAP machine automatically adjusts pressure based on your varying needs throughout the night, such as when you change position or shift into a new sleep stage.
        Your health care provider must prescribe the therapy. You then obtain the system through a medical equipment supplier. A technician from the supplier will work with you to find the right mask, set the specified air pressure settings to keep your airways open without disturbing your sleep, and answer ongoing questions about using the system.
        You can control the temperature and humidity of the air entering the mask. Additionally, you can choose how fast the air pressure increases: ""You can set it to ramp up over five minutes or 45 minutes, or select the 'auto-ramp' setting and have the machine adjust the pace automatically based on your breathing,"" explains Dr. Karen Lee, a neurologist and sleep medicine specialist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        Initial check-ups
        For CPAP therapy to be covered by insurance, you're required to see your health care provider 30 to 90 days after you start using the system. ""The clinician always needs to ensure that the CPAP has improved and hopefully resolved your sleep issues,"" Dr. Lee says, ""and what can be complicated is that you may not be aware of some of your sleep issues. For example, sleep apnea often increases the frequency of nighttime urinations, grinding or clenching your teeth, and night sweats. The clinician needs to ask appropriate questions to understand if your sleep is optimized while using CPAP.""
        At your first check-up, your provider will review data that the machine has been collecting. ""The machine tells us when you're using the device and estimates how many apnea episodes you're having per hour, when you're struggling to breathe, and whether air is leaking out your mouth or around the mask unintentionally,"" Dr. Lee says.
        Based on that information and your own observations, your clinician might prescribe a higher or lower air pressure. You might need to go back for additional visits and adjustments until the kinks are ironed out, which can take a few months. You may even require an overnight study in the sleep lab while using CPAP to help clarify any issues.
        
          
            
              
                All PAP therapies need regular evaluation
                Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is just one type of positive airway pressure (PAP). Other types include
                
                  auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP), which provides a range of preset pressures throughout the night
                  bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), which provides two different preset pressures — a more powerful one when you inhale and a less powerful one when you exhale
                  adaptive servo ventilation (ASV), an advanced device that provides pressure based on breathing patterns throughout the night.
                
                All these therapies need periodic assessment to determine how well they're working and whether the settings need adjustment.
              
            
          
        
        Additional check-ups
        Once the CPAP system is working for you, you'll need to have it re-evaluated at least once a year to see if the air pressure needs to be adjusted. These continuing follow-up appointments are important for many reasons.
        Data updates. Dr. Lee says that CPAP machines provide only estimated information, which sometimes is inaccurate. She needs to compare it with insights from a patient visit to determine if the CPAP really is helping.
        Worsening sleep apnea. Everything sags as we get older, even the airway, which causes the disease to advance over time.
        Weight loss or gain. Gaining weight can make sleep apnea worse; losing weight can make it better or even make it disappear. Either could potentially affect the pressure settings.
        Treatment side effects. Dr. Lee says that the brain sometimes reacts to CPAP in a way that creates another type of apnea. In that case, the settings or the actual device would need to be changed.
        Other sleep issues. ""We need to make sure all of your sleep needs are being addressed,"" Dr. Lee says, ""especially if you have other sleep disorders such as insomnia, restless legs syndrome, or sleepiness, despite effective CPAP treatment.""
        Missed check-ups
        Unfortunately, many people don't get regular CPAP check-ups. If you're among them, it could be that your clinician never told you that you need periodic assessments. ""While any health care provider can prescribe the therapy, they don't all know how to adjust it optimally or that they should evaluate it regularly,"" Dr. Lee says.
        Or you might not be getting CPAP check-ups because
        
          you feel better and don't think you need additional assessments
          you don't think the therapy is effective and have given up on it
          your schedule is too hectic
          you assume (mistakenly) that the medical equipment supplier is monitoring your health.
        
        When to call the expert
        If you've never had your CPAP use evaluated or haven't done so in a long time, Dr. Lee advises making an appointment with a sleep specialist or with the expert who prescribed the therapy.
        Dr. Lee also recommends calling your clinician any time new health problems or symptoms affect sleep. ""Come see me if you start snoring again or you're tired despite using the machine,"" she says. ""If you have questions, they need to be asked.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/shining-a-light-on-the-diabetesheart-disease-connection,Shining a light on the diabetes–heart disease connection,"If you have diabetes, you're twice as likely to have a heart attack or stroke than someone without diabetes — even if you keep your blood sugar under control most of the time. In fact, recent research suggests this elevated cardiovascular risk is present as early as 30 years prior to a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (see ""Higher heart risks before diabetes detection""). Typically diagnosed after age 45, type 2 diabetes accounts for more than 90% of diabetes cases in the United States.
        The new findings support the long-held observation of the shared underlying causes of diabetes and heart disease, says Dr. Deborah Wexler, chief of the Diabetes Unit at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""It's known as the common soil hypothesis, which dates back to the mid-1990s,"" she says. The ""soil"" refers to risk factors that contribute to both conditions—especially the tendency to accumulate fat in the middle of the body. Also known as visceral or abdominal obesity, this problem typically occurs in tandem with high blood pressure, unhealthy lipid levels, and elevated blood sugar. This cluster of signs and symptoms is also known as metabolic syndrome, says Dr. Wexler.
        
          
            
              
                Higher heart risks before diabetes detection
                Does the elevated risk of cardiovascular problems seen in people with diabetes occur even before their diabetes is first discovered?
                To find out, researchers used data from the Danish national health registry to track the incidence of heart disease in the 30 years before and five years after a diabetes diagnosis. The study included 127,092 people diagnosed with diabetes between 2010 and 2015. Researchers compared them to a control group of 381,023 people matched by age and sex who weren't diagnosed with diabetes. Their median age was 62, and 54% were men.
                Over the 30-year period, the incidence of heart attacks and stroke was 11.2% in people who would eventually be diagnosed with diabetes, compared to 4.7% among people without diabetes. This doubled risk of cardiovascular problems persisted during the five years following a diabetes diagnosis. The study was published Dec. 3, 2024, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
              
            
          
        
        A diabetes primer
        In type 2 diabetes, the body is often resistant to insulin, the hormone made by the pancreas that enables cells throughout the body to absorb glucose (sugar) for energy. As a result, muscle, fat, and liver cells can't easily absorb glucose from the blood, causing blood sugar levels to rise. In response, the pancreas tries to keep up with the demand by churning out more insulin. But over time, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas falter, leading to prediabetes and eventually diabetes.
        Belly fat, which makes hormones and other substances that trigger chronic inflammation, is a common hallmark of insulin resistance. Another is physical inactivity. Exercise makes your body more sensitive to insulin and builds muscle, which absorbs blood glucose.
        While a poor diet and being sedentary clearly contribute to diabetes, genetic factors play a role as well. Having one parent with diabetes translates to a 40% lifetime risk of the disease; if both parents are affected, that risk rises to 70%, according to some estimates. Still, people with a high genetic risk can prevent diabetes with healthy habits, says Dr. Wexler. ""In a study that included identical twins at risk, the twin who maintained a healthy weight did not get diabetes, but the one who gained weight did,"" she says.
        More diabetes prevention tips
        The 2025 Standards of Care in Diabetes from the American Diabetes Association includes several updates targeted to lifestyle changes for people with diabetes, such as a recommendation to do strength training (such as lifting weights or using resistance bands) two to three times per week. The benefits include preventing muscle loss and improving insulin sensitivity and overall metabolism.
        One diet-related tip encourages drinking water instead of beverages sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners. Another is a recommendation to eat more plant-based protein and fiber—a common refrain for heart-healthy eating (see ""The portfolio diet: A smart investment for your heart"" in the February 2024 Heart Letter).
        Beyond blood sugar control
        People with diabetes tend to focus on keeping their blood sugar values within range. That's important because uncontrolled high blood sugar can damage tiny blood vessels throughout the body, causing vision problems, nerve damage, and kidney disease. ""But most people don't realize that the leading cause of death in diabetes is cardiovascular disease,"" says Dr. Wexler. Doctors have long encouraged aggressive treatment of heart-related risk factors for people with diabetes — namely, keeping blood pressure and cholesterol levels in a healthy range and quitting smoking. Over the past decade, though, two new classes of drugs, SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, have emerged that not only lower blood sugar but also reduce heart-related risks (see ""Diabetes drugs with proven heart benefits"").
        Major medical societies, including the American College of Cardiology, recommend these drugs in people with type 2 diabetes who either have or are at high risk of heart disease, regardless of their A1c level, says Dr. Wexler. (The A1c test, commonly used for monitoring diabetes, provides a three-month average measure of blood sugar. Levels of 6.5% or higher are classified as diabetes.)
        Both classes of medications are underused, although the use of the GLP-1 drugs (especially semaglutide) in people with diabetes has risen in recent years. Taken weekly by self-injection, semaglutide and tirzepatide can lead to dramatic weight loss, although they may cause nausea and can be expensive, even with insurance coverage. (Both drugs are prescribed in different formulations for weight loss: semaglutide under the name Wegovy, and tirzepatide under the name Zepbound.) Cardiologists and nephrologists (who treat kidney disease) may be more comfortable prescribing SGLT-2 inhibitors, which are taken in pill form and have been around for more than a decade now, Dr. Wexler notes. Both semaglutide and SGLT-2 inhibitors have kidney benefits for people with chronic kidney disease.
        
          
            
              
                Diabetes drugs with proven heart benefits
                
                  SGLT-2 inhibitors include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance). Taken in pill form, they cause the kidneys to release more sugar into the urine. This not only lowers blood sugar but also dumps those excess calories, leading to modest weight loss and slightly lower blood pressure.
                  GLP-1 receptor agonists include dulaglutide (Trulicity), liraglutide (Victoza), semaglutide (Ozempic; also available in pill form as Rybelsus), and tirzepatide (Mounjaro). These injectable medications mimic a naturally occurring hormone that prods your pancreas to release more insulin, which lowers blood sugar. Tirzepatide, which mimics both GLP-1 and another hormone called GIP, works in a similar fashion. Studies of tirzepatide's cardiovascular effects are in process, but one study showed tirzepatide was beneficial for people with obesity and a common form of heart failure.
                
              
            
          
        
        The bottom line
        If you have diabetes, ask your physician whether you should add one of these drugs to your current medication regimen. If you don't, follow your physician's advice regarding when and how often you should be screened for diabetes. For people who are overweight, the latest guidelines suggest screening every three years starting at age 35.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/lipoproteina-an-update-on-testing-and-treatment,Lipoprotein(a): An update on testing and treatment,"A fatty particle that circulates in the bloodstream, lipoprotein(a) is similar to LDL cholesterol but more dangerous. High levels of Lp(a), as it is commonly called, can double or even triple a person's risk of a heart attack. It's considered a common culprit in heart disease that occurs at a young age. So why do so few people know about it?
        Until recently, most guidelines didn't recommend testing for Lp(a) — but with good reason. Your genes determine your Lp(a) value. Eating and exercise habits have virtually no effect on the levels in your bloodstream. Plus, there were no effective treatments to lower Lp(a), which also elevates the risk of stroke and aortic stenosis (a thickened, stiff aortic valve).
        Now, with five promising therapies to lower Lp(a) in development, the landscape is changing. Here's the latest advice and information about Lp(a).
        Lp(a) testing trends
        International consensus groups recommend one-time Lp(a) testing for everyone. In Europe, such testing is routine. But in the United States, the first official endorsement for Lp(a) testing didn't appear until 2024, from the National Lipid Association.

                    Managing Your Cholesterol offers up-to-date information to help you or a loved one keep cholesterol in check. The report spells out what are healthy and unhealthy cholesterol levels, and offers specific ways to keep cholesterol in line. It covers cholesterol tests and the genetics of cholesterol. The report also focuses on treatments based on the latest scientific evidence, including the pros and cons of statins and other medications, and provides the lowdown on other substances advertised to lower cholesterol. Managing Your Cholesterol can also help you work with your doctor to individualize your treatment.

""Recent data show that only 0.3% of people received Lp(a) screening between 2012 and 2019,"" says Harvard Medical School associate professor Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Also, about half of those tests were ordered by a very small number of health care providers, she adds.
        But Lp(a) testing should soon become more widespread, for several reasons. First, the tests are now covered by most insurers in most states. Second, even though targeted therapies to lower Lp(a) are not yet on the market, people with high levels (see ""Lp(a) readings: Check the units"") may benefit from more intensive treatment to manage their overall risk of heart disease, says Dr. O'Donoghue. ""This may include taking cholesterol-lowering drugs like statins, even if your LDL cholesterol is normal,"" she says. Low-dose aspirin is also being investigated as a possible therapy for preventing heart attacks in people with high Lp(a).
        
          
            
              
                Lp(a) readings: Check the units
                Labs report lipoprotein(a) values in two different units. The preferred method is nanomoles per liter (nmol/L), but many labs still use milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Currently, there's no universal consensus on what constitutes an abnormal Lp(a) level, but the thresholds shown below are commonly used.

        A one-time test?
        Unlike LDL, which rises with age and is influenced by diet and exercise, Lp(a) remains largely constant over a person's lifetime, so a one-time test suffices for screening. However, researchers are working to better understand changes that may occur in Lp(a) in women around the time of menopause and for men and women with certain medical conditions. The following groups of people are specifically recommended for testing:
        
          people with premature cardiovascular disease, defined as those who've had a heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or aortic stenosis before age 55 (for men) or 65 (for women)
          people who have a father, mother, sister, or brother with premature cardiovascular disease
          people with very high LDL cholesterol (190 mg/dL or higher)
          close relatives (siblings, children, and parents) of anyone with an elevated Lp(a) level.
        
        Therapies to lower Lp(a)
        Most of the drugs in development for lowering Lp(a) work by interfering with RNA, the molecule that copies and transfers genetic instructions from DNA, the cell's genetic blueprint. Currently, there are four RNA-based drugs that effectively silence the gene that makes Lp(a) in liver cells: lepodisiran, olpasiran, pelacarsen, and zerlasiran. All are administered by injection every one to six months and have been shown to lower Lp(a) levels 80% and 100%. The side effects appear to be limited to mild, short-lived pain at the injection site. Larger, longer trials looking at whether these drugs will help prevent heart-related problems are currently under way, with results expected within the next one to two years, says Dr. O'Donoghue, who is a lead investigator on the clinical trials of olpasiran.

Preliminary results also look promising for another experimental drug called muvalapin, which works by preventing the assembly of the Lp(a) particle. Like the RNA-based drugs, muvalapin also leads to dramatic drops in Lp(a), but it is taken as a daily pill. Side effects include headache, back pain, and fatigue. While some people prefer pills over shots, injectable drugs have the advantage of much less frequent dosing, Dr. O'Donoghue notes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-simple-ways-to-improve-gut-health,5 simple ways to improve gut health,"Gut health is an easy thing to take for granted — or to ignore completely, if everything is generally functioning well. But poor gut health can impact your overall health in a variety of ways, from the obvious (stomach discomfort) to less obvious effects on mood and immune function.
        Why gut health matters
        People are talking about gut health and their microbiome more than they used to, but if it's not something that comes up around your dinner table, here are some basics.
        When people talk about their gut microbiome, they're referring to all the microorganisms (both good and bad) living in your gastrointestinal tract (primarily your large intestine). Most people have hundreds — or even thousands — of different species of bacteria, viruses, and fungi living in their gut.
        Gut diversity is important because different microorganisms may help support health in a variety of ways, including:
        
          improved digestion and nutrient absorption
          immune-system regulation
          protection against harmful bacteria
          reduced inflammation
          better brain health.
        
        Plus, a healthy and diverse gut microbiome may help reduce your risk of conditions including diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, some cancers, GI disorders, and cardiovascular disease.
        Five keys to a happy gut
        The good news is that you can take steps to support a healthy gut microbiome.
        1. Add more fiber to your diet
        Fiber serves as a prebiotic, or food for the good bacteria that live in your gut. Eating plenty of fiber is associated with increased microbial diversity and a reduced risk of gastrointestinal issues like constipation and Crohn's disease. Fiber helps keep the colon healthy by reducing inflammation; it also helps keep you regular.
        However, most of us don't get enough fiber. Aim to get 21 to 38 grams of fiber per day. Fiber is found in a variety of foods including legumes, whole grains, avocados, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, tofu, berries, leafy greens, and nuts and seeds.
        2. Stay hydrated
        Water is critical for healthy digestion. It helps your body absorb and transport nutrients; it helps with keeping your core body temperature steady; it aids in the production of mucus to protect your digestive tract; and it helps prevent constipation. When you become constipated, your gut microbiota changes, becoming less abundant. If you become dehydrated, your body will let you know, as not drinking enough can manifest as thirst, headache, dry mouth, less frequent urination, dizziness, and tiredness. So drink up — around four to six cups per day for most people.
        3. Manage stress
        Increased stress often manifests itself in digestive discomfort. Stress causes hormones like adrenaline and cortisol to spike, leading to symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. This gut-brain connection is powerful; it's why we get butterflies before a big presentation, or feel nauseous when we're in a high-stakes situation. And while we can't avoid stressful situations entirely, it's possible to learn to manage stress through techniques like belly breathing, relaxation therapy, and meditation.
        4. Get enough sleep
        Healthier gut, better sleep? Perhaps, according to research published in Frontiers in Microbiology, which found that certain bacteria in your gut may impact your sleep in a variety of ways, from your likelihood of experiencing insomnia, to how frequently you need to nap, to how long you stay asleep at night. Most people should aim to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night. If you're struggling to hit that goal, try improving your sleep hygiene, getting plenty of daytime exercise, and trying some of the stress management tips above.
        5. Stay physically active
        It's not hard to find good reasons tostay active, but here's one more: According to a systematic review published in Nutrients, participating in 150 to 270 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity exercise per week for at least six weeks has a positive effect on your gut microbiota, particularly if you combine aerobic exercise with resistance training. We already know that people who are sedentary have different gut microbiota characteristics than active people; this research suggests that you might be able to improve your gut health through exercise even if you're not currently active.",Lindsay Warner,"February 20, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/practical-tips-and-simple-exercises-to-prevent-neck-pain,Practical tips and simple exercises to prevent neck pain,"Neck pain is a common problem that affects people of all ages, often disrupting daily life. Thankfully, many cases of neck pain can be avoided with some simple lifestyle changes and targeted exercises.
        Common causes of neck pain
        Everyday stressors on the neck are often enough to trigger discomfort. Common culprits include:
        
          Poor posture. Sitting or standing with your head and shoulders forward puts extra strain on your neck muscles.
          Extended screen time. Looking down at phones, tablets, or computer screens for long periods can cause ""tech neck.""
          Inadequate sleep support. Using a pillow that's too high or too flat may lead to neck stiffness.
          Stress and tension. Emotional stress can cause you to unconsciously tighten your neck and shoulder muscles.
          Repetitive movements. Jobs or activities that involve repetitive motions can strain the neck over time.
        
        Adjustments to alleviate these stressors can often prevent neck pain that could result from them.
        Ergonomic adjustments to keep neck pain at bay
        Ergonomics is the science of designing tools, spaces, and tasks in a way that reduces strain on the body. Making simple ergonomic changes to your workspace and daily activities can significantly reduce neck strain. Consider these tips:
        
          Adjust your screen height. Position your computer monitor at eye level so you don't have to look up or down. Portable laptop stands or laptop desks can elevate your laptop to a more ergonomic height and angle, whether you're sitting on a couch, lounging in bed, or working at a desk or table.
          Use a headset. Avoid cradling your phone between your ear and shoulder by using a headset, earbuds, headphones, or a speakerphone.
          Support your lower back. Sit in a chair with good lumbar support, or use a small pillow to maintain the natural curve of your spine.
          Keep your feet flat. Ensure your feet are flat on the floor while sitting, with your knees at a 90-degree angle.
          Take regular breaks. Every 30 minutes, stand up, stretch, or move around to avoid stiffness.
        
        For personalized recommendations, consult a physical or occupational therapist who can evaluate your posture and body mechanics and teach you how to perform work tasks, household chores, and recreational activities in a way that minimizes neck strain.
        Mind your posture to prevent neck pain
        How you carry yourself can either prevent or contribute to neck pain. To avoid strain, aim to keep your head in a neutral position, balanced directly over your spine. This reduces stress on your neck muscles, which support the weight of your head (around 10 to 12 pounds). Tilting your head forward, even slightly, can dramatically increase the load on your neck, leading to a painful condition often referred to as ""text neck.""
        Beyond the head and neck, the posture of your entire body plays a crucial role in preventing neck discomfort. Here are some additional posture tips to incorporate into your routine.
        
          Keep your body in proper alignment. When standing or sitting, keep your ears directly over your shoulders to avoid forward head posture. When standing or walking, proper alignment means that, from a side view, an imaginary straight line can pass through your ear, shoulder, hip, knee, and ankle.
          Don't forget your shoulders. Keep your shoulders level and aligned — not pulled back or slouched forward. Relax your shoulders by rolling them back and down to prevent tension from building up.
          Engage your core. A strong core supports your upper body and helps maintain good posture. When standing or walking, actively engage your core. One way to do this is by imagining that you are preparing to counter a push from the front, side, or back.
        
        Practicing good posture may feel awkward at first, but over time it may become second nature.
        Neck-friendly modifications for exercise and hobbies
        Growing research shows that targeted exercises — and regular physical activity overall — can aid in disrupting persistent neck pain and promote faster recovery from neck injuries. But certain exercises and hobbies can inadvertently strain your neck if done incorrectly. To protect your neck:
        
          Use ergonomic tools when gardening. Opt for tools with long handles to minimize bending and straining your neck. It can also help to regularly stand up, stretch, and change positions to prevent prolonged neck strain.
          Maintain good posture and wear supportive gear while running or walking. Keep your head balanced over your spine, avoid leaning forward, and relax your shoulders to reduce neck strain. Wear supportive shoes to minimize impact and reduce the risk of neck discomfort.
          Modify your bicycling position. Opt for a bicycle with upright handlebars to maintain a more comfortable neck position. Keep your shoulder blades down and back. Alternatively, consider a recumbent bike, which allows you to sit in a reclined position with back support and legs extended forward, reducing strain on your neck and back.
        
        Stretching exercises to prevent neck pain
        Performing neck stretches can alleviate muscle tightness and maintain or enhance your neck's range of motion. Here are some easy stretches to try.
        
          Neck tilts. Sit or stand upright. Slowly tilt your head toward your right shoulder, holding for 10 to 15 seconds. Return to center and repeat on the left side. Repeat five times on each side.
          Chin tucks and extensions. While sitting or standing, gently tuck your chin toward your chest and hold for 10 seconds. Then gently extend your neck to look upward for 10 seconds. Repeat five times.
          Side-to-side rotations. Turn your head to look over your right shoulder, hold for 10 seconds, then switch to the left. Repeat five times on each side.
          Shoulder rolls. Roll your shoulders forward five times, then backward five times, in a circular motion to release tension.
        
        You should experience a gentle stretch — but not feel pain — when you engage in these stretches.
        When to see a doctor
        If you experience persistent or severe pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in your neck, shoulders, or arms, it's time to consult a doctor. These symptoms could indicate a more serious condition, such as a pinched nerve, herniated disc, or underlying illness. If neck pain is accompanied by fever, unexplained weight loss, or difficulty moving, seek immediate medical attention.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","February 19, 2025"

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-products-that-claim-to-stop-snoring-actually-work,Do products that claim to stop snoring actually work?,"Snoring is more than an annoying nighttime quirk; it's an issue that can affect your relationships, sleep quality, and health. Fortunately, certain lifestyle changes and products can help you manage this common problem.
        What causes snoring?
        Snoring occurs when airflow through the mouth and nose is partially blocked during sleep. The blockage causes the surrounding tissues to vibrate and produce sound — snoring.
        Various factors can narrow the airway and cause snoring, including relaxed throat muscles or a backward-slipping tongue. Here are some common factors that make snoring more likely:
        
          being overweight, which adds extra tissue around the neck that compresses the airways
          nasal issues like a deviated septum
          
            nasal polyps
          
          congestion from colds or allergies
          structural features, such as a long soft palate or uvula (the back part of the roof of your mouth), or swollen tonsils or adenoids
          poor muscle tone due to aging
          alcohol and certain medications that allow the airway to collapse more easily.
        
        In some cases, snoring may indicate sleep apnea, a serious condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. You can read more about sleep apnea below.
        Anti-snoring products
        Anti-snoring products, such as oral appliances or positional aids, can reduce snoring when used correctly. These devices most often work by helping to keep your airway open during sleep. This reduces the vibrations that cause snoring.
        Anti-snoring devices are often self-administered. If a device doesn't alleviate your snoring, your doctor can help you explore other treatment options and address any underlying causes.
        Positional aids
        Research shows that sleeping on your side (rather than on your back) can significantly reduce both the intensity and duration of snoring in many individuals without sleep apnea. For some people, positional aids that encourage side sleeping are a practical and low-cost way to reduce snoring.
        Positional aids can range from tennis balls sewn into the back of sleepwear to specialized devices that prompt your body to change position. Specialized vests, pillows, and alarms are examples of positional aids that can help snorers who struggle to maintain a side-sleeping posture.
        A literature review published in Sleep & Breathing found the effectiveness of positional aids varies from product to product. For example, vests with inflatable chambers were found to reduce snoring rates by more than half in positional-dependent snorers. Wedge pillows also significantly decreased snoring. On the other hand, wearable alarm devices that alerted snorers if they were sleeping on their back did not lead to significant improvement in snoring frequency.
        Researchers found that some users did not use the devices long-term because of issues with discomfort. Despite mixed findings, positional aids remain a low-risk option worth trying for snorers, especially those who notice improvements when sleeping on their side.
        Oral appliances
        Oral appliances work by keeping the airway open during sleep. These appliances fit over the teeth like retainers, and work by repositioning the jaw or holding the tongue forward to prevent airway obstruction.
        Oral appliances can improve sleep quality for both the user and their bed partner. When prescribed by a doctor and fitted by a dentist, these devices can be a comfortable and effective solution to address chronic snoring. (You can also purchase over-the-counter ""boil and bite"" oral appliances that you mold yourself.)
        While oral appliances can be effective, they are not without potential drawbacks. Some users experience temporary side effects such as drooling or jaw discomfort. And long-term use may lead to issues like changes in bite alignment. However, many people adjust to these devices with minimal discomfort, especially when they are properly fitted and regularly monitored by a dentist.
        Devices
        A relatively new device, called eXciteOSA, was approved by the FDA to reduce snoring and mild sleep apnea. The device is worn in the mouth and used while awake. It helps snoring by strengthening tongue muscles to prevent airway obstruction during sleep. It works by delivering gentle electrical stimulation through a mouthpiece with electrodes positioned above and below the tongue.
        In a clinical trial, users completed daily 20-minute sessions for six weeks, followed by weekly maintenance sessions. The trial showed improvements in the severity of sleep apnea as well as the percent of time spent snoring loudly. Side effects included excessive salivation, gagging, and tongue discomfort.
        Lifestyle changes to reduce snoring
        Reducing snoring frequency and intensity does not necessarily require spending money on a device. Some (free) lifestyle changes may help you reduce snoring.
        
          Avoid alcohol. Refrain from drinking alcohol within three hours of bedtime to prevent airway muscles from relaxing excessively during sleep.
          Maintain a healthy weight. Losing weight can decrease the amount of tissue in the neck and throat, reducing airway obstruction.
          Address nasal issues. Use saline rinses for a stuffy nose, minimize allergens in your bedroom, and consider a humidifier or medication for swollen nasal tissues.
          Quit smoking. Smoking irritates and inflames the upper airway, increasing the likelihood of snoring. Even exposure to secondhand smoke can contribute to the problem.
          Adjust sleeping position. Sleep on your side to prevent your tongue from blocking your airway. Try a body pillow, or sew a tennis ball to the back of your sleepwear to stay off your back.
          Elevate your head. Use extra pillows, a wedge pillow, or elevate the head of your bed to improve airflow.
        
        These strategies can help with simple snoring. But if symptoms like gasping, nighttime awakenings, or daytime sleepiness persist, consult a doctor to check for sleep apnea.
        Could your snoring be a sign of sleep apnea?
        Snoring can sometimes be a warning sign of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a sleep disorder that causes people to repeatedly stop breathing for short periods during sleep. Other signs and symptoms of sleep apnea include excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, morning headaches, or waking up feeling unrefreshed.
        It's important to see a doctor if you (or your bed partner) suspect you have sleep apnea. Untreated sleep apnea can lead to high blood pressure, putting a strain on the cardiovascular system, and other health concerns.
        To determine if snoring is a sign of sleep apnea, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. They may check for physical factors like a narrowed airway, a large neck circumference, or elevated blood pressure, all of which can indicate a higher risk of OSA.
        When doctors suspect sleep apnea, they typically recommended a sleep study to confirm the diagnosis. While sleep studies were once conducted exclusively in overnight labs, home-based sleep studies are now widely available and can provide sufficient data for diagnosis in many cases.",Jenette Restivo,"February 13, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/how-to-know-if-your-bones-are-thinning,How to know if your bones are thinning,"We often think of broken bones as something kids get from playground adventures, but as we grow older, our bones face a different challenge. Over time, they can lose density and strength, making them more vulnerable to fractures — a condition known as osteoporosis.
        This silent disease develops gradually, often without symptoms, until a sudden fall or fracture brings it to light. The good news? Advances in diagnostic tools now make it easier than ever to detect osteoporosis early and take action to protect your bone health.
        Several technologies can assess bone density. The most common bone density test is known as dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). For this procedure, a machine sends x-rays through bones in order to calculate bone density. The process is quick, taking only five minutes. And it's simple: you lie on a table while a scanner passes over your body.
        While DEXA can measure bone density at any spot in the body, it is usually used to measure bone density at the lumbar spine (in the lower back), hip (a specific site in the hip near the hip joint), and femoral neck (the top of the thighbone, or femur). The test accomplishes this with only one-tenth of the radiation exposure of a standard chest x-ray.
        While DEXA is considered the gold standard for osteoporosis screening, another bone density test is ultrasound. In ultrasound, sound waves measure bone mineral density at the heel, shin, or finger. The test is sometimes used at health fairs and in some medical offices.
        The DEXA scan or ultrasound will give you a number called a T-score, which represents how close you are to average peak bone density. The World Health Organization has established the following classification system for bone density:
        
          If your T-score is –1 or greater: your bone density is considered normal.
          If your T-score is between –1 and –2.5: you have low bone density, known as osteopenia, but not osteoporosis.
          If your T-score is –2.5 or less: you have osteoporosis, even if you haven't yet broken a bone.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/carotid-ultrasound-carotid-doppler-a-to-z,Carotid ultrasound (carotid Doppler),"What is the test?
        Ultrasound uses sound waves instead of radiation to generate snapshots or moving pictures of structures inside the body. This imaging technique works in a manner similar to radar and sonar, developed in World War II to detect airplanes, missiles, and submarines that were otherwise invisible.
        After coating a small area of your skin with a lubricant to reduce friction, a radiologist or ultrasound technician places an ultrasound transducer, which looks like a microphone, on your skin and may rub it back and forth to get the right view. The transducer sends sound waves into your body and picks up the echoes of the sound waves as they bounce off internal organs and tissue. A computer transforms these echoes into an image that is displayed on a monitor.
        Doppler ultrasound is a variation of this technique that not only shows internal structures but also examines the flow of blood through blood vessels. Using the Doppler effect—the change in the frequency of sound or light waves as they bounce off a moving object—this kind of ultrasound produces an image of blood in motion.
        A carotid ultrasound shows the amount of blood flow in the carotid arteries, the major blood vessels to the brain located on either side of your neck. With this imaging technique, your doctor can see if there is any narrowing of your carotid arteries because of cholesterol deposits or some other problem. This test is often used to evaluate people who have had a stroke or who might be at high risk for one because of reduced blood flow in the carotid arteries.
        How do I prepare for the test?
        No preparation is necessary.
        What happens when the test is performed?
        After squirting some clear jelly onto one side of your neck to help the ultrasound sensor slide around easily, a technician places the sensor against your skin. An image then appears on a video screen. As the technician moves the sensor back and forth on your neck, different views of the carotid artery appear on the screen. As the equipment measures the blood flow through the artery, you hear a noise that sounds like your heartbeat. The other side of your neck is checked in the same way. This test usually takes 15 to 30 minutes.
        What risks are there from the test?
        There are no risks.
        Must I do anything special after the test is over?
        No.
        How long is it before the result of the test is known?
        The technician records the test on videotape for review by a radiologist. The radiologist then makes measurements from the video picture and submits a report to your doctor. Your doctor should have the results within a few days.",Unknown,"February 3, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/new-clues-about-broken-heart-syndrome,"New clues about ""broken heart"" syndrome","As the name suggests, ""broken heart"" syndrome can arise in response to grief and other intense emotions. The symptoms — which include sudden, squeezing chest pain and shortness of breath — mimic those of a heart attack.
        However, this often reversible but potentially serious condition is more commonly precipitated by physical stress caused by severe illness or surgery. Most cases of the syndrome occur in women. But the proportion of cases recognized in men has risen in recent decades, according to a study published Sept. 24, 2024, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
        The findings come from an international registry of nearly 4,000 people who were diagnosed with the condition between 2004 and 2021. The registry uses the original (and now preferred) term: takotsubo syndrome, which was coined by the Japanese physicians who first described it in the early 1990s. During an episode, the heart takes on an unusual shape that resembles a tako-tsubo (octopus pot), a traditional clay vessel a fisher-man uses to trap an octopus.
        The new report provides a more modern view of takotsubo syndrome, says Dr. Michael Osborne, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""It shows the diversity of possible causes and presentations of takotsubo syndrome and gives us a better sense of how people may be affected,"" he says. For example, men now make up 15% of cases — up from 10% in 2004. But this shift and other changes may stem from increased awareness and diagnoses rather than an actual change in the demographic, he adds.
        Takotsubo triggers
        Over the years, the recording of physical triggers for takotsubo syndrome rose from 39% to 58% of cases. They included serious medical conditions such as stroke, surgery, infection, cancer, and injuries. About one-third of all cases were attributed to emotional triggers, most of which stemmed from either grief or loss, anger or frustration, or interpersonal conflicts. But a small number were spurred by positive events, a phenomenon dubbed ""happy heart syndrome"" that, for unknown reasons, was mainly seen in men, says Dr. Osborne. Causes reported in these cases included weddings, surprise parties, and the birth of a grandchild.
        All of these triggers activate the body's fight-or-flight response, prompting an outpouring of stress hormones such as adrenaline. ""This surge of hormones stuns the heart's microscopic vessels, limiting blood flow to part of the heart,"" explains Dr. Osborne. This insult may temporarily alter the shape of the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber. Usually, the bottom tip of the heart balloons outward while the top narrows, creating the shape of an octopus pot. But sometimes, the midsection of the ventricle swells instead, creating a shape more akin to an amphora, an ancient Greek vase. The prevalence of this less-common heart shape increased from 18% to 28% over the registry's study period.
        Most people fully recover within weeks to months. But the registry data suggest that those who also have other serious health conditions face a higher risk of dying within two months after a takotsubo syndrome diagnosis.
        Diagnosing the problem
        Doctors start their evaluation with an electrocardiogram (ECG), a test that records the heart's electrical activity. The ECG may show abnormalities typical of heart muscle injury, which can occur from either a heart attack or takotsubo syndrome. Both conditions can also cause a rise in blood levels of troponin, a protein released from damaged heart muscle.
        A coronary angiogram (a dye-enhanced x-ray of the heart's arteries) may be done to check for a blockage that would indicate a heart attack. But in takotsubo syndrome, the heart's arteries are clear. A heart ultrasound (echocardiogram) can reveal the characteristic change in the heart's shape to confirm the diagnosis.
        Mending a broken heart
        Treating takotsubo syndrome often includes blood pressure drugs, including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and beta blockers, which help lower the heart's workload and tamp down the body's stress response.
        There's no direct evidence that stress reduction can prevent takotsubo syndrome or its recurrence. But many clues suggest practices such as meditation and deep breathing can help by modifying activity in brain regions that respond to stress, Dr. Osborne says. Other than a small time investment, there are no downsides to practicing stress-busting techniques — and it may lower your risk of other heart-related conditions. Harvard Health Publishing's report Stress Management provides details and advice.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-your-dentist-could-save-your-life,How your dentist could save your life,"""Open wide."" It's our main task when we sit in the dentist's chair, and we might assume our dentist has one job, too — to assess the condition of our teeth.
        But looking for plaque, cavities, and gum disease is only part of the picture. Dentists have a prime vantage point to be the first line of defense in identifying problems all over the body. More than 100 conditions can produce signs in the mouth, according to the American Heart Association, and dental training enables these clinicians to spot telltale clues in the teeth, gums, tongue, palate, lips, jaw, face, and neck.
        ""I think individuals should view their dentists as an indispensable part of their health care team,"" says Dr. Christine Riedy, an associate professor in oral public health and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. ""Some people describe the mouth as the gateway to the body and oral health as the canary in the coal mine. It's true — dentists might see things that can indicate other things happening in the body.""
        A lengthy list of threats
        What conditions can dentists detect, and what signs are they looking for?
        Oral cancer. Rough spots, swelling, bumps, or unexplained bleeding in the mouth might signal head and neck cancers, as do irregularities in the face, lips, jaw, or neck. While head and neck malignancies account for only about 4% of all cancers in the United States, they're more prevalent in older adults. ""Patches of mucosa that are either red or white, as well as lumps or sores, are some of the things dentists would find suspicious,"" Dr. Riedy says. ""Seeing your dentist on a regular basis is really important to pick up those changes."" (See ""Anxiety-busting strategies for visiting the dentist."")
        Diabetes. About 9% of Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes, but an estimated 23% of adults who have the condition don't know it, according to the National Institutes of Health. When sugar levels are elevated in the blood, they're also elevated in saliva. Bacteria in dental plaque feed on that, fueling inflamed and bleeding gums. Diabetes can also lead to dry mouth and infections in the mouth that take longer to heal. ""Some dentists have put HbA1c tests [which measure average blood sugar levels over the past three months] into their screening toolkit to better understand whether a patient has diabetes,"" Dr. Riedy says.
        Sleep apnea. More than a quarter of American adults are believed to have sleep apnea: a pattern of frequent lapses in breathing during sleep, often accompanied by heavy snoring. Untreated, the condition raises risk for serious conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Dentists might suspect sleep apnea if they notice enlargement of the tonsils, tongue, or jaw muscles; a red throat; or signs of teeth grinding. ""Because people with sleep apnea sleep with their mouth open, they can get dry mouth, which also creates an environment for oral disease,"" she says.
        Osteoporosis. Four times as common among older women than men, the progressive loss of bone density characterizing this condition might show up on x-rays of the teeth and jaw. Missing and loose teeth can also be a tip-off. ""With the loss of bone density, the jawbone becomes weaker, and teeth lose their stability,"" Dr. Riedy says.
        Acid reflux. Eroded enamel on back teeth is a major clue someone has acid reflux, and their teeth may also be discolored. ""People may experience heartburn and not realize that gastric acid has actually reached their mouth,"" she says. ""They think it's only centered in the chest.""
        Eating disorders. Surprisingly, Dr. Riedy says, dentists are often the first health care providers to recognize signs of eating disorders, particularly among people who purge by vomiting. Many people with eating disorders — which affect girls and women twice as often as males — engage in binge-purge cycles that don't substantially affect their weight or appearance. ""Outwardly, maybe they don't look like they have an eating disorder, but dentists can see deterioration of the back teeth and enamel erosion due to acid,"" she says.
        
          
            
              
                Anxiety-busting strategies for visiting the dentist
                Dentists can root out our health problems — whether in the mouth or elsewhere — only if we schedule an appointment. But while we're supposed to see our dentist every six months, many people view that recommendation as optional. Only two-thirds of American adults visited a dentist in the past year, according to the CDC.
                Why the low attendance? A big part of it is fear, says Dr. Christine Riedy, an associate professor in oral public health and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. An estimated 15% of people across the world report dental anxiety — women more often than men, according to an April 2023 study in Health Affairs.
                Whether it's pain, needles, or a loss of control, various aspects of dental care might contribute to reluctance to see a dentist. So can an unpleasant encounter in the past or embarrassment about oral health. Some people don't like when a dentist or hygienist leans close to their face. Some worry about how their breath smells.
                But there are ways you can reclaim a calmer frame of mind when you approach the dental chair. Dr. Riedy suggests these strategies:
                Distraction. Listen to music or a podcast through headphones. Some dentists also offer music or videos that help divert your attention. ""Try to focus on something other than what's happening in your mouth,"" she says.
                Relaxation techniques. Meditation can lower stress levels, and ""deep breathing can slow your heart rate and help you get yourself more in control,"" Dr. Riedy says.
                Sedation. Ask your dentist if she can administer medication that calms and relaxes you during treatment, such as nitrous oxide (laughing gas). Some dentists will provide a prescription for an oral sedative you can take at home before your visit, as long as you have someone to drive you.
                Bring a buddy. ""Having someone you trust come with you to the appointment can help reduce some of your anxiety,"" she says.
              
            
          
        
        Maximizing your dental check ups
        If your dentist notices signs of another health problem, she'll likely refer you to your primary care doctor or an appropriate specialist. But you can also make it easier for her to gather as much useful information as possible during dental check-ups.
        ""It may sound basic, but often your dentist will ask if you have any health updates,"" Dr. Riedy says. ""Sharing your health history and any updates can be really important, and asking questions is crucial.""
        It's also essential to voice any health concerns to your dentist, just as you would with your primary care doctor. You may believe a problem with another aspect of your health has nothing to do with your oral health, but you might be wrong. ""Be an advocate for your own care,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/hands-on-approach-to-cardiac-arrest,Hands-on approach to cardiac arrest,"Each year, an estimated 436,000 Americans die from cardiac arrest when the heart abruptly stops beating, causing the person to collapse and stop breathing.
        Immediately performing hands-on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can more than double the victim's odds of survival. CPR does not restart the heart, but the chest compressions can keep blood flowing to the person's brain and other vital organs until they receive emergency medical care.
        New research presented at the American Heart Association (AHA) Resuscitation Science Symposium in November 2024 found that beginning CPR on a person with cardiac arrest within two to 10 minutes improves their chances of survival with intact brain function.
        ""Without CPR, only 10% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims survive, and every minute that goes by, chances of survival decrease by 10%,"" says Dr. Eric Goralnick, associate professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        Helpful hands
        Yet fewer than half of the people who have a cardiac arrest outside a hospital receive CPR from a bystander. The main reason is a lack of CPR training.
        In fact, a recent scientific statement from the AHA found that although many people say they've received CPR training at some point in their lives, few are current on their training. ""All adults should take an in-person CPR class at least once and have a refresher course every two to three years,"" says Dr. Goralnick. ""You could save the life of a family member, friend, or stranger.""
        Currently, the best way to learn CPR is to take a course offered by local chapters of the American Red Cross or the AHA. Classes range from one hour for basic CPR to a full day that includes first aid training.
        Upon completion, participants receive CPR certification. While in-person classes are ideal as they offer hands-on training and direct feedback, online classes also are available, as are blended classes.
        CPR classes also include training with an automatic external defibrillator (AED). An AED is a lightweight, portable device that analyzes a person's heart rhythm. The AED has two sticky pads with sensors that are attached to the person's chest. The sensors send information about the heart's rhythm to a processor in the AED.
        If an abnormal rhythm is detected, the AED can deliver an electric shock through the chest to the heart to restore the rhythm back to normal. ""AEDs are found in many public places, so use them if they are available,"" says Dr. Goralnick.
        ABCs of CPR
        How can you recognize whether a person is suffering cardiac arrest? Look for two key features.
        Nonresponsive. The person does not react if you loudly say ""Are you okay?"" and firmly shake their shoulders. If the person is unresponsive, call 911.
        Not breathing normally. Check if their chest rises and falls or put your face close to their nose and mouth to listen for normal breathing sounds. Labored, irregular breaths that sound like snorting or gasping are signs that the brain is not receiving adequate oxygen. Tell the 911 operator if you can't detect normal breathing.
        About half of 911 operators are trained to provide verbal cues for CPR. Put the phone on speaker so you can begin CPR and continue to receive instructions until emergency medical service (EMS) personnel arrive.
        ""Even if you know CPR, during a crisis, it can be hard to think straight, and you will benefit from expert guidance,"" says Dr. Goralnick. Here are the basics for how to do CPR.
        
          Place the person on their back on the floor and kneel beside them.
          Place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest.
          Place the heel of the other hand on top of the first hand and lace the fingers of your top hand through the fingers of the bottom hand.
          Position your body so your shoulders are directly over your hands.
          Keep your arms straight, push down with your arms and hands, using your body weight to compress the person's chest. Push hard enough to press the chest down at least two inches. Let the chest completely rise before pushing down again.
          Continue pressing the chest hard and fast at a speed of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.
          Continue hands-on CPR until you notice an obvious sign of life or EMS arrives. If possible, enlist another person to take over after a few minutes, as performing the compressions can be tiring.
        
        If you're not sure if someone needs CPR, always err on the side of caution, recommends Dr. Goralnick. ""It's better to do CPR on someone who doesn't need it rather than not do it on someone who does.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/going-vegan-may-help-your-wallet-as-well-as-your-heart,Going vegan may help your wallet as well as your heart,"Both a Mediterranean-style diet and a vegan diet can help stave off heart disease, but the latter is more affordable, according to a small study published Nov. 4. 2024, in JAMA Network Open.
        The study included 62 people randomly assigned to follow a low-fat vegan diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, grains, and beans or a Mediterranean diet, which focused on fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, low-fat dairy, and extra-virgin olive oil. After 16 weeks, they resumed their regular diet for a month before switching to the opposite diet for another 16 weeks. To estimate food costs, researchers relied on participants' diet records, which were linked to a federal database of national food prices based on the consumer price index. On average, the vegan diet cut food costs by 19% compared with a standard American diet that included animal products. The Mediterranean diet was slightly more expensive (about 60 cents more per day) than the standard American diet. Following a vegan diet could save nearly $900 per year compared with a Mediterranean diet, according to the study authors.

But what if you follow a diet free of gluten, the sticky protein found in wheat, rye, and barley?",Julie Corliss,"February 1, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sex-advice-for-people-with-heart-disease,Sex advice for people with heart disease,"A heart attack often triggers a range of emotions, including sadness, worry, and fear. But after the initial shock wears off, people often just want their lives to get back to normal. Yet amid all the advice about how to recover and protect your heart health going forward, there's one topic that seldom comes up: sex.
        ""My patients rarely ask questions about sex, and I have to admit that I usually don't bring up the topic either,"" says Dr. Emily Lau, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. However, cardiovascular disease and its treatment can definitely affect sexual function. In addition, certain medications used to treat common sex-related issues may not be safe for people with heart disease.
        Heart disease's effect on sex
        A buildup of plaque in the arteries (atherosclerosis) is the root cause of most heart attacks. But atherosclerosis can affect arteries throughout the body, including those that supply blood to the genitals. As a result, men may have trouble getting erections, and women may not have the blood flow needed for vaginal arousal and lubrication.
        High blood pressure may also contribute to sexual dysfunction by damaging the inner lining of arteries, which contributes to atherosclerosis. Moreover, common blood pressure drugs sometimes lower sex drive or make it more difficult to reach orgasm in both men and women. Of the different classes of drugs for high blood pressure, beta blockers and thiazide diuretics are most likely to cause sexual side effects, says Dr. Lau. Sexual side effects are less likely with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and calcium-channel blockers. (For common examples of blood pressure drugs in these classes, see /tbpmed.)
        Medication precautions
        For most men with heart disease, drugs to treat erectile dysfunction (ED), including sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil are safe — with one very important exception. ED drugs shouldn't be used by men who take nitrates, which are most commonly used to treat the chest discomfort known as angina. Because both ED drugs and nitrates work by relaxing and widening blood vessels, taking them together can lead to dangerously low blood pressure.
        For women, menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness can interfere with a satisfying sex life. ""Estrogen products can ease these symptoms, but women who have heart disease should avoid systemic estrogen,"" says Dr. Lau. Systemic formulations, which include estrogen pills and skin patches, increase the risk of blood clots, she explains. However, estrogen products applied directly to the vagina (creams, suppositories, and rings) can relieve dryness and discomfort during sex and are safe for women with heart disease, says Dr. Lau. ""Women can safely use these topical products for as long as they need them,"" she adds.
        Sex after a heart condition
        Some couples avoid intimacy after a heart attack because of the fear of having another heart attack during intercourse. But for most people, sex is safe and comparable to other mild- to moderate-intensity activities like brisk walking or climbing up two flights of stairs, says Dr. Lau. If you attend cardiac rehabilitation — ideally starting about a month after your heart attack, as cardiologists strongly recommend — you'll get an exercise stress test. A normal result can provide reassurance for resuming exercise and other activities, including sex, she says. (Also see ""Advice for restoring intimacy after a heart attack."")
        After any procedure that involves threading a catheter up to your heart through a vessel in your upper thigh, wait until the puncture site has fully healed before resuming sex. After open heart surgery, delay sexual activity until your breastbone has healed, usually six to eight weeks. For several months thereafter, avoid any position that puts stress on your chest.
        
          
            
              
                Advice for restoring intimacy after a heart attack
                If you're feeling anxious about your ability to have sex after having a heart attack, here are some suggestions.
                
                  Find a time when you are both rested and relaxed. This may be in the morning or after a nap.
                  Choose a place that's comfortable and familiar, where you won't be interrupted.
                  Don't feel that you need to have energetic sex right away. Cuddling and caressing may be a more comfortable way to start.
                  Talk to your partner about any concerns you have. Be understanding of the emotions that both of you may be experiencing.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/3-stretches-to-relieve-knee-pain,3 stretches to relieve knee pain,"Chronic knee pain often has obvious causes, like arthritis or an old injury. Another culprit is stealthier: tight leg muscles that can contribute to knee discomfort. Fortunately, stretching the muscles can help provide some relief.
        What's the connection?
        Muscles that support the knee (primarily in the legs and hips) need a certain amount of elasticity to work properly. That ""give"" allows the joints to move through their range of motion easily.
        If muscles are tight, they won't stretch as well. ""Like a stiff rubber band that's tough to pull, it takes more force to extend tight muscles. That puts extra pressure on the tendons attaching the muscles to bone, which can lead to pain,"" says Jim Zachazewski, a physical therapist and athletic trainer with Mass General Brigham Sports Medicine.
        For example, if the quadriceps muscles in the thighs are tight, they might pull too hard on the tendon at the kneecap, causing inflammation (tendinitis) and a sore knee.
        Strength matters
        Besides being flexible, leg muscles must be strong to keep the hips, knees, and ankles aligned. ""For example, weak hip and leg muscles can prevent the kneecap from gliding smoothly on its track, which can be painful,"" Zachazewski says.
        Strong leg muscles also absorb and reduce the stress you place on the knees with each step. You should do exercises to strengthen your muscles at least twice a week.
        Your stretching prescription
        If you suspect you have a knee or leg muscle injury, talk to your doctor before stretching. If you get the all-clear, Zachazewski recommends two types of stretching.
        Before your daily workout, do some dynamic stretching to prepare the muscles. All it takes is walking or marching in place for a few minutes, gradually increasing your pace or intensity. After your workout, when muscles are warmed up and ready for change, do some static stretching to make muscles longer and more flexible. Hold each stretch for at least 30 seconds.
        While you should stretch all major muscle groups, focus on the hip and leg muscles to ease knee pain. We've included examples below, and you'll find more in the Harvard Special Health Report Stretching.
        Zachazewski says stretching tight muscles should make them more flexible within three weeks, easing knee discomfort. Leg stretches might also ease an achy knee in the moment of a flare-up. If knee pain isn't going away, it's time to call your doctor.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-winter-affects-chronic-conditions,How winter affects chronic conditions,"We all have triggers for some particular health condition. Eat spicy food, for example, and you might get heartburn. Lift something heavy, and it might set off chronic low-back pain. And if you're coping with cold weather, you might experience a flare-up of certain diseases. Here are four chronic ailments that seem to worsen in winter.
        Psoriasis
        Winter poses many risks for people with psoriasis, which causes raised red patches of skin covered in silvery or white scales. Flare-ups can result from dry skin due to being in heated indoor air or taking long, hot showers.
        Winter bugs such as viral infections or strep throat also can trigger a psoriasis flare, as can reduced exposure to sunlight. ""UVB radiation is actually a treatment for psoriasis, as it slows down the rapid skin growth that drives psoriasis,"" says Dr. Sally Tan, director of the Atopic Dermatitis Specialty Clinic at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Recommendations: ""Take shorter, lukewarm showers; use a humidifier around the house; and moisturize with bland, cream-based emollients liberally—at least once a day, right after showering—to keep the skin well-moisturized and the skin barrier intact during winter months,"" Dr. Tan advises. ""And try to get 10 to 15 minutes of natural sunlight exposure each day. Wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even if you're just sitting indoors by a window.""
        Asthma
        Many things we breathe in — such as pollen or pollution — can set off an attack of asthma, a chronic lung condition caused by inflammation and narrowing of the airways. ""Triggers vary, but most people with asthma are bothered by breathing cold air, which cools and dehydrates the airways. That causes them to spasm and tighten, known as bronchoconstriction,"" explains Dr. Nicholas Nassikas, a pulmonologist with Beth Israel Deaconess.
        Recommendations: ""Avoiding triggers is easier said than done when you live in a cold climate,"" Dr. Nassikas says. ""Try to do outdoor activities during warmer parts of the day. Before going outside for more than a few minutes, take a puff of a rescue inhaler. When outdoors, wear a mask, which will help reduce symptoms by warming and humidifying air before it gets into the lungs. Also, continue prescribed asthma therapies; stay away from heavy pollution, such as smoke from firepits; and avoid viral illness by washing your hands and masking around people who are sick.""
        Raynaud's disease
        Raynaud's disease is a blood vessel disorder triggered by cold environments. Instead of the normal response to cold weather, with blood vessels narrowing slightly to direct more blood and warmth to the organs, the response is exaggerated (vasospasm). ""The vessels in the fingers and toes narrow excessively upon exposure to cold. This can compromise blood flow in the affected fingers and toes, which can be painful,"" says Dr. Vasileois Kyttaris, a rheumatologist at Beth Israel Deaconess.
        Recommendations: Avoid unnecessary exposure to cold, and make sure to dress warmly outside: a coat, hat, and mittens are a must, and hand and foot warmers are a big help. Put on cold-weather gear before you step outside, and leave your coat, mittens, and hat on while you're in the freezer section of a grocery store. At home, turn up the thermostat a few degrees, and block cold air coming in through drafty doors and windows. Your doctor might also recommend a vasodilator drug to open blood vessels.
        Arthritis
        Many people with arthritis (no matter which kind) say that cold weather worsens joint pain. Is it true? ""Some people tend to have more pain and stiffness during certain weather conditions, but research on the connection is inconclusive,"" Dr. Kyttaris says.
        It's not that doctors don't believe there's a link; they just don't have enough scientific evidence for one. Or the weather may affect just some people with arthritis.
        Recommendations: If you feel cold weather makes your arthritis symptoms worse, ramp up your pill-free arthritis regimen. Use heat therapy (such as a heating pad or warm shower or bath) or wear a joint brace (such as a knee sleeve) to help reduce inflammation. Most importantly, exercise. Daily physical activity can lower inflammation and enhance blood flow; both contribute to pain relief. For more information, check out the Harvard Online Learning course Joint Pain Relief Workout.
        Finally, talk to your doctor. You may need a prescription adjustment or a new medication. Or it could be that another condition is causing pain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/these-drugs-might-be-best-to-relieve-migraine-pain,These drugs might be best to relieve migraine pain,"A number of medications can help relieve the agony of a migraine headache as it's occurring, including some that have come out in the past few years. Which drug is best? A large analysis of randomized controlled trials, published online Sept. 24, 2024, by The BMJ, found that older drugs called triptans are more effective than newer options. Scientists evaluated 137 studies involving almost 90,000 people who were randomly assigned to take either a placebo (an inactive pill) or one of 17 medications, including various types of triptans, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antipyretics, and two classes of newer medications known as ditans and gepants. All of the drugs were better than a placebo at relieving pain within two hours. But the triptans eletriptan (Relpax), rizatriptan (Maxalt), sumatriptan (Imitrex), and zolmitriptan (Zomig) were most effective. Eletriptan was the best at stopping pain quickly. Eletriptan and the NSAID ibuprofen (Advil) kept pain away longer than other medications. Triptans can cause temporary narrowing of blood vessels and are not advised for people with atherosclerosis of the heart arteries. Ditans and gepants don't have that risk, but do have other side effects and can be expensive. The study found they were no more effective for the average migraine sufferer than acetaminophen (Tylenol) and most NSAIDs. While the findings apply to the average patient, some individuals may respond better to the new drugs than to the older ones.

Just how risky are these drugs?Because statins have been on the market for so long, the side effects are well known. About 10% of people develop muscle aches, which disappear when they stop taking the drug. Depending on the dose, statins also increase the risk of developing diabetes by 10% to 35%, possibly by preventing your body's insulin from working well, which causes blood sugar to rise. This side effect is most common in people with obesity and prediabetes, who are already prone to developing diabetes. Regardless, the cardiovascular benefit of a statin for these high-risk patients outweighs the risk of diabetes.","Christopher P. Cannon, MD","February 1, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-heartfelt-gift-ideas-for-valentines-day,5 heartfelt gift ideas for Valentine's Day,"On February 14 — a day symbolized by hearts and dedicated to love — give that special someone a present that shows you care. Or treat yourself to one (or more) of these five gift suggestions, all of which are designed to make it easier and more enjoyable to follow the cornerstones of a heart-healthy lifestyle: eating well, getting regular exercise, sleeping soundly, and managing stress.
        Dr. Beth Frates, a lifestyle medicine coach and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, explains why and how these gifts encourage habits that benefit the heart.
        1. A cooking class
        Making home-cooked meals is one of the best things you can do for your cardiovascular health. Research suggests that people who eat more meals made at home tend to weigh less and have healthier cholesterol and blood sugar values compared with people who eat out frequently. ""You can control the amount of saturated fat, salt, and sugar in food you make yourself. You'll also avoid the preservatives, additives, and dyes found in convenience foods like frozen dinners and other processed foods,"" says Dr. Frates.
        For people who feel they don't have the time or skills to prepare healthy food, a cooking class can help. A great place to start is a single class or series of classes about Mediterranean cooking or a similar cuisine that highlights heart-healthy ingredients: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats like extra-virgin olive oil or canola oil, and plant-based proteins like nuts, seeds, legumes, and tofu (or fish or chicken for those who choose animal proteins).
        ""Taking cooking classes together is a wonderful way to bond, to have some fun, and to nourish your body,"" says Dr. Frates. Once you hone your skills and grow more comfortable making meals, cooking can also be a great way to express your creativity, she adds. Some restaurants, supermarkets, and cookware stores offer on-site cooking classes. Alternatively, you can check local community centers and colleges, or search online.
        2. Strawberries dipped in dark chocolate
        Both strawberries and dark chocolate contain beneficial plant compounds called flavonoids, which are thought to improve cardiovascular health by relaxing blood vessels, improving blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and discouraging blood clots. Studies have linked diets rich in flavonoids to a lower risk of heart attacks and related problems.
        ""Chocolate-dipped strawberries are a classic Valentine's Day gift, and they're also delectable,"" says Dr. Frates. Look for those made with dark chocolate, which tends to have a higher flavonoid content than milk chocolate. Better yet, buy your own high-quality dark chocolate and berries and make them yourself — or maybe even together with your valentine, she suggests.
        3. Custom-fit sneakers
        If people walk, jog, or hike in shoes that don't fit properly, they can run into problems, says Dr. Frates. For example, ill-fitting shoes can cause blisters, put pressure on bunions, or leave you vulnerable to plantar fasciitis (inflammation of the fibrous band of tissue on the bottom of the foot) and Achilles tendinitis (inflammation of the tendon connecting the calf muscle to the heel). Some experts recommend replacing your walking shoes at least every 300 to 500 miles, which translates to a new pair every six to 12 months if you regularly walk about three miles per day.
        Treat your valentine to an outing to your local specialty running store, where you'll find the best selection and expert advice about footwear options. Many running stores sell walking shoes, and you can even wear running shoes for walking. Outdoor equipment stores may be your best bet for hiking boots. It's well worth the investment of time (and the possibly higher price tag) to have a knowledgeable staff member help you select a well-fitting shoe to suit your needs. Be sure to try on several different brands and styles, and take them for a test walk or jog around the store.
        4. Luxury sleep products
        Getting at least seven hours of sleep each night is vital for cardiovascular health, says Dr. Frates. Insufficient sleep can raise your risk for weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Creating a sleep sanctuary that's quiet, dark, and comfortable can make it easier to fall and stay asleep.
        A variety of accessories and products may help improve slumber. But it's important to know the preferences of your intended recipient, so ask questions or drop hints to gather clues. Some people might like a sleep machine that provides white noise or a recording of soothing sounds, such as falling rain, croaking frogs, or chirping crickets. Other might appreciate luxurious high-thread-count sheets, a silk pillowcase, or lavender-scented bath salts for a pre-slumber soak.
        If outside lights or early morning sunlight curtails sleep time, consider light-blocking curtains or shades. An eye mask made of soft, breathable material (such as cotton or silk) is another option.
        5. A subscription to a meditation app
        Meditation and mindfulness have been shown to lower blood pressure, decrease levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and increase heart rate variability (microsecond time differences from one heartbeat to the next), all of which are linked to better heart health. ""A regular meditation practice can help you to better manage stress, which is an unavoidable part of life,"" says Dr. Frates. Because meditation doesn't come naturally to most people, guidance and coaching from an in-person or online class really helps. A more convenient option is a subscription to a meditation app that you can listen to on your smartphone at your leisure.
        Popular meditation apps include Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer, and Happier. Most offer a free trial period, so you could send sign-up links to a few that you think your valentine might enjoy, and then offer to treat them to a yearlong subscription.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/sleep-hygiene-simple-practices-for-better-rest,Sleep hygiene: Simple practices for better rest,"A good night's sleep is essential for good health and functioning. It revitalizes the mind and body, and prepares you to perform at your best the following day. Researchers define a good night's sleep in terms of quantity (not too little or too much) and quality (falling asleep quickly and staying asleep).
        But many people don't sleep the amount needed to function at their best, or they spend too much time awake during the night. According to the CDC, more than one-third of adults in the U.S. don't get enough sleep — 14.5% have trouble falling asleep and 17.8% have trouble staying asleep. Good sleep hygiene can help.
        What is sleep hygiene?
        Sleep hygiene is a set of practices and routines that help you get better sleep. Adequate, good quality sleep allows your body to experience the physical maintenance and repair, immune system boost, and emotional and cognitive renewal that sleep provides.
        Sleep hygiene encompasses:
        
          making your sleeping environment comfortable and conducive to uninterrupted sleep
          keeping a consistent sleep schedule of seven to nine hours per night for most adults
          following a bedtime routine that helps you fall asleep
          establishing daytime habits that optimize restful sleep at night
          tailoring these practices for your own best results.
        
        Expert recommendations have traditionally emphasized going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day, including weekends. Although it is healthier to sleep consistently throughout the week, a 2023 consensus statement by the National Sleep Foundation suggests that after a week with insufficient sleep, it may be beneficial to get some catch-up sleep on weekends.
        The amount of sleep we need varies by age and can be affected by each individual's unique health circumstances. The CDC offers sleep duration recommendations across the lifespan. Keep in mind that these are suggestions, and every individual may not have the same needs.
        Tips for sounder sleep
        Retiring to a comfortable environment with minimal disruptions makes it easier to fall asleep and sleep soundly. What you consume during the day and before bedtime also plays an important role.
        Create a sleep sanctuary
        
          Reduce or mask noise. Heavy curtains and rugs can help absorb sound. A sleep machine that provides white noise, or a recording of soothing sounds such as falling rain, can mask outside noise.
          Minimize light. Consider light-blocking curtains or shades if outside lights shine into your bedroom.
          Replace your mattress and pillows if they're worn or uncomfortable.
          Most people sleep better in a room that's slightly cool. Keep room temperature around 65°F to 68° F at night.
          Only use the bedroom for sleep and intimacy.
          Have children and pets sleep elsewhere.
          Keep electronic devices and anything work-related in another room.
        
        Don't let food and substances interfere with a good night's sleep
        
          Consume evening meals at least three hours before bedtime.
          Avoid alcohol in the evenings. Although alcohol can make you sleepy, after a few hours it becomes stimulating and may cause you to awaken and have difficulty falling back to sleep. It can also worsen snoring and reduces REM sleep, an important stage of sleep for cognitive function and mental health.
          Avoid caffeine after lunch if it keeps you awake at night.
          Nicotine is a stimulant. Avoid smoking, which can interfere with nighttime sleep (among many other detrimental health effects).
        
        Create a relaxing bedtime routine
        Reserve an hour before bedtime to wind down away from stressful, stimulating activities. Relaxing steps and rituals like these make it easier to fall asleep:
        
          Put away electronic devices, except if used for calming music or a guided relaxation routine.
          Read for pleasure in soft light.
          Take a warm bath.
          Do some easy stretches, progressive muscle relaxation, or deep breathing.
        
        Overcoming common barriers to good sleep hygiene
        Your actions during the day can affect your sleep that night. You can adjust your behaviors to support, rather than interfere with, nighttime sleep.
        Schedule exercise and naps to support sound sleep
        
          For many people, exercising within two hours of bedtime interferes with falling asleep. For others, evening exercise is fine. Experiment to find the exercise timing that works best for you.
          Long or late afternoon naps may interfere with falling asleep at bedtime. Sleep experts recommend naps of half an hour or less, if needed, and not too late in the day.
        
        Keep a sleep diary to identify possible obstacles
        Track the following each day for at least two weeks:
        
          time you go to bed and wake up
          medications you take
          time and amount of caffeine or alcohol consumption
          time you eat dinner and anything after that
          when and how long you exercise
          what time you put down electronic devices and stop watching TV.
        
        In the morning, note length and quality of the previous night's sleep, whether you awakened during the night, and for how long. Look for any patterns between your behaviors and your sleep duration or quality that may help you identify factors that are interfering with your sleep.
        Work with a partner
        Making changes to your daily routine can be hard to do on your own. If you live with a partner or roommates, you can help each other adopt and stick to recommendations for healthy sleep.",Jessica Solodar,"January 31, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-more-probiotics,How to get more probiotics,"Our gut does more than digest food — it's a powerhouse for overall health, from boosting immunity to supporting mental well-being. Probiotics, the ""good"" bacteria in our systems, play a key role in maintaining this balance and are essential for keeping your body and mind thriving.
        There are two ways to get more good bacteria into your gut: fermented foods and dietary supplements. Probiotic supplements, which are typically sold over the counter, are reserved to treat specific ailments as suggested by your doctor. They are not recommended for everyday use. Plus, supplements do not have the same FDA oversight as medications do.
        Fermented foods, on the other hand, are an excellent natural source of probiotics. Fermenting is one of the oldest techniques for food preservation. Foods that are fermented go through a process of lactofermentation in which natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food, creating lactic acid.
        This process creates an environment that preserves the food and promotes beneficial enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as various species of good bacteria. Another way to look at fermentation is that it takes one type of food and transforms it into another kind. For instance, cabbage becomes sauerkraut, cucumbers become pickles, soybeans turn into miso, and milk can be made into yogurt, cheeses, and sour cream.
        Not all fermented foods contain probiotics. Some foods undergo steps that remove the probiotics, as with beer or wine, or make them inactive, like baking and canning. However, most fermented foods are probiotic foods as well.
        If there is a potential downside to fermented foods, it is that their taste and smell can be quite strong, which may be unpleasant for some people. The unique flavors and textures of fermented foods are due in part to the different species of bacteria used.
        On the upside, there are many types of fermented foods from which to choose, so there is a good chance you can find something you will enjoy.
        Good probiotic food choices
        The most common fermented foods that naturally contain probiotics, or have probiotics added to them, include yogurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, pickles, miso, tempeh, kimchi, sourdough bread, and some cheeses.
        Yogurt is considered the go-to player of probiotic foods because it has a flavor and texture that are generally appealing to Western palates. The number and type of bacteria species can vary depending on the yogurt brand. The probiotic content of yogurt products can range from 90 billion to 500 billion CFU per serving. (CFU stands for colony-forming units, which is how many bacteria divide and form colonies.) Look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label.
        It's easy to add yogurt to your diet. Besides having it for breakfast or a midday snack, you can substitute yogurt whenever you use mayonnaise in egg salad or potato salad, or in almost any baking recipe. Yogurt also can be the basis for sauces, salad dressings, or marinades.
        How many probiotic foods do you need? That's not easy to answer, as there is no recommended daily intake for probiotics, so there is no way to know exactly which fermented foods or what quantity is best. Therefore, the general guideline is to just add as many fermented foods to your daily diet as possible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/is-it-the-right-time-for-a-knee-replacement,Is it the right time for a knee replacement?,"Knee replacement surgery is the most common inpatient surgery in the U.S. But that doesn't mean the decision to have a knee replacement is an easy one, especially if you're younger than 60.
        Older and younger people benefit equally from knee replacement surgery, if they are generally healthy to start. However, people under 60 are encouraged to delay total knee replacement if they can.
        The reason? Artificial joints have a limited life span. Assuming an average level of physical activity, you can expect today's joint implants to last 15 to 20 years — sometimes longer. However, if you are overweight or more physically active than average, your new joint will face additional stress and may wear out faster.
        Ideally, you want your first knee replacement to be your last. Given the average life span for Americans, most older adults who get a new knee will not need to have it replaced.
        The situation is more complicated if you are in your 40s or 50s. In this case, the new knee is more likely to wear out during your lifetime. Then you'll need to have a revision surgery to take out the old one and replace it. The number of people under age 55 having knee replacements is growing rapidly.
        But it's also possible to wait a bit too long. If the joint becomes crooked because of breakdown of cartilage and bone, it can make the surgery more complicated (such deformities can make you bow-legged or knock-kneed). Some research also suggests that it may provide less benefit in the long term for people who wait until they have significant disability to get surgery. But other research finds no difference in results for people who wait longer.
        The decision about when to have knee replacement is a highly individual one, further highlighting the need for shared decision-making between you and your doctor.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/new-surgery-for-benign-prostate-hyperplasia-provides-long-lasting-benefits-202501233087,New surgery for benign prostate hyperplasia provides long-lasting benefits,"Most men over 50 will develop an enlarged prostate. Also called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), this bothersome condition makes it hard to urinate and can eventually lead to other problems, such as infections, kidney stones, and bladder damage, if left untreated. Many different BPH therapies are available, including medications and various types of surgery.
        One of the newer surgical options, called aquablation, trims excess prostate tissues with highly pressurized jets of saline. Doctors perform aquablation in the operating room while looking at the prostate gland on an ultrasound machine. Patients are put under general anesthesia, so they don't feel any pain during the procedure.
        Men typically have to urinate through a catheter for about 24 hours after surgery until swelling of the urethra (the tube through which urine flows out of the bladder) subsides. Aquablation is gaining in popularity — in part because, unlike other more traditional BPH treatments, it can preserve normal ejaculation.
        In September, researchers published a study showing that improvements in urinary function from aquablation were still holding up after five years.
        Results of data analysis
        The study assessed long-term data from two clinical trials. The first, called the WATER trial (for Waterjet Ablation Therapy for Endoscopic Resection of Prostate Tissue) launched in 2015 and enrolled 116 men with prostates ranging up to 80 cubic centimeters. The second trial, WATER II, launched in 2017 and enrolled 101 men with prostates ranging between 80 and 150 cubic centimeters. (Normal prostates range from 25 to 30 cubic centimeters in size.) Enrolled patients had a median age of 66 in the WATER study and 68 in WATER II. In addition, 92% of men in the WATER trial were sexually active, as were 75% of the men in WATER II.
        Both clinical trials used the so-called International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) to measure treatment-related improvements in urinary functioning and quality of life. Calculated based on how patients rate their symptoms on a standardized questionnaire, IPSS scores fall into three categories: mild symptom scores range from 1 to 7; intermediate symptom scores range from 8 to 18; and scores greater than 19 indicate severe symptoms.
        When they first enrolled in the trials, men in the WATER and WATER II studies reported average IPSS scores of 22.9 and 23.3 respectively. Five years later, the average respective scores were much lower: 7.0 and 6.8. The average length of hospital stay was 1.4 days in the WATER group and 1.6 days for the WATER II group. Only 1% of men were taking BPH medications after five years, and fewer than 5% had been surgically re-treated.
        Another randomized control trial, WATER III, is currently underway in Europe. That trial compares aquablation with a more established type of BPH surgery, prostate enucleation, which uses a laser to remove obstructing tissues. Six-month data reported in 2023 showed that men in either group had comparable symptom improvements.
        However, 98% of men in the prostate enucleation group had ejaculatory dysfunction. That side effect is caused by damage to delicate tissues around the bladder neck that propel semen out of the body. Semen therefore flows back into the bladder, a condition called retrograde ejaculation. None of the men in the aquablation group reported ejaculatory problems.
        A word of caution
        Aquablation can result in extended bleeding, cautions Dr. Heidi Rayala, an assistant professor of urology at Harvard Medical School and a member of the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases advisory board. That's because unlike other types of surgery for BPH, including prostate enucleation, aquablation doesn't cauterize tissues with heat. ""I tell my patients to expect some blood in the urine for about four to six weeks after the procedure,"" Dr. Rayala said.
        Moreover, aquablation may be unsuitable for some men who take blood thinners to prevent blood from clotting, according to Dr. Rayala. Appropriate candidates for the surgery must be able to ""safely discontinue anticoagulant medications during post-operative healing, given the bleeding risk,"" Dr. Rayala said. Still, aquablation is an excellent option for most men, Dr. Rayala said, especially those with medium to large prostates ""who want a durable solution with a lower risk of sexual side effects.""
        ""These early results are encouraging, but limited by a relatively small number of patients,"" said Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases. ""Further evidence with a significantly larger number of patients and longer follow-up will help to support this new method of reducing prostate tissue as an important treatment option.""",Charlie Schmidt,"January 23, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/gum-disease-and-heart-health-probing-the-link,Gum disease and heart health: Probing the link,"About two-thirds of people over 65 have gum disease — more formally known as periodontal disease. It starts when plaque, a sticky film of bacteria and food, builds up around the teeth. In its earliest stage, gingivitis, irritated gums can bleed easily. Left untreated, periodontal disease can worsen and, in its most severe form, cause the teeth to loosen and fall out.
        Compared with people who have healthy gums, people with periodontal disease are about twice as likely to have a heart attack. Shared risk factors — including smoking, an unhealthy diet, or lack of access to health and dental care — may explain some of this association. However, some bacterial and viral infections also appear to increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. And growing evidence suggests that bacteria and inflammation may underlie the link between the mouth and the heart.
        ""Your mouth is a gateway to the rest of your body, so it's not surprising that your oral health can affect your overall health and vice versa,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, a prosthodontist in the Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
        Hundreds of different types of bacteria occur naturally in the mouth. Some, fed by sugars, release acids that break down the outer layer of your teeth, causing cavities. Other types of bacteria form plaque that — if not removed by regular brushing and flossing — hardens into tartar, Dr. Jiang explains. Only a professional dental cleaning can remove these hard, calcified deposits.
        
          
            
              
                Signs of gum disease
                If you experience any of these signs, you may have periodontal disease:
                
                  swollen, red, or tender gums
                  gums that bleed easily
                  pus between the teeth and gums
                  bad breath
                  buildup of hard yellow or brown deposits along the gum line
                  teeth that are moving apart or loose
                  dental appliances no longer fit well.
                
              
            
          
        
        Bacteria on the move?
        The bacteria responsible for periodontal disease can travel to blood vessels throughout the body. In fact, periodontal bacteria have been found in the fatty debris (atherosclerosis) that clogs arteries located far from the mouth — and in blood clots from people who have experienced heart attacks.
        ""In both gum disease and heart disease, we find bacteria in places where they're not supposed to be,"" says Dr. Jiang. The body's immune response to these misplaced bacteria triggers an outpouring of white blood cells. The resulting inflammation may lead to tiny clots and cause a heart attack or stroke.
        In addition, many factors linked to a higher risk of heart disease—diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity — are all more common in people with periodontal disease, according to a 2021 review article about oral health and cardiovascular disease in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology.
        One way to treat periodontal disease is for dentists and hygienists to use manual scalers or ultrasound devices to scrape away tartar above and below the gum line. Known as scaling and root planing, this deep cleaning is more extensive than the twice-yearly cleanings people typically get at the dentist. But while treating periodontal disease may help bring down levels of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream, there's limited evidence it can reduce heart attacks or other cardiovascular problems.
        Preventing periodontal disease
        To prevent gum disease, daily brushing and flossing is essential — and can even reverse gingivitis before it worsens. If you've slacked off on your flossing, you may notice a little bleeding when you start up again, says Dr. Jiang. When that happens, some people get nervous and stop flossing. But don't worry; just get back into the habit and chances are the bleeding will improve within a few days, she advises. If it doesn't, and you notice other signs of gum disease (see box), schedule an appointment with your dentist.
        A healthy diet can also help, says Dr. Jiang. Most people know that hard or chewy candy and other sticky sweets promote cavities. But sugary drinks like sodas (especially if you sip them throughout the day) also feed the bacteria that cause cavities and gum disease. ""That's also true for refined carbohydrates that stick to your teeth, like crackers and breads made with white flour,"" says Dr. Jiang. What's more, a sugary diet is itself associated with higher heart disease risk.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/typing-and-tapping-despite-hand-pain,Typing and tapping despite hand pain,"Thanks to technology, the world is at your fingertips. All it takes is tapping on a smartphone, typing on a keyboard, or clicking with a mouse. That's not so easy, however, when it irritates underlying conditions, such as tendinitis or arthritis.
        ""The problem is the repetitive movement of your fingers on a keyboard or reaching and stretching your fingers on a mouse. With a phone, it's the repetitive movement with one hand and sustained grasping with the other hand,"" explains Eve Kennedy-Spaien, clinical supervisor of the Pain Management, Work Injury, and Integrative Medicine Programs at Harvard-affiliated Spalding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        Consider the following strategies when hand pain or stiffness makes computer or smartphone use difficult, and check with your doctor to make sure these tips are right for you.
        Distribute the work
        Do you have a ""hunt and peck"" typing style? Do you text only with your thumb? That can lead to overuse injuries. Instead, distribute the work among your fingers and hands. ""Alternate which fingers are doing the work,"" Kennedy-Spaien says. ""If you only use a mouse with your right hand, try mousing left-handed. Or switch the hand you use to hold a smartphone.""
        Take breaks
        Using a computer or smartphone is a sedentary activity. It keeps you from being active and restricts blood flow to your hands, which makes them stiffer and harder to move.
        To combat it, take scheduled breaks before you feel the need to stop. ""By the time your hands are complaining, you've already aggravated them. It takes longer to get the pain and stiffness under control, and you end up needing a longer break,"" Kennedy-Spaien says. ""Take a five-minute break after 45 minutes of activity. Stand up, get a drink of water, or do anything that completely changes your position.""
        Stretch your wrists and hands
        It's important to keep your wrists and hands limber. Stretch them periodically. Start at your wrists, keeping your forearms still and slowly moving your fists in circles. Next, gently open and close your fists, stretching your fingers if you can. ""Make sure your fingers are aligned and moving together, and that no finger is going ahead of or lagging behind the others, which can happen when you have arthritis,"" Kennedy-Spaien advises.
        Use heat or cold therapy
        Heat and cold therapies have differing uses. Heat is soothing and relaxes muscles. It's helpful before typing or using your phone for an extended period. ""It's good for stiffness but not swelling,"" Kennedy-Spaien says. ""Moist heat gets deeper into the tissues and joints. You can get moist heat from warm hand soaks or using microwavable moist heat mittens.""
        Ice is an anti-inflammatory and a painkiller. ""It's best for tendinitis or swollen, hot joints. It helps after you've been using your hands for a long time,"" Kennedy-Spaien says. Try an ice pack, cold therapy gloves (with gel packs you keep in the freezer), or a hand soak in icy water. Limit therapy sessions to 20 minutes, to avoid hurting your skin.
        Avoid awkward hand positions
        Holding or moving your hands in unnatural ways can cause pain. For example, maybe you're reaching for the mouse with only your wrist; twisting your wrist as you hold your smartphone; or propping your laptop on your fingers. All of those activities put pressure on the joints and small muscles. ""Use your larger muscles — such as your whole arm to move your mouse — and keep weight off of your fingers,"" suggests Kennedy-Spaien.
        Use helpful tools
        Go easier on your hands and wrists by using some of the following tools.
        ""Virtual"" assistants or voice-to-text features. Most computers and smartphones have features that allow you to type, text, or carry out commands by simply talking out loud. Don't know how to use them? Search for an instructive video on the Internet or ask a family member for a lesson.
        A comfortable mouse. ""You should be able to move the mouse without having to grasp it tightly or stretch your fingers out too wide,"" Kennedy-Spaien notes. Get a mouse that's bigger or smaller to fit you better, or try a vertical mouse that keeps your hand in a handshake position.
        A wide-grip stylus. It's easy to hold and saves your fingers from tapping on a smartphone or tablet.
        A smartphone holder. ""A gooseneck holder enables you to adjust the height and angle,"" Kennedy-Spaien suggests.
        Gel-filled wrist rests. Get them for your keyboard and mouse.
        Get a comfy chair. Be sure it has good support and that you sit up straight in it. ""The body is a dynamic chain,"" Kennedy-Spaien says. ""When one part isn't in a good position, it affects the rest of the body, including your hands.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/osteopenia-when-you-have-weak-bones-but-not-osteoporosis,"Osteopenia: When you have weak bones, but not osteoporosis","Bone density test score determines whether you have osteopenia or osteoporosis
        
          
        
        Like their names suggest, osteopenia and osteoporosis are related diseases. Both are varying degrees of bone loss, as measured by bone mineral density, a marker for how strong a bone is and the risk that it might break. If you think of bone mineral density as a slope, normal would be at the top and osteoporosis at the bottom. Osteopenia, which affects about half of Americans over age 50, would fall somewhere in between.
        Osteopenia and bone density test
        The main way to determine your bone density is to have a painless, noninvasive test called dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) that measures the mineral content of bone. The measurements, known as T-scores, determine which category — osteopenia, osteoporosis, or normal — a person falls into (see graphic).
        Fracture risk increases as bone mineral density declines. But there isn't a huge difference between, say, a -2.3 T-score and -2.5, although the former would be labeled osteopenia and the latter, osteoporosis. The label matters less than the number. These distinctions are to some extent arbitrary lines in the sand. Regardless of your exact score, if your bone density results fall into the osteopenia category, your doctors will probably schedule you for a bone mineral density test every two to five years.
        
          
            
              
                What's your bone density score?
                A T-score ranging from -1 to -2.5 is classified as osteopenia. The lower the score, the more porous your bone.
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        The United States Preventive Services Task Forces (USPSTF) recommends bone density screening for
        
          Women 65 years or older
          Postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk for an osteoporotic fracture as estimated by clinical risk assessment.
        
        According to the USPSTF, there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of bone density screening in men.
        Osteopenia Prevention
        Everybody's bones get weaker as they get older. But certain choices and habits accelerate the process. They include:
        
          not getting enough calcium and vitamin D
          smoking
          drinking too much alcohol
          using certain medications, such as corticosteroids or some anticonvulsants
          not getting enough weight-bearing exercise (at least 30 minutes on most days). If your feet touch the ground during an exercise, it's probably weight bearing. Running and walking are weight bearing. Swimming and biking are not.
        
        Women are far more likely to have lower than normal bone density than men, but it's no longer viewed as solely a women's condition. About a third of white and Asian men over age 50 are affected. The percentages for Hispanics (23%) and blacks (19%) are lower, but still sizable.
        Osteopenia treatment
        Exercise and diet are the mainstays of osteoporosis treatment. Bones get stronger when we exert force on them by using our muscles. Weight-bearing exercise — such as resistance (strength) training or body-weight exercises — is an effective way to do this. Simply walking at a brisk pace reduces the likelihood of osteoporosis. Aerobic and balance exercises help reduce the risk of falling and suffering a fracture.
        Get the right nutrients. Bones rely on calcium to get stronger, and your body needs vitamin D to absorb calcium. Aim for 1,000 IU of vitamin D and 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day. Try to get as much calcium as you can from food, such as dairy products, sardines, and leafy greens. If you're not getting enough calcium in your diet, ask your doctor if you should add a low-dose calcium supplement to make up the gap.
        You should also consume plenty of protein, which helps build strong bones. Good sources include poultry, fish, legumes, and dairy products. Avoid or limit alcohol intake to no more than one drink per day, since alcohol can interfere with bone health.
        Your doctor may recommend drug therapy, such as a bisphosphonate, if you have advanced osteopenia and also have
        
          had a previous spine or hip fracture
          a high risk for fractures in the next 10 years, as calculated with a bone density test (a DEXA scan) and a fracture risk assessment (FRAX) score

A new blanket might help,"Weighted blankets have long been used for certain conditions. They may provide benefits for people with insomnia and anxiety, but research is scarce.

        Some people count sheep at night. You count worries. If you often find yourself lying awake at night, staring at the ceiling, you may be looking for solutions to help you get back to sleep. One approach that doesn't involve drugs or doctors is weighted blankets.
        These blankets look like regular blankets, but they're filled with plastic beads or pellets to make them heavier. They typically weigh from 3 pounds to upwards of 20 pounds. Companies are marketing them as a solution for insomnia as well as nighttime anxiety and stress reduction. And people are buying. Sales of the blankets have surged in the past two years.
        The use of weight in therapy
        The idea of using weight as a calming strategy does have some basis in current medical practice.
        Weighted blankets have been around for a long time, especially for kids with autism or behavioral disturbances. It is one of the sensory tools commonly used in psychiatric units. Patients who are in distress may choose different types of sensory activities — holding a cold object, smelling particular aromas, manipulating dough, building objects, doing arts and crafts — to try to calm down.
        The blankets are supposed to work much the same way tight swaddling helps newborns feel snug and secure so they can doze off more quickly. The blanket basically simulates a comforting hug, in theory helping to calm and settle the nervous system.
        Companies that sell the blankets typically recommend that you buy one that weighs approximately 10% of your body weight, which would mean a 15-pound blanket for a 150-pound person.
        Weighing down anxiety
        The question is, do they really work? While some people swear by these blankets, concrete evidence is unfortunately lacking. There are really no definitive scientific studies to back up the claims. A randomized clinical trial to test the blankets would be very difficult. A blind comparison is impossible because people can automatically tell if the blanket is heavy or not. And it's unlikely that somebody would sponsor such a study.
        Should you use a weighted blanket?
        While there is no robust evidence that weighted blankets are truly effective, for most healthy adults, there are likely few risks to trying one — other than price. Most weighted blankets cost at least $100 and often more than $200.
        There are certain people who should not use a weighted blanket or should check with their doctors before doing so, including people with
        
          
            sleep apnea
          
          
            certain other sleep disorders
          
          
            respiratory problems or other chronic medical conditions.
          
        
        Also, check in with your doctor or a trained therapist if you are interested in trying a weighted blanket for a child.
        If you do decide to try a weighted blanket, be realistic about your expectations and realize that results may vary.
        Blankets may be of help for anxiety or insomnia. But just as swaddling works for some babies and not others, weighted blankets won't be a miracle treatment for everyone.
        Is there a better option?
        In addition, keep in mind there may be better, evidence-based solutions out there for your sleep struggles, particularly when it comes to chronic insomnia, which is defined as having trouble falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week for three months or more.
        For insomnia, a first-line recommendation is a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and relaxation techniques, practices that are supported by evidence from controlled trials.
        CBT is typically administered in a four- to 10-week program that helps you make lasting changes to your sleep habits, including limiting the amount of time you spend in bed. This helps to train you to avoid being in bed unless you are sleeping. CBT can be challenging and typically works best when performed by a professional.",Unknown,"January 16, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/overcome-your-fear-factor,Overcome your fear factor,"Fear and worry got you down? Here's how to calm these feelings.
        
        
          
        
        Have you grown more worried and fearful about life over the years? You aren't alone. Research has shown that feelings of fear, general anxiety, and nervousness tend to rise with age.
        These negative feelings can manifest in many ways. You could be more concerned about your financial future, the risk of a new or returning health problem or injury, or as the recent COVID-19 pandemic has shown, changes in world events.
        People become more fearful about daily life because they worry a setback will come at any time, and it's something they can't control.
        
          
            
              
                Tell worry to take a walk
                Need a mental break from fear or worry? Take a mindful walk during which you focus on your body awareness, movement, breathing, and surroundings. It is a simple way to refresh your mind and be more present. One study found that people who did 30 minutes of mindful walking twice a week for four weeks had less stress and better quality of life.
              
            
          
        
        A cumulative effect
        It's not clear what drives this mindset. Researchers speculate it could be a combination of biological changes in the aging brain along with the cumulative effects of unhappy life experiences, either your own or those of someone close to you.
        These ongoing feelings of fear and worry can have a deep impact on your health. You may become less active and less social, both of which can contribute to frailty, heart disease, and depression.
         If not addressed, constant fear and worry may progress to a specific disorder, such as social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia (fear of public places), or generalized anxiety disorder (chronic worrying that may lead to physical problems like chest pain and muscle fatigue).
        What to do
        There are many ways to address constant fear and worry so they do not consume your life. The first step is to identify your fear's source. The right treatment begins with recognition. Often, people cannot articulate why they are fearful or worry too much, and why it's happening.
        Consider meeting with a psychiatrist or therapist. A professional analysis can help pinpoint where your specific worries and fears may lie.
        After that, the two of you work together to create strategies that address those fears. These could include one-on-one or group therapy sessions, relaxation training exercises, or cognitive behavioral therapy (in which you learn to reframe your response to your fearful thoughts).
        Once you are aware of your specific fears and when they typically arise, you can take other means to manage them. For example:
        Practice mindfulness. Mindfulness trains your mind's attention to be more present without drifting into concerns about the past or future. This mindset helps you not to overreact to fearful thoughts and reduce any stress, depression, or anxiety that accompanies them.
        Meditation is a popular way to learn mindfulness. The goal of meditation is not to push aside or block fearful thinking, but rather to notice your thoughts and feelings and realize that you don't have to act on them. This could be as simple as closing your eyes and repeating a single phrase or word, or counting breaths.
        Consult a financial expert. If money issues worry you, meet with a financial planner or adviser. He or she can do a thorough review of your financials, create or adjust your budget, focus on specific concerns, and help set goals. This can help you feel more confident about your situation and address any issues that may trigger worry.
        Hire a personal trainer. If you avoid activity or exercise because you fear injury, hire a personal trainer who specializes in older adult conditioning. A trainer can assess your current fitness, identify strengths and weaknesses, and develop a program to help you improve.
        Because you will see and feel your physical improvements as you progress, this will help you overcome fear of injury and the worry that you can't exercise or be more active. You can realize that you are more than capable of being active than you think. Look for trainers with specialized certification from organizations like the American Council on Exercise or the National Academy of Sports Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/got-a-hangnail-heres-what-to-do,Got a hangnail? Here's what to do,"Hangnails are small, but they can be surprisingly annoying and even painful. They often appear when the skin around your nails becomes dry, cracked, or damaged. While most hangnails are harmless and can be treated at home, they can sometimes lead to infections if not properly cared for.
        What is a hangnail?
        A hangnail is a small, torn piece of skin that appears at the edge of a fingernail. Despite its name, a hangnail isn't part of the nail itself but instead a sliver of skin that can peel away from the nail's edge. Hangnails are common and can be painful, especially if they snag on something or get infected.
        Why do hangnails happen?
        Hangnails often form when the skin around your nails becomes dry and damaged. Common causes include cold weather, frequent hand washing, or exposure to harsh chemicals. People who bite their nails or pick at their skin may also be more likely to get hangnails. Hangnails can also happen if you have brittle nails or if your hands are in water a lot, as they might be when washing dishes.
        Treating hangnails at home
        Hangnails can often be managed simply at home. Here's how:
        
          Soak your fingers. Start by soaking your fingers in warm, soapy water for about 10 minutes to soften the skin.
          Trim carefully. Using sanitized nail clippers or small scissors, gently trim the hangnail close to the skin. You might be tempted to pull out the raised piece of skin, but that's something you should avoid. Tearing the skin can cause further damage at the base and increase your risk of developing an infection in the cuticle.
          Apply moisturizer. Use a fragrance-free moisturizing cream or a bit of petroleum jelly to keep the skin around your nails moisturized. Another option is to use a small amount of over-the-counter antibacterial ointment such as bacitracin.
          Bandage if needed. If the area is sore or bleeding, cover with a bandage to protect it from infection until it heals.
        
        How to prevent hangnails
        The best way to prevent hangnails is to keep the skin around your nails healthy and hydrated. These skin and nail care tips can help:
        
          Maintain clean, dry, and hydrated skin. Wash your hands and feet with gentle cleansers, ensuring they are thoroughly dried afterward. Use moisturizers daily and reapply them after each time you wash your hands. Use a fragrance-free hand cream or cuticle oil to keep your skin soft.
          Don't bite your nails. Biting your nails or picking at the skin around them can lead to tears and infection. Instead, trim your nails carefully with a clean tool and avoid cutting your cuticles.
          Protect your hands by wearing gloves. For activities like dishwashing, layer cotton gloves beneath waterproof gloves, such as vinyl ones. Use protective gloves while cleaning, gardening, or spending time outdoors in cold weather.
          Prioritize nail care. Trim your nails straight across using sharp nail clippers or scissors. Use an emery board to slightly round the tips and smooth out any rough edges or snags. Avoid using your nails as tools — for example, don't use a nail to pry open a soda can.
        
        When to see a doctor for a hangnail
        Most hangnails heal on their own with home care. However, when the protective barrier of skin around the nail is damaged, it can let in bacteria that can cause an infection. This is known as acute paronychia. Signs of infection include:
        
          Redness: The skin around the nail becomes red and inflamed.
          Swelling: The affected area may appear puffy or swollen.
          Pain or tenderness: The area around the nail may feel sore or painful, especially when touched.
          Warmth: The infected skin may feel warm to the touch.
          Pus: A pocket of yellow or white fluid (pus) may form near the nail if the infection progresses.
        
        If you notice these symptoms, it's a good idea to seek medical attention, especially if the infection doesn't improve or worsens. Infected hangnails can be painful. And left untreated, the infection can spread to other parts of your finger.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","January 15, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/sciatica-gentle-stretches-to-help-relieve-pain-and-improve-mobility,Sciatica: Gentle stretches to help relieve pain and improve mobility,"The sharp, radiating pain of a sciatica flare-up can make everyday activities such as moving or even sleeping a challenge. However, for some people who experience it, simple, effective exercises can help relieve sciatica pain.
        What is sciatica?
        You may hear someone say that their ""sciatica is flaring up."" But sciatica isn't a single, specific medical condition. Rather, ""sciatica"" describes the symptoms that arise from irritation or compression on some part of the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is the body's largest nerve. It runs from the lower spine, through the buttocks, down the back of each leg, and into the foot. So, an irritation or injury of this nerve can potentially affect a large portion of the lower body.
        Most cases of sciatica result from compression of nerve roots in the lower body that affect the sciatic nerve. This causes heightened sensitivity and pain.
        Irritation of the sciatic nerve, or the nerves connected to it, can occur for various reasons, including:
        
          herniated disc, when the soft inner core of an intervertebral disc, which creates a cushion between the bones of your back, bulges out of position. This is the most common cause of sciatica.
          spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal canal
          spondylolisthesis, a condition in which one of the bones in your spine slips out of alignment
          injury.
        
        Sciatica may also result from other causes, such as pregnancy.
        Sciatica pain varies greatly between individuals, differing in intensity and location. For some people, sciatica feels like a mild ache. For others, it can feel like sharp, unrelenting, shooting pain radiating from the lower back through the buttocks and down one or both legs. In some cases, the pain is localized to the leg and foot, with no discomfort in the back or buttocks. The pain can feel more intense at certain times of the day or in certain positions.
        How stretching helps
        Certain home remedies and self-care techniques may help reduce pain and prevent symptoms from worsening. It may be tempting to rest when sciatica flares up, but inactivity can make symptoms worse.
        Stretching is one of the most effective ways to relieve sciatica pain and promote long-term healing. Movement and gentle stretches may provide several benefits, including:
        
          Increased flexibility and range of motion: Stretches that target the hips, lower back, and legs can reduce tension in muscles that may press on or irritate the sciatic nerve.
          Stronger supporting muscles: Building flexibility helps to support proper spinal alignment and reduce stress on the lower back, reducing the chance of future episodes.
          Circulation boost: Improved blood flow accelerates the healing process by delivering oxygen and nutrients to injured tissues.
          Reduced pain perception: Gentle movement releases endorphins, which act as natural pain relievers, helping to ease discomfort.
        
        It's important to approach stretching with care. Avoid overexertion or excessive bending that could strain the spine. Focus on slow, controlled movements and listen to your body. If stretching worsens your pain or feels uncomfortable, consult a healthcare provider to ensure you're on the right path to recovery.
        Gentle stretches to relieve sciatica pain
        Incorporating stretch-focused routines into your home routine can help to improve back pain, including sciatica. Try the following gentle stretches for relief.
        Knee to chest stretch
        
          
        
        
          Lie on your back with both knees bent, feet on the ground.
          Cross your left leg over your right, with the ankle of your left leg resting just above the knee of the right.
          Hold your right thigh with both hands and pull it toward your chest until you can feel the stretch in your buttocks. Hold it for 10 to 30 seconds.
          Return to the starting position.
          Repeat with the other leg.
        
        Knee cradle
        
          
        
        
          Lie on your back with your legs straight out.
          Bend your right knee and rotate your hip so that the lower leg is across your chest, pointing to the left. You should feel this stretch in your thigh.
          Hold for 5 to 10 seconds, then return to the starting position.
          Repeat 5 times with each leg.
        
        Cat-cow
        
          
            
          
        
        
          Get down on all fours (tabletop position) with your hands directly beneath your shoulders and your knees beneath your hips. Keep your back flat.
          As you inhale, lift your collarbone and tailbone toward the ceiling as you let your belly relax toward the floor, like a cow.
          As you exhale, round your back, bringing your chin toward your chest and tucking your tailbone under like a cat as you pull in your navel toward your spine.
          Continue moving with your breath; do not hold.
          Repeat 3 to 5 times.
        
        Lower back press
        
          
        
        
          Lie on your back with both knees bent and your feet on the floor.
          Gently flatten your lower back to the floor and hold for 5 to 10 seconds, then relax.
          Repeat 5 to 10 times.
        
        Exercises to avoid if you have sciatica
        While staying active is important for managing sciatica, certain exercises and movements can aggravate the condition.
        Here are some types of exercises to avoid, especially in the early stages of sciatica:
        Heavy lifting. Lifting heavy weights puts significant strain on the spine and can worsen sciatica pain. Avoid activities that involve lifting, especially those that require bending or twisting your back.
        Twisting movements. Twisting or rotating your back, especially with added weight, can exacerbate irritation of the sciatic nerve. Avoid activities like golf, tennis, or certain yoga poses that require sharp spinal rotation until sciatica pain subsides.
        Overly intense stretching. While gentle stretching is beneficial, aggressive or deep stretches can put too much strain on your lower back, hips, and legs, leading to more pain. Avoid any stretches that cause discomfort or sharp pain, especially those that push you beyond your current range of motion.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ease-anxiety-and-stress-take-a-belly-breather-201904261861,Ease anxiety and stress: Take a (belly) breather,"Quick: think of three things that make you feel anxious or stressed. Most of us have no trouble reeling off answers. And people who suffer from anxiety disorders — such as social anxiety, phobias, or generalized anxiety — may have a variety of triggers that send anxiety soaring. While belly breathing alone can't fix deep-seated anxieties, it works well as a tool to help ease anxiety and garden-variety stress. Regularly engaging in belly breathing (or trying the mini strategy described below) can help you turn a fight-or-flight response into a relaxation response that's beneficial to your health.
        How should you breathe?
        You take up to 23,000 breaths per day, so make sure you do it right.
        How should you breathe? Like a sleeping child, says Dr. Katherine Rosa of the Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. ""If you ever watch children sleep, they all breathe from the belly and not the chest. This relaxed state is the more normal way to breathe.""
        Yet most people are chest breathers, which is how we react to stress. When we sense a threat, our fight-or-flight response automatically kicks in. We breathe at a rapid pace to suck in extra oxygen, to fuel our heart and muscles so we can flee the danger.
        Of course, we don't need our fight-or-flight response to escape predators anymore. Our threats now come from the stress of emails, personal confrontations, daily news, and traffic jams.
        ""Your fight-or-flight response is meant to be a short-term reaction that comes and goes,"" says Dr. Rosa. ""But today, we are surrounded by so many stressors that we constantly stay in this state of tension. It doesn't turn off, and we often don't even notice it."" The result: we have become a nation of chest breathers.
        Feel it in your belly
        One way to change our reaction to modern stress is to learn how to belly breathe instead of chest breathe. Belly breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, which runs from the head down the neck, through the chest, and to the colon. This activates your relaxation response, reducing your heart rate and blood pressure and lowering stress levels.
        If you are not familiar with belly breathing, try this exercise: sit in a chair, lean forward, and place your elbows on your knees. Then breathe naturally. ""This position forces you to breathe from the belly, so you know what the sensation feels like,"" says Dr. Rosa.
        A mini strategy to ease anxiety and stress
        A strategy to teach yourself mindful belly breathing is to practice what Dr. Rosa calls ""the mini."" Here's what you do: every time you feel stressed, simply take three slow and controlled deep belly breaths. ""It's a simple act, but this interrupts the fight-or-flight response and puts it on pause,"" says Dr. Rosa. ""Over time, belly breathing can buffer your resistance to your fight-or-flight response, so you are not as sensitive to stress triggers.""
        To help you be more mindful about your breathing pattern, place one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. ""You want the chest hand to be still and the belly hand to move out like you are blowing up a balloon,"" says Dr. Rosa.
        She suggests practicing belly breathing throughout the day, like once every hour or up to 10 to 15 times per day. ""As it becomes more of a habit, you can automatically engage belly breathing whenever you face a stressful event.""",Matthew Solan,"January 10, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/lets-not-call-it-cancer-202501093086,Let's not call it cancer,"Roughly one in six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lives, but these cancers usually aren't life-threatening. Most newly diagnosed men have Grade Group 1 (GG1) prostate cancer, which can linger for years without causing significant harms.
        Prostate cancer is categorized according to how far it has spread and how aggressive it looks under the microscope. Pure GG1 prostate cancer is the least risky form of the disease. It occurs frequently with age, will not metastasize to other parts of the body, and it doesn't require any immediate treatment.
        So, should we even call it cancer? Many experts say no.
        Dr. Matthew Cooperberg, who chairs the department of urology at the University of California, San Francisco, says men wouldn't suffer as much anxiety — and would be less inclined to pursue unneeded therapies — if their doctors stopped referring to low-grade changes in the prostate as cancer. He recently co-chaired a symposium where experts from around the world gathered to discuss the pros and cons of giving GG1 cancer another name.
        Treatment discrepancies
        GG1 cancer is typically revealed by PSA screening. The goal with screening is to find more aggressive prostate cancer while it's still curable, yet these efforts often detect GG1 cancer incidentally. Attendees at the symposium agreed that GG1 disease should be managed with active surveillance. With this standard practice, doctors monitor the disease with periodic PSA checks, biopsies, and imaging, and treat the disease only if it shows signs of progression.
        But even as medical groups work to promote active surveillance, 40% of men with low-risk prostate cancer in the United States are treated immediately. According to Dr. Cooperberg, that's in part because the word ""cancer"" has such a strong emotional impact. ""It resonates with people as something that spreads and kills,"" he says. ""No matter how much we try to get the message out there that GG1 cancer is not an immediate concern, there's a lot of anxiety associated with a 'C-word' diagnosis.""
        A consequence is widespread overtreatment, with tens of thousands of men needlessly suffering side effects from surgery or radiation every year. A cancer diagnosis has other harmful consequences: studies reveal negative effects on relationships and employment as well as ""someone's ability to get life insurance,"" Dr. Cooperberg says. ""It can affect health insurance rates.""
        Debate about renaming
        Experts at the symposium proposed that GG1 cancer could be referred to instead as acinar neoplasm, which is an abnormal but nonlethal growth in tissue. Skeptics expressed a concern that patients might not stick with active surveillance if they aren't told they have cancer. But should men be scared into complying with appropriate monitoring? Dr. Cooperberg argues that patients with pure GG1 ""should not be burdened with a cancer diagnosis that has zero capacity to harm them.""
        Dr. Cooperberg does caution that since biopsies can potentially miss higher-grade cancer elsewhere in the prostate, monitoring the condition with active surveillance is crucial. Moreover, men with a strong family history of cancer, or genetic mutations such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 that put them at a higher risk of aggressive disease, should be followed more closely, he says.
        Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases, agrees. Dr. Garnick emphasized that a name change for GG1 cancer needs to consider a wide spectrum of additional testing. ""This decision can't simply be based on pathology,"" he says. ""Biopsies only sample a miniscule portion of the prostate gland. Genetic and genomic tests can help us identify some low-risk cancers that might behave in a more aggressive fashion down the road.""
        Meanwhile, support for a name change is gaining momentum. ""Younger pathologists and urologists are especially likely to think this is a good idea,"" Dr. Cooperberg says. ""I think the name change is just a matter of time — in my view, we'll get there eventually.""",Charlie Schmidt,"January 9, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/4-ways-to-keep-moving-with-joint-pain,4 ways to keep moving with joint pain,"If you suffer from joint pain, exercise may seem like the last thing you want to do, or need to do. But the right exercises performed properly can be a long-lasting way to subdue ankle, knee, hip, or shoulder pain. For some people, the right exercise routine can even help delay or sidestep surgery.
        While exercise is great medicine, it only works if you carve out time to do it regularly. And sometimes the hardest part of a workout is getting started. Here are four ways to help you get your dose of physical activity:
        
          Carve out the time. Skip several half-hour TV shows a week or work out while watching. Get up half an hour earlier each day for a morning workout. If big blocks of time aren't falling into your lap, try 10-minute walks, or half a workout in the morning and half in the evening.
          Build activity into your daily routine. Take stairs, not elevators. When commuting, get off the bus or subway a stop or two ahead, or park farther away from your workplace. While on the phone, try a few stretches, pace, or do simple exercises like lunges, squats, and heel raises. Bike or walk to work. When running errands within a reasonable radius, park your car in one spot and walk to different shops. Replace your desk and desk chair with a standing desk. Try substituting a stability ball for your desk chair a few hours a day. Rake leaves and shovel snow instead of using a leaf blower or snow blower.
          Find a workout buddy. Workouts with a friend can be more enjoyable, plus you're less likely to cancel on the spur of the moment.
          Bugged by bad weather or early darkness? Buy equipment necessary for exercising at home, join a gym, try a class in your community, or walk the mall or an indoor athletic track at a local school.
        
        When motivation flags, remind yourself of your goals, plan small rewards, ask a friend to check up on you, or consider working out with a personal trainer.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-tests-do-at-home-tests-work-on-newer-variants,COVID tests: Do at-home tests work on newer variants?,"If you develop respiratory symptoms, you may worry that you have COVID-19. One easy way to check is with an at-home COVID test. These tests are widely available at drugstores, supermarkets, and online retailers like Amazon.
        Here's a closer look at at-home COVID tests: how they work, when to test, and how to get free COVID test kits.
        How do at-home COVID tests work?
        COVID-19 is caused by the SARS CoV-2 virus. At-home over-the-counter (OTC) COVID-19 tests look for proteins from the SARS CoV-2 virus. These proteins are called antigens. Results from rapid, at-home antigen tests are often available within 15 minutes. If you test positive, you are very likely to be infected. However, there is a higher chance of false negatives with antigen tests, which means that you could test negative and still have an active infection.
        Still, because at-home tests return results quickly and have a low false-positive rate, if they are used correctly, they can be very helpful.
        Do at-home COVID tests work against newer variants?
        At-home COVID tests should work against new COVID variants. ""The antigen that the at-home tests look for has remained fairly stable even as the virus mutates and new strains of COVID develop,"" explains Dr. Michelle Chan, an infectious disease physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School. Research suggests that in general, antigen tests do a good job of picking up a variety of COVID-19 variants.
        Can you use COVID tests after they've expired?
        Generally, the FDA doesn't recommend that you use expired COVID tests —  but don't throw out your tests just yet. The FDA has extended expiration dates for some COVID tests. Check this FDA website page to see if your home test kit has an extended expiration date.
        When should you test for COVID?
        ""You should use an at-home COVID test if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough, fever, and runny nose,"" advises Dr. Chan. You may also want to test if you were exposed to someone who has COVID-19, or if you are going to be around someone who is older or immunocompromised — anyone who is at high risk of becoming very ill from COVID-19 infection,"" adds Dr. Chan.
        In general, at-home COVID tests are most effective when you have respiratory symptoms. A study published in the journal Microbiology Spectrum looked at Binax COVID tests and found that they picked up almost 90% of COVID cases when people had symptoms. But they only picked up about half of asymptomatic cases.
        If you have a positive COVID test, you have the virus. If it's negative, the FDA recommends that you check again with a repeat test 48 hours later to reduce the chance of a false negative.
        Free COVID test kits
        At-home COVID tests can be expensive. You can order free government COVID test kits by mail at this U.S. Department of Health & Human Services website. Each household can receive one order of four tests for free.
        If you need an at-home test earlier, call your insurance company. Some plans still offer some coverage of at-home COVID tests.
        COVID and flu combination tests: What to know
        The FDA has granted emergency use authorizations for several at-home, OTC, combined flu and COVID-19 tests. One test that has received FDA marketing authorization, the Healgen Rapid Check COVID-19/Flu A&B Antigen Test, can pick up over 90% of cases of both COVID-19 and the flu.
        ""If you have respiratory symptoms, it's an easy way to figure out if you have the flu, COVID-19, or both, without needing to venture out to your doctor's office,"" explains Dr. Chan. You can support public health efforts to track COVID and flu levels in the U.S. by reporting your test result (whether it's positive or negative) here.
        The best defense against both COVID-19 and the flu is to get vaccinated for both. Vaccines reduce the risk of infections, as well as developing complications if you do get sick.",Hallie Levine,"January 6, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-liquid-biopsy-for-metastatic-prostate-cancer-202501033085,A liquid biopsy for metastatic prostate cancer,"Metastatic prostate cancer can progress in different ways. In some men the disease advances rapidly, while other men have slower-growing cancer and a better prognosis. Researchers are developing various tools for predicting how fast prostate cancer might progress. Among the most promising are assays that count circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood samples.
        Prostate cancer spreads by shedding CTCs into the bloodstream, so higher counts in blood generally reflect worse disease. Sometimes referred to as a liquid biopsy, the CTC assay can help doctors decide if patients should get standard or more aggressive treatment. Just one CTC assay is currently on the market for prostate cancer. Called CellSearch, its use is so far limited to men with late-stage metastatic cancer for whom hormonal therapies are no longer effective.
        Using CTC data
        Hormonal therapies block testosterone, a hormone that drives prostate tumors to grow. Research shows that high CTC counts predict poorer survival and faster disease progression among patients with metastatic prostate cancer who become resistant to this form of treatment. But new research shows CTC counts are also predictive for early-stage metastatic prostate cancer that still responds to hormonal therapy.
        Why is that important? Because the earlier doctors can predict a cancer's trajectory, the better their ability to select patients who could benefit from more powerful (and potentially more aggressive) drug combinations or a clinical trial. Conversely, men who are older or frail might be treated less aggressively if doctors had better insights into their prognosis.
        How the study was done
        The investigators collected blood samples from 503 newly-diagnosed patients with hormonally-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer who had enrolled in a clinical trial with experimental hormonal therapies. The team collected baseline samples at trial registration, and then another set of samples after the treatments were no longer working. CTC counts were divided in three categories:
        
          more than 5 CTCs per 7.5 milliliters (mLs) of blood
          between 1 and 4 CTCs per 7.5 mLs of blood
          zero CTCs per 7.5 mLs of blood.
        
        What the research showed
        Results showed that men with higher baseline CTC counts fared worse regardless of which cancer drugs they were taking. Median survival for men with 5 or more CTCs per sample was 27.9 months compared to 56.2 months in men with 1 to 4 CTCs. There weren't enough patient deaths among those with 0 CTCs to calculate a survival rate.
        Similarly, higher CTC counts predicted faster onset of resistance to hormonal therapy: 11.3 months for men in the highest CTC category, compared to 20.7 months and 59 months for men with 1 to 4 and zero CTCs respectively. Importantly, higher CTC counts correlated with measures of prostate cancer severity, including PSA levels, numbers of metastases in bone, and other indicators.
        Observations and comments
        ""This research emphasizes the continued emergence of CTCs in helping to determine outcomes and potentially treatment options for men with metastatic prostate cancer,"" said Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases.
        ""Still to be determined is how this type of testing compares with more traditional evaluations of disease advancement, such as x-rays, bone scans, and other types of imaging. Ready access to cancer cells in blood that, in turn, eliminate the need for more invasive biopsy procedures of metastatic deposits will be a welcome addition — especially if future studies show that CTCs inform more precise treatment choices.""
        Dr. David Einstein, a medical oncologist specializing in genitourinary cancers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, agreed with that assessment. ""But the Holy Grail is finding predictive biomarkers [like CTCs] that tell you if patients will or will not benefit from particular treatments,"" he added. ""Answering these types of questions requires randomized clinical trials.""",Charlie Schmidt,"January 3, 2025"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/7-ways-to-reduce-stress-and-keep-blood-pressure-down,7 ways to reduce stress and keep blood pressure down,"When it comes to preventing and treating high blood pressure, one often-overlooked strategy is managing stress. If you often find yourself tense and on-edge, try these seven ways to reduce stress.
        
          Get enough sleep. Inadequate or poor-quality sleep can negatively affect your mood, mental alertness, energy level, and physical health.
          Learn relaxation techniques. Meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, deep breathing exercises, and yoga are powerful relaxation techniques and stress-busters.
          Strengthen your social network. Connect with others by taking a class, joining an organization, or participating in a support group.
          Hone your time-management skills. The more efficiently you can juggle work and family demands, the lower your stress level.
          Try to resolve stressful situations if you can. Don't let stressful situations fester. Hold family problem-solving sessions and use negotiation skills at home and at work.
          Nurture yourself. Treat yourself to a massage. Truly savor an experience: for example, eat slowly and really focus on the taste and sensations of each bite. Take a walk or a nap, or listen to your favorite music.
          Ask for help. Don't be afraid to ask for help from your spouse, friends, and neighbors. If stress and anxiety persist, talk to your doctor.
        
        Along with these ways to reduce stress, add in a healthy lifestyle — maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, regular exercise, and a diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthful fats — and high blood pressure could be a thing of the past.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sleep-apnea-and-heart-disease-a-weighty-matter,Sleep apnea and heart disease: A weighty matter,"In addition to helping control diabetes and obesity, the popular drugs known as GLP-1 agonists may also alleviate another disorder that's closely linked to cardiovascular problems: obstructive sleep apnea. This common condition — which is marked by brief pauses in breathing, often accompanied by loud snoring — doesn't just leave people groggy and sleepy during the day. Left untreated, this serious disorder raises the odds of high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke.
        Excess weight is the strongest risk factor linked with sleep apnea, which affects about 25% of men and 10% of women in the United States. More than half of people with the condition are overweight or obese, and the risk rises as body size increases, according to Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Extra fat tissue in the neck and throat can narrow the airway, and extra weight on the chest and belly puts pressure on the lungs, which makes the normal process of inhaling and exhaling less effective,"" she explains.
        
          
            
              
                What happens during sleep apnea?
                
                  
                
                The 10- to 30-second breathing pauses that characterize sleep apnea occur when the airway in your nose or throat becomes partially or completely blocked by large tonsils, a large tongue, or too much tissue in the airway.

        Treating sleep apnea
        In sleep apnea, the breathing pauses happen when the airway briefly closes (see ""What happens during sleep apnea?""). The first-line treatment is positive airway pressure (PAP), which uses a small bedside machine to push a forceful stream of air to a mask covering the nose or the nose and mouth to keep the airway open.
        A recent study found that one of the GLP-1 drugs, tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for obesity) can slash the number of breathing interruptions during sleep — a key measure of sleep apnea severity. Published June 21, 2024, in The New England Journal of Medicine, the yearlong study included 469 people with obesity and moderate-to-severe sleep apnea, some of whom used PAP machines when sleeping. Compared with people who got a placebo injection, those treated with tirzepatide had a nearly 59% drop in their apnea-hypopnea index, a measure that describes the number of times a person's breathing slows or stops during an hour of sleep. Those taking tirzepatide lost close to 20% of their body weight.
        Ditch your PAP machine?
        ""At least once a week, I see people in my clinic who have lost so much weight on one of the obesity drugs that they don't need to use their PAP machine any longer,"" says Dr. Javaheri. (The other GLP-1 obesity drug, semaglutide, is sold as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss). ""Several patients lost between 50 and 60 pounds, which was enough to completely cure their sleep apnea."" While tirzepatide is not approved for treating sleep apnea, it's currently under consideration by the FDA for that use. However, even if you qualify for a prescription for either semaglutide or tirzepatide based on your medical conditions, these medications can be challenging to obtain due high demand, limited supplies, cost, and other factors.
        That said, the growing list of health benefits from GLP-1 agonists (see ""Anti-obesity drug lowers heart-related problems"" in the February 2024 Heart Letter) may make them both more accessible and affordable in the future. If and when tirzepatide is approved for treating sleep apnea, sleep medicine clinics will likely provide the medication, says Dr. Javaheri.
        Weight loss has long been recommended for sleep apnea sufferers who are overweight or obese. After people lose at least 10% of their initial weight (that is, their weight at diagnosis), insurance companies usually pay for another sleep study to see if they've improved enough to stop using PAP, which people often find cumbersome and inconvenient. ""But I advise people using anti-obesity drugs to wait until they reach their goal weight before getting retested,"" says Dr. Javaheri.
        Other contributors to sleep apnea
        Finally, it's worth noting that obesity is just one of the factors that predispose people to sleep apnea, which also occurs in people who aren't overweight. ""Some people are born with anatomical differences that leave them prone to sleep apnea, such as a narrow airway, a thicker neck, a large tongue, enlarged tonsils, or a small, receding chin,"" says Dr. Javaheri. ""Smoking also increases the risk of sleep apnea significantly, and alcohol can cause sleep apnea or make it worse,"" she adds.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/letting-the-air-out,Letting the air out,"Belching loud and proud was a badge of honor as a kid. But once we're adults, belching (or burping) can be annoying and embarrassing in the company of others.
        But people shouldn't be repelled by belching, as it serves an essential purpose. ""Belching is a protective mechanism against the stomach getting overinflated from swallowing too much air,"" says Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Think about how great you feel when you have a good belch.""
        Anatomy of a belch
        There are two types of belching: gastric belching and supragastric belching.
        Gastric belching is the everyday kind that most people experience. Every time you swallow, you take in a little air, and some of it travels down the esophagus and into the upper part of the stomach. When the stomach begins to stretch out from this air, sensors in its wall send signals to your esophagus. These signals tell the sphincter (the small ring of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus) to open, allowing air that has built up in the stomach to escape up and out as a belch.
        A gastric belch often smells. ""The air might have the odor of whatever you recently ate,"" says Dr. Staller. By contrast, with supragastric belching, swallowed air stays in the esophagus and never makes it to the stomach. The air gets quickly expelled in fast and frequent odorless belches.
        People can swallow too much air for various reasons. For example:
        Eating too fast. ""When you eat quickly, you gulp more air, which is why people often feel the urge to belch after eating,"" says Dr. Staller. The solution is to eat slower so you swallow less air. Try this: At the beginning of your meal, set a timer for 20 minutes. Then pace yourself to make your meal last until the timer goes off. Chew each mouthful 30 times, and put your fork down between bites.
        Carbonated beverages. Drinks like beer, soda, and seltzer can bring extra air into the esophagus and stomach. Gulping these drinks or using a straw can also increase air intake. Cutting down on carbonated beverages, drinking slower, and not using a straw can help.
        Gum and hard candy. Chewing gum and sucking on hard candies also can lead to inadvertent air swallowing.
        
          
            
              
                What if you can't belch?
                If you can't belch, you may have a condition called retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction (R-CPD), also known as ""no burp syndrome."" ""We still have a lot to learn about R-CPD, as there are limited data on the efficacy of treatment or how to make a true diagnosis,"" says gastroenterologist Dr. Kyle Staller at Massachusetts General Hospital.
                R-CPD is believed to occur when the cricopharyngeus muscle, a sphincter muscle that sits at the top of the esophagus, cannot relax and, as a result, does not open to allow air to exit the esophagus.
                As a result, air accumulates in the stomach, esophagus, and intestines, causing bloating and pressure in the abdomen, chest, and lower neck, and gurgling sounds from the chest and neck. Because the air cannot leave through the esophagus, it instead exits the body as flatulence, which is often excessive.
                Treatment options for R-CPD include a botulinum toxin injection into the cricopharyngeus muscle or surgery to cut partway through it. Both of these approaches allow the muscle to relax and air to exit the esophagus.
              
            
          
        
        Sound of trouble
        Belching is usually nothing to worry about, says Dr. Staller, but he suggests seeing your doctor if it becomes more frequent and causes distress and discomfort. Excessive belching is a common symptom for digestive disorders like functional dyspepsia (recurring symptoms of an upset stomach with no obvious cause) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
        ""Belching could be a red flag if it accompanies other symptoms like sudden weight loss, difficulty swallowing, or blood in the stool,"" says Dr. Staller. Problematic belching also could be related to stress or anxiety, and treating these issues with psychotherapy and diaphragmatic breathing techniques often helps.
         When you do feel a belch coming, don't try to squelch it. ""There is little you can do to stop it,"" says Dr. Staller. ""You can be discreet by muffling a belch or holding it in for a few seconds until you're in a more private setting, but eventually, your body will win.""
        So, when you must belch, let it out and just say, ""Excuse me.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/clearing-up-a-foggy-memory,Clearing up a foggy memory,"At some point, most older adults experience ""senior moments."" You misplace your phone or keys, lose your train of thought during a conversation, forget directions or a name minutes after being told, or walk into a room and don't know why.
        These moments of brain fogginess can be stressful and embarrassing, but are they ever cause for concern? ""The brain is like any other part of the body, and over time, it may not function as well as it used to,"" says neuropsychologist Julie Brody Magid, clinical director of the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital Memory Disorders Assessment Clinic. ""While most memory glitches are part of normal aging, in some cases they are exacerbated by problems that people can manage.""
        Aging and the brain
        People often notice memory lapses beginning in their 50s or 60s. This is when age-related chemical and structural changes begin in brain regions devoted to memory, such as the hippocampus and frontal lobes.
        These brain regions begin to shrink, often related to narrowing of the small arteries that deliver oxygen and nutrients. ""These changes can make learning and recalling new and existing information slightly more challenging,"" says Brody Magid.
        Yet age is not always to blame. Your doctor can help you sort out whether there are other problems contributing to your memory lapses. Here are some of the possibilities:
        Depression, anxiety, and stress. Depression can disrupt the brain's ability to focus, process, and access information, according to Brody Magid. Chronic stress and anxiety can flood the brain with the stress hormone cortisol, which, over time, can affect the brain regions responsible for storing and recalling information. ""Depression, stress, and anxiety can also cause negative and preoccupying thoughts that keep people from focusing and being present, which may contribute to memory issues,"" says Brody Magid.
        Medication. Brain fogginess can be a common side effect of some medications. ""If you are taking a new drug, either prescription or over the counter, ask your doctor or pharmacist if it could be affecting your cognition,"" says Brody Magid.
        Sleep. Research has linked a decline in brain functions with sleep problems, such as sleeping less than the recommended seven to eight hours nightly, fragmented sleep, and sleep disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea.
        
          
            
              
                Mind tricks
                Even though most memory lapses are normal, you can take measures to manage and improve your existing brain skills. Here are some memory obstacles people encounter and ways to deal with them.
                Absentmindedness. This happens when you take on too many tasks or get distracted. When faced with multiple tasks, make a list, put them in order of importance, and focus on only one at a time before moving on to the next. Setting up routines and reminders can also help. For example, create a memory table by your front door or in the bedroom where you place vital objects, like your phone, medicines, keys, and glasses.
                Blocking. A common example of blocking is remembering and recalling names. When you meet someone, try linking that person with something that may help trigger name recall, like their hobby, work, background, or spouse. Another method is to associate the person with someone with the same name or a similar one, like a relative, celebrity, or movie character.
                Transience. Transience is the loss over time of certain memories like facts and events. To help retain specific memories, keep the information active in your memory; for instance, share it in conversation whenever possible, record it for future reference, and review related photographs.
              
            
          
        
        When to get checked
        If memory lapses become more frequent or substantial enough to interfere with your daily life or safety, you should get checked out, says Brody Magid.
        When speaking with your doctor, provide as much detailed information as possible surrounding your memory glitches.
        For instance, were you distracted because you were upset about something or were juggling too much at once? Does your memory recover in the moment, or does it take time for your brain to ""kick in""? Is there a pattern to your memory lapses?
        ""All of this background information can help your doctor determine if lifestyle factors or medical issues might be at play and need to be addressed, or if you need a formal examination at a memory clinic,"" says Brody Magid.

        Over six months, those who wore accelerometers, on average, increased their moderate-to-vigorous daily activity by 20 minutes and decreased their sedentary time by 40 minutes. While their back pain did not improve, they did report that their pain did not worsen, whereas the people in the sedentary group reported a rise in back pain intensity. The results add to existing evidence that even small changes in daily activity — moving more and sitting less — can benefit people with back pain.

The men completed food questionnaires to establish a Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score ranging from zero to 100. The HEI score reflects a person's overall diet quality based on recommendations from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, such as consuming a variety of foods across main food groups (grains, vegetables, fruits, milk, and meat) and limiting intake of total and saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.
        Participants were followed for approximately 6.5 years. Over that period, the prostate cancer was less likely to grow and spread in the men with higher HEI scores (indicating they followed a healthy diet), compared with the men who had lower HEI scores.
        A possible connection between diet and prostate cancer may relate to inflammation, which can fuel cancer growth. Men with high HEI scores followed a diet with known anti-inflammatory foods. In comparison, low HEI scores reflected diets with higher amounts of inflammatory foods.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/should-you-be-tested-for-inflammation-202203292715,Should you be tested for inflammation?,"Let's face it: inflammation has a bad reputation. Much of it is well-deserved. After all, long-term inflammation contributes to chronic illnesses and deaths. If you just relied on headlines for health information, you might think that stamping out inflammation would eliminate cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, and perhaps aging itself.
        Unfortunately, that's not true.
        Still, our understanding of how chronic inflammation can impair health has expanded dramatically in recent years. And with this understanding come three common questions: Could I have inflammation without knowing it? How can I find out if I do? Are there tests for inflammation? Indeed, there are.
        Testing for inflammation
        A number of well-established tests to detect inflammation are commonly used in medical care. But it's important to note these tests can't distinguish between acute inflammation, which might develop with a cold, pneumonia, or an injury, and the more damaging chronic inflammation that may accompany diabetes, obesity, or an autoimmune disease, among other conditions. Understanding the difference between acute and chronic inflammation is important.

    Fighting Chronic Inflammation


                
                    Chronic inflammation plays a central role in some of the most challenging diseases of our time, including rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, and even Alzheimer’s. This report will examine the role that chronic inflammation plays in these conditions, and will also provide information on the breadth of drugs currently available to alleviate symptoms. Drug choices range from simple aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that’s been available for more than a century, to disease-modifying drugs and so-called biologics that promise more targeted treatments.

These are four of the most common tests for inflammation:
        
          Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sed rate or ESR). This test measures how fast red blood cells settle to the bottom of a vertical tube of blood. When inflammation is present the red blood cells fall faster, as higher amounts of proteins in the blood make those cells clump together. While ranges vary by lab, a normal result is typically 20 mm/hr or less, while a value over 100 mm/hr is quite high.
          C-reactive protein (CRP). This protein made in the liver tends to rise when inflammation is present. A normal value is less than 3 mg/L. A value over 3 mg/L is often used to identify an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but bodywide inflammation can make CRP rise to 100 mg/L or more.
          Ferritin. This is a blood protein that reflects the amount of iron stored in the body. It's most often ordered to evaluate whether an anemic person is iron-deficient, in which case ferritin levels are low. Or, if there is too much iron in the body, ferritin levels may be high. But ferritin levels also rise when inflammation is present. Normal results vary by lab and tend to be a bit higher in men, but a typical normal range is 20 to 200 mcg/L.
          Fibrinogen. While this protein is most commonly measured to evaluate the status of the blood clotting system, its levels tend to rise when inflammation is present. A normal fibrinogen level is 200 to 400 mg/dL.
        
        Are tests for inflammation useful?
        In certain situations, tests to measure inflammation can be quite helpful.
        
          Diagnosing an inflammatory condition. One example of this is a rare condition called giant cell arteritis, in which the ESR is nearly always elevated. If symptoms such as new, severe headache and jaw pain suggest that a person may have this disease, an elevated ESR can increase the suspicion that the disease is present, while a normal ESR argues against this diagnosis.
          Monitoring an inflammatory condition. When someone has rheumatoid arthritis, for example, ESR or CRP (or both tests) help determine how active the disease is and how well treatment is working.
        
        None of these tests is perfect. Sometimes false negative results occur when inflammation actually is present. False positive results may occur when abnormal test results suggest inflammation even when none is present.
        Should you be routinely tested for inflammation?
        Currently, tests of inflammation are not a part of routine medical care for all adults, and expert guidelines do not recommend them.
        CRP testing to assess cardiac risk is encouraged to help decide whether preventive treatment is appropriate for some people (such as those with a risk of a heart attack that is intermediate — that is, neither high nor low). However, for most people evidence suggests that routine CRP testing adds relatively little to assessment using standard risk factors, such as a history of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, and positive family history of heart disease.
        So far, only one group I know of recommends routine testing for inflammation for all without a specific reason: companies selling inflammation tests directly to consumers.
        Inflammation may be silent — so why not test?
        It's true that chronic inflammation may not cause specific symptoms. But looking for evidence of inflammation through a blood test without any sense of why it might be there is much less helpful than having routine health care that screens for common causes of silent inflammation, including
        
          
            excess weight
          
          
            diabetes
          
          cardiovascular disease (including heart attacks and stroke)
          hepatitis C and other chronic infections
          autoimmune disease.
        
        Standard medical evaluation for most of these conditions does not require testing for inflammation. And your medical team can recommend the right treatments if you do have one of these conditions.
        The bottom line
        Testing for inflammation has its place in medical evaluation, and in monitoring certain health conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. But it's not clearly helpful as a routine test for everyone. A better approach is to adopt healthy habits and get routine medical care that can identify and treat the conditions that contribute to harmful inflammation.","Robert H.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/why-all-the-buzz-about-inflammation-and-just-how-bad-is-it-202203162705,Why all the buzz about inflammation — and just how bad is it?,"Quick health quiz: how bad is inflammation for your body?
        You're forgiven if you think inflammation is very bad. News sources everywhere will tell you it contributes to the top causes of death worldwide. Heart disease, stroke, dementia, and cancer all have been linked to chronic inflammation. And that's just the short list. So, what can you do to reduce inflammation in your body?
        Good question! Before we get to the answers, though, let's review what inflammation is — and isn't.
        Inflammation 101
        Misconceptions abound about inflammation. One standard definition describes inflammation as the body's response to an injury, allergy, or infection, causing redness, warmth, pain, swelling, and limitation of function. That's right if we're talking about a splinter in your finger, bacterial pneumonia, or the rash of poison ivy. But it's only part of the story, because there's more than one type of inflammation:
        
          Acute inflammation rears up suddenly, lasts days to weeks, and then settles down once the cause, such as an injury or infection, is under control. Generally, acute inflammation is a reaction that attempts to restore the health of the affected area. That's the type described in the definition above.
          Chronic inflammation is quite different. It can develop for no medically apparent reason, last a lifetime, and cause harm rather than healing. This type of inflammation is often linked with chronic disease, such as:
          
            
              
                excess weight
              
              
                diabetes
              
              cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and stroke
              certain infections, such as hepatitis C
              
                autoimmune disease
              
              
                cancer
              
              stress, whether psychological or physical.
            
          
        
        Which cells are involved in inflammation?
        The cells involved with both types of inflammation are part of the body's immune system. That makes sense, because the immune system defends the body from attacks of all kinds.
        Depending on the duration, location, and cause of trouble, a variety of immune cells, such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages, rush in to create inflammation. Each type of cell has its own particular role to play, including attacking foreign invaders, creating antibodies, and removing dead cells.
        4 inflammation myths and misconceptions
        Inflammation is the root cause of most modern illness.
        Not so fast. Yes, a number of chronic diseases are accompanied by inflammation. In many cases, controlling that inflammation is an important part of treatment. And it's true that unchecked inflammation contributes to long-term health problems.
        But inflammation is not the direct cause of most chronic diseases. For example, blood vessel inflammation occurs with atherosclerosis. Yet we don't know whether chronic inflammation caused this, or whether the key contributors were standard risk factors (such as high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking — all of which cause inflammation).
        You know when you're inflamed.
        True for some conditions. People with rheumatoid arthritis, for example, know when their joints are inflamed because they experience more pain, swelling, and stiffness. But the type of inflammation seen in obesity, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, for example, causes no specific symptoms. Sure, fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and other symptoms are sometimes attributed to inflammation. But plenty of people have those symptoms without inflammation.
        Controlling chronic inflammation would eliminate most chronic disease.
        Not so. Effective treatments typically target the cause of inflammation, rather than just suppressing inflammation itself. For example, a person with rheumatoid arthritis may take steroids or other anti-inflammatory medicines to reduce their symptoms. But to avoid permanent joint damage, they also take a medicine like methotrexate to treat the underlying condition that's causing inflammation.
        Anti-inflammatory diets or certain foods (blueberries! kale! garlic!) prevent disease by suppressing inflammation.
        While it's true that some foods and diets are healthier than others, it's not clear their benefits are due to reducing inflammation. Switching from a typical Western diet to an ""anti-inflammatory diet"" (such as the Mediterranean diet) improves health in multiple ways. Reducing inflammation is just one of many possible mechanisms.
        The bottom line
        Inflammation isn't a lone villain cutting short millions of lives each year. The truth is, even if you could completely eliminate inflammation — sorry, not possible — you wouldn't want to. Among other problems, quashing inflammation would leave you unable to mount an effective response to infections, allergens, toxins or injuries.
        Inflammation is complicated. Acute inflammation is your body's natural, usually helpful response to injury, infection, or other dangers. But it sometimes sparks problems of its own or spins out of control. We need to better understand what causes inflammation and what prompts it to become chronic. Then we can treat an underlying cause, instead of assigning the blame for every illness to inflammation or hoping that eating individual foods will reduce it.
        There's no quick or simple fix for unhealthy inflammation. To reduce it, we need to detect, prevent, and treat its underlying causes. Yet there is good news. Most often, inflammation exists in your body for good reason and does what it's supposed to do. And when it is causing trouble, you can take steps to improve the situation.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","December 18, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-can-cause-blood-in-stool,What can cause blood in stool?,"Discovering blood in your stool can be alarming, but it doesn't always signal a serious medical condition. Regardless of the cause, it's crucial to seek medical advice if you notice blood in your stool, as early detection and treatment can lead to better outcomes if it is caused by something serious.

What does blood in stool look like?

The appearance of blood in stool can vary, and the color of the blood often gives clues about the source of bleeding.


	Bright red blood usually suggests bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract, such as the rectum or anus, and may be visible on toilet paper, in the toilet bowl, or on the surface of the stool. Small amounts of blood in the toilet bowl or on toilet paper are often linked to conditions like hemorrhoids or anal fissures. However, certain foods such as beets, tomatoes, or foods with red food coloring can also cause stools to appear reddish. If you notice larger amounts of bright red blood, you should immediately let your healthcare provider know.
	Dark or tarry stools may indicate bleeding from a higher part of the digestive tract such as the stomach or small intestine. As the blood moves through the gastrointestinal system, it may be partially digested, resulting in a black, sticky appearance. However, certain foods, including blood sausage, blueberries, and black licorice, can also lead to dark stools. So can iron supplements, bismuth subsalicylate (found in Pepto-Bismol), and activated charcoal.


What can cause blood in stool?

There are many potential causes of rectal bleeding or blood in stool, ranging from minor issues like foods recently eaten, hemorrhoids, or anal fissures to more significant concerns such as gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, or inflammatory bowel diseases.

Hemorrhoids

Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels that can develop either externally (around the anus) or internally (in the lower rectum). They are the most common cause of rectal bleeding in middle-aged and older adults. Factors such as chronic constipation, straining during bowel movements, pregnancy, and prolonged sitting on the toilet can cause hemorrhoids. Symptoms of hemorrhoids can include rectal pain, itching, bleeding, and, in some cases, prolapse, where the hemorrhoids protrude through the anal canal.

Anal fissures

Anal fissures are small tears in the skin of the anal canal, often caused by constipation and straining to pass hard stools. Fissures can also occur due to diarrhea, vaginal childbirth, or infections. Common symptoms of anal fissures include sharp pain during bowel movements, itching around the anus, muscle spasms in the anal area, a lump or skin tag near the anus, and bright red blood in the stool, which may be seen on toilet paper after a bowel movement.

Diverticulosis

Diverticulosis occurs when weak spots in the inner wall of the colon cause small pouches to form. Over time, the blood vessels within these pouches can become fragile and prone to rupture, leading to bleeding. While diverticulosis is quite common, many people are unaware that they have it.

Colon polyps

Colon polyps are growths that occur in the large intestine (also called the colon). They are quite common — between 15% and 40% of adults may have polyps. Most polyps are benign, but some have the potential to develop into cancer over time. Removing polyps is an important step in preventing colorectal cancer.

Most people with colon polyps don't experience symptoms. However, you should see your doctor immediately for advice if you develop rectal bleeding, as it may be a sign of polyps.

Gastrointestinal infections

Certain gastrointestinal infections can cause inflammation and irritation anywhere in the digestive tract. Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial overgrowth in the stomach that can lead to bleeding ulcers and black stools. Other bacteria and parasites that infect the intestines can cause bright red blood in the stool, often associated with abdominal cramps and diarrhea.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease — results from an abnormal reaction by the body's immune system. This can expose your entire gastrointestinal system to inflammation and lead to a series of digestive problems including abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, more urgent bowel movements, and bloody stools.

Colon cancer

Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the tissues of the colon or rectum. When cancer originates in the colon, it is referred to as colon cancer. While colorectal cancer may not always cause noticeable symptoms, common signs can include changes in bowel habits, blood in the stool (either bright red or dark), frequent gas pains, bloating, feelings of fullness or cramping, weight loss, and fatigue.

Screening for colon cancer saves lives. Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard screening test because polyps identified during the procedure can be removed before they become cancerous. Colonoscopy can also detect early cancers that can be cured with surgery. Alternative tests include stool tests for DNA and occult blood, with or without sigmoidoscopy.

When should you see a doctor for blood in stool?

Anyone experiencing persistent or recurring blood in the stool, even in small amounts, should schedule an appointment with their doctor. The stool should be assessed by a health care provider to identify the underlying cause.",Jenette Restivo,"December 17, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/pseudogout-cppd-a-to-z,Pseudogout (CPPD),"What is pseudogout?
        Pseudogout is a form of arthritis triggered by deposits of calcium crystals (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate) in the joints. It is also called calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD). This disease can cause short-term or long-term swelling in joints, most often the knee, wrist, shoulder, ankle, or elbow.
        As the name suggests, this condition can appear similar to gout, which is caused by another type of crystal — uric acid crystals — and commonly causes sudden pain and swelling in a single joint, usually in the foot. Pseudogout also can resemble osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.
        Pseudogout is most common in the elderly. It affects about 3% of people in their 60s and as many as half of people in their 90s. Many people who get pseudogout already have joint damage from other conditions, or they may have age-related degenerative joint disease. One theory is that an injury to cartilage allows calcium crystals to be released into the joint space, and these crystals cause inflammation.
        In some cases, other medical conditions can make people more likely to develop pseudogout. These include:
        
          a genetic disorder of iron overload (hemochromatosis)
          high blood levels of calcium (hypercalcemia)
          too little magnesium (hypomagnesemia) in the blood.
        
        Pseudogout also can be triggered by joint injury, such as joint surgery or a sprain, or the stress of a medical illness. Frequently, however, nothing can be identified that might have triggered the disease. Although age-related joint degeneration, prior joint damage or trauma, and these other medical conditions increase the likelihood of an attack of pseudogout, the reason some people develop this condition while others do not is often unknown.
        Symptoms of pseudogout
        The most common symptoms are pain, swelling, and stiffness around a single joint, especially the knee or wrist. Occasionally, more than one joint is affected at the same time. A low-grade fever may occur during the flare.
        Diagnosing pseudogout
        Diagnosing pseudogout can be tricky because it can resemble gout, an infection, or other causes of joint inflammation. Also, pseudogout is commonly associated with other joint problems.
        X-rays may reveal calcium deposits along the affected joints, although x-rays of many healthy elderly people often show such deposits even when the person has no symptoms of pseudogout. Your doctor may recommend that joint fluid be removed from an inflamed joint. The sample will be tested for the presence of calcium pyrophosphate crystals. The sample may also need to be tested for an infection or other cause of joint inflammation.
        Your doctor may want to request tests for conditions that can trigger pseudogout. These may include tests of iron, calcium, magnesium and thyroid function.
        Expected duration of pseudogout
        Attacks of pseudogout can last for days or weeks. If the condition is not diagnosed and treated, it can cause the joint to degenerate (break down).
        Preventing pseudogout
        Treatment of a condition that increases the risk of pseudogout (such as hemochromatosis) may prevent development of the disease or repeated attacks. However, when there is no known cause or trigger, there is no way to prevent the development of pseudogout. For people with frequent attacks, taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine daily may prevent future attacks.
        Treating pseudogout
        Fluid can be removed from the joint to ease the pressure. In this procedure, called joint aspiration, a needle is inserted into the joint after the area is numbed, to withdraw fluid. Treatment usually also includes NSAIDs or injections of a medication called a glucocorticoid to keep the swelling down. These two treatments usually eliminate symptoms within hours to a few days.
        You may also need to take oral corticosteroids for a short time. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine called colchicine or an NSAID to prevent attacks. For people with frequent attacks or chronic joint inflammation due to pseudogout despite treatments mentioned, other medications to reduce inflammation may be recommended such as hydroxychloroquine or methotrexate. If other treatments aren't effective, newer medications such as anakinra or tocilizumab may be recommended.
        Occasionally, people with recurrent or chronic pseudogout may develop degenerative joint disease. In this case, surgery (such as joint replacement) may become the only effective treatment.
        When to call a professional
        If you experience significant joint pain, especially if the joint is swollen, contact your doctor.
        Prognosis
        With treatment, the outlook for pseudogout is usually good. Joint pain and swelling usually go away promptly. It's common for attacks to return, but usually they can be controlled with repeated treatment.

Today that's not necessarily true. Instead of giving small doses (called fractions) per session until the full plan is completed, radiation delivery is moving toward high-dose fractions that can be given with fewer sessions over shorter durations.
        This ""hypofractionated"" strategy is more convenient for patients, and mounting evidence shows it can be accomplished safely. With one technology called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), patients can finish their treatment plans within a week, as opposed to a month or more. Several devices are available to deliver hypofractionated therapy, so patients may also hear it referred to as CyberKnife or by other brand names.
        An SBRT session takes about 20 to 30 minutes, and the experience is similar to receiving an x-ray. Often, doctors will first insert small metal pellets shaped like grains of rice into the prostate gland. Called fiducials, these pellets function as markers that help doctors target the tumor more precisely, so that radiation beams avoid healthy tissue. During treatment, a patient lies still while the radiation-delivery machine rotates around his body, administering the therapy.

How good is SBRT at controlling prostate cancer? Results from a randomized controlled clinical trial show that SBRT and conventional radiotherapy offer the same long-term benefits.
        How the study was conducted
        The trial enrolled 874 men with localized prostate cancer, meaning cancer that is still confined to the prostate gland. The men ranged between 65 and 74 years in age, and all of them had prostate cancer with a low or intermediate risk of further progression. The study randomized each of the men to one of two groups:
        
          Treatment group: The 433 men in this group each got SBRT at the same daily dose. The treatment plan was completed after five visits given over a span of one to two weeks.
          Control group: The 441 men in this group got conventional radiotherapy over durations ranging from four to 7.5 weeks.
        
        None of the men received additional hormonal therapy, which is a treatment that blocks the prostate cancer–promoting effects of testosterone.
        What the study showed
        After a median duration of 74 months (roughly six years), the research found little difference in cancer outcomes. Among men in the treatment group, 26 developed visibly recurring prostate cancer, or a spike in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels suggesting that newly-forming tumors were somewhere in the body (this is called a biochemical recurrence). By contrast, 36 men from the control group developed visible cancer or biochemical recurrence. Put another way, 95.8% of men from the SBRT group — and 94.6% of men in the control group — were still free of prostate cancer.
        A word of caution
        Earlier results published two years into the same study showed higher rates of genitourinary side effects among the SBRT-treated men. Typical genitourinary side effects include inflammatory reactions that increase pain during urination, or that can make men want to urinate more often. Some men develop incontinence or scar tissues that make urination more difficult. In all, 12% of men in the SBRT group experienced genitourinary side effects at two years, compared to 7% of the control subjects.

    Workout Workbook


                
                    The numbers are shocking. Just three out of 10 American adults are active enough to stay healthy and fit, and nearly four out of 10 admit they aren’t active at all, despite reams of research proving that exercise is a powerful preventive, and sometimes an antidote, for disability and illness. Which side of this divide are you standing on — and why? Maybe you’re not sure what blend of exercise is best. Or perhaps you know exactly what you need to do, but your workouts have become so humdrum that it’s harder than ever to dig up the energy to do them. Do you want to jump-start your sputtering exercise program? Or are you stuck on a plateau and wishing you could kick it up to the next level?

""Interestingly, patients who were treated with CyberKnife appeared to have lower significant toxicity at two years compared with those treated on other platforms,"" said Dr. Nima Aghdam, a radiation oncologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an instructor of radiation oncology at Harvard Medical School. By five years, the differences in side effects between men treated with SBRT or conventional radiation had disappeared.
        The authors advised that men might consider conventional radiation instead of SBRT if they have existing urinary problems before being treated for cancer. Patients with baseline urinary problems are ""more likely to have long-term toxic effects,"" the authors wrote, adding that the new findings should ""allow for better patient selection for SBRT, and more careful counseling.""
        ""This is an important study that validates what's becoming a standard practice,"" said Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases. ""The use of a five-day treatment schedule has been well received by patients who live long distances from a radiation facility, given that treatment can be completed during the weekdays of a single week. As with any cancer treatment choice, the selection of the appropriate patient is crucial to minimize any potential side effects, and this can only be done after a careful consideration of the patient's other medical conditions.""
        ""This elegant study will put to rest any questions regarding the validity of SBRT as a standard-of-care option for many patients with prostate cancer,"" Dr. Aghdam added. ""Importantly in this trial, we see excellent outcomes for many patients who were treated with radiation alone. As this approach gains broad acceptance in radiation oncology practices, it remains critical to carefully consider each patient based on their baseline characteristics, and employ the highest level of quality assurance in delivering large doses of radiation in fewer fractions. As the overall duration of radiation therapy gets shorter, every single treatment becomes that much more important.""",Charlie Schmidt,"December 10, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/warding-off-germs-this-winter-whats-helpful-whats-not,"Warding off germs this winter: What's helpful, what's not","If we've learned anything about harmful microbes in the past few years, it's that we need to be proactive about avoiding them. That's especially true during the winter months, when we see an increase in cases of common colds, COVID-19, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and ""stomach"" bugs (such as norovirus).
        How vigilant do you need to be to escape infection from those bugs this winter? It's time to learn what does and doesn't keep you safe, so you can decide which habits to keep and which to let go.
        Primary transmission
        Harmful microbes spread in several ways.
        Respiratory viruses — those that infect the upper respiratory tract (the nose, mouth, throat) or the lower respiratory tract (your windpipe and lungs) — are spread primarily when sick people cough, sneeze, or talk, sending infectious agents into the air. If you inhale them, you can get sick.
        It's also possible to contract a respiratory virus by touching recently contaminated surfaces and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth, although the risk is considered lower compared to inhaled viruses.
        ""Stomach"" bugs infect the stomach or intestines. These microbes are spread when microscopic particles of feces or vomit from an infected person get into your nose or mouth. This can happen when you have direct contact with infected people, share eating utensils with them, eat food that's prepared or handled by them, eat food or drinks contaminated with infected particles, or touch contaminated surfaces and then touch your mouth or nose.
        Strategies that can protect you
        Here are the best ways to protect yourself.
        Wash your hands regularly. Wash them after shaking someone's hand; as soon as you get home from being out; and throughout the day before touching your face (especially your nose or mouth), preparing or eating food, taking medication, or blowing your nose. Get your hands soapy and scrub for 20 seconds. ""Soap causes virus particles to burst open. Gastrointestinal viruses are hardier than other germs, which is why you need to wash your hands a little longer to protect against them,"" says Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Wear a face mask. Face masks, especially those labeled N95 or KN95, help keep viruses from entering your nose or mouth. ""Consider wearing a mask in crowded indoor settings, such as a theater, where germs move easily from person to person,"" Dr. Kuritzkes says. This is particularly true if you have lung or heart disease, and therefore are more vulnerable than most people if you get a respiratory infection.
        Get vaccinated. Vaccinations for COVID-19, RSV (for people ages 75 or older and those 60 to 74 with chronic conditions), and the flu have been shown to prevent people from getting severe illness. 
        Use caution around sick loved ones. If family members in your home have a respiratory or gastrointestinal bug, Dr. Kuritzkes advises that you avoid close contact, wear a mask when you're near them, and wear rubber or latex gloves to clean up after them. To disinfect surfaces contaminated by respiratory viruses, use commercial disinfectants or a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution. To disinfect surfaces contaminated by gastrointestinal bugs, use products that contain diluted bleach or quaternary ammonium. Don't  use both at once (they produce toxic fumes), and be aware that bleach can damage certain surfaces, such as wood.
        What you don't need to do
        It's natural to want to do as much as possible to stay healthy. But some practices, such as removing your shoes before entering your home, probably won't keep you safe from winter bugs, although it will help keep your rugs and carpets clean. ""Removing your shoes is a custom in many cultures, but there's no infectious disease basis for it. You won't catch anything from walking around your house with shoes on,"" Dr. Kuritzkes says.
        Here are other anti-germ approaches that probably won't make a difference.
        Washing your groceries or packages. ""It's true that in lab studies a virus can be recovered from surfaces for a few days, but that's done under special circumstances,"" Dr. Kuritzkes says. ""In reality, there's no concern about getting a respiratory virus by touching items at a supermarket or packages delivered to your home. Is it possible that you could contract a gastrointestinal bug if you pick up groceries or packages that were handled by someone who has norovirus? It's possible, but unlikely. Just wash your hands.""
        Cleaning your smartphone. Dr. Kuritzkes says it would be extraordinarily rare for you to get sick because you touched a contaminated surface and then touched your smartphone, which you put up to your face.
        Changing your clothes when you get home. Some people don't want to sit on a bed or sofa in the same clothes they wore outside the house, such as at work or on the bus or subway. But there's no evidence that you'll contract respiratory or gastrointestinal bugs if you do.
        Wearing a rubber or latex glove to touch a bank ATM machine or gas pump. Yes, lots of people have touched that ATM or gas pump before you, but all you need to do after touching it is use hand sanitizer, avoid touching your face, and wash your hands with soap and water when you can.
        The takeaway
        We all have to work hard to stay healthy. That includes maintaining good anti-germ strategies and taking care of ourselves — getting seven to nine hours of sleep each night, eating a healthy diet, limiting alcohol consumption, not smoking, and staying active. The combination of those habits keeps the immune system robust and ready to fight invading microbes.
        Should you give up some anti-germ habits if they're probably unnecessary? It's your decision. It won't hurt to follow them, as long as they don't cause you distress.
        ""Just try to be aware of your actions,"" Dr. Kuritzkes says, ""and don't let your guard down.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/an-action-plan-to-fight-unhealthy-inflammation-202205052739,An action plan to fight unhealthy inflammation,"Although inflammation serves a vital role in the body's defense and repair systems, chronic inflammation can cause more harm than good. And that may make you wonder: what can I do about it?
        In fact, there's a lot you can do. And you may already be doing it. That's because some of the most important ways to fight inflammation are measures you should be taking routinely.
        Let's take a look at key elements of fighting chronic inflammation: prevention, detection, and treatment.
        Six ways to prevent unhealthy inflammation
        Six of the most effective ways to ward off inflammation are:
        
          Choose a healthy diet. Individual foods have a rather small impact on bodywide inflammation, so no, eating more kale isn't likely to help much. But making sure you eat lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and legumes — sometimes called an anti-inflammatory diet — may reduce inflammation and lower risk for chronic illnesses like diabetes and heart disease. Not only can these diets help reduce inflammation on their own, but replacing foods that increase inflammation (such as sugary drinks and highly processed foods) benefits your body, too.
          Exercise regularly.Physical activity may help counter some types of inflammation through regulation of the immune system. For example, exercise has anti-inflammatory effects on white blood cells and chemical messengers called cytokines.
          Maintain a healthy weight. Because excess fat in cells stimulates bodywide inflammation, avoiding excess weight is an important way to prevent fat-related inflammation. Keeping your weight in check also reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes, a condition that itself causes chronic inflammation.
          Manage stress. Repeatedly triggered stress hormones contribute to chronic inflammation. Yoga, deep breathing, mindfulness practices, and other forms of relaxation can help calm your nervous system.
          Do not smoke. Toxins inhaled in cigarette smoke trigger inflammation in the airways, damage lung tissue, and increase the risk of lung cancer and other health problems.
          Try to prevent inflammatory conditions, such as
	Infection: Take measures to avoid infections that may cause chronic inflammation. HIV, hepatitis C, and COVID-19 are examples. Practicing safer sex, not sharing needles, and getting routine vaccinations are examples of effective preventive measures.Cancer: Get cancer screening on the schedule recommended by your doctors. For example, colonoscopy can detect and remove polyps that could later become cancerous.Allergies: By avoiding triggers of asthma, eczema, or allergic reactions you can reduce the burden of inflammation in your body.
        
        Do you need tests to detect inflammation?
        While testing for inflammation is not routinely recommended, it can be helpful in some situations. For example, tests for inflammation can help to diagnose certain conditions (such as temporal arteritis) or monitor how well treatment is controlling an inflammatory condition (such as Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis).
        However, there are no perfect tests for inflammation. And the best way to know if inflammation is present is to have routine medical care. Seeing a primary care physician, reviewing your medical history and any symptoms you have, having a physical examination, and having some basic medical tests are reasonable starting points. Such routine care does not typically include tests for inflammation.
        How is inflammation treated?
        At first glance, treating unhealthy, chronic inflammation may seem simple: you take anti-inflammatory medications, right? Actually, there's much more to it than that.
        Anti-inflammatory medicines can be helpful to treat an inflammatory condition. And we have numerous FDA-approved options that are widely available — many in inexpensive generic versions. What's more, these medicines have been around for decades.
        
          Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are the gold standard. These powerful anti-inflammatory medicines can be lifesaving in a variety of conditions, ranging from asthma to allergic reactions.
          Other anti-inflammatory medicines can also be quite effective for inflammatory conditions. Ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin — which may already be in your medicine cabinet — are among the 20 or so nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that come as pills, tablets, liquids taken by mouth, products applied to skin, injections, and even suppositories.
        
        Yet relying on anti-inflammatory medicines alone for chronic inflammation is often not the best choice. That's because these medicines may need to be taken for long periods of time and often cause unacceptable side effects. It's far better to seek and treat the cause of inflammation. Taking this approach may cure or contain many types of chronic inflammation. It may also eliminate the need for other anti-inflammatory treatments.
        For example, chronic liver inflammation due to hepatitis C infection can lead to liver scarring, cirrhosis, and eventually liver failure. Medicines to reduce inflammation do not solve the problem, aren't particularly effective, and may cause intolerable side effects. However, treatments available now can cure most cases of chronic hepatitis C. Once completed, there is no need for anti-inflammatory treatment.
        Similarly, among people with rheumatoid arthritis, anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen or steroids may be a short-term approach that helps ease symptoms, yet joint damage may progress unabated. Controlling the underlying condition with medicines like methotrexate or etanercept can protect the joints and eliminate the need for other anti-inflammatory drugs.
        The bottom line
        Even though we know that chronic inflammation is closely linked to a number of chronic diseases, quashing inflammation isn't the only approach, or the best one, in all cases.
        Fortunately, you can take measures to fight or even prevent unhealthy inflammation. Living an ""anti-inflammatory life"" isn't always easy. But if you can do it, there's an added bonus: measures considered to be anti-inflammatory are generally good for your health, with benefits that reach well beyond reducing inflammation.","Robert H.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-a-quick-snooze-help-with-energy-and-focus-the-science-behind-power-naps,Can a quick snooze help with energy and focus? The science behind power naps,"If you need a quick pick-me-up during the day, a power nap can be just the thing to help restore mental clarity and fight off fatigue. Power naps can help boost productivity and improve overall well-being, especially when taken at the right time and for the right duration.
        What is a power nap?
        A power nap is a short nap that lasts anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Even though you're only resting for a short period of time, power naps can effectively increase your level of alertness and focus.
        How? Power naps allow your body and mind to rest without entering deeper stages of sleep. Once you enter deep sleep — typically about 30 minutes after you've fallen asleep — you are likely to experience ""sleep inertia"" upon waking. Sleep inertia is the drowsy feeling you may get when you wake up, in which you feel temporarily disorientated and are slower to react. It can take your body 30 to 60 minutes to recover from sleep inertia.
        Benefits of a quick snooze: An energy boost and mental clarity
        Naps offer several health benefits that can improve your quality of life. Studies show that naps can enhance mood, reduce fatigue, and improve alertness. Additional research has found that power naps may help decrease blood pressure and improve heart health, especially when taken in the early afternoon.
        Power naps may support work performance as well. Researchers at NASA found that pilots who napped 20 to 30 minutes were over 50% more alert and over 30% more proficient at their jobs than pilots who didn't nap.
        How long should a power nap be?
        Keep your power nap to 30 minutes or less to avoid sleep inertia.
        A shorter nap can also help you bypass some health risks associated with longer naps. For example, a study published in Obesity found that adults who napped longer than 30 minutes were more likely to experience higher blood pressure and blood sugar levels than people who did not nap. Short nappers did not share this increased risk.
        Set an alarm to ensure your nap doesn't exceed the 30-minute mark.
        Tips for a restorative power nap
        The following tips can help you get the biggest boost out of your power nap.
        Time it right. Aim to nap in the early afternoon, ideally between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., when your body naturally experiences a dip in energy. Napping too late in the day can interfere with nighttime sleep. That said, the ideal time to nap varies by individual. Some people may benefit from earlier naps depending on what time they wake up and go to sleep.
        Keep it short. Set an alarm to wake you after 20 to 30 minutes. A short nap will leave you refreshed rather than groggy.
        Create a cozy environment. Find a quiet, dark, and comfortable space where you won't be interrupted. If you're in a bright or noisy area, consider using an eye mask or earplugs to help you fall asleep faster.
        Listen to your body. If you frequently feel the need for a nap, it may be a sign of inadequate nighttime sleep. While a power nap can help boost energy in the short term, make sure you're prioritizing a good night's rest as well. Frequent daytime drowsiness can also be a sign of sleep apnea, a common disorder that causes people to stop breathing for short periods during sleep. Talk to your doctor if you are regularly sleepy during the day or if you're a loud snorer.
        Finally, napping is not for everyone. Some people may not feel refreshed even after a short nap. In that case, the best approach may be to avoid napping and focus on getting a good night's sleep.",Jenette Restivo,"December 4, 2024"

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-latest-thinking-on-inherited-high-cholesterol,The latest thinking on inherited high cholesterol,"Nearly one-third of American adults have high levels of harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol circulating through their blood, which doubles their risk of heart disease compared to people with normal levels (see ""Classifying LDL level""). Most of these people likely have dozens of different genetic mutations, each of which raises LDL by a little bit. Over time — coupled with a less-than-ideal diet and not enough exercise — their LDL levels slowly creep up.
        But what about very high LDL? ""About 5% of the population have LDL values of 190 or higher, and their risk of heart disease is five times higher than people with near-optimal LDL,"" says Dr. Amit V. Khera, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Within this group, an important minority has familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic condition that affects about one in 250 adults.
        What is FH?
        Most people with FH have a mutation or variant in one of three different genes that provide instructions that help remove excess LDL from the bloodstream. People who inherit one variant from a parent have heterozygous FH, which can cause LDL levels as high as 350 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). People who inherit two variants (one from each parent) have homozygous FH. This very rare condition, which affects only about four in a million people, can lead to LDL levels as high as 1,000 mg/dL.
        Excess LDL in the bloodstream can accumulate in the skin and tendons, which is why some people with FH develop small, cholesterol-filled nodules on their eyelids or their tendons, especially those along the backs of the hands, the elbows, or the backs of the ankles (the Achilles tendons). But the biggest threat is the buildup of LDL in the arteries supplying the heart. People with untreated FH can succumb to a heart attack in their 40s or earlier, likely because of the cumulative exposure to high LDL starting at birth.
        
          
            
              
                Classifying LDL level
                These targets are for people without known heart disease. People who have heart disease or are at high risk for it should aim for an LDL of 70 or lower.

        If a person's close relative — a parent or sibling — has very high cholesterol or had a heart attack at a young age (before 55 in a man or 65 in a woman), that's a red flag for possible FH. Genetic testing isn't strictly necessary, as high LDL is a reliable sign of heart disease risk in anyone, regardless of the cause.
        However, FH testing can be beneficial for two reasons, says Dr. Khera. ""First, if you've struggled your whole life with high cholesterol despite following a healthy diet and getting regular exercise, knowing there's a genetic explanation is often helpful."" Second, an FH diagnosis can be important for your biological parents, siblings, and children, each of whom has a 50/50 chance of having the same FH variant.
        Although guidelines recommend checking cholesterol levels in children and adolescents at least once between ages 9 and 11 and again between ages 17 and 21, such tests usually aren't done. And when high cholesterol is found, physicians typically don't treat children and teens very aggressively. But once they hit adulthood, treating very high cholesterol is crucial, says Dr. Khera. The Family Heart Foundation has more information on FH, including a tool to search for doctors who specialize in the condition.
        Treating very high LDL
        The latest cholesterol treatment guidelines emphasize the importance of lowering excessively high LDL and keeping it low for decades. ""It's most practical to focus on finding and treating severe hypercholesterolemia, regardless of the underlying cause,"" says Dr. Khera. The first choice is a high-intensity statin: 40 to 80 milligrams (mg) of atorvastatin (Lipitor) or 20 to 40 mg of rosuvastatin (Crestor), both of which will slash LDL by about 50%. While those drugs get many people with very high LDL close to the target range of 70 mg/dL for high-risk individuals, some need additional medications, which may include
        
          ezetimibe (Zetia), a pill that inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut
          bempedoic acid (Nexletol), a pill that blocks cholesterol production in the liver
          alirocumab (Praluent) or evolocumab (Repatha), injectable drugs that help remove excess LDL from the bloodstream
          inclisiran (Leqvio), a twice-yearly injection that interferes with a protein in the liver that regulates LDL.
        
        Following heart-healthy habits, as outlined in the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 is also crucial.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-diseases-gender-bias,Inflammatory bowel disease's gender bias,"Just because a situation is equal doesn't make it equitable. Case in point: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — which has been diagnosed in about one of every 100 American adults — affects roughly equal numbers of both sexes. But the condition clearly inflicts a disproportionate burden on women, shaping symptoms, affecting reproductive decisions, and increasing risks of ominous downstream effects.
        IBD comprises both Crohn's disease — which can affect any part of the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus — and ulcerative colitis, which is limited to the colon. Diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, urgency, rectal bleeding, weight loss, and fatigue are commonplace among both men and women with the disorder. Some patients with IBD experience only mild symptoms, while others cope with much more severe cases. People with Crohn's, for instance, can develop abnormal, tunnel-like fistulas between their colon or rectum and nearby tissues such as the skin, bladder, or vagina.
        IBD's gender bias was highlighted by a study published in the February 2023 issue of the Journal of Personalized Medicine, which reported that women with the condition report more psychological distress and a worse quality of life than male peers. IBD can also be harder on women because of its array of specific effects on their reproductive and overall health, says Dr. Rachel Winter, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Formidable challenges
        Here's how IBD can affect women differently from men:
        Symptoms ramp up during menstruation. For many women, even without IBD, periods bring intestinal troubles such as abdominal pain, loose stools, or indigestion. For women with IBD, such overlapping symptoms can make them feel like they're having a flare even if they're not, Dr. Winter says.
        Sex can be painful. If Crohn's disease affects a part of the intestine near the perineum — the area between the vulva and anus — women can find vaginal sex excruciating. A fistula between the intestinal wall and the vagina can create the same issue, as can abdominal scar tissue from IBD-related surgeries.
        Even the idea of sex can be off-putting, since IBD patients may worry about passing stool during intercourse or feel inhibited if they have an ostomy bag that collects stool outside the abdomen.
        It may be harder to conceive. Fertility may suffer when rampant inflammation from IBD affects the fallopian tubes, where fertilization occurs. And IBD flares during pregnancy can raise the risk of complications such as low birth weight or premature birth. ""We have open conversations with all of our patients who are considering becoming pregnant in the near future, because certain medications shouldn't be taken during pregnancy,"" Dr. Winter says. ""We want to transition to medications that are safe if they conceive.""
        Women who take immunosuppressive drugs have a higher risk for cervical cancer. Certain IBD medications that suppress the immune system can raise the risk of abnormal cells developing on the cervix. Because of this, doctors advise women with IBD who take these drugs to undergo screening Pap tests more frequently than other women. IBD itself does not increase the risk for precancerous or cancerous changes of the cervix.
        Iron-deficiency anemia is more likely. Menstrual bleeding — which carries iron out of the body — already increases women's odds of anemia. Adding in digestive tract bleeding from IBD creates a double whammy. IBD also hinders the body's ability to absorb iron, increasing anemia risk.
        Osteoporosis risks increase. This bone-thinning disease already disproportionately strikes women over 50 compared to men. But women with IBD are especially at risk for osteoporosis even at younger ages, particularly if they've had problems absorbing nutrients or have taken the steroid prednisone, which weakens bones.
        Support tips
        How can women with IBD generate support for any sex-specific concerns? Dr. Winter offers these suggestions:
        Be candid. Sharing private, potentially embarrassing symptoms or downstream effects of IBD can be daunting. But it's vital to push past awkward moments and be frank with your doctor, who may be able to propose solutions you hadn't considered. ""Women should not be afraid to openly discuss any of these issues with their providers,"" she says.
        Look for dedicated IBD programs. Some academic medical centers have programs aimed directly at patients with IBD, increasing the chances that clinicians there will be well versed in women-specific concerns.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/digestive-health-changes-when-to-seek-medical-care,Digestive health changes: When to seek medical care,"It's been an eventful year in the world, and if it seems like it's been a bumpy ride for your gastrointestinal tract, too — with bouts of heartburn, diarrhea, or constipation — this is a good time to consider whether you've been experiencing temporary symptoms or signs of something more serious or chronic.
        Identify your distress
        The first step in understanding gastrointestinal distress is putting a name to the problem.
        Heartburn. This fiery feeling in your chest is usually caused by stomach acid that leaks upward into the esophagus (the tube connecting your mouth and stomach). It occurs when the ring of muscles that normally stop leakage temporarily loosen or aren't working well. Heartburn might also cause a sore throat, a cough, or a metallic taste after meals.
        Constipation. If you're not having a bowel movement at least three times a week, that's considered constipation. Or if your stool is hard and lumpy and you strain to get it out or you have the feeling you aren't evacuating completely, that's also constipation.
        Diarrhea. Diarrhea is watery, unformed stool. It usually doesn't feel great as it's brewing in your gut, and it's often uncomfortable to pass it.
        What's causing the trouble?
        The digestive tract is a sophisticated yet sensitive system that can be disrupted anywhere along its route from the mouth to the anus—and it doesn't take much to cause temporary discomfort.
        For example, stress can slow digestion and cause constipation, increase acid production and trigger heartburn, or speed digestion and send you running for the bathroom with diarrhea. ""We call the gastrointestinal tract the 'second nervous system.' There are many nerve endings going to all parts of it, including the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Stress might result in the brain telling the tract how to react, even when there might not be anything wrong structurally,"" says Dr. Alexander Goldowsky, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Other possible causes of occasional gastrointestinal problems include your diet, weight gain, an infection, or a medication side effect.
        Coping with occasional bouts
        If you've been experiencing new digestive issues, try making a few changes to see if symptoms go away in a few days or weeks.
        For heartburn. Two approaches can help. One is using over-the-counter medications. Dr. Goldowsky recommends taking a fast-acting drug that targets stomach acid. Examples include calcium carbonate (Tums), aluminum hydroxide (Mylanta), and H2 blockers such as famotidine (Pepcid) and cimetidine (Tagamet).
        The other approach is making lifestyle changes. Avoid foods and drinks that seem to trigger your heartburn, such as spicy, fatty, or tomato-based foods; citrus; garlic; onion; peppermint; and anything with caffeine, such as chocolate, tea, or coffee.
        Also: eat smaller meals, stay upright for at least two hours after meals, avoid drinking alcohol or eating late at night, and sleep on a wedge pillow.
        For constipation. To combat constipation, Dr. Goldowsky advises taking a powdered fiber supplement that you add to food or drinks, such as Metamucil, Benefiber, or Citrucel. ""Fiber is a miracle. It helps stool form a shape and get out, so you feel empty,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        He also recommends increasing fiber in your diet (great sources include beans, lentils, peas, whole grains, berries, nuts, seeds, artichokes, pumpkin, and brussels sprouts). ""Your total goal should be around 30 grams of fiber per day,"" he says, ""but it's hard to reach that goal with food. That's why the supplement is important.""
        Other ways to fight constipation include drinking more fluids to help stool move along, and exercising every day (which keeps the muscles in your intestines strong).
        For diarrhea. Dr. Goldowsky recommends using a fiber supplement for this problem, too, since fiber helps stool form properly. It's also essential to stay hydrated to replace fluids you're losing through diarrhea.
        Additionally, it's a good idea to keep track of foods that might be triggering diarrhea. Common culprits include dairy foods; foods that contain gluten, artificial sweeteners, or caffeine; fried, fatty, spicy, or sugary foods; and foods with natural sugars that are difficult for some people to digest, such as those in wheat, rye, onions, garlic, legumes (chickpeas, lentils, beans), honey, pistachios, cashews, asparagus, artichokes, and sun-dried tomatoes.
        It might also help to take an anti­diarrheal medication such as loperamide (Imodium).
        ""Medications for diarrhea are helpful, but they can overdo it and cause constipation. Take a few doses and see how you feel, then gradually reduce the amount you're taking,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        When to call your doctor
        Call your doctor immediately if your symptoms include bloody stools, fever, loss of bowel control, severe pain, or severe dehydration. If you don't have those symptoms but you do have heartburn, diarrhea, or constipation that isn't going away after a week or two of home remedies, it's time to see your doctor. ""We don't want to miss colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""These are unlikely causes of such symptoms, but we need to rule them out.""
        Your physician will also rule out other disorders that can cause gastrointestinal problems (such as low thyroid function), gut changes that affect how fast food moves through the digestive tract, and medication side effects that might be causing trouble.
        The encouraging news is that there's usually a way to treat the problem, including specialized diets, physical therapy, or medications. ""Don't give up. We can get you feeling better,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""My goal is for you to be able to control or eliminate your symptoms so you can function well and have a better quality of life.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/can-a-knee-brace-ease-arthritis-pain,Can a knee brace ease arthritis pain?,"Knee braces might be known best for their benefits after knee surgery: they align and stabilize the joint, giving it time to heal properly.
        But braces might also help you cope with the pain, swelling, and stiffness of knee osteoarthritis—the wearing away of the cartilage that cushions the ends of the bones where they meet in the joint. While evidence about how well braces ease arthritis symptoms is mixed, bracing is a noninvasive strategy that won't hurt to try. The key is understanding your goals for relief. Here are three brace types to consider.
        A knee sleeve
        One common knee brace is called a sleeve. It's a compressive, stretchy fabric or neoprene tube that you pull over or wrap around your knee. The sleeve extends about six inches above and below the joint.
        The snug fit offers many potential benefits: warmth, which loosens up a stiff knee; a sense of support (though it doesn't provide structural support), which might make you feel more confident as you walk; reduced swelling, which eases pain; and possibly a way to prevent flare-ups.
        ""Compressing the knee helps keep fluid from coming into it. The less swelling, the less your knee will hurt, and the better your knee will move. Reduced swelling also allows muscles that support the knee, such as the quadriceps, to do their job better, so the knee is supported as you walk, squat, or go up or down stairs,"" says Jim Zachazewski, a physical therapist and athletic trainer with Mass General Brigham Sports Medicine.
        An unloader brace
        Another type of brace used for knee osteoarthritis is an unloader brace. It's a long frame that fits on top of your leg, from your mid-thigh to your mid-shin. It consists of rigid metal or plastic struts (bars) that go on either side of your leg and horizontal straps to keep the brace in place. The struts hinge at your knee, so you can bend it.
        This brace is for people whose arthritis is worse on one side of the knee than the other. ""The struts are adjusted to apply force that shifts pressure away from the bad or painful side of the knee, which minimizes pain and swelling,"" Zachazewski says.
        The brace also provides some side-to-side stability for the knee. But the brace can be a little bulky and uncomfortable. Zachazewski recommends wearing a light knee sleeve underneath it to prevent skin irritation and provide joint compression.
        Patella tracking braces
        This type of brace combines the approaches of both knee sleeves and unloader braces to reduce knee pain, swelling, and pressure at the kneecap (patella). The kneecap sometimes comes off its track (trochlea) — a groove in the thighbone (femur) that allows the kneecap to move up and down. Misalignment is painful.
        A patella tracking brace is worn like a knee sleeve. It also has straps or pads that use gentle force to keep the kneecap properly aligned and on track as the knee bends and straightens. This stabilizes the kneecap and redistributes pressure more evenly.
        Zachazewski says this brace is especially helpful for going up and down stairs or squatting.
        Costs
        Costs for knee braces vary. You can find a knee sleeve for about $15 to $75 online or in drugstores. It's not usually covered by insurance.
        Health insurance might cover some or all of the costs of an unloader brace or a patella tracking brace, as long as it is prescribed by a doctor and custom-fit by a durable medical equipment dealer that accepts your insurance.
        Or you can pay out of pocket for those braces if you buy them online: about $100 to $300 for an unloader brace, and about $35 to $100 for a patella tracking brace.
        Getting started
        If you're interested in using a knee brace, you can try a knee sleeve on your own. See if it makes a difference and if you feel comfortable wearing it. If it seems to help, ask your doctor if an unloader or a patella tracking brace might work even better. You might need to work with a physical therapist to get used to being active while wearing the bulkier brace.
        Zachazewski says you can wear a brace during any activity that places pressure on your knee, such as doing house or yard work, going up and down stairs, shopping, exercising, or just going about your daily activities.
        The brace won't heal your knee arthritis, and it's not guaranteed to relieve your symptoms. But for some people, it's an important tool for living with chronic knee pain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/need-a-push-to-learn-cpr,Need a push to learn CPR?,"It's distressing to imagine, but what would you do if someone in your home suddenly collapsed and stopped breathing? After calling 911, many people feel helpless during such an event, which is usually due to a cardiac arrest (see ""What is cardiac arrest?"").
        But if you immediately begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the chest compressions can keep blood flowing to the person's brain and other vital organs. Each year, more than 350,000 people in the United States experience an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Nearly three of every four of these happen at home, which means the life you potentially save with CPR is likely a loved one or friend.
        ""The two interventions that unequivocally save lives are high-quality chest compressions and early use of an automated external defibrillator, or AED,"" says Dr. Scott Goldberg, assistant professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. Emergency personnel will bring and use an AED, which shocks the heart back into a normal rhythm. Nationwide, the average response time for emergency medical services is seven minutes. A person experiencing a cardiac arrest is almost twice as likely to survive if someone administers high-quality chest compressions during that time, says Dr. Goldberg.
        
          
            
              
                What is cardiac arrest?
                Cardiac arrest happens when the heart's electrical system malfunctions, causing it to beat rapidly and chaotically — or to stop beating altogether. Without blood circulating to the brain, lungs, and other organs, the person gasps or stops breathing and becomes unresponsive within seconds. A heart attack is a common cause of cardiac arrest, but most heart attacks do not lead to cardiac arrest. Other possible causes include a structural or electrical problem; a serious imbalance of potassium, magnesium, or other minerals in the blood; an inherited condition; or a blow to the chest.
              
            
          
        
        CPR training options
        In the United States, bystander CPR training rates remain low; fewer than one in five adults are currently certified, according to the American Heart Association (AHA), which publishes the official guidelines for CPR. But the AHA and other organizations have begun moving away from advocating formal, in-person classes. ""While there's a benefit to practicing your skills with an instructor who can give you real-time feedback, there's a trade-off,"" says Dr. Goldberg, noting that in-person classes are time-consuming and can be expensive.
        One reason is that most classes include instruction beyond just learning CPR. Most also teach how to use an AED, since these devices are now widely available in airports, malls, casinos, sports arenas, and many office buildings. If you witness a cardiac arrest in a public place, ask a bystander to find one while you do chest compressions. AEDs use voice prompts, lights, and text messages to guide users through the needed steps.
        Many classes teach CPR with rescue breathing (also called mouth-to-mouth breathing) done with face shields or special plastic masks. Some also feature basic first aid training. Although some of the training can be done online, the in-person training portion typically takes two hours. However, the AHA also offers a course called Heartsaver Virtual. It includes a training kit featuring a mannequin torso that's sent to your home plus a smartphone app that enables an instructor to watch and evaluate your chest compression technique.
        Learning chest compressions
        But even if you don't have the opportunity to take a class, you can still learn how to do chest compressions. A 90-second AHA video demonstrates the basic steps and also shows the location of more than 30 kiosks (including six at major airports) throughout the United States where you can practice chest compressions on a mannequin.
        Also worth noting: about half of the 911 operators in the United States are trained to provide verbal cues for CPR. If you reach a trained operator, put your phone on speaker to hear the instructions; the operator will count out loud to help you administer compression at the correct rate (about 100 beats per minute). The AHA also has a Spotify playlist of 150 songs that have the right rate to guide chest compressions.
        When Dr. Goldberg teaches CPR, the most common question he gets is ""How do I know if someone actually needs CPR?"" Unconscious people in cardiac arrest may gasp and grunt, which can be mistaken for breathing. ""When in doubt, err on the side of caution and start chest compressions. People will stop you if they're okay,"" says Dr. Goldberg.

Is this safe, given that I had a mild heart attack a few years ago?There are two reasons why this particular activity is hazardous: intense exercise and cold temperatures. First, shoveling snow — especially wet, heavy snow — puts a much higher workload on the heart than what people normally do for their exercise. To estimate the intensity of an activity or exercise, experts often use metabolic equivalents (METs). One MET is how much energy you use just sitting still. Moderate-intensity exercises are 3 to 5.9 METs, while vigorous-intensity exercises — like shoveling snow — are 6 METs and higher.","Christopher P. Cannon, MD","December 1, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/forearm-workouts-strengthening-grip-for-everyday-function,Forearm workouts: Strengthening grip for everyday function,"When you think about building strength, your mind might immediately go to strength-training workouts for the larger muscles in your body such as your back, chest, or legs.

But the muscles of the forearm — the part of the arm that extends from the elbow to the wrist — are also worth paying attention to.

Why grip strength matters

Strong forearms support grip strength, which plays an important role in how well you can grasp and hold items. Think squeezing a tube of toothpaste, turning a doorknob, or holding a glass of water.

Research has also found that grip strength is associated with many measures of overall health, especially as you age. A weak grip is associated with:


	lower total strength
	reduced bone mineral density
	falls and fractures
	sleep problems
	memory problems
	depression
	malnutrition
	death from any cause.


How strengthening forearms can improve grip

Many of the muscles that help your hand and wrist grip something solidly extend into your forearms. One study found that having larger forearm muscles was correlated with greater grip strength. Strengthening forearm muscles can help you perform gripping and grasping movements more effectively and efficiently

As of now, there's no evidence that building forearm muscles and grip strength will improve longevity or overall health. However, increased grip strength will support your ability to perform gripping and grasping tasks — from opening jars to holding a cane and opening doors — that could help you stay independent longer.

Simple forearm exercises to boost grip strength

Some of the best forearm workouts involve surprisingly simple movements. Start with one set of 10 repetitions for each of the following strength exercises. Build up to two to three sets over time.

You'll need a set of light dumbells (1 to 3 pounds) and some therapy putty (start with the softest putty), which you can purchase at a medical supply store, to perform these exercises.

Wrist extension and flexion




	Hold a light dumbbell (1 to 3 pounds) in each hand.
	Keep your arms at your sides with your elbows bent, palms facing down.
	Moving from your wrist, lift the weights upward until you feel a gentle stretch on the inside of your wrist.
	Hold for a count of five.
	Then bend your wrist and lower the weights down until you feel a gentle stretch on the outside of your wrist.
	Hold for a count of five.
	Continue for 10 repetitions.


Wrist supination/pronation




	Hold a light dumbbell (1 to 3 pounds) in each hand.
	Keep your arms at your sides with your elbows bent, palms facing down.
	Rotate your forearm, so your palm faces up. Hold for a count of five.
	Then rotate your forearm so your palm faces down. Hold for a count of five.
	Continue for 10 repetitions.


Putty grip




	Roll the putty into a ball.
	Place the putty in your palm.
	Gently squeeze and release.
	Repeat 10 times on each hand every other day.


Putty three-point pinch




	Roll the putty into a short, fat cylinder.
	Place the putty between the pads of your thumb and your index and middle fingers.
	Gently squeeze the putty between your fingers and thumb and release.
	Repeat 10 times on each hand every other day.


Some people also use tools called hand grippers or grip strengtheners for a few minutes each day to build grip strength. There are many different models available online and in fitness stores.

Gadgets to help compensate for reduced grip strength

Forearm workouts only go so far. Sometimes you need a little assistance to accomplish tasks like opening a stubborn jar or confidently holding a sharp knife.

There are a number of tools and gadgets that can help. These are often available at medical supply stores or online. They include:


	electric can openers
	jar key openers
	nonslip gripper mats to open jars
	rocker knives
	dental floss holders
	soap-on-a-rope
	shoehorns

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/depression-symptoms-recognizing-common-and-lesser-known-symptoms,Depression symptoms: Recognizing common and lesser-known symptoms,"Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States. In 2020, 18.4% of people over the age of 18 reported having received a diagnosis of depression at some point.
        While we tend to associate depression with feeling sad and withdrawn, there are also other, less-recognized signs of depression. These include physical pain, poor hygiene, and a variety of behavioral changes
        What is depression?
        Depression is a mental health disorder that affects a person's mood and feelings of self-worth. Symptoms of depression can range from mild to severe. The most severe type of depression is called major depression.
        A combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors are believed to play a role in depression.
        What are classic depression symptoms?
        According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V), there are nine classic symptoms of depression:
        
          depressed mood
          markedly diminished interest or pleasure in most or all activities
          poor appetite, weight loss, or weight gain
          insomnia or hypersomnia
          slowing down of mental or physical activities (for example, sluggishness or diminished hand-eye coordination)
          fatigue or loss of energy
          feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
          diminished ability to think or concentrate (""brain fog""), or indecisiveness
          recurrent thoughts of death; thinking about, planning, or attempting suicide.
        
        Mental health professionals will give someone a diagnosis of major depression if they experience five or more of these symptoms over a period of two weeks or longer. The five symptoms must include depressed mood or a lack of pleasure in usual activities.
        What are less-recognized symptoms?
        While they may not be required for an official diagnosis of depression, there are other symptoms that are often experienced by individuals who are depressed. Being able to recognize these signs and symptoms may prompt you or a loved one to seek help.
        Substance use
        Substance use disorders have complex causes, but they are closely linked to depression. Often, using alcohol, drugs, or both, is a form of self-medicating depression. People with substance use disorders may not recognize that they are depressed.
        Physical pain
        There has been research showing an association between depression and an increase in inflammation and decrease in immune function. This may contribute to a person with depression experiencing various types of physical discomfort such as headaches or stomachaches.
        Neglecting personal hygiene
        Low mood, sluggishness, and fatigue can make it difficult for someone with depression to muster the energy to tend to personal hygiene practices such as showering, brushing teeth, doing laundry, or brushing hair.
        Sexual issues
        Loss of libido is a common but lesser-known symptom of depression. It can cause erectile dysfunction in men and vaginal dryness in women, along with problems achieving orgasm.
        What behavioral changes may be associated with depression?
        Depression can also cause changes in mood or behavior that go beyond crying and sadness. These include:
        
          increased anger or irritability
          feeling restless or on edge
          becoming withdrawn, negative, or detached
          increased engagement in high-risk activities
          greater impulsivity
          isolating from family and friends.
        
        When to seek help
        If you or someone you love is experiencing symptoms of depression, consider contacting your primary care physician or a mental health professional.
        If you feel overwhelmed by negative thoughts or feelings, or are having thoughts of self-harm or suicide, seek immediate help by calling 911, going to your nearest emergency department, or contacting one of the following emergency hotlines:

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/botulism-a-to-z,Botulism,"What is botulism?
        Botulism is a form of poisoning caused by exposure to Clostridium botulinum bacteria. These bacteria manufacture a chemical poison known as botulinum toxin that interferes with muscle function in many areas of the body, causing paralysis of individual muscles or groups of muscles. Exposure to this toxin is life-threatening, since one of the muscles it can paralyze is the diaphragm, the muscle that controls breathing.
        
          
        
        You can be exposed to the bacteria causing botulism in several ways, the most familiar being by eating contaminated food. In most food-borne cases of botulism in adults, home-canned foods are responsible. The bacteria that cause botulism exist in dirt and dust as a spore, but this form is inactive and does not produce toxin. However, when a spore is moved into a low-oxygen environment such as an enclosed jar or can, it can reproduce and make its dangerous toxin.
        Home-canned vegetables that are not highly acidic (asparagus, green beans, peppers, beets, and corn) are good incubators for botulism bacteria, unless they are heat-treated appropriately to kill the spores during the canning process and eaten quickly after opening. The bacteria can release large quantities of toxin into the canned food jar, causing botulism symptoms in people who sample the produce. Home-canned, smoked, or fermented fish is also a risk.
        Recent outbreaks have been reported from commercial carrot juice and home-canned bamboo shoots. In the United States, roughly 100 people become ill with botulism each year. About a quarter are due to consumption of contaminated food. Most cases today (about 70%) occur in infants. Babies less than 1 year old, especially those that are breastfeeding, have a different intestinal system than adults. Spores swallowed by an adult with a mature digestive tract usually will remain in their hibernating, inactive state. But spores ingested by a young infant can reproduce and can form toxin that is absorbed into the bloodstream, causing botulism.
        In one out of five cases of botulism in infants, the infant has eaten raw honey. More rarely, botulism spores are found in corn syrup. Since the majority of cases of infant botulism can't be traced to a food source, experts suspect that babies are exposed simply by swallowing small amounts of dust or dirt.
        Rarely, botulism is the result of a contaminated wound. Most wound botulism today occurs in people who inject or snort recreational drugs.
        Symptoms of botulism
        All of the symptoms of botulism are the result of nerve paralysis during exposure to the toxin. Symptoms usually begin within one to two days after eating contaminated food. Symptoms of infant botulism and wound botulism also appear suddenly.
        The earliest symptoms involve the eyes and face, because nerves controlling their function are affected most quickly by the botulism toxin. Early or mild symptoms, which may go away on their own, include:
        
          abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (not usually present in wound botulism)
          double vision, blurred vision (especially when viewing close objects), or drooping eyelids
          dryness of the mouth.
        
        More severe cases can cause these additional symptoms:
        
          slurred or garbled speech
          difficulty swallowing
          muscle weakness in arms or legs; general fatigue
          difficulty breathing, sometimes severe
          in infants, usually constipation at first; also lethargy and a ""floppy"" neck, arms, and legs, demonstrating weak muscles; difficulty feeding; failure to cry well.
        
        Diagnosing botulism
        If your doctor suspects botulism after asking you about your medical history and examining you, both blood and stool samples may be tested to check for the presence of botulinum toxin. Generally these tests are done in a government laboratory that specializes in detecting botulism. Sometimes botulism bacteria can be grown from a stool sample.
        Botulism is uncommon enough that your doctor will consider other explanations for your symptoms. In most cases, several other tests will be ordered:
        
          a brain scan, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, to check for other diagnoses such as stroke
          blood tests to check for Lyme disease
          a lumbar puncture to help to distinguish botulism from a similar illness called Guillain-Barre syndrome
          an electromyogram, a test of nerve and muscle function, to determine if the problem might be another muscle-weakening disease such as polymyositis or myasthenia gravis.
        
        Once definite evidence of botulism is found with laboratory tests, usually no additional testing is needed.
        Expected duration of botulism
        Most paralysis symptoms of botulism last for several weeks and then slowly go away in the following months. Sometimes fatigue and shortness of breath can last for years.
        Preventing botulism
        You can prevent food-borne botulism with careful food-handling techniques:
        
          When home canning, use a pressure cooker that can reach temperatures adequate to kill botulism spores. Preserved food should be heated above 248º F (120º C) for at least five minutes during the canning process. Some foods, such as jams and jellies, do not require a pressure cooker because their high sugar level makes it difficult for Clostridium botulinum bacteria to grow.
          Do not eat or store cooked foods that have stayed at room temperature for more than four hours.
          Do not eat or even taste canned goods from a jar that has a bulging lid or a bad odor.
          Do not leave foil-wrapped baked potatoes at room temperature. They should be served hot or refrigerated.
          Do not store chopped garlic or onions in oil at room temperature.
          If you are eating home-canned fish or vegetables, first boil the food for 10 minutes with frequent stirring. This will destroy any botulinum toxin that has been produced in storage.
          Do not feed honey or corn syrup to infants less than 1 year old.
        
        To prevent wound botulism, do not use recreational injected drugs. Report deep wounds promptly to a physician.
        Treating botulism
        Botulism usually requires hospitalization, sometimes for a prolonged time. The main treatment for botulism is administration of an antitoxin (a chemical antidote to the toxin), and good nursing support and physician care, sometimes in an intensive care unit, with machine support by a ventilator as needed to assist breathing. If antitoxin is given early in the course of the disease, it will prevent further paralysis from the toxin, but it does not affect symptoms that are already present. Physical therapy can be helpful in aiding recovery of muscle strength.
        Infants with botulism present a special challenge: They are treated with antitoxin but are not given antibiotics because killing the botulism bacteria in their gut can cause a sudden release of more antitoxin. Instead, medicines that cause vomiting or treatments such as enemas are used to remove undigested food from the gut.
        Wounds that are a source of botulism must be treated with surgery to remove contaminated tissue.
        When to call a professional
        Botulism can worsen rapidly and is a life-threatening emergency. If you or your infant has symptoms of botulism and these symptoms do not have a known explanation, you should contact a physician immediately.
        Prognosis
        Although botulism can cause severe and prolonged symptoms, most people recover completely from the illness. Early treatment reduces the risk of permanent disability and death.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/ways-to-support-someone-who-is-grieving,Ways to support someone who is grieving,"It can be hard to know how to console a friend or relative who is grieving. While you can't take away their pain, simply being present and offering consistent support can make a meaningful difference. Small gestures—like sending a card, delivering a meal, or checking in regularly—can provide comfort.
        It's also important to respect their grieving process. For instance, if they're joining you for a holiday gathering, offer flexibility in your invitation and be open to honoring their loss. If you're not sure what to say or do, here are some thoughtful ways to support a grieving loved one.
        
          Name names. Don't be afraid to mention the deceased. It won't make your friend or relative any sadder, although it may prompt tears. It's terrible to feel that someone you love must forever be expunged from memory and conversation. Saying how much you'll miss the person is much better than the perfunctory, ""I'm sorry for your loss."" 
          Don't ask, ""How are you?"" The answer is obvious—""not good""—and because it's the same greeting you would offer anyone, it doesn't acknowledge that your friend has suffered a devastating loss. Instead try, ""How are you feeling today?"" 
          Offer hope. People who have gone through grieving often remember that it is the person who offered reassuring hope, the certainty that things will get better, who helped them make the gradual passage from pain to a renewed sense of life. Be careful, though, about being too glib, as doing so may make the bereaved person feel even more isolated. Rather, say something like: ""You will grieve for as long as you need to, but you are a strong person, and will find your way through this."" This remark both acknowledges that there is no quick and easy solution and also affirms your confidence that things will improve. 
          Reach out. Call to express your sympathy. Try to steer clear of such phrases as ""It's God's will"" or ""It's for the best"" unless the bereaved person says this first. Your friend or relative may need you even more after the first few weeks and months, when other people may stop calling. Check in every now and then just to say hello (you may find it helpful to put reminders on your calendar). Most bereaved people find it difficult to reach out and need others to take the initiative. 
          Help out. Don't just ask if you can ""do anything."" That transfers the burden to the bereaved, and he or she may be reluctant to make a request. Instead, be specific when offering help. Bring dinner over, pass on information about funeral arrangements, or answer the phone. Pitch in to clean up the kitchen. Sometimes your help is most valuable later. A lawyer might help answer questions about the estate. A handy person might button up the house as winter approaches. 
          Assist with meals. Provide hands-on assistance with cooking, and volunteer to help with shopping. For many bereaved persons, particularly widows and widowers, it can be a big adjustment to get accustomed to planning meals, shopping for groceries, and cooking for just one person. 
          Listen well instead of advising. A sympathetic ear is a wonderful thing. A friend who listens even when the same story is told with little variation is even better. Often, people work through grief and trauma by telling their story over and over. Unless you are asked for your advice, don't be quick to offer it. Frequently, those who are grieving really wish others would just listen. It's your understanding—not your advice—that is most sorely needed. 
          Avoid judgments. Your friend or relative's life and emotional landscape have changed enormously, possibly forever. You may wish he or she would move on, but you can't speed the process or even ensure that it happens. Let them heal at the pace that feels right and in their own manner. ""You should cry"" or ""It's time to move on"" aren't really helpful directions.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/coping-with-anger-while-grieving,Coping with anger while grieving,"Grieving the loss of a loved one can stir up a whirlwind of emotions, and anger is often a surprising, but common, part of the process. If you find yourself feeling angry or bitter, it may help to explore where these emotions are coming from and how to manage them. Finding safe ways to express and even explain your feelings can also be incredibly healing.
        Here are some techniques to help you process and release the anger that may accompany your grief.
        Consider it. Is anger a stand-in for more painful emotions, or does the situation warrant it? Do you feel abandoned or afraid? If so, could you enlist support from others or spend some time thinking about your fears and putting them to rest? It might help to share your feelings in a grief support group and learn how others have dealt with similar feelings.
        Express it. Set aside a safe time and place each day to defuse angry feelings. Some people yell in the car with the windows rolled up. Some find stress-relief techniques like meditation or yoga helpful. Others find release in punching pillows or in spurts of strenuous activity. Think about options for releasing anger, and plan how to express it safely when it crops up. Sometimes writing about situations that make you feel angry can help you focus on what you are really feeling beneath your anger.
        Explain it. Tell others how short-fused you are right now. If you know you stepped over the line, apologize. Most people will make allowances.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/do-you-need-diagnostic-tests-for-heartburn,Do you need diagnostic tests for heartburn?,"You just enjoyed a delicious meal, but now there's a burning feeling creeping up your chest—classic heartburn. Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or ""acid reflux,"" which occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus.  But sometimes, this pain can be so intense it mimics a heart attack, making you wonder if it's something more serious.
        While doctors often skip extensive tests for straightforward cases, certain red flags—like trouble swallowing, internal bleeding, or severe, unresponsive symptoms—can call for deeper investigation. Here's a look at some of the diagnostic tests your doctor might recommend to get to the root of persistent heartburn.
        
          Upper GI endoscopy. This is the most commonly ordered initial test when people have worrisome symptoms. For this test, a person receives intravenous medicine to induce relaxation. It's called conscious sedation. The doctor sprays a local anesthetic in the back of the throat to prevent gagging. Next the doctor inserts a flexible tube called an endoscope down the throat. The tube has a light and camera attached, which let the doctor inspect the lining of the esophagus, stomach and first part of the small intestine to look for areas of irritation, ulcers, or strictures. Special tools can be inserted through the endoscope to take a biopsy (tissue sample), if necessary.
          Barium study. After drinking a liquid barium mixture, a person has an x-ray of the chest and upper abdomen. Barium helps define the esophagus on the x-ray image and can help the physician identify problems such as a hiatal hernia, esophageal ulcers, or a stricture (narrowing) of the esophagus. This test is called an upper GI series when the stomach and first part of the small intestine are also examined.
          pH monitoring. This test is used less frequently than those described above. It monitors a person's reflux episodes over 24 hours via a thin, acid sensing probe inserted through the nose and positioned at the bottom of the esophagus just above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This is an excellent method for documenting acid reflux in people who have unexplained chest pain, coughing, wheezing, or hoarseness. It's also used to assess the effectiveness of acid-suppressing drugs when symptoms persist. A wireless form of the pH monitor is contained in a capsule and looks like a pill. It is placed in the esophagus and can be used to monitor pH levels for 48 hours, during periods while the person is both on and off acid-suppressing therapy. The wireless pH system is particularly useful in people who do not respond to PPIs.
          Impedance testing. This test can be done at the same time as pH monitoring. It measures how well food and gas pass through the esophagus and is a good way to evaluate both acid- and non-acid reflux.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/bouncing-back-from-stress,Bouncing back from stress,"We all experience stress in our lives. Traffic. Monthly bills. Health concerns. Relationship issues. Because the mind and body are so closely linked, these constant worries can take a toll on health, contributing to a host of diseases.
        While you can't erase all sources of stress, you can learn how to reduce stress and also build resilience—which is your ability to bounce back from stress.
        William James was a notable Harvard philosopher-psychologist of the late 19th century and a graduate of Harvard Medical School. James was also a stressed-out melancholic. He marveled at people he called ""the healthy-minded""—optimistic and positive people who appeared to live hap­pier and healthier lives. Amid the run-of-the-mill volatility everyone must deal with, James observed that the healthy-minded seemed to turn challenges and potential failures into grist for opportunities and successes.
        The characteristics that James saw as ""healthy-minded,"" statistician and risk-management specialist Nassim Nicholas Taleb called ""antifragile."" In his book Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder, Taleb defines fragility as the tendency to be damaged by volatility and uncertainty—the kinds of things that often create a chronic stress response.
        By contrast, says Taleb, the antifragile person realizes that stress is just the price we pay for being alive. Cultivating anti­fragility helps us use our strengths to overcome chal­lenges and become stronger in the process.
        A prime example of antifragility is the Navy Seals. The Seals are able to manage high degrees of stress and still function admirably. Faced with life-threatening situations, they can rapidly change the focus of their attention and address the issue at hand efficiently and flexibly.
        
          Brain scans show that Seals have altered acti­vation in a prefrontal brain region called the insula, which is involved in managing stress signals. As a group, Navy Seals exhibit at least seven characteris­tics of resilient people:
        
        
          Calm, innovative, nondogmatic thinking
          The ability to act decisively
          Tenacity
          Inter­personal connectedness
          Honesty
          Self-control
          Optimism and a positive perspective on life.
        
        Whether adopting a ""healthy-minded"" mindset, cultivating antifragility, or thinking like a Navy Seal, building resilience is a powerful tool against stress. People tend to think of resilience as a trait that you either have or don't have, but it's actually a capacity that you can develop with the right approach.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/hoarding-what-to-know-about-this-mental-health-disorder,Hoarding: What to know about this mental health disorder,"On the surface, hoarding may appear to be a relatively straightforward problem to address. But hoarding is an often-misunderstood mental health disorder that can put a person's health and safety at risk.

What Is hoarding disorder?

Hoarding is a mental health condition characterized by an inability to discard certain belongings to the point of unhealthy accumulation. A person with hoarding disorder acquires an excessive number of items they don't need and stores them in disarray.

The items accumulated vary from one person to another. Someone might hoard boxes, magazines, containers, bags, or old clothing. An individual with hoarding disorder believes the items might be useful for them someday, or they derive great joy from their belongings and they are hesitant to discard them.

Because the items in a hoarding situation accumulate in excess and in a chaotic fashion, the living space of a person with hoarding disorder is often cluttered. The clutter can reach an extreme level so that living space can no longer be used as intended. For example, a kitchen table becomes so cluttered there is no space for a place setting, or a hallway is so stacked with possessions it is difficult to walk through.

The overwhelming amount of clutter can affect relationships, hygiene, or work of a person with hoarding disorder. It can create an unhygienic situation, leading to infestation of pests such as cockroaches or rodents. People with hoarding disorder may avoid having visitors over. In some cases, the clutter can present physical dangers such as a fire hazard, danger of falls, or other risks from the inability to safely navigate the space.

Who is at increased risk for hoarding disorder?

Hoarding disorder affects approximately 2% to 6% of the adult population, and occurs evenly in men and women. Hoarding is more common in individuals who have a family member with the disorder, and it is seen more often in people who live alone.

Studies have found that the first symptoms of hoarding disorder are typically seen during the teen years, with symptoms worsening over time. Hoarding is not seen often in children because their parents take a more active role in controlling their environment.

Hoarding occurs three times as often in older adults as in the general population. This is of particular concern because hoarding can exacerbate the risks of older adults falling, or of misplacing important items such as medications or prescription glasses.

More than 60% of people with clinically significant hoarding also have another psychiatric disorder. The most common coexisting psychiatric conditions are major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia. In some cases, conditions such as dementia or stroke may be responsible for hoarding behavior.

Symptoms of hoarding disorder

In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) recognized hoarding as a disorder under the umbrella of obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders. According to the APA, hoarding disorder is characterized by ongoing difficulty in letting go of possessions, regardless of their actual worth. This is driven by a strong urge to save items and distress about discarding them.

As a result, belongings pile up, cluttering living spaces and interfering with their normal use. If these areas are kept clear, it's usually because family, friends, or professional cleaners have stepped in. The hoarding also leads to considerable distress or challenges in daily life, affecting relationships, work, and the ability to maintain a safe living environment.

Stressful life events can intensify symptoms of hoarding.

Why do people with hoarding disorder feel compelled to hoard?

Though hoarding has been studied for over two decades, there is still more to learn about the disorder, including why people with hoarding disorder feel compelled to hoard. While research indicates a connection between hoarding and difficulties in information processing skills like planning, problem-solving, memory, learning, attention, and organization, that deficit does not adequately explain the need to hoard.

Many people who hoard do not see it as a problem. They have little awareness of how it's affecting their life or the lives of those around them. Some studies have shown that family members of individuals who hoard tend to rate the severity of the hoarding behavior significantly higher than how they believe the person who hoards would rate their own symptoms.

Treating hoarding disorder

Hoarding disorder is a challenging condition to treat, but with the right support, individuals can make meaningful progress toward changing their habits.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for hoarding

The most successful treatment for hoarding disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. CBT is a type of talk therapy in which an individual works with a trained therapist over a length of time to address emotions, thoughts, and behaviors related to problematic conduct.

In a person with hoarding disorder, CBT would help the person develop a better understanding of why they need to hoard objects, along with training on decision-making, sorting and discarding, and organization.

Relaxation techniques may also be incorporated into the therapy. CBT does not involve home cleanup, nor does it target the social consequences of hoarding.

Medications

There are no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of hoarding disorder. However, a class of medications known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often prescribed in people with hoarding disorder who also have anxiety or depression.

Coping with hoarding disorder

Coping with hoarding disorder can be difficult, but there is help. Getting support from a therapist, especially through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help you understand why it's hard to let go and teach you strategies for avoiding clutter.

If you or someone you know is struggling with hoarding disorder, reaching out to a healthcare provider or mental health professional is the first step toward finding support. It can also help to surround yourself with supportive friends or family. Progress takes time, but every step can lead to a safer and more comfortable space.",Jenette Restivo,"November 18, 2024"

        Food poisoning from Listeria can be dangerous, or even deadly. About 1,600 people get a Listeria infection each year in the U.S., and about 260 people die from the disease.
        How Listeria causes food poisoning
        The bacteria that cause listeriosis can be found in moist environments, including soil, water, and decaying vegetation. Animals can also carry Listeria bacteria in their intestines without getting sick themselves. As a result, tood can become infected with Listeria during harvesting, processing, preparation, or storage.
        If contaminated food is eaten, the bacteria can cause food poisoning.
        Symptoms of listeriosis
        The symptoms of listeriosis vary depending on whether the infection is limited to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or has spread beyond the gut.
        People infected with Listeria may feel symptoms within a few hours or days after eating contaminated food. Intestinal symptoms include diarrhea and vomiting. Symptoms usually resolve within three days, and most people feel better with rest and drinking plenty of fluids.
        Invasive listeriosis, the term for listeriosis that spreads beyond the GI tract, can take several weeks to cause symptoms. Symptoms of invasive Listeria infection include:
        
          fever
          muscle aches
          fatigue
          headache
          stiff neck
          gastroenteritis
          confusion
          loss of balance
          seizures.
        
        A severe Listeria infection may spread to the bloodstream or brain. Severe infections may cause life-threatening conditions such as sepsis, meningitis, or encephalitis.
        Some pregnant women who develop listeriosis have no symptoms or have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, or a serious infection in the newborn.
        Foods most likely to be contaminated with Listeria
        The foods that are most likely to be contaminated with Listeria include:
        
          deli meats
          hot dogs
          unpasteurized raw milk
          unpasteurized soft cheeses
          raw sprouts
          smoked seafood.
        
        While these foods have the highest risk of Listeria monocytogenes contamination, listeriosis can affect almost any improperly handled or prepared food.
        How to reduce your risk of food poisoning
        Some tips to reduce your risk of food poisoning from listeriosis or other food-borne illnesses, such as Salmonella poisoning, include the following:
        
          Set your refrigerator at 40o  F (4o C) or lower and your freezer at 0o F (andndash;18 o C). Those temperatures can slow the growth of Listeria, which can grow even in cold temperatures. Use a refrigerator thermometer and adjust the settings if necessary.
          Use refrigerated foods by the date listed on the package. The longer you keep them, the higher the risk of Listeria growing.
          Clean your refrigerator regularly, and wipe up spills right away so Listeria doesn't have a place to grow.
        
        Other steps you can take to reduce your risk of food poisoning include washing your hands before and after handling food, and using separate cutting boards and utensils for produce and raw meats or seafood.
        A food thermometer can help ensure that meat, poultry, fish, and other foods are cooked to a safe internal temperature.
        Raw pet food is another potential source of Listeria contamination, so take care when preparing your pet's meals.
        Who is at greatest risk for severe illness from Listeria?
        People at greatest risk for severe illness from Listeria include pregnant women, newborn babies, people ages 65 and older, and people with a weakened immune system, such as those being treated for cancer.
        Listeria can harm a fetus even if the mother has mild symptoms. About one in four pregnant women who get listeriosis will miscarry or lose their baby shortly after birth.
        What to know about food recalls
        When a number of people get sick from eating or drinking the same contaminated food, it's defined as a food-borne disease outbreak. This can lead to a food recall by the U.S. government.
        If a food in your home matches the details on a food recall notice, don't open or consume the product. Instead, bring the product to the place where you bought it for a refund, or dispose of it to make sure no one will consume it.
        FoodSafety.gov, a U.S. government website, maintains a current list of food recalls and food-borne disease outbreaks, and advises what to do with a recalled product.
        Treating food poisoning caused by Listeria
        Most people with intestinal symptoms of listeriosis, such as vomiting and diarrhea, recover within a couple of days with rest and fluids.
        Women who are pregnant will be prescribed an antibiotic to treat listeriosis. Antibiotics are also prescribed to people who are very ill or who are at risk of becoming very ill with an invasive Listeria infection.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","November 15, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-probiotics-help-calm-inflammatory-bowel-disease-202411133081,Can probiotics help calm inflammatory bowel disease?,"Approximately three million Americans have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is an umbrella term for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, illnesses marked by chronic or repeated bouts of inflammation in the digestive tract. Both types of IBD represent a complex interplay of genes, environment, and immune factors.

Current therapies for IBD suppress the immune system to reduce inflammation. But emerging research on the human microbiome may help scientists better understand and manage IBD. And some preliminary studies on cells, animals, and humans have investigated whether probiotics — which are sometimes called ""good"" bacteria — are beneficial for people with IBD.

The healthy microbiome: Building a barrier

The human intestinal microbiome is the vast community of trillions of helpful and harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms that inhabit our gut. Ideally, the lining of the gut acts as a barrier that prevents harmful bacteria and toxins from entering the bloodstream.

A healthy microbiome helps this lining block out harmful bacteria while enabling it to absorb nutrients. Beneficial bacteria in the microbiome promote a healthy, hospitable gut environment that limits inflammation and helps crowd out harmful bacteria.

Recent studies on human cells and in mice suggest that a healthy microbiome produces substances that


	nourish cells lining the colon, so that they form a tight barrier difficult for harmful bacteria to penetrate
	interact with immune cells in the gut, reducing inflammation
	prompt the gut lining to make mucus that acts as an additional barrier to harmful bacteria.


In animal studies, a healthy microbiome is essential to help build and maintain an effective barrier. Animals raised in the laboratory without a microbiome, or whose microbiome has been depleted by antibiotics, have intestinal linings that are easily damaged.

An unbalanced microbiome: Inflammation and damage

What happens if the microbiome doesn't have a good balance of helpful and harmful bacteria? The gut lining may become increasingly permeable. That may allow potentially harmful bacteria and their toxins to cross into the intestinal tissue and then into the bloodstream, triggering inflammation that can damage the gut.

An imbalanced microbiome is known as dysbiosis. And the inflammatory cascade linked to dysbiosis is a hallmark of IBD.

Probiotics: More promise than evidence

Probiotics — live microorganisms in supplements or in fermented foods like kombucha, kefir, yogurt, and sauerkraut — have been proposed as therapies for IBD. The idea is that by eating beneficial bacteria we can restore and maintain a balanced microbiome, reduce inflammation, and improve the gut barrier. But what does the evidence say?

Thus far, no probiotic therapy is routinely prescribed for IBD. Small randomized studies have compared specific probiotics with standard immunosuppressive therapies for IBD. The studies measured IBD symptoms, remission rates, or quality of life. Results were mixed at best:


	Ulcerative colitis. Some studies suggest that certain bacterial strains, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, are somewhat effective for ulcerative colitis, reducing symptoms, promoting remission, and improving quality of life. But these effects are modest compared to standard therapies, and probiotics have not shown enough benefit to be accepted in medical practice.
	Pouchitis. Some people with IBD may need surgery to remove the colon (large intestine). This can lead to inflammation in the remaining small intestine, which gets formed into a J-shaped pouch and attached to the anus. However, 25% to 45% of people who have a J-pouch later experience inflammation known as pouchitis. Several studies show that combining standard medication with a probiotic mix called VSL#3 effectively quells the symptoms and inflammation of pouchitis. VSL#3 contains eight strains of bacteria. It is used to treat chronic pouchitis, which is the only accepted use of probiotics in common practice for IBD.
	Crohn's disease. Probiotics have not been studied as rigorously in Crohn's disease as in ulcerative colitis. Most of the limited set of studies found that probiotics are no better than placebo in reducing symptoms or promoting remission.


Diet, fiber, and prebiotics: A role in IBD?

The makeup and activity of our microbiomes can be altered by diet. That's true even if the foods you consume aren't well-known probiotic stars like kombucha, yogurt, kefir, and other fermented foods.

Gut bacteria that break down dietary fiber are a cornerstone of a healthy microbiome. A high-fiber diet can boost the number of these bacteria, as well as their beneficial and anti-inflammatory effects.

Food ingredients that are not absorbed by the gut but are instead consumed by the gut microbiome are called prebiotics. We have limited — though promising — evidence supporting prebiotics for people with IBD. Currently, no specific prebiotic food or supplement is recommended for general use.

However, the Mediterranean diet, which encourages fiber-rich vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, may modestly reduce symptoms and markers of inflammation in IBD. While these effects are small and inconsistent, the Mediterranean diet improves overall health in people with or without IBD. Largely for this reason, the American Gastroenterology Association recommends it for people who have IBD.

The bottom line

Probiotics, and possibly even prebiotics, hold promise. But we don't yet know how to harness their full potential for treating IBD. While current evidence suggests probiotics may one day be an effective way to help treat IBD, the complexity of the microbiome means that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to work.

Many questions remain: Which strains of bacteria in the gut should we study? How do we determine the best cocktail of probiotics to reap maximum benefit? Given that everyone's microbiome is different, is a personalized approach to probiotics the right strategy? How can we define ideal dosage and formulation of probiotics?

Delivery method (capsules, powders, foods), dosage, and duration of treatment all require more research. Until these questions are answered, probiotics and prebiotics remain complementary strategies in treating IBD alongside standard immunosuppressive therapies.","Jake Dockterman, MD, PhD","November 13, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/digestive-enzymes-how-supplements-like-lactaid-and-beano-can-help-with-digestion,Digestive enzymes: How supplements like Lactaid and Beano can help with digestion,"If you're struggling with bloating or discomfort after consuming dairy, beans, or certain vegetables, digestive enzyme supplements might be what your body needs to process these tricky foods.

What are digestive enzyme supplements?

There's a lot that goes on behind the scenes during digestion. As food makes its way through your gastrointestinal (GI) tract, your digestive organs break it down into smaller parts, in part by using digestive juices. Digestive juices contain enzymes that break down food into smaller components of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. There are different enzymes for different components; for example, the enzyme amylase breaks down carbohydrates, the enzyme protease breaks down proteins, and the enzyme lipase breaks down fats.

Your pancreas, stomach, and small intestine naturally produce these enzymes. However, sometimes the body doesn't produce enough enzymes. This can slow down digestion and lead to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and gas.

Sometimes people can't make enough digestive enzymes because of a health condition like chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis. In these cases, a doctor will prescribe enzyme pills to substitute for the lack of natural enzyme production.

However, in cases of lactose intolerance or difficulty digesting complex carbohydrates found in beans and certain gas-producing vegetables, over-the-counter (OTC) digestive enzyme supplements may be enough improve digestion and provide relief from discomfort.

How do supplements like Lactaid and Beano work?

Lactaid and Beano are two popular digestive enzyme supplements that can help people digest specific foods more easily. Both supplements target specific digestive issues by providing enzymes the body may not naturally produce in sufficient quantities. And both are available without a prescription.

Lactaid dietary supplements contain lactase, an enzyme that breaks down lactose, a sugar found in dairy products. People who are lactose intolerant lack sufficient lactase, leading to symptoms like gas, bloating, and diarrhea after consuming dairy. Lactaid dietary supplements can be used every time you eat foods that contain dairy. But many people find that they can digest certain forms of dairy (like hard cheeses) more easily than other forms (like milk or ice cream). A little experimentation can help you figure out when you need an assist from an enzyme supplement.

Beano contains alpha-galactosidase, an enzyme that helps break down a type of non-absorbable fiber found in beans, root vegetables, and some dairy products. These foods can be difficult for the body to digest, and may cause gas and bloating. Beano breaks down the non-absorbable fiber before it reaches the intestines, where it would otherwise ferment and produce gas. Taking Beano before meals can help prevent gas-related symptoms like flatulence, abdominal cramping, and bloating. Beano is taken in tablet form right before eating or with your first bite.

Who can benefit from digestive enzyme supplements?

Digestive enzyme supplements can benefit people who struggle to digest certain foods due to low levels of the enzymes that process those foods. For example, individuals with lactose intolerance (which affects up to 75% of the world's population) may benefit from lactase supplements like Lactaid.

Similarly, more than 20% of the population experiences abdominal pain caused by intestinal gas resulting from difficulty digesting complex carbohydrates in beans and certain vegetables. They may find relief from supplements like Beano.

While the evidence is still unsettled, some people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may find digestive enzymes helpful for managing their symptoms.

Are digestive enzyme supplements safe?

Digestive enzyme supplements are generally safe for most people, but there are a few important considerations.

For example, Beano may cause allergic reactions in people with alpha-gal syndrome or mold allergies. Those with galactosemia, a metabolic disorder that causes an inability to metabolize the sugar galactose, should consult their doctor before using Beano.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women and young children should check with their doctor before using a lactase product like Lactaid.

Finally, as is the case with all OTC supplements, digestive enzyme supplements are not regulated by the FDA. As a result, the quality and content of these products can vary. This means you can't always be sure about the ingredients or enzyme concentration in these supplements. Prescription enzyme medications, on the other hand, are tightly regulated.",Jenette Restivo,"November 13, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/could-imaging-scans-replace-biopsies-during-prostate-cancer-screening-202411083080,Could imaging scans replace biopsies during prostate cancer screening?,"Abnormal results on a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening test for cancer are typically followed by a systematic biopsy. During that procedure, doctors use a long needle to extract roughly a dozen samples from the prostate while looking at the gland on an ultrasound machine. Those samples can then be checked for cancer under a microscope.
        Limitations and concerns
        But systematic biopsies can be problematic. A major concern is that they overdiagnose low-grade, slow-growing tumors that might never become life-threatening, thereby leading to unnecessary treatments.
        Researchers are seeking alternatives to the systematic biopsy in men flagged by PSA screening. One option is to start with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate, and then focus the biopsy only on areas that look suspicious for cancer. This is called an MRI-targeted biopsy, and it's becoming increasingly common.
        Could an MRI miss early-stage cancer that later turns out to be incurable? This is an outstanding worry, especially since systematic biopsies sometimes find newly-forming cancer that MRIs aren't yet able to detect. Indeed, systematic and targeted biopsies are often given together to boost the odds of finding clinically significant disease that may need immediate treatment.
        Methodology
        Now, a large Swedish study provides encouraging evidence favoring the MRI-only approach.
        The team invited 38,316 men ranging from 50 to 60 years in age to undergo PSA screening. If a man's PSA level was 3.0 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) or higher, then he was enrolled into the study. The investigators wound up with 13,153 men who were randomly distributed between two groups:
        
          Systematic biopsy group: All the men in this group got a systematic biopsy plus an MRI. If a man's MRI was positive for suspicious lesions, then he also got a targeted biopsy.
          MRI-targeted biopsy group: All of the men in this group got an MRI, but none got a systematic biopsy. Men with suspicious lesions on MRI got a targeted biopsy.
        
        This initial screening round was followed by repeat screening rounds — all following the same protocols — at two-, four-, and eight-year-intervals.
        What the study showed
        After a median follow-up of 3.9 years (starting from and including the first screening round), prostate cancer had been detected in 185 men from the MRI-targeted group and 298 men from the systematic biopsy group. Systematic biopsies generated more clinically insignificant cancer diagnoses — 159 compared to 68 in the MRI-targeted group. During the first screening round, ""The risk of such a diagnosis was 51% lower in the MRI-targeted biopsy group than the systematic biopsy group,"" the authors wrote.
        The authors emphasized that omitting biopsies in patients with MRI-negative results cut diagnoses of clinically insignificant cancer, meaning cancer that is slow-growing and may never need treatment, by more than half. ""And importantly, the associated risk of detecting clinically significant cancer during follow-up and at later screening visits was very low in both groups,"" said Dr. Jonas Hugosson, chief urologist at the University of Gothenberg and the study's first author. ""A total of 14 such cases (0.2 % of men who participated) were diagnosed in the systematic biopsy group and eight (0.1 %) in the MRI-targeted biopsy group.""
        Commentary from experts
        ""This study provides encouraging — though very early — data that supports the increasing use of MRI as the first diagnostic modality, following evaluation of an abnormal PSA value,"" said Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor-in-chief of the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases. ""The practice of not automatically going to prostate needle biopsy when an abnormal PSA is detected has gained in popularity in Europe, and this study may help increase its usefulness in the United States.""
        ""While these results are encouraging, the decision to omit biopsy in men with a negative MRI must be individualized based on the risk of detecting prostate cancer,"" added Dr. Boris Gershman, a urologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School focusing on prostate and bladder cancer. ""For example, biopsy may still be considered in men with markedly elevated PSA, even if the prostate MRI does not identify any lesions.""",Charlie Schmidt,"November 8, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/celiac-disease-exploring-four-myths-202411063079,Celiac disease: Exploring four myths,"Celiac disease is a digestive and immune disorder that can keep the body from absorbing necessary nutrients. ""Our conception and awareness of celiac disease has evolved over the past few decades, but there are still aspects that remain poorly understood,"" says Dr. Ciaran Kelly, medical director of the Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        Perhaps not surprisingly, misconceptions are widespread among the general public. One example? Many people assume that everyone who has celiac disease is plagued by abdominal pain, bloating, or diarrhea. But actually, many adults newly diagnosed with this inherited gluten intolerance don't have these symptoms.
        What's more, gluten — the sticky protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye — can cause gastrointestinal distress and other symptoms in people who don't have celiac disease. Read on for a deeper dive into four myths and facts about celiac disease and related digestive conditions.
        Myth # 1: Celiac disease is usually diagnosed at a young age
        Not typically. While celiac disease can develop any time after a baby's first exposure to gluten, it's usually diagnosed much later in life. According to the National Celiac Association, the average age of diagnosis is between 46 and 56. Around 25% of people are diagnosed after age 60.
        Celiac disease is slightly more common in women and among people with other autoimmune conditions, including type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (a common cause of low thyroid levels), and dermatitis herpetiformis (a rare condition marked by an itchy, blistering rash).
        ""We don't know why some people go from being susceptible to actually having celiac disease,"" says Dr. Kelly. The prevailing theory is that some sort of physical or emotional stress — such as a viral infection, surgery, or anxiety from a stressful life event — may ""flip the switch"" and cause the disease to appear, he says. ""Increasing numbers of people are being diagnosed at midlife and older, often after they're found to have conditions such as anemia or osteoporosis caused by nutrient deficiencies,"" says Dr. Kelly.
        Myth #2: Celiac disease only affects the gut
        When people have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune system attack that can ravage the lining of the small intestine. A healthy small intestine is lined with fingerlike projections, called villi, that absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the immune system attacks the villi, causing them to flatten and become inflamed — and thus unable to adequately absorb nutrients.
        While gastrointestinal problems can occur, they aren't always present. In fact, celiac disease can present with many different symptoms that affect the nervous, endocrine, and skeletal systems. A few examples are brain fog, changes in menstrual periods, or muscle and joint pain.
        Myth # 3: Celiac disease versus gluten intolerance
        If you feel sick after eating gluten, you probably have celiac disease, right? Actually, that may not be true. Some people have non-celiac gluten sensitivity (also called gluten intolerance), which can cause uncomfortable digestive symptoms after eating gluten. But gluten intolerance differs from celiac disease.
        
          Celiac disease is diagnosed with blood tests that look for specific antibodies. If antibodies are present, a definitive diagnosis requires an intestinal biopsy to look for signs of damage that characterize the condition.
          Non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not trigger antibodies or cause intestinal damage. Yet some people with this problem say they also experience brain fog, trouble concentrating, muscle aches and pain, and fatigue after eating gluten-containing foods.
        
        ""Non-celiac gluten sensitivity appears to be a real phenomenon, but it's not well defined,"" says Dr. Kelly. It's unclear whether people experiencing it are intolerant to gluten or to something else in gluten-containing foods.
        
          One possibility is sugarlike molecules known as FODMAPs, which are found in many foods — including wheat. Short for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, gas and bloating can occur when gut bacteria feed on FODMAPs.
          Another possibility is an allergy to wheat, which can cause symptoms such as swelling, itching, or irritation of the mouth and throat after eating wheat. Other symptoms include a skin rash, stuffy nose, and headache, as well as cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Some people may develop a life-threating allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis.
        
        Myth #4: A gluten-free diet always relieves the symptoms and signs of celiac disease
        The sole treatment for celiac disease — adopting a diet that avoids all gluten-containing foods — doesn't always help. This problem is known as nonresponsive celiac disease.
        ""About 20% of people with celiac disease have ongoing symptoms, despite their best efforts to stick to a gluten-free diet,"" says Dr. Kelly. Others have intermittent signs and symptoms, particularly when they are accidentally exposed to gluten. Accidental exposures often happen when people eat prepared or restaurant foods that claim to be gluten-free but are not. Cross contamination with gluten-containing foods is another potential route.
        Potential solutions to nonresponsive celiac disease are being studied. Three promising approaches are:
        
          Enzymes that break down gluten, which people could take alongside gluten-containing foods. ""It's a similar concept to the lactase pills taken by people who are lactose intolerant to help them digest dairy products,"" says Dr. Kelly.
          Dampening the immune response to gluten by inhibiting an enzyme called tissue transglutaminase that makes gluten more potent as an antigen.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/behcets-disease-a-to-z,Behcet's disease,"What is Behcet's disease?
        Behçet's (bay-setz) disease is a rare disease that causes inflammation of many parts of the body. These include the skin of the genital area, lining of the mouth, eye, nervous system, joints, and blood vessels. The most characteristic problems include ulcers in the mouth and genital areas, and serious eye inflammation. It is also called Behçet's syndrome.
        The exact cause of the disease remains unclear. But Behçet's disease is thought to involve an autoimmune response. This means the body's defense mechanism begins to attack its own tissues. Something in the environment may trigger this abnormal immune response in susceptible individuals. Genetic factors may also play a role.
        Usually, symptoms flare up repeatedly and then improve. The time between attacks may be as short as a few days or as long as years. In some people with more severe disease, symptoms vary in intensity but are always present.
        The first symptoms usually appear between ages 20 and 30.
        Symptoms of Behcet's disease
        Symptoms are different in each person. They range from mild to severe.
        People with Behçet's disease usually have painful sores in the mouth that are quite similar or identical to canker sores. But while canker sores generally occur one at a time, people with Behçet's disease tend to have multiple sores.
        More than half of people with Behçet's disease have sores around the genitals. These sores look like the mouth sores.
        Behçet's disease can cause rashes, including acne-like bumps on the skin. It can cause inflammation around hair follicles. Blood clots can occur, usually in the legs. They can cause pain and tenderness.
        Many people with Behçet's disease have joint pain and swelling, usually in the knees, ankles, and wrists. The joints can be stiff and painful for several weeks at a time. But the disease usually does not cause long-term joint damage or deformity.
        Up to three-quarters of people with Behçet's disease have eye inflammation. Specifically, a condition called uveitis usually shows up within two years of the first symptoms. At first, uveitis can cause blurred vision. Repeated flare-ups of uveitis can lead to decreased vision or even blindness.
        In about 10% of cases, Behçet's disease causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include fever, stiff neck, headache, and uncoordinated movements.
        Rarely, Behçet's disease will inflame the intestinal tract. This can cause diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, and stomach pain.
        Diagnosing Behcet's disease
        Diagnosing Behçet's disease can be difficult. The disease is rare and its symptoms can be similar to those of other diseases.
        Certain rare characteristics of this disease can be helpful in diagnosis, such as recurrent, simultaneous, and multiple oral and genital ulcers. In addition, inflammation of the lungs' arteries in Behçet's disease may cause an aneurysm. This rarely occurs in any other condition.
        Some doctors test for Behçet's disease by pricking the skin with a needle. This is called a pathergy test. After one or two days, people with Behçet's can develop a lump or nodule where the needle broke the skin.
        A skin biopsy can also support the diagnosis. In a biopsy, a small piece of skin is removed to be examined in a laboratory.
        No tests can confirm or rule out Behçet's disease with great certainty. To diagnose the disease, doctors look for the key symptoms. These include recurring mouth sores, genital sores, skin rashes, and eye inflammation.
        Expected duration of Behcet's disease
        Behçet's disease can be a chronic (long-lasting) condition. The symptoms sometimes diminish over time and disappear for as long as several years.
        Preventing Behcet's disease
        There is no way to prevent Behçet's disease.
        Treating Behcet's disease
        Research regarding treatment of a condition as rare as Behçet's disease is difficult to perform. Large, definitive studies have not been performed. Therefore, it is uncertain which treatment options are best. In general, treatment focuses on relieving the symptoms and depends on which parts of the body the disease affects.
        
          Rashes and sores in the mouth and genital area:

	for mild disease: topical corticosteroids (ointments, creams, rinses applied to the skin)for more significant disease or if topical treatment is not successful: colchicine, dapsone apremilast, or, rarely, thalidomidefor more severe disease: immune suppressants, including a pill form of corticosteroid, azathioprine (Imuran), or methotrexate (Otrexup, Trexall, Rheumatrex)for mouth pain: novocaine-type agents; a mixture of Kaopectate, diphenhydramine (Benadryl), and lidocaine as a mouth rinse can provide temporary relief
          Arthritis — The most commonly prescribed medications are colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), azathioprine (Imuran), and methotrexate
          Eye disease — Corticosteroids (drops, injections, or pills), colchicine, and immunosuppressants (including cyclosporine drops or pills, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine).
        
        Some studies suggest that immunosuppressants such as interferon (Betaseron and others), adalimumab (Humira), azathioprine (Imuran), etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept), or rituximab (Rituxan) may improve disease that has not responded to other treatments. For severe disease that affects many parts of the body, combinations of medications may be prescribed.
        Vascular surgery may be necessary for aneurysms. This is particularly true if they are expanding and at risk for rupture. Blood thinners are usually recommended if blood clots complicate this disease.
        Nonmedication therapy for joint pain, including exercise, is encouraged as soon as symptoms allow.

        Make an appointment with your doctor if you have unexplained sores in your mouth or other symptoms of Behçet's disease.
        Prognosis
        Most people with Behçet's disease are able to control their symptoms and live normal lives. If the first symptoms cannot be controlled with medications, more serious symptoms can appear.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/breathe-better-after-a-chest-cold-flu-pneumonia-or-covid,"Breathe better after a chest cold, flu, pneumonia, or COVID","Winter is almost here, along with an increased risk for infections that can settle in your lungs, such as the flu, pneumonia, COVID-19, or bronchitis. If you get one of these illnesses, beware that it can leave you with two lung problems, even when you're feeling better. One is mucus secretions in the lungs that fester, continue the infection process, and make it hard to breathe. The other is weakness in the respiratory muscles that move the lungs. To recover successfully, take action with a few exercises.
        Clear out mucus secretions
        If you notice a rattle or congestion in your lungs, try these exercises to clear mucus secretions.
        Huffing. Huffing is exhaling like you're trying to fog up a mirror. It's a little more forceful than the way you'd normally exhale. When you have mucus in the lungs, huffing helps keeps the airways open, making it easier to clear secretions. ""Take a deep breath in, hold it for a few seconds, then huff slowly, for as long as you can. That will push air out, move secretions, and trigger a productive cough. Repeat the process, but not so many times that it causes discomfort. Huff and cough whenever you need to clear secretions throughout the day. And don't swallow them; spit them out,"" says Heather Philben, a physical therapist who teaches breathing techniques and helps people regain respiratory muscle strength at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital.
        Using vibrations. You can purchase a small tool online called a flutter valve or an acapella valve (prices start at about $24). It might look like a child's bubble pipe or kazoo. ""You blow into it and hear small balls fluttering inside it. The vibrations reach into your airways and help loosen secretions. Try to cough after using the tool,"" Philben suggests. ""The secretions loosened by the vibrations may be coughed up more easily.""
        Performing an active cycle of breathing. This is a series of breaths and coughs that dislodges mucus in the lungs. ""Take four relaxed breaths. Then take four deep breaths, holding each one for three seconds before exhaling. Follow that with four relaxed breaths, then three huffing exhalations, and then a cough,"" Philben says.
        One other exercise to help clear mucus secretions is done with the help of a physical therapist in an outpatient clinic. It's called postural drainage and manual percussion. You lie down, and a physical therapist gently pats your chest like a drum over the congested area of the lungs.
        Strengthen your breathing muscles
        Your respiratory muscles can lose strength if you have an extended illness or one that requires you to go on a ventilator. If you're feeling short of breath, Philben recommends the following exercises.
        Diaphragmatic breathing. For difficulty inhaling, strengthen your diaphragm — the large dome-shaped muscle below your lungs. To tell if you are using your diaphragm, lie on your back, place one hand on your belly, and breathe deeply. Your hand and belly should rise as you breathe in. ""Take 10 nice, slow, even breaths and focus on breathing. Rest for a minute, and repeat the process,"" Philben says. ""Once you feel confident that you're using your diaphragm to breathe while lying down, try the exercise while sitting up and eventually while standing. In time, you'll strengthen your diaphragm and train yourself to rely on it instead of muscles at the top of the lungs, which are less effective.""
        Using a respiratory trainer. Once you're good at diaphragmatic breathing, try using a respiratory trainer. This is another kazoo-like device (about $20 or more) that you place in your mouth. It provides resistance to breathing, which makes your diaphragm work harder. With the device in your mouth, take in a deep breath and then exhale fully. ""Set the resistance at a level that you can perform 10 times in a row at a moderate difficulty level. Do this two to three times daily,"" Philben suggests.
        Pursed-lip breathing. If you have difficulty exhaling, pursed-lip breathing will help keep the airways open so you can breathe. ""Purse your lips as if you're slowly blowing out a candle or blowing air through a thin straw. While pursing, inhale as much as you can and then exhale fully. If it helps, breathe through an actual straw,"" Philben says. ""Like diaphragmatic breathing, do pursed-lip breathing at rest until you can do it while walking or climbing stairs,"" Philben says.
        With all of these exercises: ""The goal is using the proper breathing techniques so that they become second nature and help you breathe better when you're out in the real world,"" Philben says, ""and that will get you back to the activities you love.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/fixing-a-leaky-tricuspid-valve,Fixing a leaky tricuspid valve,"Once referred to as the forgotten valve, the tricuspid valve has been getting more attention of late. Earlier this year, the FDA approved two catheter-based devices for repairing a leaky tricuspid valve (see ""Understanding heart valve disease""). Both devices have been shown to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life for people with moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, which affects about 4% of people ages 75 and older.
        The two valves on the left side of the heart (the aortic and mitral valves) are more likely to develop problems than the tricuspid valve, which separates the upper-right and lower-right chambers of the heart. But that's just one reason that tricuspid valve problems have been underappreciated, says Dr. Pinak B. Shah, executive director of interventional and structural heart services at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""People can have a lot of leakage from the tricuspid valve for a long period of time before they start showing any symptoms,"" he says.
        
          
            
              
                Understanding heart valve disease
                
                  
                
                The heart's four valves open and shut in a carefully timed sequence to move blood through and out of the heart to the body. But the leaflets (flaps of tissue that make up the valves) and nearby structures don't always function as they should. Heart valve problems fall into two main categories:
                Regurgitation (also known as leakage or insufficiency). The valve leaflets do not close properly, causing blood to flow backward each time the heart contracts.
                Stenosis (narrowing). The valve leaflets become thick and stiff, so the valve doesn't open as wide as it should to allow blood to pass through.
                Both problems can arise simultaneously in the same valve, and more than one valve may be affected. Malfunctioning heart valves can have serious consequences, potentially hampering the heart's ability to pump sufficient amounts blood throughout the body.
              
            
          
        
        Causes and symptoms
        A range of issues can cause the tricuspid valve to malfunction, including inborn structural problems, heart infections, or conditions (most notably, longstanding atrial fibrillation) that cause the base of the valve to widen. When the valve leaks, blood can flow backward into the right atrium, causing the heart to pump harder. Over time, the heart enlarges and struggles to function normally.
        The main symptom of tricuspid regurgitation — swelling in the legs and lower body — is nonspecific, meaning it may result from many different conditions. The most common of these is age-related venous insufficiency (when the leg veins have trouble carrying blood back up to the heart). But when tricuspid regurgitation is the actual cause, the abdomen may also become distended, so much so that people notice they're not as hungry as usual, says Dr. Shah. In very severe cases, they may also feel short of breath.
        Treatment options
        Medications that help remove fluid from the body, known as diuretics, can help relieve the swelling and related symptoms of tricuspid regurgitation. Open heart surgery to repair or replace the valve can fix the problem. ""But by the time people really get into trouble, they are often too sick to undergo surgery, not just from the valve issue but other medical problems,"" says Dr. Shah.
        Now, less-invasive treatments are an option. Both of the newly approved devices are placed in the heart via a catheter passed through an artery in the upper leg, an approach that's long been used to treat aortic and mitral valve problems. One tricuspid device is a modification of a device approved in 2013 to treat mitral valve regurgitation. It works by bringing the valve leaflets together at the areas of most severe leakage, Dr. Shah explains. The other device delivers a new valve made of cow heart tissue, which is commonly used in surgical valve replacements.
        When to intervene — and how?
        Even if a heart ultrasound (echo­cardiogram) reveals tricuspid regurgitation, a person might have normal heart function and no symptoms. ""Do we intervene at that point to prevent long-term complications, or should we wait until they have symptoms and changes in heart function? That's the question experts are currently struggling with,"" says Dr. Shah. Right now, people who have symptoms despite taking diuretics are considered possible candidates for one of the catheter-based devices, he says. Ideally, they should be seen at a specialized valve disease center, where they can receive additional evaluation to determine if one of the new devices (or more traditional surgery) would be the most appropriate treatment.

The alternative is open heart surgery, in which a cardiac surgeon uses an artery or vein taken from elsewhere in the body to reroute blood around the blocked artery.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/whats-your-brain-care-score,What's your Brain Care Score?,"After someone receives the devastating diagnosis of stroke or dementia, family members inevitably have many questions. ""But the one question I get all the time is, 'What can I do to take good care of my brain so I don't end up like this?'"" says Dr. Jonathan Rosand, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. So he collaborated with patients and colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital's McCance Center for Brain Health to create the McCance Brain Care Score.
        The measurement — the first of its kind — tallies points from 12 physical, lifestyle, and social-emotional domains (see ""What factors affect brain health?""). It was validated using data from nearly 400,000 adults ages 40 through 69 who were followed an average of 12.5 years. The study, published Nov. 30, 2023, by Frontiers in Neurology, found that people who scored higher at the start of the study had lower risks of developing strokes or dementia over time. Each year, more than 795,000 people suffer a stroke in the United States, and dementia affects one in seven Americans.
        The results varied by age group, with more dramatic drops among people younger than 50 compared to those ages 59 and older. But the benefits were still evident for people in their 60s: a five-point higher score was linked to a 33% lower risk of stroke. A subsequent study found that higher scores were also associated with a lower risk of depression over time.
        
          
            
              
                What factors affect brain health?
                The McCance Brain Care Score was designed as a simple tool to encourage people to identify and modify factors that put them at risk for common, age-related brain disorders. It includes multiple-choice options for
                4. physical components: blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, and body mass index
                5. lifestyle components: nutrition, alcohol intake, smoking, aerobic activities, and sleep
                3. social-emotional components: stress management, social relationships, and meaning in life.
                Each response is assigned a point value; these are added to determine the Brain Care Score, with 21 the highest possible total. Higher scores mean better brain care.
              
            
          
        
        Benefits beyond the brain?
        ""The findings support earlier evidence showing that it's never too late to raise your Brain Care Score,"" says Dr. Rosand. While the impact may be greater when you're younger, it's still substantial when you're older. And if you've already had a stroke or have early cognitive decline, raising your score is likely to reduce your risk of another stroke and might even slow the rate of your cognitive decline.
        Every four minutes, someone in the United States dies from a stroke-related cause. Yet at least 60% of strokes are preventable by changing behaviors, habits, and other risk factors that contribute to stroke. Among the most potent of these are (1) not smoking and (2) keeping your blood pressure below 120/80 mm Hg. Both factors net three points each on the Brain Care Score.
        What's more, the same things that benefit your brain are also closely linked to lower risks for heart disease and heart failure, as well as many cancers, including those of the lung, breast, and colon. ""As those of us who focus on brain health like to say, 'Take care of your brain, and the rest of your body will follow,'"" says Dr. Rosand.
        Decoding the dementia link
        Heart attacks and strokes are two main examples of problems affecting the vascular system — the network of blood vessels in the body and brain. Another is vascular dementia, which stems from the degeneration of blood vessels in the brain, often from a series of tiny strokes. The symptoms include slowed thinking, confusion, and problems with attention, concentration, and organization. Vascular dementia differs from Alzheimer's disease, which results from brain cell degeneration, Dr. Rosand explains. However, the two conditions often occur together, and Alzheimer's disease is exacerbated by vascular dementia. In fact, it's often difficult to say for certain whether a person has Alzheimer's or vascular dementia. The good news is that a higher Brain Care Score appears to help prevent both types.
        ""The brain is a very metabolically active organ that demands rapid changes in blood supply from second to second,"" says Dr. Rosand. As a result, the brain's smallest vessels constantly dilate and contract to ensure that the regions of the brain that are active have the blood supply they need, while those that are at rest don't receive any more than they need. Over time, damage to these vessels leaves them prone to injury and deterioration. Known as cerebral small vessel disease, it's the most common precursor to vascular dementia.
        In a study published Aug. 27, 2024, in Neurology, Dr. Rosand and colleagues found that a higher Brain Care Score was associated with less visible damage from cerebral small vessel disease. The study involved more than 34,000 middle-aged adults without a history of stroke or dementia who had brain MRI scans. The scans can reveal evidence of damage to small vessels — especially lesions in the brain's white matter, which consists of bundles of nerve fibers that connect brain cells.
        ""The findings provide a physical sign that you can measure in the brain that's correlated to your lifestyle and the degree to which you're modifying your risk factors,"" says Dr. Rosand.
        How to use the Brain Care Score
        Tallying up your Brain Care Score helps you identify what you're doing right and pinpoint the areas you can improve. ""It doesn't matter where you start — just pick one area that seems the easiest,"" says Dr. Rosand. One successful experience often leads people to try other changes, he says.
        Where people live, what they have access to, and their unique lifestyles all influence what they're able to start changing. Dr. Rosand chats with his patients to help them figure out about what solutions might work best for them. For example, a patient who rarely ate vegetables acknowledged liking broccoli and eating it about once a week. ""Why not eat it three times a week?"" Dr. Rosand suggested. It's not that much extra effort to buy and cook a few extra servings.
        A different person whose job demanded long stretches of sitting realized he could add informal exercise to his daily routine by climbing the six flights of stairs to his apartment at least twice a day. ""You don't have to wear fancy exercise gear and go to a gym to meet the recommended exercise goals,"" says Dr. Rosand. Another man, who was recently divorced, didn't have many social relationships outside of work and his immediate family. ""We started talking about his old friends, which reminded him of his artistic aspirations during high school,"" says Dr. Rosand. Within six months, the man was taking painting lessons and meeting new people.
        ""Each of us can find ways to improve our Brain Care Score over time. The key is deciding that you really don't want to develop dementia or stroke and are eager to do something about it,"" he says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/why-you-may-need-therapy,Why you may need therapy,"Men often pride themselves on being helpful problem-solvers. However, sometimes they need help dealing with their own problems stemming from emotional issues.
        ""Many men have trouble processing their feelings and putting them into words, so they need help finding solutions to their problems,"" says Dr. Stephanie Collier, director of education in the division of geriatric psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        This is where confiding in a professional therapist can help. ""Sometimes talking about a problem with a friend or family member is useful, but other times it's better to speak with someone outside your circle, so you can feel more relaxed and open about sharing without worrying about feeling judged,"" says Dr. Collier.
        When you need help
        Depression and anxiety are the most common reasons men seek professional help. Such feelings often arise from grief, like the death of a spouse, friend, or family member. Other situations that can trigger similar responses include health issues, financial anxiety, or the loss of independence (like no longer being able to drive).
        In addition to the trademark symptoms of prolonged sadness and lack of energy, men with depression may adopt self-destructive behavior, like alcohol or opioid abuse. They may experience changes in their social life, such as soured relationships or withdrawal from favorite activities. Anxiety also can cause irritability, insomnia, and trouble with memory and concentration.
        ""While men may recognize these changes, they may not know the root causes, or if they do, what they can do about them,"" says Dr. Collier. ""A therapist can work with you to identify the source of your problems and then devise a strategy to resolve them.""
        
          
            
              
                Questions to ask a potential therapist
                A good rapport with a therapist who matches your specific needs is essential for a successful relationship. Here are some questions to ask as you consider working with a therapist:
                
                  What's your training?
                  What certifications or degrees do you hold?
                  How long have you worked in this field?
                  What kinds of treatment or therapy do you use?
                  What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches, including medication?
                  How does the treatment work?
                  What are the chances that treatment will succeed?
                  How soon should I start feeling better?
                  How will we assess my progress?
                  What should I do if I don't feel better with therapy?
                
              
            
          
        
        How to find a therapist
        The first step is to speak with your doctor about your situation, feelings, and symptoms. ""They should be able to point you to a therapist who can help with your specific issues,"" says Dr. Collier. ""Online sources are also available."" Many kinds of professionals offer therapy (both in-person and virtual). They have different approaches based on their training, education, and areas of experience. For example:
        Psychiatrist. A psychiatrist is a doctor with a medical degree who can prescribe medication and can assist with conditions that often call for drug treatment, such as depression and bipolar disorder.
        Psychologist. This professional has earned a Ph.D. or a Psy.D. in clinical psychology. In most states, psychologists cannot prescribe medication. They evaluate and treat a range of emotional and psychological issues, such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.
        Counselor. A counselor focuses on the problems of everyday living, such as stress and anxiety, relationship conflicts, and mild depression. A licensed professional counselor (LPC) has finished an accredited graduate program plus 2,000 hours of supervised psychotherapy experience.
        Social worker. Similar to a professional counselor in terms of education and training, many social workers focus on mental health issues, dealing with addiction, connecting clients with resources, and helping with referrals to other professionals, if needed. Depending on the state, they may have other credentials such as LCSW (licensed clinical social worker), LICSW (licensed independent clinical social worker), and LSW (licensed social worker).
        Weekly visits are standard at first; depending on your response, you may go more or less often. ""After you have completed your initial sessions and found them successful, you might return for periodic check-ins,"" says Dr. Collier. ""But if you are doing well, you may not need to engage in long-term therapy.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/keeping-score-of-prostate-cancer,Keeping score of prostate cancer,"Men who choose periodic screening for prostate cancer typically get a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. If the PSA level is abnormally high, men often need a biopsy. The biopsy not only confirms the presence of cancer, it also offers information on how it might grow and spread. This is done by creating a Gleason score from the biopsied samples.
        ""The Gleason score is the primary measurement to determine overall management of prostate cancer,"" says Dr. Marc B. Garnick, editor in chief of the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases. ""It's important to understand how Gleason scores are calculated and what they can mean, as your ongoing treatment is often dictated by the results.""
        Getting to the core
        The most common type of prostate biopsy is a transrectal biopsy. Here, the doctor passes a needle through the rectum and into the prostate to remove a small cylinder of tissue, called a core. Typically, 12 core samples are taken from different areas of the prostate. Your doctor also may take tissue samples from questionable areas identified during the DRE or possibly from a prostate MRI, if that was part of the pre-biopsy evaluation.
        Another type of biopsy increasingly being used is a transperineal biopsy. This involves taking tissue core samples through the perineum, the skin between the rectum and scrotum. Studies have found they have fewer complications than transrectal ones. ""Another advantage with transperineal biopsies is that samples are more easily obtained from the front of the prostate, where more aggressive cancer can appear,"" says Dr. Garnick.
        A pathologist then examines the core samples. If the tissue shows prostate cancer, the pathologist grades the most prevalent type of cancer cell on a scale of 3 to 5. The higher the number, the more aggressive the cancer. The pathologist does the same for the second most prevalent type of cancer cell. The sum of the two grades is the Gleason score — for example, 3+3=6, 3+4=7, 4+3=7, 4+4=8, etc. Here's a breakdown of the scores:
        
          6 suggests that cancer will grow slowly and is less likely to spread
          7 indicates intermediate-grade cancer
          8 to 10 (10 being the highest score) means high-grade, aggressive cancer.
        
        Beyond the Gleason score
        The final Gleason score does not provide some important nuances that affect therapy decisions. For instance, a Gleason score of 7 (4+3) is potentially more dangerous than a Gleason score of 7 (3+4). ""The first number represents the common cell pattern,"" says Dr. Garnick. ""Grade 4 cells are more abnormal and more likely to spread than grade 3 cells, so a 4+3 score is a higher-risk cancer than 3+4.""
        Another issue is that high-grade cancers are lumped together. ""There can be big differences between Gleason 8, 9, and 10 cancers in terms of their aggressiveness,"" says Dr. Garnick. Gleason scores can also vary depending on where in the prostate the samples come from. ""Cores might come from different areas of the same tumor or different tumors in the prostate,"" says Dr. Garnick. ""Because the grade can vary within the same tumor or between different tumors, different cores can have different Gleason scores.""
        To help resolve these issues, the International Society of Urological Pathology created a new grading system. It divides Gleason scores into five grade groups:
        
          Grade Group 1 includes Gleason 3+3=6
          Grade Group 2 includes Gleason 3+4=7
          Grade Group 3 includes Gleason 4+3=7
          Grade Group 4 includes Gleason 4+4=8
          Grade Group 5 includes Gleason 4+5=9, 5+4=9, and 5+5=10.
        
        How Gleason scores are used
        Cancers with Gleason scores of 8, 9, or 10 usually require treatment, and your doctor will discuss which options are best for you. However, the necessity and timing of treatment for Gleason scores of 6 and 7 are not always clear-cut.
        Most men with a Gleason 6 or 7 (3+4), which indicates low-risk cancer, can receive treatment or go on active surveillance, in which they monitor their PSA levels for changes. However, some men with low-risk cancer feel uneasy being so close to having more aggressive cancer and may wish to start earlier treatment.
        Other findings from the biopsy are also used to calculate treatment options, such as the number of biopsy cores that contain cancer, the percentage of each core that contains cancer, and whether cancer was found on both sides of the prostate. ""The Gleason score is an important marker in managing prostate cancer, but the number only provides information to help guide therapy decisions,"" says Dr. Garnick. ""Ultimately, it's up to the doctor and patient to determine the next steps.""

LeWine, MD","November 1, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-hidden-dangers-of-prediabetes,The hidden dangers of prediabetes,"Approximately 98 million Americans — more than one in three — have prediabetes, meaning the average amount of sugar (glucose) in their blood is high but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.
        Prediabetes occurs when the body has trouble using glucose for energy because cells become less responsive to insulin produced by the pancreas, a state known as insulin resistance. (Insulin facilitates the transport of glucose out of the blood and into the cells.) The unused glucose builds up in the bloodstream. The difference between diabetes and prediabetes is how high blood sugar levels get.
        ""If you have prediabetes, you obviously want to stop it from progressing to a diagnosis of diabetes,"" says Dr. Howard LeWine, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and editor in chief of Harvard Men's Health Watch. ""But if left alone, prediabetes can be dangerous on its own, as it increases your risk for other serious issues, like cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and fatty liver disease, even if you never get full diabetes.""
        The big three
        Here is a look at each of these three conditions and how they affect people with prediabetes.
        Cardiovascular disease. Research has found that people with prediabetes have a 15% greater risk for cardiovascular disease compared to people who don't have it. That's why it's so important to pay attention to other cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, blood pressure, and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. ""People with prediabetes must quit smoking and strive for lower levels of blood pressure and LDL cholesterol compared to those with normal blood sugar,"" says Dr. LeWine.
        The American Diabetes Association recommends people with prediabetes aim for a blood pressure of less than 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). However, Dr. LeWine suggests those with prediabetes aim for lower numbers, closer to 120/80 mmHg. ""But you and your doctor can decide the best goal for you,"" he says.
        Guidelines suggest people with prediabetes keep LDL levels less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Dr. LeWine says that the lower the LDL, the better, and recommends that people with prediabetes strive for levels of 70 mg/dL or less.
        ""By driving down your blood pressure and cholesterol, you are less likely to accumulate fatty plaque in your arteries, offsetting the excess risk of heart disease and stroke related to prediabetes,"" says Dr. LeWine. He recommends lifestyle changes as your primary approach to manage both blood pressure and cholesterol, adding medication if needed.
        Chronic kidney disease. Having prediabetes puts extra strain on the kidneys as they work to filter sugar and other waste products from the blood. Over time, this can damage the kidneys. In fact, studies have found that people with prediabetes are up to twice as likely to develop chronic kidney disease compared to people with normal blood sugar levels, and the risk increases the longer a person has prediabetes.
        Fatty liver disease. Prediabetes increases the risk for fatty liver disease — now formally known as metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease — in several ways. Elevated glucose levels can cause the body to convert excess glucose into fat, which gets stored in the liver. Insulin resistance can impair the liver's ability to process and break down fats, also leading to fat buildup.
        
          
            
              
                Testing for prediabetes
                Prediabetes usually has no symptoms, which is why an estimated 80% of people with the condition are unaware they have it. Therefore, overweight people are advised to get screened for prediabetes even if they're otherwise in good overall health. Most doctors order a blood test for hemoglobin A1c, which provides an average of blood sugar levels over the prior three months. According to the American Diabetes Association, prediabetes is diagnosed with an A1c from 5.7% to 6.4%.
              
            
          
        
        Lifestyle changes
        Lifestyle changes like weight loss, exercise, and diet are the best ways to manage blood sugar levels and prevent prediabetes from progressing to full diabetes. (Getting sufficient vitamin D also may help.)
        ""But making healthy lifestyle choices doesn't just help lower blood sugar levels. It also helps reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, and fatty liver,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""Even if you need medication to reach your blood pressure and LDL cholesterol goals, you will likely need lower doses if you focus on these three areas.""
        Weight loss. If you are overweight, losing 5% to 10% of your current body weight can improve blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Weight loss if needed is also a key strategy to both prevent and treat fatty liver disease, according to Dr. LeWine.
        Exercise. Federal guidelines suggest that everyone get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise weekly. ""Also add two or three hours of resistance exercises per week using free weights, machines, or body weight,"" says Dr. LeWine. The combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training is linked to better blood sugar control, reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, and a healthier liver.
        Diet. Reduce your intake of foods high in simple carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, processed foods, and high-sugar beverages like fruit juice and soda. These carbs are quickly digested and can cause blood sugar levels to quickly rise and fall. Replace them with complex carbs, such as those in whole grains, beans, green peas, and lentils. Also, increase your intake of fiber-rich foods.
        ""Fiber helps with weight loss by slowing digestion, which helps you feel full and less hungry between meals,"" says Dr. LeWine. And by slowing the body's absorption of glucose, it smooths out spikes in blood sugar.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/short-bursts-of-intense-exercise-may-benefit-stroke-survivors,Short bursts of intense exercise may benefit stroke survivors,"For stroke survivors, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) may boost fitness more than moderate-intensity workouts, a new study finds.
        The study included 82 people who'd had a stroke between six months and five years earlier. Researchers randomly assigned them to one of two exercise regimens. Both were done on recumbent step machines three days per week for 12 weeks. One group alternated between one minute of high-intensity exercise and one minute of low-intensity exercise for a total of 19 minutes. The other group did 20 to 30 minutes of steady, moderate-intensity exercise.
        After 12 weeks, the people in the first group improved their fitness twice as much as those in the second group, on average. While the findings support to benefits of HIIT, it's important to note that the study participants were generally healthy with good physical function. Anyone who's had a stroke should check with their doctor before starting any exercise regimen. The study was published Aug. 7, 2024, in the journal Stroke.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cant-shake-that-cough,Can't shake that cough?,"Dry. Hacking. Loose. Deep. Phlegmy. Barking. Chesty. A cough can sound like any of these descriptors — often more than one at the same time — and these characteristics can sometimes point toward its cause.
        Now add another: lingering. What does that tell us? Not as much as we might hope, a Harvard expert says.
        A natural reflex that helps keep our airways clear, the average cough — typically due to a cold or another respiratory virus — lasts three weeks or less, says Dr. Jessica McCannon, a pulmonary critical care specialist with Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham. When a cough endures for eight weeks or more, it's considered chronic. Only rarely is this dangerous, but it certainly can be mystifying.
        ""When people come to a lung doctor for a chronic cough, they usually hope that at the end of the first visit they'll leave with an answer and some medication and will quickly feel better,"" Dr. McCannon says. ""But of all the things we care for, it's one of the most difficult. And if we don't talk about that up front, I think people will have ongoing frustration and disappointment.""
        Many possible culprits
        Indeed, be prepared for a detective hunt. Many chronic coughs have more than one contributor, so doctors don't just look to the airway or lungs to unearth the cause.
        ""Often we're thinking top to bottom — about the sinuses, swallow function, and esophagus and stomach in addition to the airways and lungs themselves,"" Dr. McCannon says.
        More than a dozen conditions or situations can explain a lingering cough, including
        
          sinus problems, such as sinusitis
          bronchitis
          seasonal allergies
          gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
          side effects from medications, such as ACE inhibitors to treat high blood pressure.
        
        But only a handful of chronic cough triggers are serious, such as
        
          asthma
          chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
          interstitial lung disease, a progressive condition involving coughing and breathlessness
          chronic lung infections
          bronchiectasis, chronic inflammation of the tubes leading to the lungs
          lung cancer.
        
        Occasionally, chronic coughs arise from ""very weird causes"" such as impacted earwax, Dr. McCannon points out. And sometimes the culprit is all too clear: smoking — whether tobacco, marijuana, or vaping. ""Basically, anything going into the lungs that shouldn't be there will potentially cause a cough.""
        Seeking a diagnosis
        It's reasonable to try over-the-counter medications to quell your cough. The choice depends on the apparent cause of the cough, so you might take cough suppressants, antihistamines if you think it may be allergies, or antacids for acid reflux as a possibility. But if they don't make a dent, Dr. McCannon says, it's time to see a health care professional. ""Tell your doctor what's worked and what hasn't. That can give us some clues,"" she says.
        Certain red flags make a doctor's visit more pressing. Schedule an appointment (or a follow-up) if your lingering cough doesn't resolve after treatment with antibiotics or if you also experience breathlessness; wheezing; chest pain, pressure, or tightness; blood in your sputum; weight loss; or fatigue.
        ""A lingering cough with any of those things should lead you to seek care soon,"" Dr. McCannon says.
        Getting to the bottom of things will likely involve a physical exam, x-rays, or lung function testing. Your doctor may order CT imaging as well, ""although that's certainly not necessary at the threshold of three months unless there are other warning signs,"" she says.
        To make your doctor's visit more fruitful, Dr. McCannon suggests one important strategy: track your cough.
        ""Note its patterns. What circumstances bring it on? Is it productive or dry? Is it worse after meals, or when you're lying down? Does it intrude on sleep?"" she asks. ""Paying attention to the circumstances in which you notice it can provide us with some really helpful clues.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/want-a-calmer-brain-try-this-202410293078,Want a calmer brain? Try this,"For neuroscientist Sara Lazar, a form of meditation called open awareness is as fundamental to her day as breathing.
        ""I just become aware that I am aware, with no particular thing that I focus on,"" explains Lazar, an associate researcher in the psychiatry department at Massachusetts General Hospital and assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School. ""This sort of practice helps me become more aware of the subtle thoughts and emotions that briefly flit by, that we usually ignore but are quite useful to tune into.""
        But meditation doesn't just change your perspective in the moment. Some studies show certain types of meditation offer an array of benefits, from easing chronic pain and stress and lowering high blood pressure to help relieve anxiety and depression. And, as Lazar's research has shown, meditation can actually change the structure and connectivity of brain areas that help us cope with fear and anxiety.
        ""It's become really clear that all of our experiences shape our brain in one way or another,"" Lazar says. ""A lot of people talk about meditation being a mental exercise. Just as you build your physical muscles, you can build your calm muscles. Meditation is a very effective way of training those muscles.""
        What counts as meditation?
        More than you might have believed. An intriguing if somewhat perplexing aspect of meditation is that it encompasses a broad range of practices. ""It's clear what is not meditation, but there's less consensus on what it is,"" Lazar says.
        Open awareness, Lazar's go-to meditation, joins other forms, including focused awareness, slow deep breathing, guided meditation, and mantra meditation, along with many variations. At their core, Lazar says, is an awareness of the moment, noticing what you're experiencing and nonjudgmentally disengaging from intrusive thoughts that might interfere with your ability to attend to this task.
        Meditation can also involve sitting with eyes closed and paying attention to your body and any sensations that are present. A regular meditation practice typically involves slowing down, breathing, and observing inner experience.
        ""Meditation can involve flickering candles, breath awareness, or mantras — all of these things,"" Lazar says. ""But there's definitely an element of focusing and regulating your attention.""
        A close look at how meditation alters the brain
        Small MRI imaging studies have zeroed in meditation's effects on the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure deep within the brain that processes fear and anxiety as well as other emotions.
        Lazar and her colleagues have spent many years laying the groundwork to show how practicing mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) alters the amygdala after only about two months. The MBSR practice in this research consisted of weekly group meetings and daily home mindfulness practices, including sitting meditation and yoga.
        What has their research found?
        One key study involved 26 people with high levels of perceived stress. After an eight-week regimen of MBSR, brain scans showed the density of their amygdalae decreased, and these brain changes correlated to lower reported stress levels.
        Building on this, Lazar and colleagues designed a study that focused on 26 people diagnosed with generalized anxiety, a disorder marked by excessive, ongoing, and often illogical anxiety levels. The researchers randomized participants to either practice MBSR or receive stress management education. These participants were compared to 26 healthy participants.
        In this first-of-its-kind research, participants were shown a series of images with angry or neutral facial expressions while their brain activity was gauged using functional MRI imaging. At the beginning of the study, anxiety patients showed higher levels of amygdala activation in response to neutral faces than healthy participants. This suggests a stronger fear response to a nonthreatening situation.
        But after eight weeks of MBSR, MRI imaging showed increased connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, a brain area crucial to emotional regulation. The amygdalae in participants with generalized anxiety no longer displayed a fear response to neutral faces. These participants also reported their symptoms had improved.
        ""It seems meditation helps to down-regulate the amygdala in response to things it perceives to be threatening,"" Lazar says.
        How can meditation benefits help us in daily life?
        Lazar believes training your brain to stop and notice your thoughts in a slightly detached way can calm you amidst the muddle of work deadlines, family friction, or distressing news.
        ""That's one of the biggest translations"" of meditation to everyday benefits, she says. ""The person or situation that is stressing you out won't go away, but you can watch your reactivity to the situation in a mindful, detached way, which shifts your relationship to it.""
        ""It's not indifference,"" she adds. ""It's sort of like a bubble bursting — you realize you don't need to keep going on this loop. Once you see that, it totally shifts your relationship to that reaction bubbling through your brain.""
        Want to try meditation — or expand your practice?
        Haven't tried meditating? To get started, Lazar recommends the Three-Minute Breathing Space Meditation. This offers a quick taste of meditation, walking you through three pared-down but distinct steps. ""It's simple, fast, and anyone can do it,"" she says.
        Simple ways to expand this basic approach are:
        
          adding minutes, just as you might for exercise
          meditating outdoors
          pausing to notice how you feel after you meditate.
        
        ""Or try either doing a longer session or short hits throughout the day, such as a three-minute breathing break four to five times a day,"" Lazar suggests.
        Another way to enhance your practice is to use ordinary, repetitive moments throughout the day — such as reaching for a doorknob — as a cue to pause for five seconds and notice the sensation of your hand on the knob.
        ""As you walk from your office to your car, for instance, instead of thinking of all the things you have to do, you can be mindful while you're walking,"" Lazar says. ""Feel the sunshine and the pavement under your feet. There are simple ways to work meditation into each day.""",Maureen Salamon,"October 29, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/reducing-your-stroke-risk-after-a-transient-ischemic-attack-tia,Reducing your stroke risk after a transient ischemic attack (TIA),"The symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) can pass quickly, but that doesn't mean you should put the episode in the rearview mirror. A TIA is a warning. Treat it as an opportunity to reduce your risk of going on to develop a full-blown stroke.
        What is a TIA?
        A transient ischemic attack is a temporary lack of blood flow (and therefore oxygen) in a part of the brain. TIAs, which are sometimes called ministrokes, are very common — they happen to at least 240,000 Americans every year.
        When you have a TIA, one or more of the arteries that supply blood to your brain becomes blocked, by either plaque or by a blood clot. This usually improves within minutes, avoiding permanent brain damage.
        Transient ischemic attack symptoms are the same as those of a stroke, but last only for a few minutes or hours. The American Stroke Association uses the acronym FAST to help people spot signs of a TIA or stroke. They include:
        
          F – Face drooping: You may see one side of the face droop, or it may look numb. If the person smiles, it may appear uneven.
          A – Arm weakness: One arm may be weak or numb. If you raise both arms, one may drift downward.
          S – Speech difficulty: Speech may be slurred.
          T – Time to call 911: If you notice any of the above symptoms, call 911 immediately.
        
        A TIA should never be ignored. It's a warning that you're at high risk for a full-blown stroke.
        TIA or full-blown stroke?
        A TIA is a stroke in which the blockage is temporary, and symptoms typically improve within an hour. Since there's no way to tell in the moment if your symptoms are due to a TIA or a full-blown stroke, always treat it as an emergency. Call 911 to get help right away.
        Stroke risk after a TIA
        It's important to take a TIA very seriously. Even though the symptoms are temporary, you are at a much higher risk for developing a full-blown stroke. About one-third of those who have a TIA will eventually go on to have a full-blown stroke. The risk is highest during the first 48 hours: up to 10% of people with a TIA go on to have an actual stroke within a couple of days. Your risk of stroke may also be higher if you have any of these risk factors:
        
          type 2 diabetes
          age 60 years or older
          
            high blood pressure
          
          weakness on one side of your body during your TIA
          speech problems during your TIA
          TIA symptoms that lasted for an hour or longer
          existing heart disease (severely clogged or narrowed arteries).
        
        Medications to reduce stroke risk after a TIA
        You usually do not need to be hospitalized for a TIA. You will, however, be prescribed certain medications to reduce your risk of having a full-blown stroke.
        Antiplatelet medications. Your doctor may want you to take a medication that prevents platelets (cell fragments that help blood clot) from clumping together and clogging up arteries, raising the risk of full-blown stroke. Antiplatelet drugs include aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), and ticagrelor (Brilinta).
        Sometimes, two antiplatelet medications are used together for a short time. This is called dual platelet therapy. After a few weeks, you continue on only one antiplatelet medication. A 2023 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that this approach led to a lower risk of stroke within 90 days of a mild stroke or high-risk TIA than aspirin alone.
        Anticoagulants. If you also have atrial fibrillation — a type of irregular heart rhythm — then your doctor may recommend that you take an anticoagulant. Sometimes referred to as blood thinners, these prescription medications help to prevent blood clots from forming. Today, doctors most often prescribe one of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), edoxaban (Savaysa), or rivaroxaban (Xarelto).
        Your doctor may also prescribe medication to treat other underlying conditions that raise your risk of stroke, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol.
        Lifestyle changes to help prevent a stroke after a TIA
        About 80% of strokes are preventable, according to the CDC. The following lifestyle changes can help reduce your risk of having a full-blown stroke after a TIA.
        Diet
        A healthy, plant-based diet rich in foods like leafy greens, whole grains, and beans appears to lower overall stroke risk by about 10%, according to a Harvard study published in the journal Neurology. The CDC recommends that you also limit the amount of sodium, or salt, in your diet to lower your blood pressure. You should also avoid or limit saturated fat, which raises cholesterol levels and is found in foods like full-fat dairy, fried foods, and red meat.
        Exercise
        The CDC recommends all adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity such as walking each week. If that seems daunting, keep in mind that small bursts of exercise like walking the dog contribute to this overall goal. Try to stay on your feet as much as you can, too. A study published in JAMA found that people who sat for more than 13 hours a day had a 44% increased risk of stroke.
        Monitoring and managing blood pressure
        High blood pressure is the number one controllable risk factor for stroke, according to the American Heart Association. Over time it damages arteries, which can lead to blockages and blood clots. If you've had a TIA, it's important to make sure your blood pressure is under control. Ways you can do this include:
        
          eating a low salt diet like the DASH diet (try to limit yourself to no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium a day)
          maintaining a healthy weight
          exercising regularly
          limiting alcohol
          not smoking (and quitting, if you do).
        
        If your blood pressure is already elevated (higher than 130/80 mm Hg), your doctor may prescribe blood pressure lowering medication.
        Recognizing the warning signs of stroke: When to seek immediate help
        When it comes to stroke, every second counts. If you or a loved one experience any of these symptoms, call 911 immediately:
        
          sudden numbness or weakness on one side of your body
          confusion
          trouble speaking
          trouble seeing

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ever-hear-of-tonsil-stones-202410213077,Ever hear of tonsil stones?,"Recently, a friend asked me about tonsil stones. He has sore throats several times a year, which are instantly relieved by gargling to remove them. When I told him I thought tonsil stones were pretty rare, he asked: ""Are you sure about that? My ear, nose, and throat doctor says they're common as rocks."" (Get it? stones? rocks?)
        It turns out, my friend and his doctor are on to something. Tonsil stones are surprisingly common and often quite annoying. Here's what to know and do.
        What are tonsil stones?
        Tonsil stones (medical term: tonsilloliths) are small white or yellow deposits on the tonsils. They develop when bacteria, saliva, food particles, and debris from cells lining the mouth get trapped in tiny indentations called crypts.
        They vary considerably between people, including:
        
          Size. They may be so small that you can't see them with the naked eye. Or they may grow to the size of gravel or, rarely, much larger.
          Consistency. They're often soft but may calcify, becoming hard as a rock. Hence, the name.
          How long they last. Tonsil stones can last days to weeks, or may persist far longer before they break up and fall out.
          How often they occur. New tonsilloliths may appear several times each month or just once or twice a year.
        
        While they're more likely to form if you have poor oral hygiene, good oral hygiene doesn't provide complete protection. Even those who brush, floss, and see their dentists regularly can develop tonsil stones.
        How common are tonsil stones?
        You've heard of kidney stones and gallstones, right? Clearly, those conditions are better known than tonsil stones. Yet tonsil stones are far more common: studies suggest that up to 40% of the population have them. Fortunately, unlike kidney stones and gallstones, tonsil stones are usually harmless.
        What are the symptoms of tonsil stones?
        Often people have no symptoms. In fact, if tonsil stones are small enough, you may not even know you have them. When tonsil stones do cause symptoms, the most common ones are:
        
          sore throat, or an irritation that feels as though something is stuck in the throat
          bad breath
          cough
          discomfort with swallowing
          throat infections.
        
        Who gets tonsil stones?
        Anyone who has tonsils can get them. However, some people are more likely than others to form tonsil stones, including those who
        
          have tonsils with lots of indentations and irregular surfaces rather than a smooth surface
          smoke
          drink lots of sugary beverages
          have poor oral hygiene
          have a family history of tonsil stones.
        
        How are tonsil stones treated?
        That depends on whether you have symptoms and how severe the symptoms are.
        
          If you have no symptoms, tonsil stones may require no treatment.
          If you do have symptoms, gargling with salt water or removing tonsil stones with a cotton swab or a water flosser usually helps. Avoid trying to remove them with sharp, firm objects like a toothpick or a pen, as that can damage your throat or tonsils.
          If your tonsils are inflamed, swollen, or infected, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medications.
        
        Is surgery ever necessary?
        Occasionally, surgery may be warranted. It's generally reserved for people with severe symptoms or frequent infections who don't improve with the measures mentioned above.
        Surgical options are:
        
          tonsillectomy, which is removing the tonsils
          cryptolysis, which uses laser, electrical current, or radio waves to smooth the deep indentations in tonsils that allow stones to form.
        
        Can tonsil stones be prevented?
        Yes, there are ways to reduce the risk that tonsil stones will recur. Experts recommend the following:
        
          Brush your teeth and tongue regularly (at least twice a day: in the morning and before sleep).
          Floss regularly.
          Gargle with salt water after eating.
          Eliminate foods and drinks that contain a lot of sugar, which feeds bacteria that can help stones form.
          Don't smoke, because smoking irritates and inflames tonsils, which can encourage stone formation. The same may apply to vaping, though there is limited research to rely upon.
        
        The bottom line
        Considering how common tonsil stones are and how bothersome they can be, it seems strange that they aren't more well known. Maybe that's because they often get better on their own, or people figure out how to deal with them without needing medical attention.
        I hope you aren't one of the many millions of people bothered by tonsil stones. But if you are, it's good to know that they're generally harmless and can be readily treated and prevented.
        Now that you know more about them, feel free to spread the word: tonsil stones should be a secret no more.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","October 21, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/midlife-adhd-coping-strategies-that-can-help-202102052381,Midlife ADHD? Coping strategies that can help,"Trouble staying focused and paying attention are two familiar symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a common health issue among children and teens.
        When ADHD persists through early adulthood and on into middle age, it presents many of the same challenges it does in childhood: it's hard to stay organized, start projects, stay on task, and meet deadlines. But now life is busier, and often expectations from work and family are even higher. Fortunately, there are lots of strategies that can help you navigate this time in your life.
        Staying organized
        Organizational tools are a must for people with adult ADHD. They'll help you prioritize and track activities for each day or the coming weeks.
        
          Pick the right tools. Tools can include a pen and paper to make lists, or computer or smartphone apps to set appointment reminders, highlight important days on the calendar, mark deadlines, and keep lists and other information handy.
          Schedule updates. Set aside time each day to update your lists and schedules. Don't let the task become a chore in itself; think of it like a routine task such as brushing your teeth, and do it daily so it becomes an established habit.
          Set a timer. And a word of caution: smartphones and computers can also turn into a distraction. If you have adult ADHD, you may find yourself spending hours looking at less useful apps or sites. If that's a frequent trap for you, set a timer for each use or keep the phone off or in another room when you are trying to work.
        
        Staying focused
        Just being organized doesn't mean your work will get done. But a few simple approaches can at least make it easier to do the work.
        
          Declutter your home and office. Give yourself an appealing work environment and keep important items easily accessible.
          Reduce distractions. This could mean changing your workstation so it doesn't face a window, moving to a quieter space, or just silencing your smartphone and email alerts.
          Jot down ideas as they come to you. You may have an ""aha"" moment for one task while you're in the middle of another. That's okay; just write down that thought and get back to it later, after your more pressing work is finished.
        
        Meeting deadlines
        Deadlines pose two big challenges when you have adult ADHD. First, it's hard to start a project, often because you want it to be perfect, or you're intimidated by it so you put it off. Second, when you do start a project, it's very easy to become distracted and leave the task unfinished.
        How can you avoid these traps?
        
          Put off procrastinating. Put procrastination on your to-do list — like a chore — and fool yourself into actually starting your work.
          Deal with emails, phone calls, or other matters as soon as you can. That way there will be fewer things hanging over your head and overwhelming you later on.
          Be a clock watcher. Get a watch and get in the habit of using it. The more aware you are of time, the more likely you'll be able to avoid spending too long on a task.
          Take one thing at a time. Multitasking is overrated for everyone — and it's a nightmare for people with adult ADHD. Focus on completing one task, then move on to the next.
          Be realistic about your time. This can mean having to say no to new projects or other commitments.
        
        Get more help
        The ideas listed here can help you start coping with adult ADHD, but they may not be enough to help you overcome adult ADHD's challenges.
        Consider hiring an ADHD coach who can provide more strategies and give you additional tools to cope with your condition. Look for an ADHD coach who is a licensed mental health professional who specializes in treating ADHD, and may also have a certification in ADHD coaching from the ADHD Coaches Organization.",Heidi Godman,"October 18, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/narcolepsy-a-to-z,Narcolepsy,"What is narcolepsy?
        Narcolepsy is a disorder that causes sudden episodes of deep sleep. These episodes can occur often and at inappropriate times, for example while a person is talking, eating, or driving. Although sleep episodes can happen at any time, they may be more frequent during periods of inactivity or monotonous, repetitive activity.
        Narcolepsy usually appears between ages 15 and 30, but the condition can appear earlier or later. Once it appears, narcolepsy is present for life. Men and women are affected equally.
        About 50% of people with diagnosed narcolepsy have the combination of marked daytime sleepiness and sudden episodes of muscle weakness (called cataplexy). The muscle weakness can be so severe that a person with narcolepsy will collapse to the floor, but not become unconscious. This type of narcolepsy is associated with a shortage of a brain-stimulating protein called orexin (also known as hypocretin).
        The cause of other types of narcolepsy is unknown. A genetic (inherited) predisposition appears to play a role.
        People with narcolepsy don't require extra hours of sleep, but they do need daytime naps because they have difficulty staying awake for long periods. During the night, healthy people normally progress through several stages of sleep before entering or leaving the state of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM). During REM sleep, your brain waves resemble those of an awake person, visual dreams occur, and muscle tone is slack. In narcolepsy, the brain-wave pattern can skip some or all of the other sleep stages, causing the person to move from the awake state immediately to REM sleep, or to awaken directly from the REM sleep stage.
        Symptoms of narcolepsy
        The earliest symptom of narcolepsy is usually daytime sleepiness, which may be extreme. However, it may take years to recognize the disorder because other, more common causes of daytime sleepiness often are blamed for the symptoms.
        Narcolepsy has four main symptoms. It is common for people with narcolepsy to have more than one symptom, but it is rare for a person with the disease to experience all four:
        
          Excessive daytime sleepiness — This is always present and is usually the most prominent symptom.
          Cataplexy — This is the sudden, temporary loss of muscle tone, which causes paralysis of the head or body while the person remains conscious. It can last a few seconds or several minutes. Mild attacks can cause slurred or stuttering speech, drooping eyelids or hand weakness that causes the person to drop objects. Severe attacks can cause the knees to buckle, leading to collapse. Typically, cataplexy is brought on by laughter, excitement or anger. The sudden relaxing of muscle tone is probably the result of the brain abruptly entering REM sleep.
          Sleep paralysis — This is the temporary inability to move while falling asleep or awakening. It lasts no more than several minutes. Like cataplexy, sleep paralysis probably is related to insufficient separation between REM sleep and the awake state.
          Hypnagogic hallucinations — These are dreamlike images that are seen during the awake state instead of during sleep. These often-frightening visions are seen just as the person is falling asleep or waking up. They tend to occur in people who also have sleep paralysis.
        
        Symptoms usually begin during adolescence or young adulthood. People with narcolepsy complain of fatigue, experience impaired performance at work and school, and may have difficulty in social relationships. Excessive daytime sleepiness can be disabling and may greatly diminish a person's quality of life. Memory lapses and visual disturbances may be particularly upsetting.
        More than 50% of people with narcolepsy experience periods of memory lapse or blackouts caused by very short periods of sleep called microsleeps. Microsleeps are not unique to people with narcolepsy, and they can be experienced by anyone who is severely sleep deprived. They are periods of sleep that last only a few seconds, and usually are not noticed. During such episodes, a person may get lost while walking or driving, write or speak nonsense, misplace objects, or bump into things. Later in the course of narcolepsy, a person also can develop insomnia (difficulty sleeping) during normal sleeping hours.
        Diagnosing narcolepsy
        To diagnose narcolepsy, your doctor will ask you about your history of typical episodes and will have you undergo an overnight sleep study. The sleep study checks for other explanations that could account for daytime sleepiness, such as sleep apnea or other causes of sleep interruptions. The sleep test measures brain waves, eye movements, muscle activity, heartbeat, blood oxygen levels, and breathing.
        A specific study called a multiple sleep latency test is a necessary part of the evaluation for narcolepsy. This test must be done after the person has had an adequate night's sleep. A multiple sleep latency test consists of four 20-minute opportunities to nap, which are offered every two hours throughout the day. Patients with narcolepsy fall asleep in approximately five minutes or less, and move into REM sleep during at least two of the four naps. Normal, well-rested sleepers take about 12 to 14 minutes to fall asleep for a daytime nap, and don't fall directly into REM sleep.
        Expected duration of narcolepsy
        Narcolepsy cannot be cured and does not go away. In most cases, symptoms can be diminished with medications, regularly scheduled naps, and good sleep habits.
        Preventing narcolepsy
        There is no way to prevent narcolepsy. For people who have the condition, avoiding conditions that bring on narcolepsy episodes may help to reduce their frequency. If you have narcolepsy and your symptoms are not controlled with medicines, you should never smoke because you could fall asleep with a lit cigarette, and you should never drive.
        Treating narcolepsy
        The main symptom of narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness, can be partially relieved with medications that stimulate the central nervous system. Doctors often prescribe a trial of modafinil (Provigil) first. Other potential choices include armodafinil (Nuvigil), pitolisant (Wakix), or solriamfetol (Sunosi).
        regularly scheduled time for exercise and short naps during the day also helps reduce daytime sleepiness.
        Cataplexy and sleep paralysis can be treated with a variety of medicines that can make you more resistant to entering REM sleep. Most of these medicines were developed for use as antidepressants. Examples of potentially effective medications include venlafaxine (Effexor), fluoxetine (Prozac), and protriptyline (Vivactil).
        Cataplexy also can be treated with sodium oxybate (also called gamma hydroxybutyrate or Xyrem), although the use of this drug is tightly controlled because it has been abused recreationally. For reasons that are not well understood, a low dose of this medicine reduces cataplexy attacks and improves daytime sleepiness in people who have narcolepsy with cataplexy, even though the drug causes sedation in most people without narcolepsy.
        Psychological counseling may be important for difficulties associated with self-esteem and for emotional support, especially since people with narcolepsy have difficulty doing tasks that require concentration, and may be regarded as unmotivated by family and peers.
        When to call a professional
        Call a doctor if you are excessively sleepy during the day. You should be evaluated as quickly as possible if episodes occur while you are driving a car or operating machinery.
        Prognosis
        People with narcolepsy have a significantly higher risk of death or serious injury resulting from motor vehicle or job-related accidents, and they must take care to avoid situations where such accidents might occur.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/giardiasis-a-to-z,Giardiasis,"What is giardiasis?
        Giardiasis is an intestinal illness caused by infection with the parasite Giardia lamblia, which lives in contaminated water. Although the illness most often occurs in developing countries, giardiasis is also a common cause of waterborne illness in the United States. A person can remain infected with Giardia until the infection is diagnosed and treated.
        In developing areas of the world, it is common for more than 20% of a country's population to have ongoing Giardia infection. In the United States, only one or two out of every 10,000 people have Giardia in a typical year, but the infection is found in about one out of three people who have prolonged diarrhea symptoms if they have recently traveled to a developing country.
        As one part of their life cycle, G. lamblia parasites change into cysts. Contagious cysts are found in the feces of infected people or animals. You can become infected with G. lamblia by:
        
          drinking water that has been contaminated with Giardia cysts (usually because the water has come into contact with sewage)
          eating uncooked fruits or vegetables that have been washed in contaminated water
          eating uncooked fruits or vegetables from a garden where contaminated fertilizer has been used
          touching feces, diapers, or objects soiled with feces, then failing to adequately wash your hands
          having direct contact with an infected person or animal, then failing to adequately wash your hands.
        
        G. lamblia can survive in cold, chlorinated water for up to two months, and outbreaks have occurred in municipal water supplies.
        People at greatest risk of giardiasis include:
        
          children in day care centers and their families
          day care workers
          travelers to developing countries
          campers who drink unprocessed water
          homosexual men (because of anal sex).
        
        Children are three times more likely to develop giardiasis than adults. It is possible that the human body develops some immunity to the parasite over time.
        Symptoms of giardiasis
        Up to two-thirds of people infected with the organism do not have any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can appear suddenly and be obvious or they may worsen slowly. Typically, symptoms start one to three weeks after exposure and include:
        
          watery diarrhea
          abdominal cramping
          bloating
          nausea with or without vomiting
          gas
          floating or unusually smelly stools
          weight loss
          new intolerance to milk and dairy foods in your diet
          low-grade fever
          loss of appetite.
        
        Some of the symptoms can take several months or more to begin because they are caused by gradual changes in the lining of your intestine. G. lamblia interferes with the body's ability to absorb fats, so your stools may have more fat in them during a Giardia infection. This is why your stools may float and smell foul.
        Diagnosing giardiasis
        Your doctor will ask you about your travel history, whether you might have had contact with contaminated water during camping or hiking, and whether your home has well water. If the patient is a child who attends day care, the doctor will ask about any recent outbreaks of diarrhea at the day care center. He or she also will review the patient's symptoms.
        The diagnosis is made by testing the stool for Giardia antigen, a protein that is made by G. lamblia parasites, or by identifying G. lamblia cysts or parasites in stool samples. Multiple stool samples may need to be collected since the infection can only be detected in a portion of collected stool samples, even if infection is present.
        Infrequently, diagnosis may require an inspection of the intestine with a procedure called endoscopy. In this procedure, an instrument called an endoscope is inserted through your mouth into your intestine. An endoscope is a narrow, flexible, cord-shaped instrument that is equipped with a camera. If necessary, your doctor can use the endoscope to take a small piece of tissue from your small intestine (a biopsy) to be examined in a laboratory.
        Expected duration of giardiasis
        The worst symptoms of giardiasis typically last for five to seven days, as long as diagnosis and treatment is not delayed. Symptoms can take as long as several months to completely go away after treatment because the intestine needs to repair itself. It is common to be intolerant to milk and other dairy products that contain lactose for the first few months after a Giardia infection. In some people who are not treated, the infection can cause repeated bouts of abdominal pain and diarrhea for a year or longer.
        Preventing giardiasis
        There is no vaccine that can prevent giardiasis. Medicine to prevent infection is not recommended. The best way to prevent infection is good travel habits and good sanitation.
        Travelers should take special care to avoid food and water that could be contaminated. It is safest to eat produce that has been peeled or cooked. Cooking kills Giardia parasites and cysts.
        To prevent giardiasis caused by contaminated water, drink water only from approved sources. When camping and when traveling to developing countries, drink bottled water or other beverages that have been bottled or canned. Campers can drink bottled water, treat water with iodine for eight or more hours, use a high-quality water filter or boil water for at least one minute. Travelers to developing countries should avoid drinking beverages that are served with ice.
        It is always a good habit to wash your hands frequently. This can reduce your risk of Giardia infection at home and while traveling. It is especially important to wash your hands after you use the bathroom, before you eat, after you change a diaper and after you care for a sick person or animal.
        Treating giardiasis
        If you don't receive treatment for a Giardia infection, you will probably eventually recover on your own. However, treatment is a good idea for anyone who is having symptoms. Treatment can also help if you don't have symptoms because treatment can prevent the spread of infection to others. This is especially true for children and for people who prepare or serve food.
        Commonly prescribed medications used to treat Giardia infection include tinidazole (Tindamax), nitazoxanide (Alinia), and metronidazole (Flagyl).
        A doctor should examine and consider treatment for sexual partners and people who have had close contact with the infected person, such as household members, even if they have no symptoms. Pregnant women generally are not treated with medications during the first trimester.
        If you have giardiasis, be sure to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Over-the-counter medications for diarrhea, such as loperamide (Imodium), may help your symptoms. Wash your hands frequently if you have giardiasis or if you are caring for a person or animal with this infection.
        When to call a professional
        See your doctor if you get diarrhea, especially if this diarrhea lasts for longer than several days, produces stools that float and smell foul, or if you also have abdominal cramps, bloating and fever.
        Prognosis
        In otherwise healthy people, giardiasis generally goes away completely within weeks, with or without treatment. In some cases, Giardia can be a long-term problem if it is not treated.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs-a-to-z,Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),"What is IBS?
        Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that causes a variety of symptoms, including:
        
          abdominal pain
          diarrhea and/or constipation
          bloating
          gassiness
          cramping.
        
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        The severity of the disorder varies from person to person. Some people experience symptoms that come and go and are just mildly annoying. Others have such severe daily bowel problems that IBS affects their ability to work, sleep, and enjoy life.
        In addition, symptoms may change over time. A person may have severe symptoms for several weeks and then feel well for months or even years.
        Most people are never cured of IBS. However, the disorder is not related to any other disease. It does not develop into colitis. People with IBS do not have an increased risk of colon cancer.
        IBS usually starts in early adulthood. It affects twice as many women as men. Approximately 10% to 20% of the population has IBS, but half of all people with the condition never seek medical care for their symptoms.
        No one knows what causes IBS. Some studies suggest that the nerves of the colon may be much more sensitive than usual in people with IBS. The normal movement of food and gas through the colon causes pain, intestinal spasms, and an irregular pattern of bowel movements.
        Stress does not cause IBS, but stress can increase the frequency and severity of symptoms.
        IBS has been called irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis, and functional bowel disease.
        Symptoms of IBS
        People with IBS may have some or all of these symptoms:
        
          mild or severe abdominal pain, discomfort, or cramping that usually goes away after a bowel movement
          periods of diarrhea or constipation, or alternating between these two symptoms
          bloating, gassiness, or a feeling of having a distended abdomen
          mucus in bowel movements
          feeling as though a bowel movement is incomplete.
        
        Although the symptoms of IBS often change over time, people tend to develop their own pattern. For example, some people have mostly diarrhea, some have mostly constipation, and others have abdominal pain without a major change in bowel movements.
        Diagnosing IBS
        There is no test for IBS. Your doctor will diagnose IBS if you have the typical symptoms and have been tested for other disorders that can cause similar symptoms.
        Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms. Your doctor will examine you, testing your abdomen for tenderness and feeling to determine whether internal organs are larger than normal. The doctor will check for fever or weight loss. If you have any of these signs, you likely have something other than IBS.
        Depending on your medical history, your doctor may do tests to eliminate other diseases that may cause similar symptoms. These tests might include:
        
          blood tests
          stool sample, to check for blood or evidence of infection
          sigmoidoscopy, in which a flexible, lighted tube with a tiny camera on the end is inserted into the rectum and up the left side of the colon
          colonoscopy, in which a longer tube examines the entire colon.
        
        Your doctor may suggest that you stop eating or drinking certain foods for up to three weeks to determine if your diet is contributing to your symptoms. For example, your doctor may ask you to eliminate milk products if he or she suspects lactose intolerance.
        Expected duration of IBS
        IBS symptoms may be a daily problem throughout a person's life. Symptoms may come and go, lasting a day, a week, or a month before disappearing. Dietary changes with or without medication may help to reduce the frequency or severity of symptoms.
        Preventing IBS
        Because no one knows what causes IBS, it is impossible to prevent the disorder. Once diagnosed with IBS, a person may be able to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms by reducing stress or changing the diet.
        Treating IBS
        Changing your diet may improve symptoms dramatically. It often takes a long time to discover what works well for you, and you may need to alter your original program if symptoms flare.
        Keep track of the different foods you eat throughout the day. See which foods seem to make your symptoms worse. After you discover your particular trigger foods, eliminate them from your diet. Some common IBS trigger foods include:
        
          cabbage, broccoli, kale, legumes, and other gas-producing foods
          caffeine
          alcohol
          dairy products
          fatty foods, including whole milk, cream, cheese, butter, oils, meats, and avocados
          raw fruits
          foods, gums, and beverages that contain sorbitol, an artificial sweetener.
        
        The way you eat may help to create IBS symptoms. Eating large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea, so eating smaller meals more often may help some people with IBS. Eating quickly can cause you to swallow air, which can cause belching or gas.
        Adding fiber to your diet, especially if constipation is one of your main symptoms, often helps to regulate your bowel movements and reduce abdominal discomfort. At first, fiber will increase the amount of gas in your system, so add fiber gradually. Over time, the body adjusts to the effects of fiber and the gassiness will decrease. Fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain breads and cereals are good food sources of fiber.
        Your doctor may recommend a fiber supplement. Some experts believe that the fiber methylcellulose creates the least amount of gas, and brands of this fiber are often recommended for people with IBS. Psyllium is also a good source of fiber.
        A low-FODMAP diet helps relieve symptoms for many people with IBS. You need to review a list of foods that have a high amount of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, and reduce their intake.
        If your symptoms are not relieved after you eliminate trigger foods and add fiber, your doctor may prescribe medications.
        For people that have frequent loose stools (diarrhea-predominant IBS), medication options include:
        
          antidiarrheals — loperamide (Imodium), diphenoxylate (Lomotil and other brand names)
          antispasmodics to reduce cramping — dicyclomine (Bentyl)
          pain-reducing agents — amitriptyline (Elavil), desipramine (Norpramin)
          alosetron (Lotronex) is approved only for women with severe diarrhea-predominant IBS who have very severe diarrhea and have not responded to other treatments. To receive this drug, you must sign a form stating that you are aware of life-threatening complications, such as a blocked, ruptured, or damaged bowel.
        
        For people with constipation-predominant IBS, fiber and plenty of fluids are the mainstays of therapy. If medication is needed, your doctor may prescribe an osmotic laxative such as lactulose.
        Other drugs available for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome include:
        
          lubiprostone (Amitiza), which is approved for women with persistent constipation
          linaclotide (LINZESS) and plecanatide (Trulance), which are approved for adults age 18 and older.
        
        Both drugs act on the cells that line the inside of the intestines. They promote increased fluid secretion into the intestine, making stool passage easier.
        Stress reduction through mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other practices, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can be extremely helpful.
        When to call a professional
        It is useful for anyone with irritable bowel symptoms to discuss their symptoms with a doctor, so that diet, fiber, stress reduction, and drug treatment strategies can be planned.
        After you have been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, contact your doctor if you have:
        
          an episode of severe symptoms
          unexplained weight loss or fever
          blood in your stool
          abdominal pain that is accompanied by vomiting, dizziness, or fainting
          abdominal pain or diarrhea that awakens you from sleep.
        
        Prognosis
        There is no cure for IBS. But most people can lessen the symptoms by making dietary changes, reducing stress, and — if necessary — taking medication.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/diverticulosis-and-diverticulitis-a-to-z,Diverticulosis and diverticulitis,"What are diverticulosis and diverticulitis?
        In diverticulosis, small pouches develop and bulge out through weak spots in the walls of the colon, typically in the part of the colon called the sigmoid colon on the left side of the abdomen. These small, balloon-like pouches are called diverticula.
        The condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States ages 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        If the diverticula become inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis.
        Diverticulitis can lead to serious complications such as abscess, perforation, intestinal blockage from internal scarring, or fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two organs. A rare but life-threatening complication called peritonitis can occur when diverticula rupture, leaking infection into the abdominal cavity.
        Symptoms of diverticulosis and diverticulitis
        Most people who have diverticulosis don't have any symptoms, but some have mild cramps, constipation, or bloating. Diverticulitis causes more severe symptoms, including any of the following, but particularly the first two:
        
          steady abdominal pain
          tenderness to pressure in the lower abdomen, especially on the left side
          fever
          nausea
          vomiting
          chills
          cramping
          change in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea)
          sharper pain with breathing or jarring movements such as walking.
        
        Lower intestinal bleeding can occur in people with diverticulosis. The loss of blood can cause weakness and dizziness.
        Diagnosing diverticulosis and diverticulitis
        The condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States aged 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men. However, unless you have had a colonoscopy, CT scan of your abdomen, or barium enema, you would not be aware they exist.
        On the other hand, diverticulitis almost always causes symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your medical history, bowel habits, and diet and will conduct a physical examination. Your doctor will press on your abdomen to check for tenderness.
        Based on the location of your symptoms and the location of abdominal pain and tenderness, your doctor may be able to make the diagnosis without further testing. If your doctor is unsure or concerned that you may have an abscess or other complication, he or she will likely order additional studies. These usually include blood tests for signs of infection and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan.
        Lower intestinal bleeding is commonly caused by a broken blood vessel within a diverticula. But it is often very difficult to identify the exact bleeding site, even with colonoscopy.
        Expected duration of diverticulosis and diverticulitis
        Diverticula do not disappear unless the section of colon is removed surgically. Diverticulosis is a lifelong condition that can be managed, primarily with adjustments in diet.
        Symptoms of diverticulitis or bleeding from diverticulosis may subside within a few days after treatment, may continue, or may get worse in the case of severe illness or complications.
        Preventing diverticulosis and diverticulitis
        People whose diets contain large amounts of fiber are less likely to develop diverticular disease. The recommended daily fiber intake is at least 20 grams per day, but a healthier goal is 35 grams of fiber daily, preferably from fruits, vegetables, and grains. Your doctor also may recommend unprocessed bran or a fiber product. It is important to increase fiber intake gradually and to drink more water to increase the bulk of the bowel movements, which reduces pressure inside the bowel.
        Physical activity also may lower the risk of diverticulosis. Many doctors previously recommended that people with diverticulosis avoid eating nuts, popcorn, and foods with seeds. This restriction has not been proven to prevent diverticulitis.
        Treating diverticulosis and diverticulitis
        The only possible treatment for diverticulosis is to increase fiber in the diet. Fiber will not heal existing diverticula, but it may prevent more from forming.
        If you have symptoms of mild diverticulitis, your doctor may recommend a short period of observation without antibiotics. There are no specific dietary recommendations, but many doctors suggest a low-fiber diet until symptoms resolve. If the diagnosis is uncertain, an abdominal CT scan is usually ordered. Depending on the results, your doctor can then decide if treatment at home with oral antibiotics versus intravenous (IV) antibiotics, either at home or in the hospital.
        If fever and pain continues, you may be developing complicated diverticulitis, For example, an abscess can develop when a diverticulum becomes perforated (develops a hole). An abscess is a collection of pus. A surgeon then will help your doctor plan the next step: drainage or surgery. The choice depends on the extent of the problem and your overall health. Drainage means that the surgeon cleans out the pus.
        Surgery also may be required during the hospital stay to treat a particularly severe episode of diverticulitis. Emergency surgery is required if the abscess breaks open and causes peritonitis, the most serious potential complication of diverticulitis. Peritonitis requires surgical repair as well as intravenous antibiotics.
        For persistent or recurrent bleeding from diverticulosis, surgery may be the only option.
        The most common procedure, known as a colon resection, involves removing the part of the colon that contains the bleeding diverticula and reattaching the ends.
        When done during emergencies, a colon resection is often done as a two-stage process. First, a section of colon is removed, but because of infection, it is not safe to rejoin the ends. Instead, the surgeon creates a temporary hole, or stoma, in the abdomen and connects the colon to it, a procedure called a colostomy. A bag is attached to collect the stool. Later, a second operation is done to reattach the end of the colon, and remove the colostomy.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        After successful treatment for diverticulitis, your doctor normally will recommend a high-fiber diet. Later, you may need to have a procedure called a colonoscopy, which is an internal examination of the colon.
        In general, surgery is not recommended after only one or even two attacks without complications. However, it is usually recommended after a third episode occurs in the same location within the colon.
        Repeated episodes of diverticulitis can lead to internal scarring and narrowing of the colon, which also may require surgery to remove a piece of the colon.
        When to call a professional
        Call your doctor if abdominal pain in one spot lasts for longer than a few hours, especially if it becomes worse or is accompanied by fever.
        Prognosis
        With proper treatment and a high-fiber diet, the outlook for people with diverticulosis and uncomplicated diverticulitis is excellent. Most people with diverticulosis never have symptoms.
        People who have diverticulitis usually improve within two to four days after treatment begins. Over 85% of patients recover with bed rest and liquid diet, with or without antibiotics. Most never have a second episode of diverticulitis.
        The prognosis varies if complications develop and is particularly serious in the case of peritonitis.
        About 90% of people who have a colon resection do not have symptoms return after the surgery.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/evoking-calm-practicing-mindfulness-in-daily-life-helps-202110142617,Evoking calm: Practicing mindfulness in daily life helps,"It's easy to say you simply don't have time to be mindful. With so much going on in daily life, who has time to stop and be present? But everyone has at least 10 minutes to spare to practice mindfulness.
        The point of these brief, daily reflections is to help you tap into calmness whenever life gets too hairy. Practicing everyday mindfulness can also improve your memory and concentration skills and help you feel less distracted and better able to manage stress . And mindfulness tools have been successfully incorporated into treatments for anxiety and depression.
        There is more than one way to practice mindfulness. Still, any mindfulness technique aims to achieve a state of alert, focused, relaxed consciousness by deliberately paying attention to thoughts and sensations without passing judgment on them. This allows the mind to focus on the present moment with an attitude of acceptance.
        Three easy mindfulness exercises to try
        Here are three simple exercises you can try whenever you need a mental break, emotional lift, or just want to pause and appreciate everything around you. Devote 10 minutes a day to them and see how the experience changes your outlook. It's time well spent.
        Simple meditation
        A quick and easy meditation is an excellent place to begin practicing mindfulness.
        
          Sit on a straight-backed chair or cross-legged on the floor.
          Focus on an aspect of your breathing, such as the sensations of air flowing into your nostrils and out of your mouth, or your belly rising and falling as you inhale and exhale.
          Once you've narrowed your concentration in this way, begin to widen your focus. Become aware of sounds, sensations, and ideas. Embrace and consider each without judgment.
          If your mind starts to race, return your focus to your breathing. Then expand your awareness again.
          Take as much time as you like: one minute, or five, or 10 — whatever you're comfortable with. Experts in mindfulness meditation note that the practice is most helpful if you commit to a regular meditation schedule.
        
        Open awareness
        Another approach to mindfulness is ""open awareness,"" which helps you stay in the present and truly participate in specific moments in life. You can choose any task or moment to practice open awareness, such as eating, taking a walk, showering, cooking a meal, or working in the garden. When you are engaged in these and other similar routine activities, follow these steps.
        
          Bring your attention to the sensations in your body, both physical and emotional.
          Breathe in through your nose, allowing the air to fill your lungs. Let your abdomen expand fully. Then breathe out slowly through your mouth.
          Carry on with the task at hand, slowly and with deliberation.
          Engage each of your senses, paying close attention to what you can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste.
          Try ""single-tasking,"" bringing your attention as fully as possible to what you're doing.
          Allow any thoughts or emotions that arise to come and go, like clouds passing through the sky.
          If your mind wanders away from your current task, gently refocus your attention back to the sensation of the moment.
        
        Body awareness
        Another way to practice mindfulness is to focus your attention on other thoughts, objects, and sensations. While sitting quietly with your eyes closed, channel your awareness toward each of the following:
        
          Sensations: Notice subtle feelings such as an itch or tingling without judgment, and let them pass. Notice each part of your body in succession from head to toe.
          Sights and sounds: Notice sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. Name them ""sight,"" ""sound,"" ""smell,"" ""taste,"" or ""touch"" without judgment and let them go.
          Emotions: Allow emotions to be present without judging them. Practice a steady and relaxed naming of emotions: ""joy,"" ""anger,"" ""frustration.""
          Urges: When you feel a craving or an urge (for instance, to eat excess food or practice an unwanted behavior), acknowledge the desire and understand that it will pass. Notice how your body feels as the craving enters. Replace the wish for the craving to go away with the specific knowledge that it will subside.",Matthew Solan,"October 1, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-does-it-mean-to-have-a-heart-attack,What does it mean to have a heart attack?,"Envision a heart attack, and you probably think of someone clutching his chest in agony, being rushed to the hospital, maybe even dying before he arrives. While this scenario does occur, the reality is often quite different.
        The reason is that heart attacks don't follow a linear path. Symptoms can be severe or subtle. The underlying process that causes a heart attack can differ. People may experience significant heart damage or little to none.
        ""Not all heart attacks strike in the same way, so diagnosing a heart attack requires the combination of a doctor's judgment, signs and symptoms, and test results,"" says Dr. Peter Libby, a cardiologist with the Heart and Vascular Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        What exactly is a heart attack?
        Most heart attacks occur when one of the coronary arteries (the vessels that supply blood to the heart) is unable to deliver enough blood to an area of the heart, or to deliver any at all. The most common underlying cause is formation of fatty plaque in one or more coronary arteries.
        There are two different mechanisms that cause this compromised blood flow. Doctors define them as type 1 and type 2 heart attacks. ""The distinction is important because the various types of heart attacks may be treated entirely differently,"" says Dr. Libby. Here is a look at each one.
        Type 1. With a type 1 heart attack, the cap over a plaque deposit ruptures and releases chemicals that trigger the formation of a blood clot. The clot blocks the artery, interfering with blood flow to part of the heart.
        Type 2. A type 2 heart attack does not involve a ruptured plaque. Instead, it happens when there is a mismatch between the amount of blood a portion of the heart muscle needs and the blood supply in the coronary artery feeding that area of the heart.
        The trigger for this type of heart attack can be a condition that puts extra stress on the heart, like the flu or pneumonia, an abnormal heart rhythm resulting in an accelerated heart rate, or a significant spike in blood pressure.
        Heart attack symptoms
        When a heart attack strikes, it can trigger a variety of symptoms. The most common is the stereotypical chest pain, usually described as crushing, squeezing, pressing, heavy, or occasionally stabbing or burning.
        Chest pain tends to be focused either in the center of the chest or just below the center of the rib cage, and it can spread to the arms, abdomen, neck, or lower jaw. It's also possible to have a heart attack and not know it. This is known as a silent heart attack. Symptoms lack the intensity of a classic heart attack. Instead, they can appear as chest discomfort that comes and goes; pain in one or both arms, neck, or jaw; sudden shortness of breath; breaking out in a cold sweat; or feeling nauseated or lightheaded. ""Because these symptoms can feel so mild and brief, they often get confused for regular discomforts like indigestion or heartburn,"" says Dr. Libby.
        Diagnosing a heart attack
        If you have any suspicion that you may be having a heart attack, don't hesitate: call 911. Once you arrive for medical care, the staff will do a quick review of your symptoms.
        With any concern for a heart attack, the doctor will immediately order an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a blood test to measure levels of troponin, a protein in heart muscle cells that spills into the bloodstream when any type of heart damage occurs.
        Doctors look for high troponin levels and certain changes in the electrical pattern on the ECG to make a diagnosis. Both tests are used because either one can be normal or show only minimal changes in the earliest stage of a heart attack.
        In fact, even with normal ECG and troponin results, emergency department doctors will begin immediate treatment if your symptoms are highly suggestive of a heart attack, especially if you have multiple heart risk factors.
        Initial treatment
        If your test results suggest you're having either a type 1 or type 2 heart attack, most often the doctor will give you several pills right away. These include aspirin; a high-dose statin, such as atorvastatin (Lipitor) or rosuvastatin (Crestor); and a beta blocker to slow your heart rate and reduce heart stress. You'll also get an intravenous infusion of heparin, a drug that discourages blood clotting.
        If you're diagnosed with a likely type 1 heart attack with full artery blockage, the doctor will probably send you to the cardiac catheterization lab for angioplasty and stent placement, a minimally invasive procedure to clear the artery and prop it open. This can restore blood flow to the injured heart muscle and minimize permanent damage.
        For a type 2 diagnosis, the goal is to restore the mismatch between blood supply and demand. In addition to the medications noted above, you'll need treatment for any medical problem that stressed the heart, such as an infection or an abnormally fast heart rhythm.
        Once your condition is stable, your doctor will design a strategy to help with recovery.
        ""The goal after the first heart attack is simple — to prevent a second one, and prevent further weakening of the heart muscle that can lead to heart failure,"" says Dr. Libby. This includes diet changes, exercising regularly, a personalized medication regimen, and perhaps referral for cardiac rehabilitation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/gratitude-linked-to-longer-life-and-fewer-heart-related-deaths,Gratitude linked to longer life and fewer heart-related deaths,"Cultivating gratitude may help older women live longer, a new study shows. The findings, published July 3, 2024, in JAMA Psychiatry, suggest that most of this benefit comes from preventing deaths from heart disease.
        The study included more than 49,000 nurses with an average age of 79 who completed a six-question gratitude test. Three years later, nearly 10% had died, most commonly of heart disease. Those with the highest levels of gratitude had a 9% lower risk of dying in that period than those in with the lowest levels.
         Writing down a few small things you're grateful for — an uplifting conversation, a beautiful view, a treasured possession — is a popular way to foster gratitude. For more information, see ""How positive psychology can help you cultivate better heart health"" in the June 2023 Heart Letter.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/cutting-meat-intake-by-a-third-could-reduce-rates-of-heart-disease,Cutting meat intake by a third could reduce rates of heart disease,"Rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and colon cancer would fall substantially if people ate less red and processed meat, according to a report in the July 2024 Lancet Planetary Health.
        Previous research suggests that eating red meat (such as hamburgers and steak) and processed meat (such as hot dogs, deli meat, and bacon) raises the risk of common chronic diseases.
        Researchers used data from two nationwide nutrition surveys and a simulation model based on 8,665 representative Americans to estimate how cutting back on meat could lower heart disease, diabetes, and colon cancer rates.
        The findings suggest that if American adults cut their consumption of both red and processed meat by 30%, that could prevent an estimated 382,400 cases of cardiovascular disease over a 10-year period. For processed meat, that would translate to cutting back from an average of just over two servings to 1.4 servings per week. The red meat reduction would be from 3.7 to 2.8 servings per week. (A serving of meat is 3 ounces.)

        The study included adults ages 35 and older who were tested for respiratory viruses over a 12-year period ending in 2019. The testing revealed more than 23,000 separate cases of influenza. Researchers then compared the incidence of heart attack during the risk period (the week after a positive test) to the control period (one year before and 51 weeks after the risk period). Heart attacks were six times more likely to occur during the risk period versus the control period. Earlier research has consistently shown a heightened risk of heart attack soon after viral infections like the flu, as well as the common cold and COVID-19.
        The findings are a good reminder to get your annual flu vaccine if you haven't already. On average, the vaccine can reduce your chance of getting the flu by about 50%.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/travel-tips-for-people-with-heart-related-risks,Travel tips for people with heart related risks,"If you're planning to travel by plane over the holidays or for a winter vacation, a little extra preparation may be wise if you have (or are at risk for) heart disease. For most people, the simple precautions described below will suffice. But check with your doctor before booking a flight if you've recently had a heart attack or undergone any type of heart procedure.
        Before takeoff
        Write down the phone numbers for your primary care doctor (and cardiologist, if applicable) on a card or in small notebook, just in case your cellphone dies. Include your current medical conditions and a list of your prescriptions, which you'll need in the event of an emergency.
        ""Keep all of your prescription medications easily accessible in your carry-on bag, and make sure to bring extra doses in case of travel delays,"" says Dr. Yuliya Mints, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital. It's safer — and in many states and countries, required — to leave them in the original labeled container.
        Make note of any time difference between your home and destination. Ideally, you should stick to a consistent schedule and take your medications (especially blood pressure and anti-clotting drugs) based on your home time zone, says Dr. Mints. Set an alarm on your phone or watch as a reminder, she suggests.
        At the airport, the full-body scans commonly used for security screening are safe for people with pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. But these devices may trigger alarms on walk-through metal detectors, which are used in certain circumstances. Carry the ID card for your device in case you need to show it to security personnel, says Dr. Mints.
        In the air
        When the flight attendants offer up drinks, resist the temptation to order an alcoholic beverage. ""Even on the ground, drinking alcohol can raise the risk of atrial fibrillation and high blood pressure,"" says Dr. Mints. But inflight drinking may pose added dangers, particularly for people prone to cardiovascular disease, according to a study published online June 3, 2024, by the journal Thorax.
        For the study, researchers randomly assigned 48 healthy adults to spend two nights sleeping at normal air pressure or at the equivalent of airplane cabin pressure. The participants stayed sober for one night but drank alcohol (the equivalent of two beers or two glasses of wine) the other night. They also wore devices measuring their blood oxygen and heart rate.
        Compared to people sleeping in normal air pressure, those sleeping in airplane cabin pressure had lower blood oxygen levels and higher heart rates. Adding alcohol to the mix lowered oxygen levels even more and boosted heart rates even higher. Such changes could be dangerous for older adults at risk for heart problems, says Dr. Mints.
        But do drink plenty of water, which has the added advantage of requiring you to get up to use the restroom. On a long flight, walking a little every hour or so will help improve circulation in your legs; so can flexing your feet and circling your ankles. Doing so may reduce the chance of developing a blood clot, although the overall risk of such a clot (known as deep-vein thrombosis, or DVT) is quite low. Doctors often recommend that people with a history of DVT wear compression stockings (elastic, below-the-knee socks that gently squeeze your calves) when they fly.
        At your destination
        If your vacation involves more activity that you're accustomed to doing regularly, take it easy the first day or so. That's especially important if you travel to a high-elevation destination, such as a ski resort. The higher the altitude, the less oxygen concentration in the air (see ""Oxygen levels at high-altitude destinations in America""). In response, your heart rate and blood pressure rise temporarily until your body adapts to the lower oxygen level, usually within a few days. As a general rule, don't go above 8,000 feet the first day, and give your body time to adapt before going higher or doing any strenuous exercise. Ascending up to 12,000 feet is considered fine for most people with stable heart disease.
        In the event that you need medical care while away from home, the CDC has helpful information, including resources about locating medical services abroad.
        
          
            
              
                Oxygen levels at high-altitude destinations in America
                If you live close to sea level and travel to mile-high Denver (5,279 feet), you might not notice the elevation change — even if you do vigorous exercise. The average drop in VO2 max (the maximum amount of oxygen you can use during intense exercise) is just 1%. In Park City, Utah (7,001 ft), the reduction is 9%. But if you ascend to the highest ski chairlift in North America in Breckenridge, Colo. (12,840 feet), you'll definitely notice the difference. At that elevation, the reduction in VO2 max is about 25%.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/chronic-loneliness-may-raise-stroke-risk,Chronic loneliness may raise stroke risk,"Older adults who are chronically lonely are significantly more likely to suffer a stroke, a new Harvard-led analysis suggests.
        Published online June 24, 2024, by eClinical Medicine, the study evaluated data from 2006 through 2018 from nearly 12,200 people ages 50 and up (average age 67, 61% women). None of the participants had suffered a stroke before the study began. All answered questions from a standard test gauging loneliness, and about 9,000 participants answered the questions a second time four years later. Based on those answers, the researchers placed participants into four categories of loneliness: consistently low; remitting (scoring high at baseline and low at follow-up); recent onset (scoring low at baseline and high at follow-up); and consistently high (scoring high at both baseline and follow-up).
        Over 12 years of follow-up, 601 strokes were recorded among participants who had been surveyed about loneliness at two time periods. People categorized as ""consistently high"" in loneliness had 56% higher odds of having a stroke compared to those in the ""consistently low"" group, even after researchers accounted for other psychological factors such as isolation and depression. However, participants in the ""remitting"" or ""recent onset"" loneliness groups did not show a pattern of higher stroke odds, suggesting that loneliness over the long term weighs more heavily on risk.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/regular-walking-can-hamper-low-back-pain-recurrence,Regular walking can hamper low back pain recurrence,"If your low back pain tends to return again and again, walking regularly may help stave off a repeat episode, a new study suggests.
        The analysis, published online June 19, 2024, by The Lancet, tracked 701 adults (average age 54, 81% women), all of whom had recently recovered from an episode of low back pain. Half were assigned to six months of an individualized, physical therapist–guided walking program and education sessions, while the other half received no walking guidance or education.
        After tracking participants for between one and three years, researchers found that the walking and education group had fewer occurrences of activity-limiting pain compared to the no-intervention group. They also went nearly twice as long before they had a recurrence of low back pain — an average of 208 days compared to 112 days. While researchers couldn't pinpoint why walking seemed to hamper back pain, they believe the benefits stem from a combination of factors, including movement, stress relief, and release of ""feel-good"" chemicals called endorphins.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/depressions-cognitive-cost,Depression's cognitive cost,"Elaine's memory lapses seemed minor, but they happened often. She frequently forgot where she parked her car or why she walked into a room; reminiscing with a good friend, she could barely remember a wondrous vacation the two had shared in their 40s. Now in her mid-60s — and with a mother with Alzheimer's disease — Elaine fretted that these memory blanks signaled she, too, was developing dementia.
        But the true culprit was a lot sneakier: longstanding depression. A battery of cognitive tests ruled out dementia, easing Elaine's mind but provoking distress that a condition characterized by persistent sadness and apathy could also steal her ability to recall simple details.
        ""Few things are as depressing and anxiety-provoking as being aware you're having memory lapses or being afraid you might develop dementia,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School who conducted Elaine's cognitive tests.
        Inattention a factor
        An estimated 21 million American adults — roughly 8% — have experienced at least one episode of depression, and women are twice as likely as men to have the condition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
        Most people associate depression with its hallmark symptoms, which include not only sadness and apathy, but also loss of enjoyment in things that previously brought pleasure, appetite changes, and trouble sleeping. Yet memory is often a casualty as well, with research suggesting that having depression increases a person's risk for memory problems. Depressive symptoms can even speed memory decline in older people, according to a study of 8,200 adults published online June 11, 2024, by JAMA Network Open.
        Dr. Budson points out that memory glitches common in depressed people are a byproduct of an overstimulated mind. ""I think of these more as attention deficits than memory deficits,"" he says. ""If someone has depression, they always have something on their mind that prevents them from focusing their full attention on where they are and what they're doing.""
        Indeed, just getting through the day can feel exhausting when you're depressed. But an inability to drum up energy and attention is only one contributor to depression-fueled memory problems, Dr. Budson says. It's believed that depression also alters levels of brain chemicals that help us focus, such as dopamine and norepinephrine. Memory issues may also stem from other depression-related changes in the brain involved in creating, combining, and recalling memories.
        How dementia is distinct
        Importantly, however, memory problems show up in depression quite differently than in Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.
        Someone who's depressed, for example, is likely to have a harder time retrieving long-ago memories — like the camping trip her family took when she was 8 — than remembering what she ate for breakfast that morning. A person with dementia, on the other hand, can typically summon memories from many years ago with ease, but can't recall where she went yesterday.
        That's because dementia damages the hippocampus, a brain structure in charge of helping us learn new information and retrieving recent memories. We don't need the hippocampus to retrieve older memories, though, which is why people with Alzheimer's have less difficulty recalling their childhood or early adulthood.
        ""People with Alzheimer's can remember things that happened 20, 30, and 50 years ago quite well, at least in the early stages of the disease, but have great difficulty remembering things that happened that morning or yesterday or last week,"" Dr. Budson says. ""The pattern is almost the exact opposite of what you see in depression.""
        Positive memories fade first
        Another curious distinction in depression-related memory problems is how the mood disorder doesn't target all memories in the same way. Often, the first to fade are recollections of happier times — just when that type of boost would be especially welcome. Why? Again, brain biology is the culprit: areas that process positive or rewarding experiences are disrupted in people with depression.
        Many, if not most, memories are context-dependent, Dr. Budson explains. Case in point: visit the town where you grew up or your old high school, and ""all of a sudden you'll be able to retrieve memories you didn't even know you still had,"" he says.
        But this type of context-dependent memory retrieval doesn't just involve places—it's also relevant for moods. ""When you're feeling happy, you're more likely to be able to easily retrieve memories of other times when you were feeling happy,"" he explains. ""And when you're depressed, it's easy to retrieve memories of other times when you were feeling depressed, but difficult to retrieve those from when you were feeling happy.""
        This unlucky phenomenon might make it more difficult to recover from depression, creating a vicious cycle. ""It's hard to remember those happy times — and that you can be happy again,"" Dr. Budson says. ""I don't know if that worsens depression, but it makes it hard to get out of it.""
        Proactive steps
        Dr. Budson offers these strategies to lower your risk of depression and protect your memory if you're prone to the mood disorder:
        Get your heart pumping. Regular aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, biking, or swimming, not only generates feel-happy endorphins, but also increases growth factors in the brain that help produce new cells in the hippocampus.
        Stay socially engaged. Spending time with friends and family and engaging in social activities may not only stave off depression, but also help ease it. ""Being around people you like and who like you is super-helpful,"" he says.
        Plan around your triggers. Hard experience may have taught you that certain people, places, or events can trigger your depression to recur. Avoid those situations as much as you can, and consider alternative actions during happier moments, when you have the mental bandwidth to plan ahead.
        Keep your ""happy people"" on speed dial. Many of us have a special someone — perhaps a friend, relative, or religious adviser — who can lift our spirits on the bleakest days. Reach out to that person if you find yourself in emotional quicksand. To help you remember to do that, add reminders to your phone or calendar.
        Log your favorite memories. Knowing it's normal to have difficulty summoning up pleasant memories when you're depressed, post a written list of some of your favorites on a bulletin board or refrigerator. ""When you're feeling blue, read the list,"" Dr. Budson says. ""It might just make you smile.""
        
          
            
              
                Common infection's dark side: Could it trigger Alzheimer's?
                Being infected with Helicobacter pylori—a stomach bacterium found in an estimated two-thirds of the world's population—may be linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in adults 50 and older, a new study suggests.
                Passed from one person to another, H. pylori is often harmless. But it can lead to indigestion, ulcers, and (in rare cases) stomach cancer. Alzheimer's may join that list, according to the study, which was published in the March 2024 issue of Alzheimer's and Dementia.
                Researchers analyzed medical records spanning nearly three decades from more than 4.2 million people in the United Kingdom ages 50 and up. None of the participants had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's at the study's start. People with a symptomatic H. pylori infection had 11% higher odds of developing Alzheimer's disease over an average follow-up period of 11 years, the study found.
                The findings are only observational and therefore do not prove that H. pylori causes dementia. But the possibility doesn't surprise Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. ""We've known for more than 10 years that other infections are also associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease,"" he says.
                How might infections be linked to Alzheimer's? Research increasingly suggests that beta-amyloid—a type of protein involved in Alzheimer's-related brain plaques— is normally deposited in the brain to help it fight off infection, Dr. Budson says. But some people, due to genetic or other factors, aren't able to clear this protein out of the brain after the threat has passed.
                ""We all make a bit of amyloid during the day, and when we sleep at night, it gets flushed away,"" he says. ""That's why it's important to get a good night's sleep. But over a lifetime, people sometimes generate a little too much amyloid or have trouble clearing it away. When too much of it builds up, that's what leads to Alzheimer's.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/erratic-sleeping-behavior-may-increase-diabetes-risk,Erratic sleeping behavior may increase diabetes risk,"Seven to nine hours of sleep per night is generally regarded as a healthy amount. But sometimes people sleep too little, and then try to catch up by sleeping more than usual. However, a study published online June 27, 2024, by the journal Diabetologia found that this kind of erratic sleeping may increase a person's risk for diabetes.
        Researchers collected health questionnaires from approximately 36,000 adults in their 50s. The information included the average number of hours they slept on weekdays and weekends. The researchers divided sleep patterns into three categories: short (less than seven hours), normal (seven to nine hours), and long (more than nine hours). Next, to show how consistently people slept from night to night, they created nine sleep trajectory combinations — for example, short-short, short-normal, short-long, normal-normal, and normal-short.
        Five years later, the questionnaires were repeated. The researchers found that people who regularly reported short-long or long-short sleeping patterns — meaning they bounced back and forth from sleeping less than seven hours to longer than nine — had a 50% higher risk for diabetes than people who regularly slept the normal seven to nine hours.
        While this study only showed an association, it underscores the potential impact of sleep on diabetes. Other studies have shown that poor sleeping habits can lead to elevated blood sugar levels and weight gain, both of which are risk factors for diabetes.

        The research drew on data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, which tracked the diet and health of more than half a million adults ages 50 to 71 for almost 23 years. The researchers scored people's diets using a rating system that classifies foods according to the degree and type of processing used in their preparation.
        The researchers found that people who consumed significant amounts of ultra-processed food were 10% more likely to die — especially from heart disease and diabetes — during the study's two-decade follow-up period than those who did not. These individuals also had an overall lower-quality diet and a greater body mass index than those who ate fewer ultra-processed foods. The ultra-processed foods consumed the most were sugar-sweetened beverages and processed meats, such as hot dogs, sausages, and deli meat.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/the-end-of-painful-sitting,The end of painful sitting,"Older adults typically sit for about 65% to 80% of their waking hours, according to some estimates. And all that inactivity is bad for your health. Research has shown that prolonged sitting can increase your risk for obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.
        But another less serious, but still frustrating everyday problem caused by too much sitting is gluteal amnesia. Also known by its more colorful moniker, ""dead butt syndrome,"" gluteal amnesia causes pain and discomfort in your buttocks.
        It occurs when the gluteus medius — one of the three gluteal muscles that help stabilize the pelvis and maintain your body's proper alignment — becomes too weak. This can happen in different ways, but one is simply a lack of movement.
        When it's rarely called upon to contract (like during long periods of sitting), the gluteus medius lengthens. At the same time, the hip flexors in the front of your thighs tighten because they are constantly contracted when you're in a flexed (seated) position.
        This creates an imbalance between these opposing muscle groups, so they don't work together as effectively. The result can be a smaller range of motion that leads to pain or discomfort in your buttocks.
        ""And when the gluteus medius isn't functioning properly, muscles above, below, and around it may be called on to pick up the slack, potentially leading to hip, back, or knee pain,"" says Vijay Daryanani, a physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation.
        Get up and get moving
        Fortunately, with the right moves, you can correct this painful problem. The first step is to keep the gluteal muscles limber by standing and moving around more during the day. Here are some strategies that can help.
        Drink water. Fill up a large water bottle and drink it throughout the day, so you'll have to get up to use the bathroom regularly. (Plus, it will help you stay hydrated.)
        Set a reminder. Try not to sit for longer than 20 to 30 minutes at a time, says Daryanani. Set up alerts to remind you to get up and move. You can use a smartphone or other smart device, fitness tracker, or regular kitchen timer.
        Take a chore break. Break up household chores like loading the dishwasher, doing laundry, and taking out the recycling into smaller segments, so you must move about regularly throughout the day.
        Pace during phone calls. Stand or walk back and forth or in circles while you talk.
        Strengthening weak muscles
        The second step is to strengthen the weak gluteus. Here are three exercises adapted from Harvard Health Publishing's Special Health Report Body-Weight Exercise that can help. You can do them together on their own, or add them to your regular workouts.
        Standing side leg lift. Stand up straight, feet together, with your weight evenly distributed on both feet. Relax your arms at your sides.
        Movement: Lift your right foot to the side a few inches off the floor, shifting your weight to your left leg. Lift your arms out to your sides to help you balance. Hold for five to 30 seconds and return to the starting position. Repeat with your left foot. This completes one set. Repeat the sequence up to three times.
        If holding the balance is difficult, keep the toes of your raised leg lightly touching the floor. For a challenge, hold the balance on each side for up to 60 seconds or with your eyes closed.
        Skater. Stand up straight with your feet hip-width apart and your arms at your sides.
        Movement: Jump to the right as far as possible, landing on your right leg. Bring your left foot across behind you and swing your arms to the right as you bend your right knee into a lunge. Repeat, leaping to the left and lunging on your left leg with your right one behind you.
        Continue alternating directions for 30 seconds. To make the move easier, step to the side instead of jumping, make the lunge smaller, or don't lunge at all and instead tap your foot behind you. For a challenge, make bigger hops, or speed up the pace.
        Clam. Lie on your right side, knees bent, and heels in line with your buttocks. Rest your head on your right arm and place your left hand on the floor in front of you.
        Movement: Engage your gluteal muscles. Keeping your feet together, lift your left knee up toward the ceiling as high as comfortable. Hold for a second. Then slowly lower to the starting position to complete one rep. Keep a slow and steady pace — take three seconds to lift your knee and three seconds to lower it
        Repeat the movement up to 10 times, then repeat on the other side. This completes one set. Perform two or three sets, resting in between. For more of a challenge, wrap an exercise band around both legs above the knees.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/harvard-researchers-irregular-sleep-patterns-linked-to-diabetes,Harvard researchers: Irregular sleep patterns linked to diabetes,"Getting the right amount of sleep is essential for good health. But if the duration of your nightly Z's varies significantly, you might be boosting your diabetes risk, suggests a Harvard-led study published online July 17, 2024, by Diabetes Care. Researchers asked more than 84,000 diabetes-free people (average age 62) to wear activity trackers for a week, and then followed their health for more than seven years. People whose sleep duration varied the most (fluctuating by more than an hour from night to night) had a 34% higher risk for diabetes, compared with people whose sleep duration was more consistent. The association was strongest among those who slept more than eight hours per night, on average. ""However, the association was also present among those who slept seven to eight hours per night. This suggests that even for those who get enough sleep each night, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule is still important,"" says Sina Kianersi, the lead author and a researcher at Harvard affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. The study doesn't prove that inconsistent sleep causes diabetes, but other studies have tied varying sleep duration to diabetes risk factors, including a big belly and high blood sugar, blood pressure, and triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-do-i-need-a-flu-or-covid-vaccine,Why do I need a flu or COVID vaccine?,"Q. 
          My doctor says I should get vaccines for the flu and COVID. But I've never had either flu or COVID, so why do I need a vaccine?
        
        A. Most people are not as lucky as you: in their lifetimes, many people get sick from influenza (flu) multiple times, and blood tests show that most people in the United States have been infected with the COVID virus even though some people may not have realized it.
        Each of these viruses can make a person very sick. In the United States, 15,000 to 50,000 people die from the flu every year, and over a million have died from COVID. Fortunately, there is no doubt that the vaccines for each virus are effective in reducing the risk of getting very sick. You may know all this and still wonder if you really can benefit from these vaccines.
        So, here's something else to consider, as shown by several important recent studies. The flu and COVID viruses both can injure the body, making it vulnerable to developing new major illnesses. Take the flu. A study involving 26,000 people, published in the medical journal NEJM Evidence in July 2024, found that in the week following the flu, the inflammation caused by the flu virus destabilized plaques of atherosclerosis, causing clots to form. As a result, people were six times more likely to have heart attacks in the first week after getting the flu than these same people had been in the year before they got the flu and in the year after they recovered from it. Many of those people had not previously been diagnosed with heart disease.
        Another new study compared 135,000 people who developed COVID to 5.2 million who did not (but were similar in age, gender, and medical conditions). The individuals were identified in 2020, before the COVID vaccine was available. Scientists found that those who got COVID had a much higher risk for heart, lung, gastrointestinal, and brain diseases over the next three years — including more heart attacks, strokes, and newly developed Alzheimer's disease. This was true even of people who had been only mildly ill with COVID. The evidence was published in the journal Nature Medicine in June 2024.
        Finally, an outstanding study involving nearly six million people in the United States found that getting the COVID vaccine greatly reduces these risks. The findings were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in July 2024.
        So even if you are one of those unusual people who has never gotten the flu or COVID — or at least hasn't gotten very sick from them — there still are good reasons to get the vaccines. Not only do they reduce your risk of getting the flu and COVID, they also reduce your risk of getting several serious additional diseases. Who would not want that?

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/different-types-of-rapid-heart-rhythms,Different types of rapid heart rhythms,"Q. 
          What is the difference between atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia?
        
        A. While both conditions are rapid, abnormal heart rhythms that originate in the upper part of the heart, they tend to develop at different ages, and they require different treatments. Atrial fibrillation (afib) is more common and affects mostly people ages 65 and older. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) can strike at any age — even in young children — but the average age of diagnosis is 45.
        Afib is a rapid, chaotic heart rhythm triggered by errant electrical signals in the heart's upper left chamber (atrium). These signals fire in an irregular pattern over 300 times per minute, causing the atria to quiver rather than beat normally. The heart's lower chambers (ventricles) also beat irregularly. The ventricles may not have time to fill and pump blood to the body, which can lead to breathlessness and fatigue.
        People with afib may need medications that help slow down the heart. They may also need anti-clotting medication to prevent clots from forming in the atria, which can occur when blood stagnates due to the atria's lack of normal movement. If a clot escapes the heart, it can travel to the brain and cause a stroke.
        With SVT, the errant electrical signal comes from above (supra) the ventricles — either in the left or right atrium or, more often, in the atrioventricular node between the atria and ventricles (see illustration). These abnormal signals override the normal signal, creating a series of fast heartbeats (tachycardia).
        These fast rhythms are regular and cause both the atria and ventricles to beat very rapidly — as much as 200 beats per minute. If SVT lasts just a few seconds, people say it feels as though their heart is flip-flopping or fluttering in their chest. But if lasts for more than a few minutes, sometimes the heart doesn't have time to fill completely. Just as with afib, the resulting decrease in blood flow to the body and brain can cause a person to feel breathless, dizzy, or lightheaded. Treatments include simple tricks to slow the heart (like coughing or gagging), medications, and ablation procedures.
        If you feel a prolonged fluttering sensation in your chest or a rapid, irregular heartbeat, check with your doctor. Physicians usually order a patch monitor that records the heart's electric activity (an electrocardiogram, or ECG) for two to four weeks. Certain smart watches that can record a brief ECG may be able to detect afib; they can also save the record, which you can share with your doctor. Both of these devices are helpful tools to help distinguish between SVT and afib.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/is-it-dementia-or-depression,Is it dementia or depression?,"In older adults who experience intellectual decline, it's sometimes difficult to tell whether the cause is dementia or depression. Both disorders are common in later years, and each can lead to the other.
        Depression in the elderly can also lead to a phenomenon called pseudodementia — an apparent intellectual decline that stems from a lack of energy or effort. People with this problem are often forgetful, move slowly, and have low motivation as well as mental slowing. They may or may not appear depressed. This syndrome responds well to treatments for depression. As mood improves, a person's energy, ability to concentrate, and intellectual functioning usually return to previous levels.
        Although depression and dementia share certain traits, there are some differences that help distinguish one from the other:
        
          Decline in mental functioning tends to be more rapid with depression than with Alzheimer's or another type of dementia.
          Unlike people with Alzheimer's, people with depression are usually not disoriented.
          People with depression have difficulty concentrating, whereas those affected by Alzheimer's have problems with short-term memory.
          Writing, speaking, and motor skills aren't usually impaired in depression.
          Depressed people are more likely to notice and comment on their memory problems, while those with Alzheimer's may seem indifferent to such changes.
        
        Since there is no simple test that can reveal whether someone has depression or dementia, treatment is often worth trying. If depression is at the root, treatment can produce dramatic improvement.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/are-you-missing-these-signs-of-anxiety-or-depression,Are you missing these signs of anxiety or depression?,"The signs of mental illness aren't always obvious. Subtle changes in mood or behavior are often attributed to aging, just like weaker muscles and fuzzy thinking. There's a tendency to dismiss it as, 'Well, of course I'm worried, I have heart disease,' or, 'Of course I'm sad, I'm not as relevant as I once was.
        But depression (extreme sadness, worthlessness, or hopelessness) and anxiety (debilitating worry and agitation) do not need to be routine parts of aging. Getting help for these feelings can help you maintain your health and enjoy life to the fullest.
        Symptoms
        Sometimes recognizing depression and anxiety takes a little honest reflection about your behaviors, feelings, and habits. Here are some signposts:
        
          Apathy. Have you lost interest in the activities that used to bring you joy? Has life lost so much meaning that you feel empty? Those are classic signs of depression.
          Helplessness or hopelessness. Do you feel there is little you or anyone can do to improve your life? Helplessness and hopelessness also are classic signs of depression.
          Changes in habits. Sleeping or eating too much or too little can be a sign of depression. So can drinking more alcohol than usual or engaging in risky behavior.
          Persistent fatigue. It's normal to be tired at the end of the day. But if you're tired all the time, it could be due to depression or anxiety. Or it may be related to an underlying medical condition, such as an underactive thyroid or heart failure.
          Difficulty focusing or making decisions. People who are depressed and anxious have difficulty making decisions because they worry whatever they do will be wrong. Or you may have trouble concentrating or paying attention to others.
          Mood swings. If you're easily irritated (or extremely impatient or overly self-critical), or if you experience frequent mood swings, it could be a sign of depression or anxiety.
          Unending worry. Are you anticipating every possible problem and focusing on it rather than looking at the lake or sky or enjoying being with your grandchild? He says that kind of worry could be due to an anxiety disorder.
          Wanting to be alone. If you enjoy solitude because you like the time to read or meditate, that's fine. But that's different from staying home because it takes too much energy to interact with others. That can be a sign of depression.
        
        What you should do
        Just because you're experiencing one of those symptoms doesn't mean you'll be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or depression. But if you're too caught up in one feeling or another, having less pleasure in life or having trouble doing what you need to do, then certainly get help.
        Reaching out to family and friends may be a good way to start the process. Talk to people who might be understanding, compassionate, and helpful. If you feel embarrassed to share your feelings or worries with those close to you, make an appointment with your doctor.
        Treatment
        Help for depression and anxiety can come in a variety of forms, such as treating underlying conditions that may be causing depression, taking anti-depressant medications, or taking part in talk therapy.
        There are also plenty of pill-free approaches that can help. Exercise is an important one. A daily walk can help you maintain your overall mood, energy, and positivity. Activating your muscles increases blood flow to the brain and releases substances that stimulate the growth of brain cells and their connections.
        Another strategy is staying connected socially. Social connections are associated with reduced stress, improved immune system function, and longer life. People with more social connections also have lower levels of anxiety and depression, higher self-esteem, and a better overall sense of well-being.
        The takeaway
        You don't have to suffer with depression or anxiety, no matter what your age. It's useful to find a way to manage it better so you can live your life fully and experience being alive. You want to feel like every day that you wake up is a good day.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/dont-ignore-depression,Don't ignore depression,"Depression may be more common as people age, but perhaps the biggest threat to older adults' mental health is that many of them fail to recognize its symptoms and seriousness.
        A 2020 poll conducted by GeneSight Mental Health Monitor found that 61% of people ages 65 and older who worry they may have depression don't seek treatment. About one-third believe they can ""snap out of it"" on their own.
        This all-too-common attitude can cause many to unnecessarily suffer from a treatable illness.
        ""Depression still carries a stigma, especially among older adults, who have trouble admitting they have a problem,"" says Dr. Caroline Bader, a geriatric psychiatrist with Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""But it's a common and treatable problem, and older people should know they are not alone and do not need to suffer in silence.""
        Facing new life changes
        Older adults often resist the reality of depression because they write it off as just another health problem that comes with age, which isn't necessarily true. ""It's not a normal part of aging to feel depressed,"" says Dr. Bader.
        While depression affects both genders, older men in particular can be more vulnerable. Today's older men were typically breadwinners for much of their lives, so their energy, purpose, and identity were wrapped up in work.
        But now, in retirement, many have lost that sense of self, according to Dr. Bader. ""It's a huge change for many men, and they don't know how to fill that space,"" she says. ""This can lead to a sense of purposelessness and hopelessness that often contributes to depression.""
        Seeking treatment
        The first step toward facing depression is to recognize the symptoms and not ignore them (see ""Look for the signs""). Speak with your doctor if any of these apply to you. He or she can offer a diagnosis and prescribe antidepressants if needed. Many people respond well to medication and may prefer this course of treatment.
        ""Opening up to friends and family also can help you gain perspective on whether depression symptoms have become a problem in your life and you need to seek more help,"" says Dr. Bader.
        
          
            
              
                Look for the signs
                If you experience several of the following most days for at least two weeks, you may have depression and should seek help:
                
                  loss of enjoyment in favorite activities
                  persistent sad or ""empty"" mood
                  increased boredom and apathy
                  fatigue or loss of energy
                  restlessness or irritability
                  insomnia or spending too much time in bed
                  feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
                  trouble concentrating or making decisions
                  unintentional weight gain or loss.
                
              
            
          
        
        There are other ways to address and manage your symptoms. Here are some strategies you can try. ""When you recognize depression as something real and treatable, you can begin to improve many aspects of your life,"" says Dr. Bader.
        Make small changes. Adding regular structure to your daily life can help ward off and even treat many common symptoms. ""You don't have to make sweeping changes,"" says Dr. Bader. ""Small adjustments can often have a significant impact."" For example, make daily exercise a priority (like a 10-minute walk), get involved in your religious community, or volunteer. Even during a pandemic, you can join virtual religious services, or volunteer by making phone calls or partaking in a letter-writing campaign for an organization or charity. ""This helps create a greater sense of purpose,"" says Dr. Bader.
        Try mindfulness or meditation. These practices teach you to manage stress that can exacerbate or lead to depression symptoms. Many online instructions and apps show you the basics. Some examples include Calm, Ten Percent Happier, and Headspace, all of which offer free trials.
        Explore online psychotherapy. The pandemic has led to a surge in telehealth, especially online therapy. ""Talk therapy can be a positive experience for many and helps address issues that are triggering symptoms,"" says Dr. Bader. ""Plus, this approach can be an option for men who are more reluctant to do in-person therapy."" Ask your doctor to recommend a mental health expert, and inquire about online sessions. If the therapist doesn't offer them, ask for names of colleagues who do.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/stretching-to-help-arthritis-pain,Stretching to help arthritis pain,"If you're experiencing arthritis, you shouldn't let the pain keep you from staying physically active. When arthritis makes movement painful, it's only natural to try to avoid it. Yet if you keep an arthritic joint bent rather than moving through its range of motion, you allow muscles to stiffen in that position. Over time, the muscles actually shorten, curtailing range of motion and causing other problems. That can lead to a host of other problems, including weight gain, difficulty walking, and poor balance. 
        A regular stretching routine can help you avoid this vicious cycle. Doctors and physical therapists often prescribe stretching as part of a treatment plan to help maintain or reclaim abilities and ease discomfort. Stretches can also help improve range of motion in people with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease. 
        If you have arthritis, it's best to talk to your doctor before starting any exercise routine, including a stretching routine. Once you get the okay, try these tips to help you get started:
        
          Warm up thoroughly. Take extra time to warm up before you stretch. A hot shower or bath, a heated pool, or even warm compresses or a heating pad can also relax stiff joints before you stretch.
          Stretch during your least painful time of day. Morning won't work for some people, since that's when their joints are stiffest. You might do your stretches when pain relievers are at their peak effectiveness.
          Adapt stretches. Use pillows or rolled-up towels to adjust your range of motion in each stretch. Choose seated stretches, if necessary.
          Expect some discomfort. While you should stretch only to the point of mild tension, not pain, you may experience some discomfort. Try this guideline: if discomfort following stretches or other activities lasts longer than two hours, or is more severe than your usual pain, ease up on your routine. Try holding each stretch for less time. As stretching becomes easier, gradually step it up again.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/postpartum-depression-a-to-z,Postpartum depression,"What is postpartum depression?
        Postpartum refers to the period immediately after childbirth. When a woman has significant symptoms of depression during this period, she is said to have postpartum depression.
        Postpartum depression is not the same as the ""baby blues,"" a much more common condition that affects as many as 85% of new mothers. New moms often are emotionally sensitive and tend to cry easily. The baby blues is uncomfortable, but usually doesn't interfere with functioning as a mother, and it almost always goes away within a few weeks.
        Postpartum depression is a different matter. It affects up to 15% of new mothers. It may begin at any time in the first two to three months after giving birth. The mother feels sad or hopeless and sometimes guilty or worthless. She is unable to concentrate and unable to take any interest in anything, even the baby. In some cases, the mother may feel overwhelmed by the baby's needs and become intensely anxious. This may lead to persistent troubling thoughts or obsessions about the baby's well-being and compulsive repetitive actions, such as checking on the baby constantly or phoning the pediatrician repeatedly to ask questions.
        A woman is more likely to develop postpartum depression if she has:
        
          a previous history of depression, including depression during pregnancy
          a troubled marriage
          very few supportive family members or friends
          a recent stress
          difficulty caring for her new infant, especially if the child has serious medical problems.
        
        Teenage mothers, particularly if they come from families with few economic resources, have a particularly high risk of postpartum depression.
        In a rare form of this disorder, which occurs in one out of 1,000 births, the mother becomes psychotic — that is, she is unable to recognize reality. This condition is sometimes called postpartum psychosis. The mother may have hallucinations (altered perceptions, for example, hearing or smelling things that are not there) or delusions (false beliefs, such as the idea that her baby is possessed by the devil).
        This condition is most commonly associated with bipolar disorder. It is extremely dangerous for both the mother and the baby. And once it has happened it is highly likely to happen again if the mother has another child.
        Researchers have many reasons to assume that biological changes contribute to these mood problems. In the weeks after delivery, significant swings occur in sex hormone levels and in the regulation of stress hormones. In postpartum depression, perhaps as a response to the hormonal shifts, there may be subtle changes in the parts of the brain that process emotion and in the brain regions responsible for managing social interactions. These changes are important not just for the mother, but also for the new baby.
        Fewer than half of women with postpartum depression seek treatment for the problem. Some new mothers are unaware that postpartum depression is a real, treatable illness. Others believe that they are expected to feel happy after having a baby, and are so embarrassed about their symptoms that they do not ask for help.
        Symptoms of postpartum depression
        A woman with postpartum depression can have any of the following symptoms:
        
          feeling depressed, with tearfulness or crying spells
          feeling anxious, sometimes with obsessions and compulsions, often about the baby's welfare or about being able to carry out responsibilities as a mother
          feeling hopeless, worthless, or guilty
          feeling irritable or burdened
          losing interest or pleasure in all activities, including pleasure in being a mother
          changes in appetite (either overeating or not eating enough)
          sleep problems (for example, difficulty falling asleep or waking especially early)
          appearing slowed or agitated
          extreme exhaustion beyond the normal fatigue caused by caring for a newborn
          poor concentration or indecisiveness
          persistent thoughts about death, including suicide
          difficulty caring for the baby.
        
        These symptoms may develop in the first days after birth or as long as three months later.
        Diagnosing postpartum depression
        Primary care physicians, obstetrician/gynecologists and pediatricians may screen for postpartum depression by asking questions about the mother's quality of life. If you are a new mother, your doctor may ask about your emotions, your sleep and your appetite. You may be asked two questions for screening purposes:
        
          Have you felt down, depressed or hopeless?
          Do you feel little interest or pleasure in doing things?
        
        Another scale frequently used for screening is the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This is a 10-question scale that you can answer to give you and your doctor a measure of how depressed you might be. The scale with instructions is freely available online.
        If your primary care doctor or obstetrician/gynecologist believes you have symptoms of postpartum depression, and these symptoms have lasted for several weeks without improving, he or she may offer you an antidepressant or refer you to a psychiatrist or other mental health clinician for further evaluation. If your doctor is concerned that some of your symptoms may be caused by a medical illness, he or she may order blood tests to check for such conditions as anemia or an underactive thyroid.
        Expected duration of postpartum depression
        Usually, symptoms of postpartum depression last for a few weeks before the condition is diagnosed. Without treatment, symptoms can last for months. With treatment, many women feel better within weeks.
        Preventing postpartum depression
        If you are pregnant, you may be able to decrease your risk of postpartum depression by preparing yourself before the birth for the changes in lifestyle that motherhood will bring. Talk to other mothers and to your doctor in very practical, day-to-day terms about what it's like to care for an infant. Don't underestimate how much time you'll need with your newborn. Clear out as much time as you can during the period after birth. Also, don't hesitate to ask for help from your partner and others who care about you.
        Often, postpartum depression is difficult to combat without antidepressant treatment. If you have a history of depression, postpartum depression or bipolar disorder, you should talk with your doctor before the birth about the possibility of starting antidepressant medication soon after your baby is born. As a general rule, doctors try to minimize the amount of medication prescribed during pregnancy, but sometimes the risks of depression are more significant than the risk to the fetus. It is very important to discuss these trade-offs with your doctor.
        Treating postpartum depression
        As with other types of depression, a combination of psychotherapy and medication is most helpful. If a mother is exhibiting signs of psychosis, she needs immediate medical attention.
        A number of psychotherapy techniques have been proven helpful depending on the nature of the stress, the cause of the depression and personal preference. Every woman with postpartum depression needs support as well as education about depression. Various types of psychological therapy are available.
        
          Cognitive behavioral therapy is designed to examine and to help correct faulty, self-critical thought patterns.
          Psychodynamic, insight-oriented, or interpersonal psychotherapy can help a person sort out conflicts in important relationships or explore past events or issues that may have contributed to the symptoms.
          Couples therapy can help the mother and father figure out how to manage possible areas of disagreement or how best to organize child care and muster support.
        
        The antidepressants used for treating other types of depression are also effective for postpartum depression. Among others, the choices include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine. As with depression treatment in general, there are many medication options available. The treatment you choose will be influenced by such factors as potential side effects or past treatments.
        If you are breastfeeding, you are likely to have questions about the possibility of passing medication to your newborn. There are wide variations in the concentration of antidepressant in breast milk, depending on such things as the dose, your metabolism and when your baby feeds. Fortunately, most studies show little effect on the baby. Many mothers do choose to take antidepressants, but it is important to discuss the choices with your doctors to assess the risks and the benefits in your situation.
        You may begin to feel relief soon after starting treatment, but it usually takes at least two to six weeks before a clear improvement can be seen. You may need to try a few different approaches to psychotherapy or medication before you find the method most helpful to you. Keep trying until you get the help you need.
        When to call a professional
        If you are a new mother, contact your doctor if you develop any symptoms of postpartum depression, especially anxiety, feelings of intense sadness or hopelessness, or difficulty sleeping. Call your doctor immediately if you have thoughts about harming yourself or the baby, or if you feel that you can no longer cope with caring for your new baby.
        Prognosis
        Most mothers with postpartum depression recover completely. This is especially true if the illness is diagnosed and treated early. About 50% of women who recover from postpartum depression develop the illness again after future pregnancies. To decrease this risk, some doctors suggest that women with a history of postpartum depression should start antidepressants immediately after the baby is delivered, before the onset of depression symptoms.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/melanoma-a-to-z,Melanoma,"What is melanoma?
        Melanoma is cancer of the cells (melanocytes) that give skin its color. It develops when these cells change and reproduce aggressively. The number of cases of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is increasing faster than any other cancer.
        Doctors aren't completely sure why melanoma rates are soaring. It could be from spending too much time in the sun during outdoor activities. It could also be due to global changes, such as the depletion of the ozone, which absorbs many of the sun's harmful rays.
        Your pattern of sun exposure appears to affect your risk of developing melanoma more than the total amount of sun exposure in your lifetime. Short bursts of intense sun seem most dangerous, especially if you get sunburned. Being out in the sun can cause changes (mutations) in skin cells' genes.
        The most common type of melanoma spreads on the skin's surface. It is called superficial spreading melanoma. It may stay on the surface or grow down into deeper tissues. Other types of melanoma can start anywhere on or inside the body.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        Your risk of developing melanoma is higher if you have:
        
          red or blond hair
          green or blue eyes
          fair skin
          a history of being in the sun a lot, especially as a child
          a mother, father, sister or brother with melanoma. If one of these relatives has melanoma, you are eight times more likely to develop it.
        
        Features of freckles or moles that raise your risk of melanoma include:
        
          a new mole appearing after age 30
          a new mole at any age if it is in an area rarely exposed to the sun
          a change in an existing mole
          one or more atypical moles — moles that look like a fried egg, or moles that are darker than others or have irregular borders or an irregular shape
          20 or more moles larger than 2 millimeters across
          5 or more moles larger than 5 millimeters across (larger than a pencil eraser)
          freckles caused by being in the sun.
        
        Symptoms of melanoma
        Melanoma is usually visible as a single dark skin spot. It may appear anywhere on the body, but it most commonly develops on the back, chest, and legs. Most of the time, melanoma develops on normal-looking skin, but it can grow out of an existing mole.
        Watch a mole for the A, , C, D and Es of melanoma:
        
          Asymmetry (one side doesn't match the other)
          Border irregularities
          Colors or shades of skin that are different within the same mole
          Diameter larger than 6 millimeters (larger than a pencil eraser)
          Evolving (a newly developing mole).
        
        A mole that bleeds, feels numb, or has a crusty surface may also hint at melanoma.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        Diagnosing melanoma
        If your doctor thinks a mole may be melanoma, he or she will do a biopsy of the skin or refer you to a specialist for the procedure.
        Before the biopsy, your doctor will check for enlarged lymph nodes close to the mole. If you have a melanoma, enlarged lymph nodes can mean that the cancer has spread. After a skin biopsy, nearby lymph nodes can swell because the skin incision is healing.
        In a biopsy, a doctor removes a piece of tissue and examines it in a laboratory. Based on this report, your doctor can then determine the thickness of the melanoma and how deep the cancer has grown below the skin's surface. That's the most important factor in predicting whether it can be cured.
        Melanomas deeper than 1 millimeter are more likely to have spread to other parts of the body. Your doctor may suggest additional tests including:
        
          blood tests
          imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans and MRIs
          additional biopsies.
        
        If the cancer is advanced, the biopsy sample of your melanoma may be tested to see if it has one of the gene mutations common in melanoma. Some melanoma treatments have been designed to attack specific genetic subtypes of this cancer.
        Expected duration of melanoma
        Melanoma can usually be cured if it is removed when the tumor has not gone deep into the skin. More advanced melanoma requires longer treatment. If you have one melanoma, you are at risk of developing another, so have a doctor examine your skin regularly. About 1 out of 20 people who have a melanoma will develop a second melanoma within 20 years.
        Preventing melanoma
        To reduce your risk of melanoma, stay out of the sun. A bad sunburn is a major risk factor. Spending a lot of time in the sun as a child may pose the greatest risk. To be safe in the sun, take these steps:
        
          Apply plenty of sunscreen and apply it frequently. It should:
	have a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30provide broad spectrum coverage against both UVA and UVB raysbe water resistant.
          Wear protective sunglasses, clothing (long sleeves and long pants) and wide-brimmed hats.
          Stay out of the sun when it is strongest (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.).
          Ask your doctor if any medications you take could make your skin more likely to be damaged by the sun.
          Avoid tanning salons. If you want to look tan, use sunless tanning creams. They are available in department and drug stores.
        
        Melanoma is often easy to spot early, because it can be seen on your skin. If you are at risk of developing melanoma, ask your doctor to examine your skin. Also ask your doctor how often you should have your skin checked.
        Your doctor will pay special attention to any atypical looking moles. Because some melanomas can arise from existing moles, your doctor may remove atypical moles. These moles may be more likely to become cancerous. Alternatively, your doctor may take pictures of your moles. He or she can compare the photos to your moles in the future to see if they have changed.
        Examine your skin regularly, especially if you have risk factors for melanoma. Use a full-length and hand-held mirror. Have someone examine your scalp using a blow dryer to part your hair. That person can also examine your back and other areas that you can't easily see. Watch for new moles and changes in existing ones. Keep an eye on moles that you've had since birth; these moles may be more likely to turn into melanoma.
        Treating melanoma
        Major advances have been made in the treatment of melanoma.
        Surgery is the initial treatment for melanoma that appears in just one spot. The doctor removes the visible tumor along with 1 to 2.5 centimeters of healthy skin around the tumor, depending on the size of the tumor. (Nearby skin can contain microscopic bits of the cancer.)
        In some cases, the doctor may perform a specialized procedure during which the tumor is shaved away one thin layer at a time. Each layer is examined under the microscope as it is removed. This technique helps the doctor remove as little healthy skin as possible.
        If the melanoma is more than 1 millimeter deep, your doctor will want to know if the melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes. To do this, he or she may inject a radioactive liquid into the tumor. The liquid flows through the natural drainage pathway that connects the tumor to nearby lymph nodes.
        The drainage path can be tracked, and the first lymph node along the path is called the sentinel node. This node is removed and examined for cancer cells. If the sentinel node has no cancer, the other nodes are most often cancer-free.
        If cancer is found in the sentinel node, most often all the lymph nodes in the area will be removed. However, it's not been absolutely proven that removing all lymph nodes improves survival. Although spreading cancer cells might be removed, cells that are fighting the cancer also are removed.
        When cancer has spread to one or two other sites only, surgical removal similar to what was done the first time can improve survival.
        Additional therapies can often help people with thicker tumors that have grown deep into the skin and/or spread to more areas of the body. The cancer cells are tested for certain specific markers. The results guide the type of therapy that has the greatest chance of improving quality of life and survival.
        Most often patients are treated with immunotherapy and/or drugs designed to block major pathways that allow cancers to grow. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are less effective. But they can be used when other therapies don't work or stop working.
        When to call a professional
        Early treatment of melanoma is crucial. If you detect any of the ABCDE signs or see any suspicious skin changes, call your doctor right away. If you delay, melanoma can spread. If melanoma runs in your family, of if you have other risk factors, be especially alert. Have your doctor examine your skin regularly.
        Prognosis
        Five key factors help to determine how serious melanoma is:
        
          tumor thickness — How deep it goes into the skin
          location — Melanoma on the arms or legs may not be as serious as a tumor somewhere else on the body
          age — People older than 60 are in more danger
          gender — Males are more likely to die of the disease
          spreading of the tumor — Twenty percent of people with melanoma have cancer in lymph nodes when their cancer is diagnosed.
        
        The thickness of the tumor is the most important factor in determining whether it can be treated. Tumors on the skin's surface usually can be cured. Deeper cancers are more difficult, sometimes impossible, to treat. If melanoma cells break away and spread to organs such as the lungs, liver or brain, the cancer can be cured in only a small number of patients.
        If treatment begins when the tumor is less than 0.75 millimeters deep, the chance of a cure is excellent. More than 95% of people with small melanomas are cancer-free as long as 8 years later. However, for deeper melanomas, the survival rate is variable.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/car-t-immunotherapy-for-prostate-cancer-202409163070,CAR-T immunotherapy for prostate cancer?,"By fighting off pathogens, the specialized cells of our immune systems help to keep us healthy and free of infectious diseases. Immunotherapies teach those same cells to recognize and destroy cancer. The drugs have been remarkably successful in treating melanoma — a type of skin cancer — as well as cancers of the lung, bladder, kidneys, and blood. Just one form of immunotherapy, a type of cancer vaccine, is currently approved for prostate cancer.
        A new approach
        Researchers at City of Hope Hospital in Duarte, California, are now reporting promising results with a different method called CAR-T cell therapy. It involves engineering immune cells called T cells after they've been obtained from a patient's own body. The engineered cells are studded with proteins called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that bind to specific molecular targets (antigens) on cancer cells.
        Upon being returned to the body, the engineered CAR-T cells kill tumor cells expressing their target antigen. CAR-T cell treatments are currently approved only for blood cancers. The treatments can be highly effective against these diseases, but they also have challenging side effects, including in some cases a widespread inflammatory reaction known as cytokine release syndrome.
        During their investigation, the researchers engineered CAR-T cells that bind specifically to a protein called prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA). PSCA is preferentially expressed at high levels in prostate tumors, particularly during advanced disease stages and after the cancer has spread to the bones.
        The investigators treated 14 patients, all of them diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer that was no longer responding to hormonal therapy. Each patient was treated with 100 million CAR-T cells either with or without an additional treatment used to prevent a patient's other T cells from interfering in the anticancer attack. This other treatment is called lymphodepletion.
        What the study showed
        Results were encouraging: In four patients, levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) — which drop when prostate tumors shrink — declined by 30% or more. One patient had a greater than 90% decline in PSA during the 28-day monitoring period, as well as shrinking cancer in his bones and soft tissue. That positive response lasted for eight months. Five patients had mild cytokine release syndrome that was effectively treated, and two patients experienced cystitis, which is irritation of the bladder.
        Unfortunately, the CAR-T cells did not persist at high levels beyond the monitoring period, and that could limit the treatment's effectiveness. The team plans to explore strategies to extend CAR-T-benefits in upcoming research.
        Prostate cancer tends to be immunologically ""cold,"" meaning that it's well hidden from the immune system. Most immunotherapies have therefore met with limited success against prostate cancer. But CAR-T offers a more powerful approach to overcoming tumor defenses, according to Dr. Tanya Dorff, a medical oncologist at City of Hope and the study's first author.
        Observations
        Dr. David Einstein, a medical oncologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, points out that lymphodepletion can leave some patients vulnerable to infections. Given the added risk of cytokine release syndrome, CAR-T cell therapy will likely be suitable ""only for a selected group of patients,"" he says.
        ""This is a different and more intensive treatment experience than hormonal therapy and even chemotherapy,"" he says. Still, he says, the results suggest that CAR-T therapy may emerge as an additional immunotherapeutic option for men with prostate cancer.
        ""This research is very encouraging,"" says Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases. ""It represents the beginning of a completely novel method to eliminate cancer cells which have spread beyond the prostate gland, independent of the traditional methods for prostate cancer elimination that include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and various methods of radiation therapy.
        ""Because the CAR-T program uses a novel and exciting way of eliminating cancer cells, more work will be needed to help understand both the mechanism by which this occurs, and as Dr. Einstein emphasizes, methods to lessen the side effects associated with this new technology.""",Charlie Schmidt,"September 16, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/insomnia-a-to-z,Insomnia,"What is insomnia?
        Insomnia is difficulty getting enough sleep or trouble sleeping without interruption. You may have difficulty falling asleep, may wake up too early, or may wake up periodically during the night. Insomnia of any kind can keep you from feeling rested and refreshed during the day.
        Almost all of us have episodes of insomnia at some time, but insomnia is not a short-term problem for everyone. Insomnia is classified as chronic when it happens almost every night for at least one month. Insomnia can be related to a medical or psychiatric illness, can be caused by mental stress or excitement, or can be caused by your daytime and bedtime habits.
        Your habits and surroundings are the usual causes of short-term insomnia problems. Factors that contribute to insomnia can include:
        
          stress or anxiety
          a change in sleeping environment (being a guest at a hotel or a relative's home)
          an uncomfortable sleeping environment (too hot, too cold, too bright, too noisy)
          an uncomfortable mattress
          pajamas that are too tight
          having a bed partner who snores or has disruptive sleep patterns
          watching television, reading a book or problem-solving in your bed, so your brain associates lying down in bed without activities other than sleeping
          eating a heavy meal before bedtime
          taking a prescription medication that has insomnia as a side effect
          drinking alcoholic beverages before bedtime
          having a high intake of beverages containing caffeine (coffee, tea, cola) during the day
          cigarette smoking
          exercising immediately before bedtime
          not exercising enough during the day, so you have energy to spare
          taking a hot bath or shower before bed
          traveling to a different time zone
          traveling to a much higher altitude
          shift work.
        
        Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to insomnia. Women who are pregnant may have insomnia because of hormone changes, heartburn, leg cramps or a need to urinate more frequently. In addition, the unborn baby's increasing size often makes it harder for the mother to find a comfortable sleeping position.
        Chronic insomnia may be caused by a medical or psychiatric problem. Some common causes of chronic insomnia include:
        
          psychiatric illness, especially depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
          chronic medical illnesses, especially kidney disease, heart failure or asthma
          painful illnesses, especially arthritis, neuropathy, acid reflux or cancer
          hormone imbalance, especially menopause or hyperthyroidism
          taking a prescription medicine that has insomnia as a side effect
          restless legs syndrome: this disorder causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs. Symptoms can include twitching of the legs, a habit of repetitive leg movements, and leg cramps.
          obstructive sleep apnea.
        
        Sleep apnea is a common condition. However, often the people that have this problem don't realize it. Snorers or people who are overweight may have repeated episodes in which breathing stops for 10 seconds to 30 seconds during sleep, just when the person is relaxing into deep sleep.
        Sleep apnea is caused most often by relaxing the tongue and throat tissues, which can settle into a position that closes your airway. Your body reacts to sleep apnea by releasing adrenaline-like ""alarm"" hormones so you will awaken and resume breathing. These hormones keep you awake for periods of the night.
        Symptoms of insomnia
        Symptoms of insomnia can include:
        
          difficulty falling asleep
          waking up periodically during the night
          waking up in the early morning, but not feeling rested
          feeling tired and irritable during the day
          having trouble concentrating.
        
        Diagnosing insomnia
        Your doctor often can determine the cause of your insomnia by asking about your habits and sleep environment, by reviewing your symptoms, and by examining you. Your doctor may suggest that you keep a sleep diary (a log of your sleep patterns) to provide an exact record of how many hours you sleep, whether symptoms may be your trigger for awakenings, and at what times you wake up.
        If your doctor suspects that a medical illness is causing your insomnia, you may need additional tests. In some patients, an overnight sleep study at a sleep clinic may be necessary. During a sleep study, your brain waves, breathing pattern and oxygen levels can be monitored, and your body movements can be observed.
        Expected duration of insomnia
        Insomnia may last only one or two nights, or it may continue for weeks, months or years. How long insomnia lasts depends on its cause, and on the success of lifestyle changes and treatment.
        Preventing insomnia
        It helps to have habits that promote healthy sleep:
        
          Follow a regular sleep schedule. Have a routine bedtime and wake up at roughly the same hour each morning.
          Sleep in loose, comfortable clothes in a comfortable bed.
          Eliminate any sources of noise or bright lights that prevent or disrupt sleep. If noise from outside your bedroom can't be eliminated, it might help if you drown out that noise by creating a monotonous noise of your own. Use a fan, a channel with static noise on your radio, or a recording of ocean waves to make a noise that can lull you to sleep.
          Maintain a comfortable temperature in your bedroom.
          Cut down on beverages containing caffeine during the day, since the stimulating effects of caffeine can last for many hours.
          Avoid heavy meals before bedtime.
          Eliminate alcohol, since many people experience wakefulness as the effect of the alcohol wears off.
          Exercise daily, preferably early in the day.
          If you read before bed, do this in a chair or in another room.
          Consider sleeping in a separate bed or separate room if your partner keeps you awake.
        
        If you have chronic insomnia because of chronic pain, medical illness or psychiatric problems, seek prompt treatment for your health problem. Don't assume that insomnia is an unavoidable part of your illness.
        Treating insomnia
        Changes in your bedtime surroundings and habits that can promote sleep are usually the most important way to manage insomnia.
        Behavioral therapies also may be used to treat some patients with insomnia. These therapies include:
        
          Relaxation therapy — Special techniques to quiet the mind and relax the muscles
          Sleep restriction — A program that at first permits only a few hours of sleep per night, then gradually increases the nightly sleeping time
          Reconditioning — A program that teaches the patient to associate the bed only with sleeping (and sexual activity) by having the patient go to bed only when sleepy and avoid daytime naps
        
        If insomnia is one of the symptoms of a medical disorder, treating the underlying problem may be all that you need. For example, treating restless legs syndrome with specific medication or sleep apnea with a special mask can markedly improve quality of sleep.
        Your doctor may prescribe sleeping pills for short term or occasional use. Today there are a wide variety of medications to choose from. Some act quickly and are most helpful if you have trouble falling asleep. Others have a longer duration of action when the problem is staying asleep. Many of the medications are available as generics, which tend to be much less expensive. Older people should avoid the longer acting drugs because the sedation can last much longer than eight or nine hours.
        Melatonin, a dietary supplement, works for some people and not others. It has a good safety profile when used in the doses directed on the label.
        When to call a professional
        Call your doctor if you are worried about sleeping problems, especially if insufficient sleep or disturbed sleep is interfering with your ability to function normally during the day. Insomnia is an urgent medical problem if sleep problems are making it unsafe for you to drive a car or to perform potentially dangerous tasks at work.
        Prognosis
        In many people with insomnia, normal sleep patterns return within a few days, especially if a lifestyle issue (stress, a habit of heavy meals before bed, a change in time zones) disappears or is modified.
        In people with chronic insomnia, the outlook depends on the underlying problem. In people with obstructive sleep apnea, most experience relief when they use a nighttime nose mask that provides modest continuous air pressure through the mouth and nose. This mask must be prescribed by a doctor.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-sore-throat-checklist-what-parents-need-to-know-202109132586,The sore throat checklist: What parents need to know,"Sore throats happen to children all the time — and most of the time, they are nothing to worry about. Sometimes, though, parents do need to worry. Here's what parents should know about sore throats.
        Signs that a sore throat could be an emergency
        First and most important, here's when a sore throat could be a sign of a real emergency:
        
          When your child has any trouble breathing. The sore throat could be a sign of a swelling or blockage in the respiratory system.
          When your child is having trouble swallowing, especially if they are drooling. This also could be a sign of dangerous swelling or blockage.
          When your child has a high fever that won't go down, or unusual sleepiness. A temperature of 102° F or higher that won't go down with acetaminophen or ibuprofen, or unusual sleepiness, could be a sign of a serious infection.
          When your child has severe, unrelenting pain. That kind of pain, anywhere, warrants immediate attention.
        
        If any of those happen, you should take your child to the nearest emergency room.
        More common reasons for sore throats in children
        Luckily, such emergencies are rare. Sore throats can be caused by many things, including:
        
          Viral infections. It's most likely a virus if along with the sore throat your child has a runny nose and cough, perhaps with body aches, fever, an upset stomach, or diarrhea. Many different viruses can cause these symptoms, including flu and COVID, along with more garden variety ones like rhinovirus, which causes the common cold. If your child has a sore throat that doesn't go away easily with something to drink and some distraction, check in with your doctor about whether any testing might be warranted.
          Allergies. Sore throats often come along with allergies, especially when stuffy noses lead to mouth breathing, which leads to a dry mouth. It can be hard to tell the difference between allergies and a virus. If the sore throat is mild and accompanied by a stuffy nose, sneezing, and some itchy eyes, chances are it's allergies. If you aren't sure, check with your doctor.
          Bacterial infections such as strep throat. It's more likely to be a bacterial infection if there is fever and there's no runny nose or cough. Sometimes children with strep throat will also have a headache, stomachache, and a sandpapery rash, as well as a voice that sounds like they are holding a hot potato in their mouth.
          Irritants that are inhaled or swallowed. Exposure to irritants in the air, like air pollution, can cause a sore throat — as can swallowing anything that irritates the throat, like acids. Be sure to keep all dangerous things out of your child's reach. Call your doctor or a Poison Center (800-222-1222) if you think your child has gotten into anything.
          Gastroesophageal reflux. When acid comes up from the stomach, it can lead to a sore throat. If your child has problems with stomachaches and/or heartburn along with the sore throat, that may be the cause. Talk to your doctor about this.
        
        Preventing sore throats
        To help prevent the infections that can cause sore throats, it's always a good idea to
        
          wash your hands regularly (or use hand sanitizer if soap and water isn't available)
          avoid touching your face
          wipe down public surfaces before touching them
          do your best to stay away from sick people
          Get vaccinated against flu and COVID every year.
        
        As we learned during the COVID pandemic, wearing a mask can be very helpful when it comes to preventing infection. If you have to be around sick people, or are going to be around a lot of people and don't want to get sick, you might consider wearing a mask.","Claire McCarthy, MD","September 12, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-to-help-your-child-get-the-sleep-they-need-202008312264,How to help your child get the sleep they need,"It's tempting at this time of year to let summer sleep schedules stay in place or let bedtimes slide, especially when parents feel tired out, too. But it's important that children have a regular routine — and that they are sleeping during the dark hours and awake during the light ones, as our bodies do best that way.
        That's true for families who are home-schooling, as well: even when the trip to school is just a walk to the kitchen table, allowing for more sleep than those catching an early bus may get, no child should be spending all morning in bed.
        Sleep is crucial for all of us, and this is particularly true for children. Without enough quality sleep, children are more likely to have health and behavioral problems — and difficulty learning. Here are a few simple things you can do to help your child get the sleep they need.
        Have a regular schedule
        Our bodies do best when we go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time every day.
        
          Children and teens need eight to 10 hours of sleep. Count back 10 hours from when your child needs to get up in the morning. That's roughly the time they need to be getting ready for bed (for younger children, count back 11 hours).
          For example, if your teen needs to be up at 7, then they should be getting ready for bed by 9, and in bed by 10 (since most of us don't fall asleep the moment our head hits the pillow). A younger child should start getting ready (bathing, etc.) by around 8.
          Understand that teens are biologically wired to fall asleep later and wake up later and will naturally have later bedtimes. Unfortunately, most school districts don't accommodate to this, so you are often working against biology.
          While it's okay to stay up a bit later on weekends, don't let the bedtime vary by more than an hour or so.
        
        Turn off the screens before bed
        The blue light emitted by screens can keep us awake.
        
          It's best if the screens can be off two hours before you want your child asleep. Use that time when they start getting ready for bed as the time that the screens go off.
          The only real way to achieve this is to get all devices out of the bedroom.
          Teens will fight you on this. If you can, hold firm (and buy them an alarm clock if they say they need their phone for this). At the very least, be sure that the phone is on Do Not Disturb mode overnight.
        
        Have an environment that encourages sleep
        
          Quiet things down. If you are watching TV, turn the volume down, and in general try to not make much noise after children go to bed.
          Consider a white noise machine or a fan (or air conditioner if you live somewhere warm). There are also white noise apps for those teens who won't give up their phones.
          Room-darkening curtains can make a difference for children who tend to wake up at the first light of dawn — or who can't fall asleep if it's not fully dark outside.
        
        Know how other factors influence sleep
        
          Busy teens often have difficulty getting everything done in time to get enough sleep. Talk with your teen about their daily schedule and look for ways to help them get more shut-eye, such as getting homework done during the school day, or limiting video games or other activities that eat into homework time. Sleep needs to be the priority.
          Limit caffeine. It's best not to have any, but certainly nothing from mid-afternoon on.
          Limit naps! For a tired older child naps may seem like a good idea, but they can interfere with nighttime sleep. Naptime is okay through preschool.
          Make sure your child gets exercise. It's not only important for their health, it helps their sleep.
          Have calming routines before bed (not exercise!).
        
        If your child is having trouble falling asleep, or is waking up at night, talk to your doctor. It's also important to talk to your doctor if your child is snoring or having other breathing problems at night. Don't ever ignore a sleep problem; always ask for help.","Claire McCarthy, MD","September 12, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/gratitude-enhances-health-brings-happiness-and-may-even-lengthen-lives-202409113071,"Gratitude enhances health, brings happiness — and may even lengthen lives","Several evenings a week, as Tyler VanderWeele gathers around the dinner table with his wife and two young kids, the family deliberately pauses during the meal to do something simple but profound. Each member shares several things for which they're grateful — an act that VanderWeele, co-director of the Initiative on Health, Spirituality, and Religion at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, feels changes his family dynamic for the better.
        ""I do think it makes a difference and can be a very powerful practice,"" he says. ""Even on those bad days where life seems difficult, that effort is worthwhile.""
        Gratitude, health, and longevity
        How can the power of gratitude affect our lives? Recent research has pointed to gratitude's myriad positive health effects, including greater emotional and social well-being, better sleep quality, lower depression risks, and favorable markers of cardiovascular health. Now, new data from the long-term Nurses' Health Study shows that it may extend lives.
        ""Gratitude has been one of the most widely studied activities contributing to well-being, but we couldn't find a single prior study that looked at its effects on mortality and longevity, much to our surprise,"" says VanderWeele, co-author of the new research.
        What did the study look at?
        Published July 2024 in JAMA Psychiatry, the new study drew on data from 49,275 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. Their average age was 79. In 2016, participants completed a six-item gratitude questionnaire in which they ranked their agreement with statements such as, ""I have so much in life to be thankful for,"" and ""If I had to list everything I felt grateful for, it would be a very long list.""
        Four years later, researchers combed through participants' medical records to determine who had died. There were 4,608 deaths from all causes, as well as from specific causes such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory diseases, neurodegenerative disease, infection, and injury. Deaths from cardiovascular disease — a top killer of women and men in the United States — were the most common cause.
        What did the researchers find?
        Participants with gratitude scores in the highest third at the study's start had a 9% lower risk of dying over the following four years than participants who scored in the bottom third. This did not change after controlling for physical health, economic circumstances, and other aspects of mental health and well-being. Gratitude seemed to help protect participants from every cause of death studied — including cardiovascular disease.
        But what does this actually mean?
        ""A 9% reduction in mortality risk is meaningful, but not huge,"" VanderWeele says. ""But what's remarkable about gratitude is that just about anyone can practice it. Anyone can recognize what's around them and express thanks to others for what's good in their life.""
        While the study couldn't pinpoint why gratitude is associated with longer life, VanderWeele believes several factors may contribute.
        ""We know that gratitude makes people feel happier. That in itself has a small effect on mortality risk,"" he says. ""Practicing gratitude may also make someone a bit more motivated to take care of their health. Maybe they're more likely to show up for medical appointments or exercise. It may also help with relationships and social support, which we know contribute to health.""
        What are the study's limitations and strengths?
        The study was observational. This means it can't prove that gratitude helps people live longer — only that an association exists. And the particular sample of people analyzed is both the biggest strength and limitation of the research, VanderWeele says. All were older female nurses with high socioeconomic status. The vast majority were white.
        ""Does the longevity effect extend to men, to those who are younger, and to those with lower socioeconomic resources?"" VanderWeele asks. ""Those are all open questions.""
        On the plus side, he says, the study sample's large size is one of its biggest strengths. So is the extensive data gathered on potential confounding factors such as participants' physical health, social characteristics, and other aspects of psychological well-being.
        ""Between the quality of the data and the size of the sample, we were able to provide reasonable evidence for this modest longevity effect,"" he says.
        Try this: Six questions to evoke gratitude
        Not feeling especially grateful today? You have the power to change that. Asking yourself certain questions can evoke gratitude, such as
        
          What happened today that was good?
          What am I taking for granted that I can be thankful for?
          Which people in my life am I grateful for?
          What is the last book I read or movie, show, or social media clip I saw that I really appreciated, and why?
          What am I most looking forward to this week, month, and year, and why?
          What is the kindest thing someone has said or done lately?
        
        Similarly, a few simple actions can infuse gratitude into your days. Try VanderWeele's family routine of regularly expressing gratitude around the dinner table. Another well-known practice — that's perhaps becoming forgotten in this digital age — is penning thank-you notes.
        ""I do think writing a thank-you note or gratitude letter gets your mind to dwell on something positive for a longer period, to think more deeply about it, because you have to put it not just in words, but in writing,"" VanderWeele says. ""It also deepens the relationship and builds that bond.""
        One less-recognized but valuable gratitude practice is called a ""savoring exercise,"" which builds on aspects of mindfulness. All that's required is ""pausing, looking around you, and taking in and enjoying everything that's good in your current setting,"" VanderWeele says. ""It's not a big leap to go from recognizing the good to expressing gratitude for what you have.""",Maureen Salamon,"September 11, 2024"

But dreams are an important part of a sleep stage known as REM sleep. All sleep is important, but REM sleep plays a key role for brain health and function.

What is REM sleep?

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is part of your body's normal sleep cycle. Each of your body's sleep cycles lasts about 80 to 100 minutes. Most of us experience four to six sleep cycles per night. Your first REM episode usually lasts for just a few minutes. They lengthen during each subsequent sleep cycle. Toward the end of the night, you may spend up to half an hour in REM sleep.

REM sleep is when most of your dreams occur. During REM sleep, your heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, and breathing increase. Your eyes move rapidly, even though they are closed. The muscles in your arms and legs also become temporarily unable to move. This prevents you from acting out your dreams as you experience them.

How much REM sleep do you need?

Just like your overall slumber patterns, your REM sleep needs shift as you age. Newborns spend about half their snooze time in REM sleep. This starts to decrease by about 6 months, and continues to decline throughout childhood and the teen years. By age 20, most people spend just over 20% of their total shut-eye time in REM sleep. In older adults, time spent in REM sleep decreases slightly, to about 17% by age 80.

Benefits of REM sleep

Benefits of REM sleep include:


	Improved learning. During REM sleep, your brain prunes its synapses, the spaces in which brain cells communicate with one another. This appears to improve memory and problem-solving abilities.
	Mood regulation. REM sleep helps your brain process emotional memories, including ones associated with fear.
	Brain development. REM sleep is thought to aid in the development of the central nervous system, which includes your brain and spinal cord. That may be one reason why infants, particularly newborns, require so much REM sleep.
	Protection against dementia. People who get less REM sleep may have a greater risk of developing dementia, according to a study published in the journal Neurology. The researchers found that for every 1% reduction in REM sleep, there was a 9% increase in the risk of dementia.


REM sleep is so important that if you don't get enough one night, your body will naturally increase it the next — you'll enter this stage earlier and stay in it for longer. This is known as REM rebound.

How to get a good night's sleep

Sleep is elusive for many of us — over 14% of American adults experience trouble falling asleep most days of the week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most REM sleep occurs at the end of the night, so getting enough total sleep helps to maximize REM sleep.

Here are some tips to help you fall asleep and stay asleep:

Stick to a sleep schedule. Set a regular bedtime and wake-up time and stick to it, even on weekends and when you're on vacation. This will help to regulate your sleep/wake cycle and make it easier for you to drift off at night. If you can't fall asleep within 20 to 30 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room, and do something relaxing like reading or knitting until you feel sleepy again. Don't stay in bed and watch the clock, which can make insomnia worse. If you have trouble sleeping one night, try not to sleep later or nap the next day. Doing so will disrupt your routine. You may be more tired that day, but you will sleep better that night.

Limit alcohol and caffeine. A nightcap may help you nod off, but it suppresses your REM sleep. Caffeine also interferes with a good night's rest because it blocks brain chemicals that promote sleep. A study published in the Journal of Biological Rhythms found that three 150-milligram servings of caffeine a day — the equivalent of about 4-1/2 cups of coffee — affected REM sleep in young healthy men.

Stay active. Exercise itself has been shown to slightly decrease REM sleep. But a 2024 study published in the journal Scientific Reports found that regular physical activity increases the amount of deep, restorative sleep that you get, which in turn boosts mood and energy. Try to exercise outside in the morning, since natural light helps to set your body's sleep/wake cycle.

Relax before bed. Try the following calming rituals an hour or two before bedtime:


	Listen to soft music.
	Take a warm bath or shower.
	Stretch.
	Read. Avoid doing it on your phone or tablet, however, as those devices emit blue light that can interfere with sleep.",Hallie Levine,"September 9, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-to-help-your-preschooler-sleep-alone-202211212853,How to help your preschooler sleep alone,"""Sleep is still most perfect… when it is shared with a beloved,"" wrote D.H. Lawrence, and most young children would agree. But sometimes those beloved — that is, parents — would rather have some privacy and not be woken by a kicking child all night.
        So what can you do?
        Sleep-alone campaign step one: Understanding
        Before you do anything, be sure you understand why your child wants to sleep with you. It's most likely simply because they love you and feel most secure snuggled next to you, but before you work to change the habit, be sure that your child is ready for — and can handle — the change. If your child has been more clingy or irritable than usual, or is having difficult behaviors in any way, touch base with your doctor.
        Sleep-alone campaign step two: Changing habits
        Changing where your child sleeps is changing a habit. When it comes to changing habits, it helps to be practical and — this is really important — consistent. Here are some tips:
        
          Make an appealing sleep space for your child. Not that anything can really take the place of you, but it is certainly easier to get them to stay in their own room or space if they like it there. Work with them to set up and decorate in a way they like.
          As you create the space, keep in mind what keeps your child awake. If it's light, use room-darkening curtains. If it's darkness, think night lights and flashlights. If it's noise, think about getting a white-noise machine. Set your child up for success. Please: no TVs or devices in the bedroom. They get in the way of healthy sleep.
          Have a consistent bedtime. Try not to let your child stay up late — or sleep late — on weekends. This way your child is more likely to be tired when you want them to be tired.
          Have a consistent, calming, and nurturing bedtime routine. Try to lower the energy level, perhaps with a bath and then some snuggling and reading stories. You want to help them wind down, and also be sure they end the day feeling loved.
          If your child has a hard time going to bed alone, it's okay to sit in the room and ease yourself out bit by bit after lights are out (you can literally move closer and closer to the door). Try to gradually shorten the time you are in the room.
          If your child gets out of bed, bring them back to their bed. This is the hard part: your child won't like it, and it can be exhausting for you if they keep creeping out of their bed and into yours. But if you give in and let them stay in your room, they will stay in your room. Every night.
          Use incentives. Make sure your child gets major kudos for any progress at all — and maybe earns something extra for staying in their own bed all night. Try to steer away from things, if possible, and think more about quality time (an extra story, a fun outing).
        
        If nothing is working, or your child is really upset, talk to your doctor. There may be more going on, and the two of you can work together to figure things out and help your child. Both of you deserve a restful night's sleep.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/xylitol-what-to-know-about-this-popular-sugar-substitute,Xylitol: What to know about this popular sugar substitute,"The next time you pop a stick of sugar-free chewing gum in your mouth, take a look at the list of ingredients: Chances are you'll see an ingredient called xylitol. This sugar alcohol that tastes as sweet sugar but has fewer calories and negligible effects on blood sugar levels and insulin.
        For this reason, xylitol is used in many sugar-free gums, candies, baked goods, and diabetes-friendly foods. You'll also find xylitol in toothpaste, mouthwash, and other types of oral-care products.
        What is xylitol?
        A naturally occurring sugar alcohol found (in trace amounts) in many fruits and vegetables, xylitol can be processed from certain trees or from a plant fiber called xylan. It tastes about as sweet as regular sugar, but with only about half the calories per serving. Store-bought xylitol is a white, crystalline powder that can be used as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in recipes.
        What are the health benefits of xylitol?
        Eating too much sugar has been linked to a host of serious health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and tooth decay, so sugar-free sweeteners like xylitol are a compelling alternative.
        Xylitol is lower in calories and carbohydrates than sugar
        Xylitol is an excellent alternative to sugar for people who need to watch their weight, their blood sugar levels, or both. The sugar alcohol contains about 2.4 calories per gram (compared with 4 calories per gram in regular sugar). That makes it a good option for those who want to limit their simple carbohydrate intake, like people with diabetes or related metabolic syndromes.
        Xylitol doesn't cause blood sugar spikes
        When measured on the glycemic index (GI), a measure of how quickly food raises blood sugar, xylitol's GI score is 7, while regular sugar has a GI score of about 60. Xylitol's lower GI score correlates to more sustained energy without the spike and plunge associated with a sudden intake of regular sugar.
        Xylitol is good for your dental health
        Xylitol may help prevent tooth decay by reducing levels of bad bacteria in your mouth. According to a review published in the Journal of International Society of Preventive & Community Dentistry, consuming 5 to 10 grams per day of xylitol-containing products (like lozenges, candies, chewing gum, toothpaste, or mouth rinse) significantly prevented cavities and tooth decay compared with products that do not contain xylitol. So don't be surprised if your dentist recommends a xylitol-containing chewing gum at your next checkup.
        Xylitol in everyday products
        Many sugar-free products contain xylitol, including sugar-free candy, gum, baked goods, mints, cough syrup, chewable vitamins, some nut butters, ice cream, and oral hygiene products like toothpaste and mouthwash. You can also buy xylitol in bulk at most grocery stores or online retailers to use in cooking and baking.
        Possible side effects
        Most people can add xylitol to their diets without noticing any side effects. But some people may experience digestive problems like gas, bloating, and diarrhea if they consume too much too quickly. If you notice uncomfortable digestive problems, cut back your xylitol intake and reintroduce it slowly. And if you have other digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), you may want to avoid sugar alcohols entirely.
        Additionally, an observational study published in the June issue of European Heart Journal found that high levels of xylitol were associated with greater risk of heart attack or stroke in adults years later. While more research is needed (the study was small, and observational versus experimental), it's best to keep your consumption of xylitol in check.
        Keep xylitol away from your dog
        Xylitol is highly toxic to dogs, causing dangerously low blood sugar, liver failure, and even death. Keep sugar-free products out of your dog's reach, and always check the ingredient label on ice cream and peanut butter before offering it to your pup.",Lindsay Warner,"September 4, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/can-cbd-oil-help-manage-pain,Can CBD oil help manage pain?,"Chronic pain affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, prompting a continuous search for safer, effective pain management solutions. One therapy gaining popularity is CBD oil. Does it help?
        What is CBD oil?
        Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of over 400 chemical compounds found in the cannabis (marijuana) plant. Unlike THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, also found in cannabis), CBD doesn't produce a high. CBD oil is typically extracted from hemp, a variety of cannabis with low THC levels. The extracted CBD is then diluted with a carrier oil, such as coconut or hemp seed oil, creating CBD oil.
        CBD oil may be used in many different forms. It's available in capsules that can be taken by mouth; as tinctures and sprays that are placed under the tongue; and in oils, lotions, and creams that are applied to the skin. CBD oil can even be vaped with an e-cigarette.
        Can CBD oil help manage chronic pain?
        CBD's potential to alleviate chronic pain may be attributed in part to its anti-inflammatory properties, though it interacts with dozens of different receptors in our bodies. It is believed to modulate the body's endocannabinoid system (ECS), which plays a role in regulating various physiological processes, including pain sensation, mood, and immune response. By influencing the ECS, CBD may offer a means of alleviating pain and inflammation (which are often two sides of the same coin). Additionally, CBD may help reduce anxiety and improve sleep, both of which can indirectly contribute to pain relief.
        Research on CBD oil's efficacy in managing chronic pain is still in its early stages, but the findings are promising. Several studies offer hope that CBD may help reduce pain and improve the quality of life for individuals with various chronic pain conditions.
        A systematic review published in the journal Cureus analyzed multiple studies on CBD and pain management. The review concluded that CBD could help reduce pain and inflammation in conditions such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, and neuropathic pain. Research in another report also concluded that CBD, along with other cannabinoids, can be an effective treatment option for managing chronic pain in adults.
        Many of the studies included in the research of CBD also look at the effects of cannabis, which contains both CBD and THC, on pain relief. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions on the effect of CBD alone on chronic pain.
        More research is needed to fully understand CBD's effectiveness for pain management. Currently the FDA does not approve the use of CBD oil for the treatment of chronic pain. The only FDA-approved use of CBD is for certain childhood epilepsy syndromes.
        Is CBD oil safe?
        CBD oil is generally considered safe. According to the World Health Organization, CBD is well tolerated in most individuals and has a good safety profile. But it's still wise to use CBD with caution, and to openly communicate with your physicians about your CBD usage. CBD side effects can include:
        
          fatigue
          drowsiness
          changes in mood, such as irritability
          diarrhea
          changes in appetite or weight
          dry mouth
          liver inflammation.
        
        CBD can also interact with certain medications because it competes for liver enzymes and can raise the levels of other drugs in your system. If you are taking other medications, it is particularly important to discuss with your health care professional before starting CBD. The CDC advises against using CBD during pregnancy.
        Quality and purity are significant concerns with CBD products. The market is wholly unregulated, so CBD products may not contain what's stated on the product label, and may be contaminated with unwanted substances such as THC (which is dangerous if you are not expecting it and are, for example, driving).
        Always purchase CBD oil from reputable sources that provide third-party lab testing results to ensure product quality and safety. These come with a COA, or a certificate of analysis, which demonstrates that the labeling is accurate.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","September 3, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/chronic-loneliness-linked-to-higher-risk-of-stroke,Chronic loneliness linked to higher risk of stroke,"People who feel persistently lonely may be more prone to experiencing a stroke, according to a study published June 24, 2024, in eClinicalMedicine.
        The study included more than 12,000 adults ages 50 and older who had never had a stroke. All completed a 20-item test designed to measure loneliness and social isolation. Four years later, the nearly 9,000 people remaining in the study repeated the test; researchers then tracked them for six to eight more years.
        People with high loneliness scores only during the initial assessment had a 25% higher risk of stroke than those not considered lonely. But those who were lonely during both assessments had a 56% higher risk of stroke than those with consistently low loneliness scores, even after researchers accounted for a range of other risk factors. In addition to classic risk factors for stroke, such as high blood pressure and smoking, these included measures of social isolation and symptoms of depression, which are related to but distinct from loneliness.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/high-lipoproteina-raises-heart-attack-risk-even-in-healthy-people,High lipoprotein(a) raises heart attack risk even in healthy people,"High blood levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a) — a variant of LDL cholesterol — may triple the risk of a heart attack, even among people with no other risks for heart disease, a new study confirms.
        The study included 6,238 people ages 43 to 65 who had their Lp(a) levels measured. Values in the top 10% — 216 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) or greater — were defined as high, while values in the lower 50% — less than 42 nmol/L — were defined as low. Most had conditions or habits that raised their heart disease risk, known as standard modifiable risk factors (SMuRFs). These include diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, and unfavorable cholesterol levels. While about 4% of the study participants had all four SMuRFs, nearly 24% had none.
        Over a median follow-up period of nearly nine years, high Lp(a) levels were linked to nearly triple the risk of heart attack, regardless of the presence or number of SMuRFs a person had. Having a high Lp(a) was equivalent to having two SMuRFs. The findings support more widespread Lp(a) testing, according to the authors, whose study was published May 21, 2024, in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

          Everything I eat lately tastes like it's been doused in salt, even if I know it hasn't. Why might this happen?
        
        A. This phenomenon certainly puts a damper on enjoying your food. But you should know there are many possible reasons food can taste oversalted.
        Do you have seasonal allergies? Sometimes postnasal drip leads to a salty sensation, as can an allergy to a particular food. Also on the list of potential culprits are gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, certain autoimmune conditions, and vitamin B12 deficiency. Even a chronically dry mouth — which can be a side effect of various medications — can make food taste especially salty.
        Even if you have one of these conditions, don't just accept living with a salty mouth. It's wise to mention the issue to your primary care doctor. She'll work with you to help improve your symptoms, which may be as easy as changing your medications. Otherwise, she may recommend some simple blood tests to investigate the cause.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/doomscrolling-dangers,Doomscrolling dangers,"What was the first thing you did when you woke up this morning? If you reached for your phone and scrolled through the news — scanning headline after headline blaring bad tidings — you're doing something called doomscrolling. And you're definitely not alone.
        It's an understandable urge: with wars raging across the world, frequent mass shootings, multiple climate disasters, and a polarized populace poised to vote in another presidential election, our newsfeeds are ablaze with distressing information. Many of us scan it hungrily, constantly; we hit refresh, and the stream starts anew.
        The phenomenon of doomscrolling — one of the Oxford English Dictionary's words of the year in 2020 — rose to prominence during the pandemic when our upended lives prodded us to relentlessly track the latest COVID casualties. But more than four years later, we're still living through tremendous social, political, and economic unrest, and doomscrolling has emerged as an insidious threat to our minds and bodies, Harvard experts say.
        With the media's propensity to blast mostly bad news (as the saying goes, ""if it bleeds, it leads""), ""we're not getting any messages about hope — it's all negativity,"" says Dr. Richard Mollica, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
        ""It has been one onslaught after the other,"" agrees Dr. Aditi Nerurkar, a lecturer in the Division of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""Our brains and bodies are expertly designed to handle short bursts of stress. But over the past several years, the stress just doesn't seem to end. Doomscrolling is our response to that.""
        Women particularly vulnerable
        Who's susceptible? Every last one of us. ""If you have a device, it's open season for doomscrolling,"" Dr. Nerurkar says.
        The behavior is rooted in our brain's limbic system — often referred to as the lizard or reptilian brain — that's dominated by a structure called the amygdala. It promotes self-preservation and drives the fight-or-flight response to danger, fueling us to troll for threats.
        ""Stress stokes our primary urge to scroll,"" she says. ""We're hypervigilant and scanning for danger. The more you scroll, the more you feel you need to.""
        But two key groups are especially vulnerable: women and people with a history of trauma, Dr. Mollica says. Women are hit harder by doomscrolling because ""most of violent media is about hurting women and children,"" he says.
        Meanwhile, people who've lived through violence doomscroll out of fear, says Dr. Mollica, who is also director of the Harvard Program in Refugee Trauma at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""They don't feel safe in the world and want to get a handle on what's going on so they can calm their anxiety. But in these same people, doomscrolling acts as a trigger.""
        Physical and mental ripple effects
        Perhaps unsurprisingly, stomach-churning news has a tendency to turn our stomachs. But nausea is far from the only physical effect of doomscrolling. Others can include headaches, muscle tension, neck and shoulder pain, low appetite, difficulty sleeping, and even elevated blood pressure, according to Harvard experts.
        ""When people doomscroll for hours, they're sedentary for a long time too,"" Dr. Nerurkar notes. ""The ripple effects are vast and problematic.""
        In the wake of the pandemic, doomscrolling's mental health effects have been examined more extensively. An April 2023 research review published in Applied Research in Quality of Life analyzed three separate studies involving a total of about 1,200 adults, suggesting doomscrolling is linked to worse mental well-being and life satisfaction.
        An August 2024 study of 800 adults published in Computers in Human Behavior Reports reinforces those findings, suggesting doomscrolling evokes greater levels of existential anxiety — a feeling of dread or panic that arises when we confront the limitations of our existence. Yet another study in Computers in Human Behavior in April 2024 provided additional perspective, suggesting that employees who doomscroll while at work may become less engaged with their professional tasks.
        On a practical level, Dr. Nerurkar says, doomscrolling can give us ""popcorn brain,"" which happens when we spend too much time online. ""It's the real, biological phenomenon of feeling your brain is popping because you're being overstimulated online,"" she explains. ""Then it's hard to engage with the real world, which moves at a much slower pace.""
        How to cut back
        While keeping abreast of current events is essential, doomscrolling provides no extra benefits. ""We need to stay informed, but not at the expense of our mental health,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. ""And cutting back is not about abstinence; it's about decreasing reliance.""
        How to accomplish this? Strategies mainly revolve around creating ""digital boundaries that can give your brain and body a chance to recalibrate to normal,"" she says.
        Dr. Nerurkar and Dr. Mollica suggest these approaches:
        Keep your phone off your nightstand. That doesn't mean it can't be in the bedroom, but keeping your phone out of easy reach means you can't compulsively grab it upon waking. ""It could be the biggest game changer for your stress from doomscrolling,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. ""You're acclimating yourself instead to wake up to the light, look at your bed partner, and go to the bathroom and brush your teeth, creating a buffer to your stress response.""
        Follow suit in your work space. Similarly, place your phone in a desk drawer or 10 or more feet away from where you're planted during working hours.
        Don't bring your phone to the dinner table. At mealtime, leave your phone more than an arm's length away, and set it to silent mode.
        Switch your phone to grayscale. This type of visual boundary makes scrolling less enticing by dialing back the saturation levels of colors on your screen. ""There's some early data that this decreases screen time,"" Dr. Nerurkar says.
        Opt out of notifications. These types of beeps and dings — which alert us to new headlines, emails, messages, and the like — are self-selected. Opting out is as simple as reviewing your phone's settings. ""This is about re-establishing some boundaries,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. ""Are you using your device, or is your device using you?""
        Focus on community news. Local headlines tend to be less doom-and-gloom and more uplifting. ""Stick to the environment you live in,"" Dr. Mollica says.
        Just say no. Tell people who are sharing depressing or violent stories that you're not interested. ""This puts you in control,"" Dr. Mollica says. ""You're not giving your power to someone else.""
        Focus on the good. Volunteer at a charity or another altruistic organization such as an animal shelter. Or take part in emotionally freeing activities, like a dance class or nature walks. ""You need to share positive emotional experiences with others,"" Dr. Mollica says.
        Talk to your doctor. If you find you can't stop doomscrolling or that it makes you extremely upset, it's time to discuss it with a professional. ""A small percentage of people really need professional help, and the best place to start is by talking to your primary care doctor about it,"" Dr. Mollica says. ""Certain problems are very hard to overcome on your own.""

        BMI has long been the standard to classify a person's body weight as too low, normal, overweight, or obese. While BMI often reflects a person's body fat amount, it doesn't account for fat distribution or the amount of muscle mass. (Muscle weighs more than fat, and BMI can overestimate body fat in people with a lot of muscle.)
        BRI addresses these shortcomings by focusing on a person's height, waist size, and hip size. By taking weight out of the equation, BRI provides a better indicator of how much belly fat (visceral fat) surrounds the organs inside the abdomen. High amounts of belly fat are linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.
        In the study, researchers recorded the BRIs of about 33,000 people and followed them for 20 years. They found that a higher BRI was associated with an increased risk of death during that period compared with a lower BRI.
        For example, people with a BRI of 6.9 or higher had an almost 50% greater risk of early death compared with individuals with a BRI of 4.5 to 5.5. On the other end of the spectrum, individuals ages 65 and older who had very low BRIs (less than 3.4) also had a higher risk of early death. That's not surprising, because a too-low number often means the person is malnourished or has a significant medical condition causing weight loss.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-point-of-knee-shots,The point of knee shots,"An estimated 19% of men ages 60 and older suffer from knee osteoarthritis. Symptoms include pain while moving, stiffness, swelling, tenderness, and limited range of motion.
        Men can often manage the pain and improve mobility with lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, physical therapy, and exercises focusing on joint movement and strengthening leg muscles. Taking occasional over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers or anti-inflammatory medicines also can help. These can be taken in pill form or topically (applied to the skin).
        But if these strategies don't offer sufficient relief, or if symptoms impede your ability to move freely, you may benefit from a medication injection.
        ""Injections can provide immediate pain relief, reduce inflammation, and increase mobility,"" says rheumatologist Dr. Robert Shmerling, the former clinical chief of the division of rheumatology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        ""But not everyone improves, and even if they are helpful, injections are a temporary treatment that won't cure your knee osteoarthritis or change the course of the disease. If you must rely on repeated injections for pain management and help with mobility, then it's probably time to consider a knee replacement.""
        There are two main types of injections for knee osteoarthritis: corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid.
        Corticosteroid injections
        Corticosteroid injections (also known as steroid shots) are often doctors' first choice. Corticosteroids are manufactured drugs that resemble cortisol, a hormone the adrenal glands produce. They reduce inflammation, pain, and swelling in and around the knee joint. Your doctor will first treat the knee with a local anesthetic. If the knee has extra swelling, your doctor may remove excess fluid with a needle.
        Joints are surrounded by synovial fluid, which helps cushion and lubricate the moving parts of the knee. However, when cartilage is damaged from osteoarthritis, the body responds by overproducing synovial fluid, which leads to swelling. ""Removing fluid relieves pressure and swelling around the knee joint and makes the steroid injection more effective,"" says Dr. Shmerling.
        Once any excess fluid is removed, the corticosteroid (usually mixed with a numbing agent) is injected into the knee joint. Your doctor may use ultrasound to help guide the needle. The procedure is rarely painful, though you may feel some discomfort.
        ""Relief from the numbing agent kicks in right away, while the corticosteroid takes about 24 hours to start working on your symptoms,"" says Dr. Shmerling. ""If you don't feel the effects within 72 hours, the injection probably won't work for you.""
        Common side effects are pain and swelling around the injection site, which usually goes away within 48 hours. Your knee also may feel tender, so you should avoid strenuous activities for a few days. ""You may want to take an over-the-counter pain medication to reduce any discomfort,"" says Dr. Shmerling. ""Otherwise, regular rest is all you need.""
        The injection's effect can last from several weeks to months. Repeat injections can be given every three to four months. ""But keep in mind that a shot often works best the first time,"" says Dr. Shmerling. ""Over time, they may work less well and for shorter periods. If the pain and inflammation improve for only a week or two after the first injection, you probably won't benefit much from future ones."" Studies also have suggested that relying too much on injections may damage cells in the knee that make cartilage, which can worsen the joint deterioration.
        Hyaluronic acid injections
        Another injection therapy involves using a synthetic version of hyaluronic acid. ""This is usually recommended only if a corticosteroid injection doesn't work or if you have diabetes and your doctor is concerned about possible side effects from the steroid, such as higher blood sugar levels,"" says Dr. Shmerling.
        Hyaluronic acid is a natural component of the synovial fluid in the joints. However, as osteoarthritis advances, hyaluronic acid decreases, which makes synovial fluid thinner and less effective. ""This can increase pain and stiffness, as there's less lubrication to help the knee joint move freely,"" says Dr. Shmerling. ""The synthetic hyaluronic acid acts like oil on a rusty joint.""
        Possible side effects include pain at the injection site, inflammation in the knee soon after injection (as a reaction to the medication), and infection. ""If the injection provided significant benefit, a follow-up injection may be given after six months,"" says Dr. Shmerling.
        If you take any type of anticoagulant (blood thinner), be sure to let the doctor know before getting any injections, because it increases your risk of bleeding into and around the joint.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cooling-off-heartburn,Cooling off heartburn,"At some point, everyone experiences heartburn — that deep, painful burning sensation in the chest that can be so intense it's mistaken for a heart attack. Heartburn (also known as acid reflux) occurs when stomach acid flows backward into the esophagus, the tube connecting the mouth and stomach. It often happens when you eat too quickly or too much, or after you eat rich, spicy, or acidic foods.
        Heartburn usually goes away on its own, but sometimes you need an over-the-counter remedy to get relief. For more severe and ongoing heartburn, you might need stronger medication. Which should you use, and when? Here's a breakdown.
        Occasional heartburn
        For now-and-then heartburn, use antacids. They quickly neutralize digestive acids in the stomach and esophagus. ""They work well for people with mild, occasional heartburn and provide immediate relief,"" says Dr. Andrew T. Chan, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Liquid antacids provide faster relief, but many people find tablets more convenient. There are three categories of over-the-counter antacids: magnesium-based (Maalox, Mylanta), aluminum-based (Amphojel), and calcium-based (Tums, Rolaids). ""There aren't data to support whether one works better than the others,"" says Dr. Chan.
        Other products, like Gaviscon, contain both aluminum and magnesium. The combination of ingredients creates a foam layer when ingested, which floats to the top of the stomach to help block acid reflux. Another option is a seltzer (Alka-Seltzer), which has sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) as the active ingredient. ""These are the least powerful antacids,"" says Dr. Chan. They contain high levels of sodium, so do not take them if you are on a salt-restricted diet or have heart failure, high blood pressure, or kidney problems.
        Recurring heartburn
        If heartburn strikes many times a week, symptoms become more severe, or antacids don't work, you can try an over-the-counter H2 blocker. These work by blocking histamine, a chemical that signals the stomach to produce acid. ComBrands include famotidine (Pepcid) and cimetidine (Tagamet).
        H2 blockers are taken twice a day for one to two weeks. People whose heartburn is troublesome only at night often need only a single dose taken in the evening or at bedtime. ""H2 blockers are fine to take in the short term, but check with your doctor if you need to continue taking one after a few weeks,"" says Dr. Chan. ""They can prescribe a stronger H2 blocker if needed."" Also consult your doctor before taking an H2 blocker if you take a blood thinner, antidepressant, or blood pressure medication.
        
          
            
              
                Making changes
                If you take medication to manage recurring or persistent heartburn, you also should focus on adopting healthy lifestyle habits. They help reduce your dependence on drugs, and may even make it possible for you to stop taking them. For example:
                Weight loss and exercise. Losing excess weight and engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise daily can prevent flare-ups and reduce symptoms.
                Avoid trigger foods. Keep a daily food diary in which you list the foods and beverages that coincide with heartburn symptoms. Choose one and remove it from your diet for two weeks. Then add it back and note whether symptoms return. Repeat the process as needed until you find your trigger foods and drinks.
                Eat smaller meals. A large meal can remain in the stomach for several hours, increasing the risk of acid reflux. Eat frequent smaller meals a day instead of three large ones.
              
            
          
        
        Persistent heartburn
        If symptoms become intense or linger longer than two to three weeks despite taking an H2 blocker, you should consult your doctor. ""Persistent heartburn is caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD,"" says Dr. Chan. If you are diagnosed with GERD, your doctor will probably recommend a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), the strongest stomach acid inhibitor medication.
        PPIs — such as omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and esomeprazole (Nexium) — inhibit certain cells from ""pumping"" acid into the stomach, which lowers acid levels and reduces heartburn pain. PPIs are available over the counter or by prescription and are usually taken once daily.
        ""While both nonprescription and prescription PPIs work basically the same, your doctor will advise you on which one you need,"" says Dr. Chan. Long-term treatment with a PPI is often necessary, as heartburn usually returns when treatment ends. However, once your heartburn is under control, you may continue with a lower-dose PPI or switch to an H2 blocker.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-to-avoid-heart-failure,How to avoid heart failure,"About 10% of Americans will develop heart failure during their lifetimes, an incidence that rises substantially after age 65. But perhaps most concerning is that Americans are now dying from heart failure at a higher rate than 25 years ago, according to a study in the June 2024 issue of JAMA Cardiology.
        ""We are struggling to understand what has caused this change, which has made taking preventive measures against heart failure more important than ever,"" says cardiologist Dr. Mandeep R. Mehra, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the Center for Advanced Heart Disease at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        What is heart failure?
        Contrary to its name, heart failure does not mean the heart has suddenly stopped, but rather that it does not pump blood as effectively as it should.
        The pumping problem can affect the entire heart or just one side — left or right. Most cases occur because of left-sided issues: the left ventricle (the heart's largest chamber) is too weak or stiff to pump properly. Left-sided heart failure is classified into one of two main types depending on the heart's ejection fraction (EF) — the percentage of blood inside the left ventricle that gets pumped out with each contraction.
        People with an EF of at least 50% have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Those with an EF of less than 40% have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. People with an EF of 40% to 49% tend to have a mixed picture, but resemble those with reduced ejection fraction in their response to treatments.
        Both types of left-sided heart failure have similar symptoms, such as fatigue or shortness of breath or wheezing with exertion or when lying flat, a persistent cough, and swelling in the legs and ankles. As swelling increases, people may experience sudden and significant weight gain.
        ""People may dismiss many of these symptoms, especially if they don't interfere with daily life, and associate them with general aging, but they must be checked out even if the symptoms appear minor or they come and go,"" says Dr. Mehra. Standard tests for suspected heart failure include blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a chest x-ray, and an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart).
        
          
            
              
                Heart failure and genetics
                Your genes also play a role in your heart failure risk. Having one parent with heart failure increases your risk by as much as 70% compared with someone without a family history, according to Dr. Mandeep R. Mehra, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. If heart failure runs in the family, he suggests getting a genetic evaluation to determine if you have inherited a genetic risk. Also, don't ignore early symptoms of heart failure, such as ankle swelling or an unexpected decline in your ability to exercise. ""Seek medical evaluation, and if the reason is mild heart failure, addressing the condition right away can help prevent it from getting worse,"" says Dr. Mehra.
              
            
          
        
        Prevention is the best medicine
        What can you do to reduce your risk for heart failure? ""The best prevention is to address the top underlying contributors of heart failure, including high blood pressure, abnormal blood lipid levels, and weight gain,"" says Dr. Mehra. ""Addressing these risk factors can also protect against developing coronary artery disease and diabetes, two of the main medical conditions that cause heart failure.""
        High blood pressure forces the heart to work harder to pump blood to the rest of the body. Over time, this can prompt the heart's left ventricle to thicken and enlarge. Abnormal blood lipid levels, especially high LDL (bad) cholesterol, can lead to a buildup of fatty deposits (plaque) in your coronary arteries, known as coronary artery disease. This, in turn, can cause persistent diminished blood supply to the heart muscle or a major heart attack, either of which can result in heart failure.
        Extra weight increases the body's blood volume and makes the heart work harder to pump and circulate blood. Over time, this can lead to an enlarged heart muscle. Excess weight can also directly impair heart muscle function, which can further diminish its pumping action. Studies have found that a body mass index (BMI) of 30 and higher (classified as obese) is linked with a high risk for heart failure. ""But even a BMI of 25 to 29.9, deemed overweight, still puts some people in danger,"" says Dr. Mehra.
        Diet and exercise combo
        Preventing heart failure always begins with the one-two punch of a heart-healthy diet and regular exercise. These steps may also help with weight loss.
        Studies have shown that the plant-based Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet helps lower blood pressure. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, and nuts while minimizing salt, sugar, and red meat consumption. DASH and similar plant-based diets, like the Mediterranean diet, are also high in fiber, which helps reduce cholesterol. Fiber binds to cholesterol in the small intestine and prevents it from entering the bloodstream.
        Moreover, a study published online Nov. 28, 2023, by the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that overweight adults who ate a plant-based diet consisting primarily of fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes lost an average of about 13 pounds over 16 weeks.
        Regarding exercise, Dr. Mehra says doing at least 30 minutes of daily aerobic activity is good for heart health and thus can help lower heart failure risk. Any kind of activity is helpful, such as running, swimming, cycling, pickleball, and walking. A study published Feb. 21, 2024, in JAMA Cardiology found that walking just 3,600 steps per day — about 1.5 miles — at a normal pace lowered the risk of heart failure by 26% compared to people who look fewer steps. ""Staying consistently active is what's important,"" says Dr. Mehra.
        He also advises having regular checks of your blood pressure and LDL cholesterol levels. If either is above goal, your doctor will likely recommend dietary changes, increased exercise, and medication if necessary, such as a diuretic, ACE inhibitor, or angiotensin-receptor blocker for blood pressure, and a statin to lower LDL cholesterol.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/music-as-medicine,Music as medicine,"Just a few gentle strums of ukelele music can immediately transport us to a place of calm. This mysterious effect is one reason board-certified music therapist Lorrie Kubicek helps many patients take up the easy-to-play instrument after they're diagnosed with cancer or another major health condition — transforming a fraught situation into a constructive one.
        ""Instead of saying 'I have to go to the hospital for my chemo,' patients start saying, 'I have to go to the hospital for my ukelele lesson,'"" says Kubicek, co-director of the Katherine A. Gallagher Integrated Therapies Program at Harvard-affiliated Mass General Cancer Center.
        But music therapy is far more than a pleasant diversion, exemplifying how the art and science of medicine can work in tandem. With ancient roots — the Chinese character for medicine includes the character for music — the approach also helped rehabilitate World War II veterans' minds, bodies, and spirits.
        Characterized by personally tailored music interventions such as singing, songwriting, playing an instrument, listening to music, or moving to the beat, music therapy strikes a chord in many areas of medicine. Evidence increasingly suggests it helps people better manage disease symptoms and treatment side effects by curbing stress, soothing pain, promoting sleep, and boosting focus.
        ""Music connects you to a part of yourself that's well, and that's true no matter what patient population we're working with,"" Kubicek says. ""Music remains, no matter the challenges a person is facing.""
        Personalized approach
        Music therapy isn't the same thing as music medicine, in which patients simply wear headphones and listen to their favorite music for relaxation or distraction while undergoing medical treatment. It also doesn't require any musical background or experience to participate or benefit.
        The therapy begins with a one-on-one assessment with a music therapist to explore how each person relates to music and what problems they may face. ""We combine this information with evidence-based interventions to help patients feel, deal, or heal as quickly as possible,"" Kubicek says. ""We figure out how music can help you move toward your goals in a way that sets you up for success.""
        Building on decades of research, recent studies indicate this type of intervention can provide important relief by reducing anxiety during medical treatment, according to a 2021 research review published in Psychiatry Research.
        ""We see this all the time,"" she says. ""Because of music's connection to the limbic system in the brain, it can help you access the relaxation response and calm your nervous system, slowing down your breathing. It really helps shift your mind from what it's stuck on or worried about and helps you land in the moment you're in.""
        People with Alzheimer's disease were the focus of a research review published online in March 2023 by Alzheimer's Research and Therapy, which suggested that music therapy improved memory, attention, and orientation in these patients. And for people with psychiatric illnesses such as depression, Kubicek says, music therapy can ""bring energy and joy back at a very dark time in people's lives. It's also really beautiful to see how music can connect people of different ages and stages, cognitive abilities, and cultures.""
        Stretching the benefits
        Regardless of diagnosis, music therapy can hit the right notes as long as you feel a connection to music. ""You don't need to be a musician. You just need to love music and have something you want to develop or nurture,"" she says.
        You also don't need to wait for your doctor to offer music therapy. Ask her — or your local hospital or clinic — to refer you to a program. ""If you do have a specific diagnosis, you can always ask your health care team,"" Kubicek says. You can also find a music therapist near you through the American Music Therapy Association.
        To maximize the therapy's benefits, find a balance between taking risks and staying in your comfort zone, Kubicek advises. ""When we're exploring music, often we're trying something new for the first time,"" she says. ""Find that 'stretch zone,' because you don't know the full effect of what music can do for you until you try.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/drinks-on-a-plane-consider-saying-no,Drinks on a plane: Consider saying no,"Some people enjoy having a bit of bubbly when jetting off to a new locale, perhaps as a way to toast the start of an adventure. But drinking champagne or any other alcoholic beverage on an airplane might pose risks ranging from falls to heart attacks. This is particularly true if you intend to sleep on the flight, such as on a long-haul overnight flight. So it might be time to rethink your drink order.
        Your body on a plane
        Before you even take a sip of alcohol, your body experiences physiological effects of being high above sea level: there's less atmospheric pressure to force oxygen into red blood cells for delivery throughout your body, and blood oxygen drops from normal levels of 96%–100% to about 90%, or even below 90%.
        Your body has a way to compensate for that. You breathe faster to take in more oxygen. Your heart rate increases to move blood through your system faster. However, reduced blood oxygen levels and increased heart rates can be dangerous for people with a heart condition.
        Complicating factors
        Small dips in blood oxygen can become more pronounced on a plane when you add other factors into the mix, and drinking alcohol is one of them. ""Some studies suggest that alcohol impairs the ability of red blood cells to take up oxygen by altering hemoglobin, the molecule that actually carries the oxygen,"" says Dr. Matthew Mosquera, medical director of the Alcohol, Drugs, and Addiction Inpatient Program at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        The following factors can also lead to lower blood oxygen:
        Aging: Our ability to adapt to changes in blood oxygen levels declines as we age.
        Sleeping: Breathing normally slows during sleep, even on an airplane.
        Underlying conditions: Less oxygen gets to your lungs if you have lung disease, sleep apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep), or heart problems.
        What's the risk?
        The more contributors to low blood oxygen you have, the harder it becomes for your body to compensate, especially on a plane. That was illustrated in a study published online June 3, 2024, by Thorax.
        Researchers wanted to know more about the combined effects of alcohol consumption and airplane cabin pressure during sleep on a plane. They randomly assigned 48 healthy people (ages 18 to 40) to spend two nights sleeping at normal air pressure or at the equivalent of airplane cabin pressure. Participants drank alcohol (the equivalent of two beers or two glasses of wine) before one of the nights and were sober for the other. They also wore devices measuring their blood oxygen and heart rate.
        Compared to sleeping in normal air pressure, sleeping in airplane cabin pressure made blood oxygen levels lower and heart rates higher. Combining drinking and sleeping when in airplane cabin pressure made oxygen levels even lower and heart rate even higher.
        ""Drinking and sleeping on a plane puts a big strain on your body, especially your cardiovascular system,"" Dr. Mosquera says. ""And there's even more strain if you have heart or lung disease. It places you at a higher risk for a heart attack or stroke.""
        Other alcohol risks on a plane
        Drinking alcohol on a plane poses additional health risks. For example, it
        
          increases your fall risk
          causes dehydration, which adds to the strain on your cardiovascular system
          impairs your judgment and ability to focus (which you don't want when it's time to get off the plane)
          may help you fall asleep, but reduces the time you spend in good-quality deep sleep.
        
        What you should do
        Is it best to pass on alcohol when the drink cart approaches? That depends. ""If you're healthy, drinking in moderation might be okay,"" Dr. Mosquera says. However, he urges you to consider the following:
        
          Think twice about drinking alcohol and taking certain medications. Alcohol can worsen drowsiness from drugs that make you sleepy.
          Drink extra water. This will help your body flush out the alcohol, and prevent dehydration caused by alcohol.
          Be mindful of your balance. Take your time going from a sitting position to standing, to avoid falls.
        
        And if you have heart or lung disease, sleep apnea, or chronic lung disease, or if you've had a stroke in the past — especially if you plan to sleep on the flight — it may be wisest not to drink alcohol.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-you-really-take-that-daily-aspirin,Should you really take that daily aspirin?,"Low-dose aspirin therapy used to be considered a simple way to help prevent a first-time heart attack or stroke in people with low risks for those events. That changed in 2019, when evidence about aspirin's limited benefits and increased bleeding risks in low-risk adults prompted new recommendations against such therapy. But many people haven't gotten the message, according to a research letter published online June 24, 2024, by Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers analyzed data from national health surveys of 186,000 people ages 40 or older, collected between 2012 and 2019 and again in 2021. While aspirin use declined after 2019, nearly a third of healthy adults ages 60 or older reported that they were still taking aspirin in 2021, and about 1 in 20 were using it without medical advice. If you're taking a daily low-dose aspirin — 81 milligrams (mg) — but you're at low risk for heart disease, stroke, or bleeding risks (say, from a peptic ulcer), talk to your doctor as soon as possible about whether you should continue taking it. Aspirin therapy remains a mainstay for people with a high risk of having a heart attack.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/trouble-treating-rheumatoid-arthritis,Trouble treating rheumatoid arthritis,"The initial treatment for active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is supposed to be aggressive. Doctors can pre-scribe powerful medications to slow the chronic immune system attack on the lining of the joints, and the drugs should be administered as soon as possible to help prevent crippling disability.
        Unfortunately, most people diagnosed after age 65 (which includes up to a third of all people with rheumatoid arthritis) aren't getting optimal treatment, according to recent evidence. Here's why this might be happening to people with ""late-onset"" RA, and what you can do about it.
        Recent evidence
        In a study published Dec. 5, 2023, in ACR Open Rheumatology, scientists used Medicare data from 2008 to 2017 to identify people with a new diagnosis of late-onset RA. Among more than 33,000 people who fit the profile, just 29% received a medication that can modify the disease within the first year after diagnosis, even though such treatment is recommended by current clinical practice guidelines.
        ""This is in contrast with 70% to 80% of younger adults with rheumatoid arthritis who receive disease-modifying medications soon after diagnosis,"" says Dr. Devyani Misra, a geriatrician, rheumatologist, and researcher at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital.
        Why disease-modifying drugs are important
        The most effective rheumatoid arthritis medications not only relieve symptoms, but also slow the disease process. That helps reduce the amount of joint destruction and curb the loss of joint function.
        In most cases, the first-line treatment is a nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) such as methotrexate (Otrexup, Trexall), typically taken as a pill or self-injection.
        If a nonbiologic DMARD doesn't provide significant improvement within a month or two, you might be offered a newer type of DMARD, such as one of the following.
        Biologic DMARDs, such as etanercept (Enbrel), rituximab (Rituxan), or tocilizumab (Actemra), have a more targeted effect on immune system function than nonbiologic DMARDs. They are typically given as infusions or are self-injected.
        Janus kinase inhibitors, such as tofacitinib (Xeljanz), like other DMARDs, reduce inflammation. They are taken as pills.
        Until those medications begin to work (within weeks to months), doctors might recommend low doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or corticosteroids, such as prednisone. But these medications do not protect the joints from damage, and long-term use can carry significant side effects.
        What's the holdup?
        Many factors keep people who develop late-onset RA from getting the most effective medications. Here are some examples.
        Cost. Biologic DMARDs and Janus kinase inhibitors are expensive, with price tags upward of $20,000 or more per year. While they are often covered by insurance, copays and deductibles might translate to hundreds or thousands of dollars per year.
        Side effects. All three classes of DMARD medications (like all drugs) can have side effects. For example, nonbiologic DMARDs can cause fatigue and liver problems; biologic DMARDs increase the risk for infections, especially tuberculosis; and Janus kinase inhibitor use can lead to shingles, allergic reactions, diarrhea, headache, runny or stuffy nose, or sore throat. Dr. Misra says some people decline the medications to avoid those risks.
        Coexisting conditions. By the time late-onset RA develops, some people have other conditions that complicate treatment, such as heart or kidney problems. ""Even aging itself can complicate rheumatoid arthritis treatment, in that liver, kidney, and gut function decline as we age, and the immune system becomes a little dysfunctional,"" Dr. Misra says.
        Perceived frailty. ""Some health care providers might be nervous about how medication side effects will affect someone they perceive as being frail, and then select the least aggressive treatment, such as a corticosteroid to ease symptoms,"" Dr. Misra says. ""Yet I often prescribe DMARDs in older patients, and the drugs are effective and well tolerated.""
        Cognitive impairment. ""Cognitive impairment interferes with the ability to follow instructions for medication use, lab monitoring, and clinic visit follow-ups. It's an ethical dilemma to determine how aggressively we want to treat these patients,"" Dr. Misra says.
        Accessibility to health care. About 1.5 million people in the United States have rheumatoid arthritis, but there are only about 6,000 rheumatologists (doctors who are experts in treating the condition and who are most likely to prescribe DMARDs). So you might not have a specialist in your town who can navigate the challenges of late-onset RA. Even if you do, you might not have transportation, funds, or physical strength for in-person visits or infusions.
        What you can do
        If you aren't getting DMARD treatment for rheumatoid arthritis but feel you should be, talk to your doctor about workarounds to make treatment more feasible. Here are some examples.
        If you can't give yourself injections. Infusions or an oral drug might be a better option.
        If you can't get to a clinic. It might be possible to have a service provide blood work or infusions at home.
        If you can't take methotrexate. A different medication might be a better fit when methotrexate isn't an option due to medication allergies or liver or kidney disease.
        If you have cognitive impairment. ""Perhaps you can have a family member or a visiting nurse give you your medications, or use an electronic pill-dispensing box,"" Dr. Misra suggests.
        If the medications are too expensive. Ask your pharmacist about manufacturer coupons and patient assistance programs that can help reduce the costs of RA drugs.
        If you're worried about side effects. ""We often can find a drug that is the most benign, but still relieves discomfort,"" Dr. Misra says. ""Or we can arrange the use of other therapies, such as physical or occupational therapy, topical creams, or heat and ice therapy. When we put them all together, they often provide pain relief. This is all about improving your quality of life, which will decline if you don't have treatment. And you're not too old to be treated.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/when-fear-strikes-the-heart-post-traumatic-stress-disorder,When fear strikes the heart: Post-traumatic stress disorder,"Experiencing or witnessing deeply disturbing events — natural or human-made disasters, serious accidents, or violent acts — is surprisingly common. Over a lifetime, these and other traumatic events will touch the lives of up to seven in 10 adults in this country. While only some will go on to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (see ""Understanding PTSD""), these people are especially vulnerable to cardiovascular problems, according to a recent review.
        Published in August 2024 in Current Problems in Cardiology, the analysis pooled findings from 20 studies involving a total of more than 335,000 people. PTSD was linked to a 40% higher risk of heart attack and a doubled risk of stroke.
        
          
            
              
                Understanding PTSD
                Mention PTSD, and people immediately think of war veterans. But this potentially debilitating mental health condition can affect people of all ages who have experienced any kind of trauma, including disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, car accidents, sexual assault, and gun violence, for example.
                It's normal to have upsetting memories, feel on edge, and have trouble sleeping after a disturbing event. But if symptoms last more than a few months, you might have PTSD. Key symptoms include
                
                  recurring nightmares or intrusive thoughts about the event
                  feeling emotionally numb and disconnected
                  withdrawing from people and certain situations
                  being jumpy and on guard.
                
                About 11% to 20% of veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan have PTSD. Among the general population, the condition affects an estimated 4% of men and 8% of women. The National Center for PTSD offers a brief self-screening test that can help you decide whether to seek more information and help.
              
            
          
        
        Brain activity imbalance
        In a separate study, psychologist Dr. Antonia Seligowski, who heads the MGH Neurocardiac Effects of Stress and Trauma laboratory, and her colleagues used brain imaging and other tests to take a closer look at the connection between PTSD and heart disease. The amygdala, a brain structure involved in processing anxiety, fear, and stress, is overactive in people with PTSD. ""But these people also have decreased activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for regulating emotions and dampening the fear response,"" she says. These two structures communicate with each other and the nearby hypothalamus, which, in turn, sends signals to the brainstem. Located at the base of the brain, this region controls unconscious, automatic responses like breathing and heart rate.
        If the prefrontal cortex doesn't pump the brakes on rampant activity in the amygdala, the imbalance leads to chronic activation of the body's ""fight-or-flight"" response. This not only causes the heart rate and blood pressure to rise but also stimulates the bone marrow to release white blood cells. In the short term, these cells help fight off infection. But chronic or repeated activation of the stress response — a hallmark of PTSD — can persistently elevate white blood cells. The resulting inflammation contributes to atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty plaque that narrows blood vessels. Chronic inflammation also makes the blood ""stickier"" and more likely to form clots.
        Both brain changes and inflammatory markers appear to influence the association between PTSD and heart attack, stroke, and related problems, according to the study, which was published in the March 2024 issue of Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.
        Different ways to tame stress
        The good news: Several stress-busting habits may improve both problems. For example, exercise helps your brain as well as your heart by boosting activity in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, recently updated guidelines for treating PTSD recommend mindfulness-based stress reduction. This eight-week program, which includes meditation, body scanning, and simple yoga stretches, may also improve certain heart-related risks such as high blood pressure.
        In research funded by the American Heart Association, Dr. Seligowski is studying whether cognitive behavioral therapy can help quiet the body's stress response and lower arterial inflammation in people with PTSD at risk of cardiovascular disease. Her team is also exploring the potential benefits of breathwork, a calming technique that helps ease stress. ""We hope to figure out which techniques are best for people with different psychiatric disorders and heart-related risks,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-i-take-an-aspirin-if-i-think-im-having-a-heart-attack,Should I take an aspirin if I think I'm having a heart attack?,"Q. 
          I've heard that if you think you're having a heart attack, you should call 911 and then chew a regular aspirin while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Is that still considered good advice?
        
        A. Although aspirin may be part of the treatment for a heart attack, the American Heart Association no longer advises people who think they might be having a heart attack to use it on their own.
        The main reason? You might not actually be having a heart attack, and aspirin could make things worse. For example, sudden, severe chest pain may result from a tear in the aorta (the large artery that arches out of the heart), causing dangerous bleeding. Aspirin could make this problem worse because it prevents cell fragments (platelets) from clumping together, decreasing the blood's ability to clot.
        A stomach ulcer — which can cause pain just above the stomach in the upper abdomen — can also be mistaken for a heart attack. Taking aspirin may cause the ulcer to bleed into the stomach. That's because the drug also inhibits helpful substances called prostaglandins that protect the stomach's delicate lining.
        When a person is actually experiencing a heart attack, aspirin's ability to prevent clots may help keep blood flowing freely in the heart's arteries. However, there's no definitive evidence of an added benefit from starting this processes 15 to 30 minutes earlier — that is, if you took aspirin at home rather than waiting for emergency personnel with the ambulance team or at the hospital to give you an aspirin. They will determine whether to do so based on your symptoms, medical history, current medications, and test results.
        Taking aspirin at the first sign of a possible stroke also isn't advised for similar reasons. Although most strokes are caused by clots, some are caused by ruptured blood vessels and bleeding. Taking aspirin could potentially make these bleeding strokes more severe.
        What if you already take aspirin daily, which is only recommended in specific situations (see ""Advice about daily aspirin"" in the July 2021 Heart Letter)? Should you take your daily dose? That would be reasonable but probably not necessary. The aspirin you take regularly will last a week in the blood, so there is less of a need to take additional aspirin. However, you may get an extra dose at the hospital if a doctor confirms you've had a heart attack.
        The bottom line: If you think you are having a heart attack or stroke, call 911. Do not start aspirin therapy on your own.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/5-tips-for-coping-with-sciatica,Preventing and coping with sciatica,"Sciatica causes pain that begins in the lower back and spreads through the buttock, leg, calf and, occasionally, the foot. It can be a disruptive and painful condition, but early intervention and lifestyle adjustments can significantly alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life.
        
          Increase exercise 
        
        Exercise is an important way to prevent sciatica. If you already have symptoms, staying physically can actually help diminish your pain. Consider these types:
        
          aerobic exercise, such as walking, jogging, swimming, dancing, and other activities that increase your heart rate
          strength training, such as exercises using free weights or weight machines, or isometric exercises, which involve contracting muscles without obvious movement
          flexibility training, such as yoga, tai chi, Pilates, and similar activities that increase both flexibility and strength.
        
        The ""best"" exercise is the one that you like to do and will continue to do long term. Always ""start low and go slow"" when beginning a new type of exercise.
        
          Strengthen your core 
        
        It might not seem obvious that a stronger core could improve your spinal health. But your core is not just your abdominal muscles, even though they are key contributors to the stability of your spine. Muscles in the back, sides, pelvis, and buttocks also are part of your core. Strengthening all of these muscles helps to support your spine.
        Many types of exercise, including yoga and Pilates, can strengthen the core muscles. For example, planks and bridges are movements that target the core. You can find more options, with instructions, in the Harvard Special Health Report Gentle Core Exercises.
        
          Avoid sitting for long periods 
        
        Prolonged periods of sitting put pressure on the discs and ligaments in the low back. If you have a job that requires a lot of sitting, take frequent breaks, or try a standing desk. Less sitting is better.
        
          Practice good posture 
        
        Although there's no evidence that poor posture can cause back pain, it can make existing pain worse. But you don't have to walk around the room with a book on your head to practice good posture. Follow these tips:
        
          Pay attention to your body's position when you're standing or sitting.
          To prevent slouching, pull your shoulders down and back. Imagine your shoulder blades touching.
          If you work at a computer, take frequent breaks. Position your monitor so you can see it without bending your head down or tilting it back.
        
        
          Avoid smoking 
        
        Besides its general harmful effects on your health, smoking reduces how much oxygen your tissues are getting. Because the discs in the spine don't have a great oxygen supply to begin with, smoking can increase the risk of disc degeneration and damage that can lead to sciatica.
        
          Get enough sleep 
        
        Like your brain, your spine also needs rest. While you're awake and vertical, it supports the weight of your body and absorbs the forces of everyday life. Aim for seven to nine hours of sleep a night. Tips for spine-healthy sleep include the following:
        
          If you need or want to purchase a new mattress, get one that feels comfortable to you and that keeps your spine aligned. Firmer isn't necessarily better. Finding a mattress with a money-back guarantee can give you time to test your purchase and ensure it's right for you.
          If you sleep on your back, a two-piece wedge cushion may relieve pain from sciatica. One-piece rests under your legs and the other under your back. An alternative to buying a special cushion: put two thick pillows behind your back to prop you into a slightly raised position. Then place one or two flatter pillows under your knees to raise your legs.
          If you sleep on your side, place a contoured pillow (or any plump pillow) between your knees. Use a thick pillow under your head; this helps to align your upper spine.
          Sleeping on your stomach is the least preferred position if you have sciatica. But if this is how you're most comfortable, use no pillow or only a flat pillow under your head. Place a plump pillow under your hips to align your spine.
        
        The vast majority of people who have sciatica get better within a few weeks. If you have sciatica, chances are also good that with careful attention, treatment, and preventive steps, you'll be able to keep it from coming back.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/protect-your-skin-during-heat-waves-heres-how-202408143066,Protect your skin during heat waves — here's how,"Global average temperatures have soared in 2024, surpassing records set just last year. Extreme heat poses numerous health risks, some of which are visible on our skin. Understanding how heat affects your skin can help you take measures to prevent or ease heat rash, eczema, rosacea, the discoloration of melasma, and many other skin conditions sparked or worsened by high temperatures.
        How does heat affect your skin?
        Heat waves can provoke or worsen several skin conditions.
        
          Heat rash (miliaria) occurs due to obstruction of sweat ducts on the skin, which are responsible for helping the body maintain a normal temperature by releasing water to the surface of the skin. As these sweat glands get blocked with excessive sweat on an extremely hot day, they do not function properly and red itchy bumps develop.
          Grover disease, a rash of small, red, itchy bumps on the chest and back, can also be triggered or worsened by excessive heat and sweating. Often this clears up within a few weeks or months. Less often symptoms may persist for years, with flares during the summer months.
          Eczema is a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, itchy plaques that affects millions of people in the United States. Increased sweating during heat waves can lead to skin irritation and inflammation, aggravating eczema symptoms. Dehydration caused by fluid loss through sweating can make the skin more susceptible to eczema flare-ups.
          Rosacea, which causes facial redness, visible blood vessels, and acne-like bumps, is also heat-sensitive. Heat causes blood vessels to dilate as the body attempts to cool itself, resulting in visible redness and flushing. High temperatures, especially combined with sun exposure, can cause flare ups.
          Melasma. Hyperpigmentation disorders like melasma also worsen with heat. Melasma is characterized by irregular dark patches on the face and is often triggered by UV exposure from the sun. Heat can increase the activity of melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment, making these patches more pronounced. Additionally, the combined effects of heat and UV radiation accelerate collagen and elastin degradation, leading to premature aging and loss of skin elasticity.
          Skin cancer risk rises with increased exposure to UV radiation. Heat waves — now beginning earlier, ending later, and lasting longer — contribute to UV exposure, particularly among people who work outdoors. And preliminary research suggests prolonged exposure to high temperatures may further boost skin cancer risk. This could be of particular concern for firefighters, who face extended exposure to extreme heat.
        
        Heat waves, air pollution, and skin
        During heat waves, levels of environmental pollutants like ozone and particulate matter can rise. And reactions between these pollutants, heat, and UV radiation spawn secondary pollutants such as peroxyacetyl nitrates (PANs). Pollutants like these can irritate the skin and contribute to inflammation through oxidative stress and DNA damage, so inflammatory conditions such as eczema and rosacea may worsen.
        Can heat affect medications?
        High temperatures compromise the effectiveness of certain medications. For instance, EpiPens, which are crucial for managing life-threatening allergic reactions, can lose their potency when exposed to high temperatures. Check the instructions on all of your medicines to see which ones should be stored in a cool, dry place or refrigerated. If you're not sure which medicines might be affected by heat, talk to your pharmacist or doctor.
        Retinoids in skin care products, antibiotics taken for acne, and immunomodulators for autoimmune diseases can make skin more susceptible to sun damage. This can lead to severe sunburns or rashes known as photodermatoses. If you experience this, contact your health care team for advice.
        Protect your skin when temperatures climb
        Keep skin cool
        
          Wear light, breathable clothing. Choose natural fibers like cotton and linen to help regulate body temperature and prevent sweat-induced skin issues. Avoid synthetic fabrics, which can trap heat and moisture.
          Take cool baths or showers. Use cool or tepid water to bathe. Avoid hot showers, which can strip the skin of natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation.
          Find cool spaces. If your home is not air-conditioned, seek out cooler places and ways to cool off during heat waves.
        
        Keep skin hydrated
        
          Drink ample water and eat water-rich foods. Foods like watermelon and cucumbers can provide additional hydration.
          Moisturize your skin. Apply light, non-comedogenic moisturizers immediately after bathing. Look for ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin, which are beneficial for enhancing skin hydration.
        
        Limit exposure to sun and pollution
        
          Use protective clothing. Wear wide-brimmed hats, UV-blocking sunglasses, and long-sleeved shirts to shield the skin from harmful radiation.
          Wear sunscreen. Apply broad-spectrum mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, or iron oxide to protect against UV radiation and pollutants.
          Use topical antioxidants. Use products like vitamin C in your morning skin care routine to mitigate oxidative stress.
          Wash up. Cleansing face and body at the end of the day may help you limit skin exposure to pollutants while also rinsing off any sunscreen residue.",Kathyana P. Santiago Mangual,"August 14, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/lifestyle-strategies-to-help-prevent-natural-age-related-decline-in-testosterone,Lifestyle strategies to help prevent natural age-related decline in testosterone,"As men get older, their testosterone levels naturally decrease, which can cause undesirable symptoms for some. However, adopting healthy lifestyle habits can help improve or maintain testosterone levels.
        What is testosterone and what does it do?
        Testosterone is a hormone primarily produced in the testes. It plays a crucial role in male development and characteristics, influencing muscle mass, bone density, and sex drive. It's also important for regulating mood and cognitive function.
        Testosterone levels change throughout life: they are low before puberty, increase sharply during puberty, and then gradually decrease by about 1% each year, although there are some exceptions.
        What can cause levels of testosterone to drop?
        Signals from the brain to the pituitary gland regulate testosterone production in men. The pituitary gland, which is found at the base of the brain, sends messages to the testes to produce testosterone. A ""feedback loop"" carefully monitors levels of this hormone in the blood.
        Anything that affects this system can contribute to declining testosterone levels. Aging is the most common cause, but other genetic and acquired conditions can also lead to drops in testosterone. These include:
        
          
            obesity
          
          chronic diseases, such as kidney disease, diabetes, lung disease, and cirrhosis
          critical illness, such as a heart attack, surgery, or head trauma
          certain medications, such as glucocorticoids (steroids) and opioids
          congenital disorders, such as Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome
          stress
          
            sleep apnea
          
          tumors.
        
        What are the symptoms of low testosterone?
        Many men with low testosterone never have symptoms. When symptoms do occur, low testosterone can cause a range of effects. Some symptoms are general, such as fatigue, poor concentration, and mood changes. Others are more specific, such as:
        
          reduced sex drive
          
            erectile dysfunction
          
          infertility
          physical changes including decreased muscle mass, increased body fat, and thinning hair.
        
        If you have any of these symptoms, ask your doctor if it might be related to low testosterone. He or she can order a blood test to check the level. Because blood testosterone levels can fluctuate, it's important to do the test in the morning before 10 a.m. In general, a normal total testosterone level is 300 ng/dL or higher.
        Natural ways to help maintain testosterone levels
        Certain lifestyle habits can help slow the natural testosterone decline that comes with age. Doctors often recommend a trial of intense lifestyle changes for men with low testosterone before considering medications.
        Here are some natural ways to maintain and improve testosterone levels as you age.
        Maintain a healthy weight and lose weight if needed
        Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for testosterone levels. Excess body fat, particularly around the abdomen, can contribute to lower testosterone. Losing weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise can help boost testosterone production up to 30%, according to some research.
        Exercise
        Regular physical activity is one of the best ways to maintain healthy testosterone levels. Both resistance training like weightlifting, and cardiovascular exercises such as running or swimming, can increase testosterone.
        The largest improvements are seen with moderate- or high-intensity resistance exercises involving large muscle groups, such as squats and bench presses.
        Other lifestyle changes
        Other factors that can affect testosterone levels include:
        
          Diet. Well-rounded diets full of healthy fats, proteins, and nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables support healthy testosterone production. Foods that have been linked to increased testosterone include onions, oysters, fatty fish (which contains healthy omega-3 fats), and extra virgin olive oil.
          Alcohol. Excessive alcohol consumption can lower testosterone levels, impair sexual function, and reduce sperm count due to hormone disruption. Reduce or avoid alcohol, or at least limit your intake to no more than one drink per day.
          Smoking. Nicotine found in cigarettes and chewing tobacco has been linked to lower testosterone levels, though some studies suggest smoking may not affect or could even increase these levels. However, smoking can negatively affect male reproductive health, including sperm count, motility, and morphology. Quitting smoking may help some men restore a normal testosterone level.
          Environmental toxins. Chemicals found in certain plastics, including bisphenol A or BPA, disrupt hormone-producing glands and have been associated with decreased testosterone levels and reduced sperm count. Try to avoid BPA-containing products such as plastic bottles, containers, and certain canned foods. Instead, look for ""BPA-free"" labels.
        
        The role of sleep in testosterone production
        Adequate sleep is essential for maintaining testosterone levels. Most testosterone release occurs during sleep, particularly during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage.
        Sleep apnea, a condition in which you stop breathing for short periods while you are asleep, can negatively affect hormone levels, including testosterone.
        Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night to support healthy hormone production. If you have sleep apnea or are concerned you may have symptoms of this condition, talk with your doctor about treatment options.
        Manage stress to help libido
        Chronic stress can also negatively impact testosterone levels and libido. High stress increases cortisol, a hormone that can interfere with testosterone production.
        Stress affects not only the body but also the mind. It can cause mental distractions and make it hard to focus on or enjoy sex. Additionally, stress can impact your mood, potentially leading to anxiety and depression, both of which can reduce your interest in sex.
        Enhancing mental well-being through relaxation techniques and mindfulness, and adopting a healthier lifestyle to minimize the negative effects of stress, are important for maintaining testosterone levels and healthy libido.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","August 13, 2024"

        What are heart palpitations?
        Have you ever noticed your heart seeming to beat more forcefully or faster than usual? This is known as heart palpitations. They happen to a lot of people — in fact, they are one of the top reasons people see their primary care provider or even a cardiologist.
        Heart palpitations may feel uncomfortable, but most of the time they're harmless. They should always be checked out by your doctor, however, in case they're being triggered by an underlying medical condition.
        What do heart palpitations feel like?
        If you have heart palpitations, you may feel like your heart is pounding or racing. You may also feel it not just in your chest, but in your neck. Some people describe a sensation of ""flip-flopping"" in their chest, where their heart seems to skip a beat.
        Some people experience heart palpitations all day. Others just notice heart palpitations at night, during exercise, or in times of stress.
        What causes heart palpitations?
        There are many different causes of heart palpitations. These include:
        Physical stress or strong emotions. Heart palpitations can be brought on by physical stress, such as intense exercise, or a fever. They can be triggered by strong emotions as well. When you are upset, your body releases stress hormones that can affect your heart rate.
        Heart conditions. Sometimes heart palpitations are due to an electrical misfire in your heart that causes it to beat quickly or erratically. One of the most common causes is atrial fibrillation, a rapid, irregular heartbeat.
        Hormonal changes. Up to 42% of perimenopausal women and 54% of postmenopausal women report that they experience heart palpitations.
        Certain substances. Caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine can all trigger heart palpitations.
        Metabolic changes. Low blood sugar can lead to heart palpitations. You may also experience them if your body produces too much thyroid hormone, a condition known as hyperthyroidism.
        Do you need to worry about heart palpitations?
        See your doctor if you have heart palpitations; most of the time, they can find the trigger. The evaluation usually involves a test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical signals of your heart.
        If you have heart palpitations but a normal ECG, your doctor may ask you to wear a heart monitor for a couple of weeks. You push a button on the portable device when you feel a heart palpitation, and that information is sent to your doctor. It can help to pinpoint a cause.
        Sometimes, heart palpitations can indicate a heart attack or stroke if they occur along with other symptoms. Call 911 if you also experience:
        
          shortness of breath
          chest pain or pressure — it may be constant, or it may come and go
          chest discomfort that radiates into your arms, back, stomach, neck, or jaw
          sweating, nausea, or lightheadedness.
        
        Lifestyle changes to prevent heart palpitations
        If your heart palpitations aren't due to an underlying medical condition, the following lifestyle changes may help to prevent them or reduce their frequency.
        Try vagal maneuvers. These are physical movements you can do to stimulate your vagus nerve, which helps to control your heart rate. Your doctor may recommend that you:
        
          cough
          hold your breath and bear down, like you are having a bowel movement
          place an ice-cold towel over your face.
        
        Steer clear of certain substances. Limit caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, certain soft drinks, and even chocolate. Don't have more than one alcoholic beverage per day. More than that can promote palpitations in some people, and it increases the risk of atrial fibrillation. In addition, don't smoke or consume nicotine-containing products.
        Tweak your medications. Certain drugs can trigger heart palpitations. These include asthma inhalers and some over-the-counter cough and cold medications. Your doctor may be able to suggest alternatives.
        Manage stress. If you are depressed or anxious, your body releases stress hormones that can impact your heart rate. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to help you manage your emotions, such as regular exercise, talk therapy, and relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/weighing-in-on-weight-gain-from-antidepressants-202408023063,Weighing in on weight gain from antidepressants,"If you're struggling with depression, the most important question about taking an antidepressant is whether it will work. But another question on your mind may be whether it will fuel weight gain.
        A new study provides some context by suggesting how much weight, on average, people taking one of eight commonly used antidepressants might expect to gain. This insight is valuable, since people with depression often stop taking antidepressants because they don't like the effect on their weight, a Harvard expert says.
        ""It's important to acknowledge that weight gain is a key reason that some people decide to stop antidepressants, even if they're otherwise working well,"" says Dr. Roy Perlis, associate chief of psychiatric research at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""It's also a reason people may be reluctant to start them in the first place, even if they're quite depressed or anxious.""
        What did the study look at?
        Published July 2024 in Annals of Internal Medicine, the new study drew on data from more than 183,000 people between ages 20 and 80. Their average age was 48, and 65% were women. Most were overweight or obese at the study's start.
        The researchers analyzed participants' electronic health records and body mass index. They gauged weight gain or loss at regular intervals — six, 12, and 24 months — after people began taking an antidepressant for the first time.
        The study compared the weight-related effects of sertraline (Zoloft) to seven other antidepressant medications:
        
          escitalopram (Lexapro)
          paroxetine (Paxil)
          duloxetine (Cymbalta)
          citalopram (Celexa)
          fluoxetine (Prozac)
          venlafaxine (Effexor)
          bupropion (Wellbutrin).
        
        What did the research find?
        The antidepressants led to the following average weight gain:
        
          sertraline: Nearly 0.5 pounds at six months; 3.2 pounds at 24 months
          escitalopram: 1.4 pounds at six months; 3.6 pounds at 24 months
          paroxetine: 1.4 pounds at six months; 2.9 pounds at 24 months
          duloxetine: 1.2 pounds at six months; 1.7 pounds at 24 months.
        
        Citalopram, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine didn't confer lower or higher odds of weight gain than Zoloft, the study found. And only bupropion was associated with a small amount of weight loss — 0.25-pounds — at six months. But that trend reversed at 24 months, when bupropion led to an average weight gain of 1.2 pounds.
        What does the study tell us?
        ""Weight gain is common among antidepressant users, even if the amounts gained on average are modest,"" says Dr. Perlis, who was not involved in this new study. It underscores similar findings from other studies of antidepressants, including research he published with colleagues a decade ago.
        ""While differences in weight gain for specific antidepressants tend to be small, there are certainly some — like bupropion — that tend to cause less weight gain,"" he notes.
        It's crucial to keep in mind that the study points out average weight gain. Many people taking antidepressants won't gain any weight and others could gain more. ""Still, having average values to work with — and seeing that these averages line up well with prior studies — at least lets us give people a sense of what they might expect,"" he says.
        ""One caution is that some people lose weight as a result of depression, which can impact appetite,"" he adds, ""so some of what we're seeing may be people regaining weight they'd lost as their depression or anxiety improves.""
        What additional limitations did the study have?
        Other limitations may have shaped the findings. The study was observational, meaning it cannot prove that antidepressants cause weight changes, only that they were linked with them. It wasn't a randomized, controlled trial — considered the gold standard in research — and the participants taking antidepressants weren't compared to a control group not taking the medications.
        Additionally, only about one in three participants was still taking their initially prescribed medication six months after the study started. That makes it difficult to link any later weight changes with a specific medication.
        ""As with any study that's not randomized, we don't know if the differences between medicines could reflect other differences in who gets prescribed these medicines,"" Dr. Perlis says. ""But, for circumstances where a randomized trial is unrealistic, health records can be a helpful way of trying to study side effects and at least generate a partial answer to these important questions.""
        What else should you consider?
        Another thing to consider, if you're taking an antidepressant, is what types of side effects you're willing to tolerate in pursuit of its mood-smoothing benefits.
        ""The best way to manage side effects is to anticipate them — to have an open conversation with your doctor about the potential risks and how we'll manage them if they occur,"" Dr. Perlis says.
        What can you discuss with your doctor?
        If weight gain is a particular concern for you, you may also wish to consider nondrug treatments for depression. They include:
        
          Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy that teaches people to become aware of their thought patterns and adjust them during stressful moments to reframe their thinking.
          Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a brain stimulation therapy that is noninvasive. It uses an electromagnetic coil placed on the scalp to deliver magnetic pulses that stimulate nerve cells to brain regions involved in depression.
        
        ""We know that certain kinds of talk therapies, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, can be very effective for treating depression and anxiety disorders,"" Dr. Perlis says. ""Whether people choose talk therapy or antidepressant medications can depend on their preference. It's important to have multiple options.""",Maureen Salamon,"August 2, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/take-control-of-your-knee-pain,Take control of your knee pain,"If you've got sore knees, exercise might seem like the hardest thing you can do — but it's also one of the best.
        ""Exercise is one of the most important things you can do for knee pain,"" says Dr. Lauren Elson, an instructor in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School.
        The right combination of strengthening and stretching exercises can relieve pain by helping to improve the way the joint moves and functions.
        ""The knee is often an innocent bystander between the hip and the foot. Knee pain is often caused by problems occurring above or below,"" says Dr. Elson.
        For example, weak hip muscles may cause more strain on the knee, intensifying your pain. Strengthening the muscles around the hip joint can help relieve it, says Dr. Elson.
        In addition, knee pain is sometimes caused or aggravated by tight muscles around the knee, a problem that is often successfully addressed by stretching. If the muscles aren't flexible, the knee joint sometimes won't move properly, says Dr. Elson.
        What conditions can exercise help?
        Knee exercises and stretches can help relieve knee pain caused by many conditions, including these three that commonly affect older women:
        Patellofemoral pain. This condition typically causes a dull, aching pain in the front of the knee that's made worse by daily activities, such as squatting, going up or down stairs, or standing up after sitting for a long period of time. The pain is caused by irritation of the cartilage underneath the kneecap when it does not glide or sit properly. Exercise can help to eliminate problems that lead to this irritation. Stretches can loosen tight muscles on the side of the knee that may be pulling the kneecap out of its groove as it moves. Strengthening weak hip muscles or stretching tight muscles in the front or back of the legs can also reduce discomfort.
        Chronic degenerative meniscal tears. When one or both pads of cartilage that cushion each of your knee joints deteriorates or tears, you may feel pain and a sticking or locking sensation. While surgery is sometimes necessary, doctors usually first recommend physical therapy to help build up the muscles around the knee to take the pressure off the joint and reduce discomfort.
        Osteoarthritis. If you're over age 50 and you have stiffness, pain, or swelling, it may be osteoarthritis. Years of wear and tear can break down the cartilage in the knees, leading to chronic joint inflammation. A past injury may also lead to arthritis. While nothing can reverse these physical changes, you can reduce pain by building up the muscles around the knee as well as in the pelvis and core. Strong muscles act like scaffolding, taking some of the pressure off the joints. Stretching to increase flexibility can help the joint function properly.

                While many conditions that cause knee pain can be helped by exercise, in some instances it may not be appropriate, says Dr. Lauren Elson, an instructor in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School. You should stop exercising and see a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms:
                
                  fever
                  pain that is not improving
                  pain that intensifies with activity
                  pain that wakes you up in the middle of the night.

        Exercises to try
        To ease knee pain, you'll want to perform exercises that work a number of different muscles, from the hip abductors to the hamstrings and quadriceps, says Dr. Elson.
        Two to add to your routine are the side-leg raise, and the single-leg lift. Do this workout at least two days a week to start and ideally work up to every other day.
        How many exercises you do in each session is your choice. But keep in mind that rushing through exercises can be counterproductive.
        ""It's more important to have good form than it is to have volume,"" says Dr. Elson. Start slowly with fewer repetitions to ensure you get your form right. Then add more as it becomes easier.
        Side-leg raise
        
          
        
        Starting position: Lie on your right side, with your legs straight. Bend your right forearm upward and rest your head on your hand.
        Movement: Keep your legs straight and slowly lift your left leg up toward the ceiling. Pause, then slowly return to the starting position. Finish all repetitions, then repeat on the left side.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Throughout the movement, keep your hips straight and still as if you were lying with your back against a wall.
          Contract your abdominal muscles and keep your pelvis still (no rocking) throughout.
          Lift your leg up as high as possible without letting your hip move and while maintaining good form.
        
        Make it easier: Lift your top leg a shorter distance, or lean your back against a wall for support.
        Make it harder: Tie resistance tubing around your upper thighs, or increase the number of repetitions.
        Single-leg lift
        
          
        
        Starting position: Lie on your back with your legs straight. Extend one leg, foot slightly flexed. Rest your hands at your sides on the floor.
        Movement: Tighten your thigh muscles and slowly lift the leg in the air until your knees are aligned. Pause, then slowly lower your leg to rest on the floor. Finish all repetitions, then repeat with the other leg.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Keep your abdominal muscles contracted.
          Keep your hips on the floor as you lift one leg.
          Exhale as you lift.
        
        Make it easier: Lift your leg a shorter distance.
        Make it harder: At a slow, controlled pace, try tracing the letter T with your leg in the air. Lift up one leg four inches, move the leg four inches to the left, return to center, move the leg four inches to the right, return to center, then lower your leg to the floor. Finish all repetitions, then repeat with the other leg.
        Stretching
        You should also incorporate daily stretching into your routine. Try using a foam roller to work out the kinks in your muscles. The roller targets tight, rigid, and painful areas in both the muscles and the myofascial tissue (a layer of connective tissue around the muscles). This process, called myofascial release, which can also be performed through a hands-on massage, is designed to relax this tissue to reduce pain. It does this by releasing tension in muscles that are pulling abnormally on the knee joint, says Dr. Elson.
        Below are two stretches to try. Ideally, you should aim to do three or four repetitions of each, holding for 10 to 30 seconds each time.
        Hamstring stretch
        
          
        
        Starting position: Lie on your back with your legs straight and your arms by your side.
        Movement: Grasp your right leg with both hands behind the thigh. Extend your leg to lift your right foot toward the ceiling, foot flexed. Straighten the leg as much as possible without locking the knee to feel a stretch along the back of the right thigh. Hold. Return to the starting position and repeat with the left leg.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Stretch the leg extended toward the ceiling to the point of mild tension without any pressure behind the knee or any pain.
          Relax your shoulders down and back into the floor.
        
        Make it easier: Don't lift your leg as high, or use a strap instead of your hands to support your leg.
        Make it harder: Pull your leg closer to your chest.
        Quadriceps stretch
        
          
        
        Starting position: Stand on the floor with your feet spaced shoulder-width apart.
        Movement: Bend your right knee and bring the heel toward your right buttock. Reach back with your right hand and take hold of your foot. Hold the stretch, then slowly lower your foot to the floor. Repeat the stretch with your left leg.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Stand straight.
          Keep your bent knee aligned with the hip, not pointing out to the side.
        
        Make it easier: Lie on your stomach to do the same stretch. Place a yoga strap around your foot and hold on to both ends as you get into the starting position. Then use the strap to assist with the stretch.
        Make it harder: Doing the stretch on your stomach, lift your knee off  the floor slightly, without pulling your foot, to increase the stretch.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/top-5-ways-to-reduce-crippling-hand-pain,Top 5 ways to reduce crippling hand pain,"Hand pain is more than just annoying. The stiffness and swelling that go along with hand pain can sap strength and diminish the ability to carry out routine functions, like buttoning clothes.
        One common cause of hand pain is osteoarthritis—when the shock-absorbing cartilage between bones in the finger joints and at the base of the thumb becomes worn or damaged. Hand pain can also result from nerve conditions, like the pain and tingling you feel when there is pressure on the median nerve in the wrist (the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome) or the ulnar nerve near the elbow. Sometimes hand pain results from tendinitis, an inflammation of the tissue that attaches muscles to the bones. Here are five methods to help manage hand pain, retain hand function, and avoid surgery.
        1. Splinting
        A splint stabilizes the position of your fingers, thumb, or wrist. You can wear a splint for a few weeks if arthritis flares, so the inflammation can settle down.
        2. Injections
        An injection of a corticosteroid into a joint can reduce inflammation. The relief it provides can last for many months. For some people the amount of relief diminishes with subsequent injections.
        3. NSAIDs
        A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) helps relieve hand pain by blocking enzymes that produce pain and swelling, but it's not effective for carpal tunnel syndrome. Long-term use of oral NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are linked to ulcers, stomach bleeding, liver damage, and increased risk of heart attacks. Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac (Voltaren), pose less risk.
        4. Heat and cold
        Heat can loosen hand stiffness. Even a hot shower will do the job. Cold is effective for hand pain that results from activity, such as playing golf. Apply it in the form of flexible gel pads you keep in the freezer, or even bags of frozen peas or corn, which conform well to the three-dimensional complexities of the hand.
        5. Exercises and stretches
        These focus on your hand's tendons and muscles. A physical therapist or occupational therapist can guide you through exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles, which can help absorb the stress on joints in the hand and reduce pain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tackling-the-top-stressors-for-dementia-caregivers,Tackling the top stressors for dementia caregivers,"Caregiving is a demanding job that you commit to out of love, loyalty, compassion, and often necessity. And when the person you're caring for has dementia, the job is especially difficult. It comes with a long list of physical, financial, logistical, and emotional challenges. Which are the most difficult, and how can you cope?
        Recent findings
        A 2024 Alzheimer's Association survey highlights the stressors caregivers say are most burdensome. The survey included more than 1,500 current or recent unpaid caregivers of adults ages 50 or older with cognitive problems. The top five stressors were costs, coordinating numerous doctor visits, securing doctor appointments, finding the right doctors, and getting help to take a break (respite care).
        Only half of the caregivers surveyed had ever spoken with health care professionals for guidance.
        Physical and emotional tolls
        Caring for a person with dementia is physically and emotionally demanding. For example, you might need to help a loved one with bathing, dressing, eating, and getting in and out of a car. It takes physical strength and stamina.
        Caregiving also puts you through an emotional wringer. It's common to feel frustration with the unpredictability of your loved one's behavior: one day they understand and recognize you, but the next day they don't. You might feel helpless if you don't know how to communicate with a loved one or how to cope with dementia-specific behaviors such as sundowning (meltdowns at the end of each day). You might feel anguish that they might not be getting adequate care. Above all, you probably feel grief at gradually losing the individual you once knew.
        ""Caregivers might also experience anger from the demands of nonstop caregiving. Then, recognizing their anger, caregivers might immediately feel guilty about resenting the loved one or having a desire to take time for themselves,"" says Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        The combination of stressors puts caregivers at high risk for burnout, high blood pressure, sleep problems, depression, isolation, weight changes, and even premature death.
        What you can do
        Resolving caregiving challenges is an ongoing process. Here are some ways to get started.
        For logistical challenges: Talk to your loved one's doctors about whether you can consolidate numerous appointments on the same days or do some visits as a video or phone call.
        For help finding services: Your local Area Agency on Aging can provide a free comprehensive list of services tailored to your loved one's needs and connect you to the people who provide them. The agency can also guide you to groups in your area that might help pay for services such as respite care or transportation.
        Alternatively, ask your local health care system if it has a comprehensive dementia care program that provides similar help. Many systems are ramping up dementia care navigation services as a result of a new initiative from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services called Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE). It pays providers to offer caregiver training, help lines, care navigators, and individual care plans.
        You can also turn to the ARCH National Respite Network and Resource Center, a national resource program to direct you to respite services in your area.
        For help coping emotionally: Join a free caregiver support group — either online, such as those offered by the Family Caregiver Alliance, or in person (if time permits) at a senior center or local hospital. Or work with a therapist online (it's covered by your own Medicare). ""For example, if you feel guilty about negative emotions, a therapist might acknowledge your struggle with guilt and help you understand that perfection is impossible. You'll be guided to establish realistic goals,"" Dr. Collier says.
        To avoid burnout: ""Caregiving often requires a team, so don't feel bad asking for help from friends and family or hiring health aides at home,"" Dr. Collier says. ""The assistance can give you a much-needed break. And taking time for yourself is not just okay, it's recommended. You need to exercise, get enough sleep, see your doctors, and take part in pleasurable activities, such as spending time with friends or reading a book. Caregiving is a marathon, with endless things to do, but you must set the priority to recharge regularly.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-i-use-a-continuous-glucose-monitor,Should I use a continuous glucose monitor?,"Q.  I'm overweight, but don't have diabetes yet. Should I use a continuous glucose monitor, like people with diabetes do?

A. Increasingly, new technologies are allowing us to monitor how our body is functioning. Smart watches and specialized rings monitor the number of steps we take and flights we climb, our heart and breathing rates, and our blood oxygen levels.

People with diabetes need to monitor their level of blood sugar, often multiple times a day, to make sure it doesn't get either too high or too low. When I was beginning my medical career, measuring blood sugar levels required a venipuncture (using a needle to take a blood sample). That was not something a patient could do, so instead we asked patients to collect several urine samples a day and use a kit to measure the level of sugar in it. That gave a crude indication of when blood sugars were too high, but didn't help determine when sugars were too low.

Then, new technology allowed people to prick a fingertip, collect a drop of blood on a special test strip, and use a machine to measure the blood sugar level. This was more accurate than the urine testing and much more feasible than multiple venipunctures each day, but people didn't much like pricking their fingertips. Neither did their fingers.

Then came continuous glucose monitoring technology. A small device sticks to the skin, and a tiny sensor on the underside of the device painlessly pushes into the skin. The sensor continuously monitors the level of sugar and sends that information wirelessly to another device (such as a smartphone) where a person can easily see their sugar level. With some devices, an alarm goes off when the sugar is too high or too low. Continuous glucose monitors can be expensive and are not always covered by insurance.

You ask if you should use a continuous glucose monitor, even though you do not have diabetes. There are relatively few studies of that question. At this time, there is no solid evidence of the value of these monitors in people who do not have diabetes.

What will future studies show? I'm much better at predicting the past than predicting the future, but here goes: my bet is that these devices will have no value in people who have no risk factors for diabetes. On the other hand, they may prove to have value in some people who have risk factors for diabetes — such as people who are overweight (like you), people with prediabetes whose blood sugar levels are somewhat high, and people for whom diabetes runs in the family. But this will need to be scientifically established before it's worth using such monitors. Or before insurance is likely to pay for them.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tips-to-change-your-night-owl-lifestyle,Tips to change your night-owl lifestyle,"Do you naturally stay up until the wee hours and sleep late in the morning? Do you feel more creative, productive, or focused in the afternoon or evening than you do in the morning? If so, you're probably a ""night owl."" That's the opposite of a ""morning lark,"" someone who wakes with the sun and goes to sleep early.
        For a long time, doctors believed there were no health differences between night owls and morning larks as long as you got the optimal seven to nine hours of sleep per night. But that thinking is changing. So it might be time to consider if you should try to shift your sleep pattern.
        Night owl risks
        A growing amount of evidence suggests that being a night owl may increase the risk of developing many health problems.
        For example, a 2023 Harvard-led study of about 64,000 healthy middle-aged women, followed for eight years, found that those who said they were night owls were 72% more likely to develop diabetes than morning larks. The night owls were also more likely than morning larks to be overweight and have an unhealthy life-style — drinking a lot of alcohol, smoking, eating a poor diet, and getting too little sleep. Even after scientists calculated the impact of those lifestyle factors on health, the night owls were still 19% more likely to develop diabetes than morning larks.
        In addition, a 2021 study of almost 137,000 middle-aged and older adults suggested that having a bedtime past 10 p.m. was tied to a 20% greater risk of having obesity or a dangerously large waistline (35 or more inches for women, 40 or more for men), compared with people who went to bed between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The risk for obesity was even higher (35% to 38%) among people who went to bed between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Night owls in this study also slept fewer hours (six or seven hours per night) than morning larks (eight or nine hours per night).
        The risks of little sleep
        The fact that night owls sometimes sleep less than morning larks only adds to the risk. Sleep is the time when the brain flushes out toxins and consolidates memories and new bits of information. It's when our muscles and cells rebuild.
        Getting an inadequate amount of good-quality sleep is linked to poor concentration; increased risks of falls, broken bones, and car crashes; a weakened immune system; and many diseases, such as dementia, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, stroke, obesity, and depression.
        The power of darkness
        The typical human sleep-wake cycle makes the desire for sleep strongest between midnight and dawn, when it's dark outside.
        ""We sleep best, with the highest-quality sleep, when the sun is down. That's just how we're wired,"" says Dr. Kenneth Sassower, a pediatric and adult sleep neurologist at Harvard-­affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""If you're a night owl and you don't go to sleep until the middle of the night, you're not maximizing the number of hours you can sleep in darkness. The sun comes up soon after your bedtime, which might lead to poor-quality or interrupted sleep.""
        
          
            
              
                Tips for success
                Give yourself the best chance of successfully shifting your sleep-wake cycle by following good sleep hygiene.
                
                  Exercise daily, but not too close to bedtime.
                  Avoid alcohol and spicy food close to bedtime.
                  Create a sleep ritual an hour before bed: turn down the lights, turn off the TV and computer screens, and do a quiet activity (like reading).
                  Sleep in a cool, dark room, and make sure your bed and bedding are comfortable.
                
              
            
          
        
        Changing your sleep schedule
        It's not that the evidence is so strong that night owls should definitely go to sleep and awaken earlier. But the evidence is convincing enough that it's worth a try, particularly if you're not sleeping long enough or if the bulk of your sleep isn't occurring when it's dark outside.
        Is it possible to shift your sleep-wake cycle, even if you're not wired to go to bed earlier? ""Yes, but it's a slow process,"" Dr. Sassower says. He recommends the following steps.
        Set a bedtime goal. Dr. Sassower suggests aiming for a bedtime between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., so you'll get at least five hours of sleep in darkness.
        Gradually go to bed earlier. ""You can't just start going to sleep hours earlier and expect to make a lasting change to your sleep-wake cycle. Your brain won't comply,"" Dr. Sassower says. He advises rolling back your bedtime by 20 minutes every five days, until you reach your desired bedtime.
        For example, if you currently go to sleep at 1 a.m. each night and would prefer a bedtime of about 11:30 p.m., go to sleep at
        12:40 a.m. for five nights
        then 12:20 a.m. for five nights
        then midnight for five nights
        then 11:40 p.m. for five nights
        then 11:20 p.m. indefinitely.
        Use medication. Until you reach your bedtime goal, it might help to take melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle. If you use an over-the-counter supplement, you should take it two hours before bedtime. It would be more effective, Dr. Sassower says, if you take a more potent prescription version of melatonin, a drug called ramelteon (Rozerem), at bedtime. You'll have to talk to your doctor about that.
        Set a wake time. ""Don't get up late,"" Dr. Sassower says. ""You need a consistent wake time to train the brain. Don't make it any later than 9 a.m.""
        Be patient. Once you've reached your bedtime goal, it will take about 90 days to officially establish the new sleep schedule and make it stick. ""I'm not saying it's easy,"" Dr. Sassower says, ""but it can be done. And you'll probably sleep better, feel the difference, and improve your health.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/stroke-rates-holding-steady-for-people-65-or-older-but-increasing-among-younger-people,"Stroke rates holding steady for people 65 or older, but increasing among younger people","Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability and death, and it's not just a golden-years problem. A study published May 23, 2024, in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report indicates that stroke rates are rising in middle-aged and even young adults. Researchers analyzed self-reported data from more than a million people surveyed during 2011 to 2013 and again in 2020 to 2022. In the decade between the surveys, stroke rates remained the same in people ages 65 or older but increased almost 16% among people 45 to 64 years old, and almost 15% among people ages 18 to 44. Scientists say the increase might be due to higher rates of obesity, high blood pressure, and opioid use. It's a good reminder to follow a healthy lifestyle no matter how old you are — eating a healthy diet, exercising, managing stress, and getting enough sleep — and to learn to recognize the signs of a stroke: weakness or numbness on one side of the body, vision changes, difficulty speaking or understanding, dizziness, and an excruciating headache. All stroke symptoms come on suddenly.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-brief-bout-of-anger-may-be-bad-for-your-blood-vessels,A brief bout of anger may be bad for your blood vessels,"A short episode of anger may have adverse effects on the cells lining the blood vessels, according to a new study. The findings, published May 7, 2024, in the Journal of the American Heart Association, may help explain the long-observed link between negative emotions and an increased likelihood of heart problems.
        For the study, 280 apparently healthy adults were randomly assigned to one of four tasks that lasted just eight minutes: recalling a personal memory that made them angry; recalling a time they felt anxious; reading a passage meant to evoke sadness; or repeatedly counting to 100 to evoke a neutral state. Researchers tracked changes in blood vessel dilation using special probes placed on the participants' index fingers. They also measured markers of cell injury or reduced repair capacity in blood vessels before and then three, 40, 70, and 100 minutes after the task.
        People in the anger group showed signs of impaired blood vessel function compared with the neutral group—an effect that lasted 40 minutes after the task. The anxiety and sadness groups showed no such changes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/rethinking-hdl-cholesterol,Rethinking HDL cholesterol,"Cholesterol, a waxy, pale yellow fat, travels through the bloodstream in tiny, protein-covered particles called lipoproteins that mix easily with blood. You need cholesterol to create cell membranes, make hormones, and synthesize vitamin D, among other things. But if you're trying to avoid heart disease, you should keep tabs on your blood cholesterol values — especially your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol. Too much LDL in the bloodstream helps to create artery-clogging plaque, raising your risk of a heart attack.
        Your cholesterol report (also called a lipid profile or lipid panel) also includes your high-density lipoprotein (HDL); see the table below for recommended values. HDL has long been referred to as ""good"" cholesterol, based on observational studies dating back decades showing that people with high HDL levels are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease.
        However, the scientific understanding of HDL has evolved in the ensuing years, and many cardiologists now believe that HDL may be more of a bystander rather than a ""good guy"" that helps lower heart disease risk. ""Higher HDL levels are closely linked with behaviors like eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise,"" says Dr. Stephen Wiviott, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Talking trash about HDL
        Researchers have also discovered that the way HDL functions and its role in the body are more complex that once believed. ""The analogy that's often used to describe HDL is a garbage truck, because it picks up extra cholesterol, or garbage, from the bloodstream and the arteries and then transports it to the liver, where it's recycled or disposed,"" says Dr. Wiviott. That was the rationale behind the creation of experimental drugs that raised HDL levels dramatically — between 60% and 100%.
        Over the past decade, large clinical trials tested five of these drugs (known as CEPT inhibitors) in people with low HDL levels. But while the drugs reliably raised HDL levels, they didn't achieve the most important goal: preventing heart attacks, strokes, and other complications from clogged arteries. Maybe, the thinking went, it wasn't the number of garbage trucks that mattered but how good they were at picking up trash. That is, maybe the drugs increased the wrong kind of HDL cholesterol.
        It turns out that HDL comes in different shapes and sizes. Some types are spherical, while others are doughnut-shaped. Some types of HDL are great at plucking excess cholesterol from LDL and artery walls (a process referred to as reverse cholesterol transport), while some are not.

        A better garbage truck?
        What if you had an HDL-based drug specifically designed to improve reverse cholesterol transport? Think of it as an empty garbage truck with a better trash compactor. But when investigators tested four weekly infusions of this type of experimental drug on more than 18,200 recent heart attack survivors, it was no better than a placebo in preventing heart attack, stroke, or death, as detailed in a study published May 2, 2024, in The New England Journal of Medicine. ""It's yet another point of reference to suggest that targeting HDL with medications may not be helpful,"" says Dr. Wiviott.
        But these findings shouldn't distract you from focusing on the factors you can control — namely, making sure your LDL is below 100 milligrams per deciliter, or even lower if you have heart disease (see advice about LDL-lowering strategies). That's true even if you have a high HDL level, which shouldn't be considered overly reassuring or a reason to ignore an elevated LDL value, says Dr. Wiviott.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-heart-attacks-overdiagnosed,Are heart attacks overdiagnosed?,"More than two decades ago, a now-classic study revealed an unsettling statistic: about 2% of people who showed up in emergency departments in the throes of a heart attack were mistakenly sent home without treatment. ""Failure to diagnose a heart attack is the No. 1 cause of malpractice payouts in the emergency department,"" says Dr. James Januzzi, the Hutter Family Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        What's happened since then, however, has created a different problem. Out of fear of missing the diagnosis, doctors may screen people with symptoms that are subtle, unusual, or even completely absent (see ""Heart attack symptoms"").
        Because the blood test used to detect a heart attack is so sensitive, some people are told they're having a possible heart attack (also known as a myocardial infarction, or MI) when they are not. In fact, overdiagnosis of MI is now more common than underdiagnosis, says Dr. Januzzi, who co-authored an opinion piece on this topic in the April 24, 2024, issue of JAMA.
        Failing to detect an actual heart attack (underdiagnosis) can have dire consequences. However, overdiagnosis exposes people to unneeded risks, high costs, and other downsides.
        What usually happens when people arrive in the emergency department with possible heart attack symptoms? And how can you make sure that you or a loved one receives appropriate care?
        
          
            
              
                Heart attack symptoms
                
                  Discomfort, pressure, or a squeezing sensation, usually in the center of your chest
                  Pain in one or both arms or shoulders or in your back, neck, or jaw
                  A rapid or irregular heartbeat
                  Trouble breathing
                  Feeling lightheaded, dizzy, or weak
                  Feeling ""sick to your stomach,"" possibly vomiting
                
              
            
          
        
        At the emergency department
        Most emergency departments follow a specific protocol for a suspected heart attack. Often, the first test is an electrocardiogram (ECG), a recording of the heart's electrical activity. A major heart attack — when an artery feeding your heart is blocked, choking off the blood supply to part of the muscle — usually creates a distinct signature on the ECG. However, an ECG is not very sensitive, and a normal tracing doesn't rule out a heart attack, says Dr. Januzzi. So doctors rely on a high-sensitivity troponin test, which measures a protein that rises in response to heart muscle damage.
        ""The troponin test has evolved over the years to now being so sensitive, it's rare to miss cases of MI. But because this test is so sensitive, we're detecting a lot of myocardial injury that is not related to a heart attack,"" says Dr. Januzzi. One possible cause is heart muscle inflammation (myocarditis), which can result from bacterial or viral infections, including COVID-19. Certain types of heart failure and chronic kidney disease can also cause troponin levels to rise. A single abnormal troponin level, or a value that rises slightly over time, doesn't necessarily mean you've had a heart attack.
        Unneeded testing
        One study found that a quarter of people who showed up in emergency departments received a troponin test, although fewer than half complained of chest pain. Why does this happen? One reason is that like most people, physicians tend to remember rare, unusual scenarios more than typical, everyday situations, says Dr. Januzzi. ""While 99 of 100 people who have heart attacks come in with classic symptoms, most doctors have seen at least one person who had a bizarre symptom like elbow pain that turned out to be a heart attack,"" he says. That drives a lot of excess testing, he says. Heart attacks are more common in older people, but such people are also more prone to chronic health problems that might lead to an abnormal troponin result. Consequently, they are more likely to have elevated troponin values that don't necessarily represent a heart attack.
        Overdiagnosis downsides
        People incorrectly diagnosed with a heart attack often undergo further testing (including costly imaging tests), potentially risky invasive procedures, and unnecessary hospitalizations. About one in five people diagnosed with a heart attack experiences depression, and a third face financial hardship due to medication costs. The diagnosis may also affect a person's ability to get (or afford) life insurance.
        ""If a doctor tells you that some of your test results suggest a possible heart attack, be mindful that the diagnosis requires much more than a single blood test,"" says Dr. Januzzi. Ask what other evidence points to a heart attack, such as changes on an ECG or a heart ultrasound. An accurate diagnosis is vital, as treatments for each situation differ considerably, he adds.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/chemical-pollutants-a-growing-concern-for-your-heart,Chemical pollutants: A growing concern for your heart,"Contact with toxic chemicals and pollution usually conjures up concerns about cancer or neurological problems. But hazardous substances in the environment are also implicated in the nation's leading cause of death — cardiovascular disease.
        ""The recognition that chemical pollutants can contribute to heart disease is more recent. But it's quite real,"" says Dr. Philip Landrigan, adjunct professor of environmental health at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health and an affiliate in the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Until recently, the risk from environmental pollution has been overshadowed by other classic heart disease risk factors, he explains.
        ""Cardiologists have made extraordinary progress in identifying and addressing those risks. Deaths from heart disease are far lower now than in the 1950s. But now that fewer people are smoking and more people have their cholesterol levels and blood pressure under better control, the importance of environmental exposures is getting more attention,"" he says.
        Pollution sources
        Chemical pollutants include toxins found in air, water, and soil. Of these, air pollution is the leading threat to cardiovascular health, Dr. Landrigan says (see ""The heart-related hazards of air pollution"" in the March 2022 Heart Letter).
        Other worrisome contaminants include heavy metals (especially lead); perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS; and pesticides, according to an article in the April 26, 2024, issue of Circulation Research. Where are these substances found, and how might they harm the heart?
        Lead. Anyone born before the mid-1970s was exposed to lead from breathing exhaust from cars that ran on leaded gas, says Dr. Landrigan. Residue from lead paint persists in homes and other structures built before 1978, and erosion from lead pipes (mainly in homes built before 1986) can contaminate drinking water. Hobbies such as oil painting and stained glass making can also expose people to lead.
        Although your body eliminates some lead through your urine, a portion of it goes into your bones, where it can stay for decades. Bone tissue constantly remodels itself, and that stored lead can be released back into the bloodstream as people age. Lead appears to promote heart disease risk by impairing kidney function, which raises blood pressure.
        PFAS. Known as forever chemicals because they resist chemical and biological degradation, PFAS are commonplace in daily life: they're used to coat food and beverage packaging and other products. However, PFAS are widely used in aerospace, automotive, and other industries, and the resulting industrial waste means that PFAS often end up in our drinking water and food supply.  High blood levels of these chemicals have been linked to increases in harmful LDL cholesterol and plaque buildup inside arteries.
        Pesticides. Agricultural and chemical industry workers face the highest risk from these chemicals, although people living in rural agricultural areas also can be affected by pesticide spray drift. Home pesticide use to combat weeds and insects is another possible route of exposure, and people may consume pesticide residues in food.
        What you can do
        These steps may help:
        Check your drinking water. By law, municipal drinking water suppliers must provide annual quality reports to their customers, but the water is tested before it leaves the facility. Because lead can leach into water from pipes that supply your home, testing your tap water may be prudent; the EPA provides detailed guidance. Contact your local health or environmental agency if your water comes from a private well. If your drinking water contains heavy metals, PFAS, or other contaminants, use one of the major water filter brands and be sure to replace the filter according to the instructions.
        Choose PFAS-free products. Residue and dust from certain consumer products may expose people to PFAS. These include
        
          stain-resistant carpets, upholstery, and other fabrics
          water-resistant clothing and shoes
          cleaning products
          personal care products and cosmetics, such as shampoo, dental floss, nail polish, and eye makeup
          paints, varnishes, and sealants.
        
        Look for the words ""PFAS-free"" on labels, and avoid products containing ingredients with ""perfluoro"" or ""fluoro"" in their names.
        Avoid pesticides when possible. Seek alternative, non-chemical methods to manage pests at home. Consider buying organic food, especially for the foods you eat most often.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/another-risk-related-to-atrial-fibrillation,Another risk related to atrial fibrillation,"Q. 
          My mother has atrial fibrillation. She takes a blood thinner to prevent stroke, but are there other risks she should know about?
        
        A. Atrial fibrillation (also known as afib) is a common disorder marked by a rapid, irregular heart rhythm that causes blood to pool in the heart's upper chambers, or atria. The stagnant blood can form clots, which may then travel to the brain and cause a stroke. That's why people with afib take blood thinners, which don't actually ""thin"" the blood but rather discourage clot formation. While doctors have long warned about the heightened risk of stroke with afib, a recent study found that heart failure — when the heart fails to pump adequate amounts of blood to the body — might be a risk that occurs even more often.
        For the study, researchers evaluated the health information of 3.5 million people ages 45 to 95 over a 23-year period. Among those who developed afib, heart failure was by far the most common complication. The lifetime risk of heart failure was two out of every five people — more than twice as likely as the risk of stroke, which occurred in about one in five people. The connection between afib and heart failure isn't entirely clear, but researchers suspect that the erratic and ineffective beating of the atria forces the lower chambers (ventricles) to work harder. Over time, that may take a toll on the heart's pumping ability.
        It's yet another reason people with afib should take steps to prevent the progression of their condition, as detailed in our April 2024 issue (""Update on atrial fibrillation""). But your mother should also be vigilant about the early warning signs of heart failure, which can be subtle and easy to miss. People often attribute feeling tired or a little winded to being out of shape or growing older, but these symptoms may signal a decline in the heart's pumping ability. The classic warning signs for heart failure include the following, which go by the acronym FACES:
        F: Fatigue. A weakened heart can't deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the body's needs, causing a general sense of feeling tired or fatigued.
        A: Activity limitation. Because people with heart failure tire easily, they often struggle to do everyday activities such as making a meal or taking a short walk.
        C: Congestion. The heart's poor pumping ability causes blood to back up and fluid to leak into the lungs, which can trigger coughing and wheezing.
        E: Edema or ankle swelling. Excess fluid can also collect in the ankles, legs, thighs, and abdomen, which may cause rapid weight gain.
        S: Shortness of breath. Lung congestion makes breathing difficult — a problem that's often worse when the person lies down, because excess fluid from the lower body moves up toward the lungs.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-you-reduce-your-cholesterol-without-taking-a-drug,Can you reduce your cholesterol without taking a drug?,"It's one of the most common questions people ask their doctors: How do I lower my cholesterol? Many of them hope to avoid taking drugs, while others are interested in natural cholesterol-lowering medications, like the Heart Letter reader who wrote to us recently.
        She's an active, slender 76-year-old who follows a heart-friendly diet (mostly organic fruits and vegetables, grains, and lean meats, but no red meat and no alcohol). Her blood pressure and blood sugar levels are normal, but her LDL (""bad"") cholesterol is 157 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), which is considered borderline high.
        In general, there are three main ways to lower LDL to the recommended 100 mg/dL or lower: diet, a dietary supplement, or a prescription medication, such as a statin. Here's how Heart Letter editor in chief Dr. Christopher Cannon counsels patients on this topic.
        Dietary changes
        What many people don't realize is that only about 20% of the cholesterol in your bloodstream comes from your diet — your liver and intestines make the rest. For most people, the cholesterol present in food doesn't have that much of an effect. However, most of the cholesterol in the average person's diet comes from animal-based foods such as meat and dairy, which are also high in saturated fat. Saturated fat clearly raises LDL cholesterol and should be consumed in limited amounts.
        The rest of your diet matters, too. Swap saturated fat for unsaturated fats (such as those found in vegetable oils, avocados, and fatty fish). Eat plenty of plant foods (like vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains — especially oats) that are rich in fiber, which helps lower your cholesterol by making dietary cholesterol harder to absorb from your gut.
        If you eat cheeseburgers and ice cream regularly but then gradually transition to a healthier diet, you're likely to see your LDL level fall. If your diet is already quite healthy (like the reader described above), further tweaks might not make that much of a difference. ""I often tell patients that while some people see modest reductions in their LDL after changing their diet, some do not,"" says Dr. Cannon. Still, a healthy diet has other cardiovascular benefits, even if your LDL doesn't drop very much, he adds. For example, many of the compounds found in whole, unprocessed plant foods help dampen inflammation, discouraging plaque buildup.
        Supplements
        Many dietary supplements sold in the United States claim to benefit heart health. But only three may help drive down LDL cholesterol, and only by a modest amount.
        Psyllium husk. Derived from the seeds of the Plantago ovata plant, this fiber supplement is best known as a treatment for constipation (Metamucil is one familiar brand). The powder is mixed with a liquid to make a thick gel. Psyllium husk or powder is also available in wafers, bars, and capsules. It's thought to absorb bile acids and cholesterol, which are then eliminated from the body during bowel movements. The suggested daily dose is 5 to 10 grams. An April 2024 review article in the journal Nutrients found that taking psyllium daily for a month or two can lower LDL by about 6 points, on average.
        Plant sterols. Found naturally in the cell membranes of plants like nuts, soybeans, peas, and rapeseed (the source of canola oil), these compounds (also call phytosterols) have a structure similar to cholesterol. Eating them helps limit the amount of cholesterol your body can absorb. Manufacturers offer many types of foods with added plant sterols, including margarine (such as Benecol), mayonnaise, bread, breakfast and snack bars, milk, and juice. Phytosterols are also available in capsule form. Some studies show that consuming 2 grams of plant sterols per day for at least eight weeks can lower LDL by up to 10%. However, a recent, carefully controlled four-week trial — the Supplements, Placebo, or Rosuvastatin Trial, or SPORT —  found only a 4.4% LDL reduction from plant sterols.
        Red yeast rice. Made by steaming white rice with the yeast Monascus purpureus, this red-hued extract contains monacolin K, the same active ingredient in the prescription cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin. Some studies suggest that supplements containing 4 milligrams (mg) to 10 mg of monacolin K can lower LDL between 20% and 25%. But SPORT reported a mere 6.6% LDL reduction from red yeast rice.
        ""I have several patients who've been able to lower their LDL a little bit with psyllium, which is a safe, inexpensive product,"" says Dr. Cannon. The problem with the plant sterols and red yeast rice is the same as with all dietary supplements: the amount of active ingredient is not regulated and may vary from batch to batch. If you want to try these products, do so only under a doctor's supervision and use brands tested and vetted by ConsumerLab.com, an independent testing company.
        Statins
        Unlike dietary supplements, drugs in the class known as statins contain a known amount of the active ingredient — a compound that both decreases the amount of cholesterol the body makes and boosts the liver's ability to clear cholesterol from the blood. These drugs can lower LDL between 25% and 55%.
        Note that simply having elevated LDL cholesterol doesn't necessarily mean you should be taking a statin, Dr. Cannon notes. The ultimate goal is to lower your risk of heart disease, and other factors (like your age and other health conditions) affect your risk. He recommends using the American College of Cardiology's risk calculator. The calculator provides treatment advice about managing your LDL and other heart disease risk factors, which you can then discuss with your physician. For our reader, a moderate-intensity statin may be reasonable, according to the calculator's recommendation.
        When people are reluctant to start taking a statin, a coronary calcium score can help them make a more informed decision. Our reader's calcium score is 116, which suggests she has a small amount of plaque in her coronary arteries (see ""Should I get a calcium score?"" in the April 2023 Heart Letter for information about this test). ""But any number above zero means that the person has coronary artery disease,"" Dr. Cannon explains. Anyone with that diagnosis should get their LDL down to 70 or lower, which will prevent additional plaque buildup, he says. For someone with an LDL of 157, a statin is the most effective means to reach that goal.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/is-arthritis-preventable,Is arthritis preventable?,"Q.
          Like many 60-something women, I feel a bit achy when I wake up. But my older sister is racked with arthritis. Can I avoid it?
        
        A. You're right to be concerned, since osteoarthritis — the most common form of arthritis — affects more women than men, especially after age 50, according to the CDC. But while the risk of this ""wear and tear"" form of arthritis rises with age, developing it isn't inevitable.
        More than one in 10 cases of osteoarthritis result from earlier joint injuries, such as to the knees, shoulders, or hips. It's also more common among people with chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, or heart disease, or whose relatives have arthritis. That said, certain measures can help prevent you from developing arthritis. These include
        
          staying physically active
          maintaining a healthy weight
          engaging in low-impact exercise, such as cycling or swimming
          managing risk factors for diabetes and heart disease.
        
        Talk to your doctor about your concerns. She may also offer valuable guidance about ways to keep your joints healthier.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/decoding-poor-circulation,Decoding poor circulation,"If hair on your toes no longer sprouts or your toenails seem to grow more slowly than ever, don't dismiss these developments as just strange new quirks.
        Along with buttock pain or red, tight, or shiny skin on the legs, these are lesser-known signs that your circulatory system — the 60,000-mile network of arteries, veins, and capillaries that enables blood to carry oxygen and nutrients around the body — might not be functioning as well as it should.
        While all these vessels are connected, each type works quite differently. When problems develop, they show up differently as well — and often in a confusing variety of ways.
        ""People do pay attention to their circulation, but I don't think they understand it very well,"" says Dr. Dara Lee Lewis, a cardiologist specializing in women's heart health at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""People throw around the term 'poor circulation' without necessarily having a sense of what it means.""
        Arteries vs. veins
        Arteries and veins operate in tandem, but also in opposition: arteries deliver blood from the heart to the body, while veins return blood to the heart. This distinction influences which circulatory troubles can afflict each.
        ""I often think of vasculature as a whole separate organ system,"" says Dr. Mounica Yanamandala, a cardiologist and blood vessel specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Arteries supply blood differently to the legs than the heart, for example. And brain tissue is very different from the gut, which has moments of high demand when we eat. So the way arteries and veins have to work is very different depending on supply and demand.""
        Conditions involving the arteries are marked by diminished blood flow to an organ or body part. Often dangerous, they include
        
          recurrent chest pain (called angina)
          heart attack
          stroke
          peripheral artery disease, which reduces blood flow to muscles—typically in the legs—when plaque buildup narrows arteries far from the heart. ""A red flag is pain in the leg muscles when you walk,"" Dr. Lewis says.
        
        Circulation problems involving the veins often arise when valves in these vessels weaken, allowing blood and other fluids to pool and pressure to build. They include
        
          twisted, bulging varicose veins in the legs
          discolored skin on hands or feet
          swollen legs, ankles, or feet.
        
        Signs to watch
        Is it possible to have poor circulation and a healthy heart? Not usually. Typically, healthy blood vessels and a robust heart go hand in hand, Harvard experts say.
        Circulation problems ""can be like a canary in a coal mine,"" Dr. Yanamandala says. ""Your heart pumps blood to this network of highways and small roads that all lead to your organs. So if we find disease in the arteries, we can bet there's disease elsewhere.""
        Because of this, you should take any signs of poor circulation seriously. Follow up with your doctor if you notice
        
          chest pain
          lightheadedness
          numbness, tingling, or swelling in the arms or legs
          achy muscles in your legs, calves, or feet
          muscle loss in your legs
          slow-healing wounds
          difficulty walking distances.
        
        But some people with circulation problems notice no telltale signs. ""Many people don't have any symptoms, or don't think they do,"" Dr. Yanamandala says. They may also mistakenly attribute any clues to getting older.
        ""Again and again, I see people who think their inability to walk very far is normal, just part of aging,"" she says. ""But it's not normal.""
        
          
            
              
                Boost blood flow with these tasty choices
                It's no secret that a poor diet contributes to heart disease, which kills more than 2,500 Americans each day and remains the leading cause of death in the United States for both women and men. But avoiding what are often called inflammatory foods—such as red and processed meats, deep-fried items, and sugary treats—is only part of the dietary strategy to combat the diminished blood flow that characterizes heart disease and other circulatory conditions.
                Certain nutrients can fight inflammation, increase ""good"" HDL cholesterol, and help blood vessels widen to promote better blood flow and reduce clotting risk. Such anti-inflammatory foods tend to be high in antioxidants and fiber. They include
                
                  fruits
                  vegetables
                  olive oil
                  nuts
                  avocadoes
                  beans
                  whole grains.
                
                Meanwhile, foods that boost blood flow are naturally high in nitrates. These are compounds made of nitrogen and oxygen, which our bodies convert into nitric oxide—a molecule that relaxes blood vessels and may help lower blood pressure. (Foods with added nitrates, such as processed meats like bacon, hot dogs, and deli meats, do not have this effect and can be harmful when eaten often.) Foods naturally high in nitrates include
                
                  beets
                  celery
                  garlic
                  broccoli
                  cauliflower
                  dark chocolate.
                
                As you reach for these nourishing choices, bear in mind that doing so isn't a panacea, says Dr. Dara Lee Lewis, a cardiologist specializing in women's heart health at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""If someone's already got major blockages in their arteries, all the nitric oxide in the world is not going to help,"" Dr. Lewis says. But when combined with exercising regularly and minimizing risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, healthy eating can stave off circulation woes.
              
            
          
        
        Walking as prevention
        While aging itself can contribute to circulation problems, they're largely preventable if we control underlying risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. ""Many medications overlap that can treat all of these,"" Dr. Yanamandala says.
        Perhaps the best way to avoid circulatory issues — or nip them in the bud — is to walk for progressively longer periods and farther distances. ""One of the coolest things about arteries and veins is they have the ability to grow to try to overcome barriers,"" Dr. Yanamandala says. ""The best way to build up arteries is to exercise. When you increase the demand, muscles call out for more blood, and that signal actually prompts arteries to form to meet that demand.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/new-urine-test-may-help-identify-high-grade-prostate-cancer,New urine test may help identify high-grade prostate cancer,"Men with an elevated blood level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) often need a biopsy to diagnose cancer and determine the grade. Low-grade prostate cancers can usually be followed with active surveillance, but doctors often recommend immediate treatment for men with medium and high-grade cancers. Now, a simple urine test helps identify men without cancer and those with just low-grade prostate cancer, which may allow them to avoid a biopsy, according to a study published online April 18, 2024, by JAMA Oncology.
        The urine test, called MyProstateScore 2.0, looks for 18 different genes linked with high-grade tumors. Researchers identified the 18 genes by first examining a database of more than 58,000 prostate cancer–associated genes. They then isolated 54 genes associated with cancers classified as medium-grade or higher. Next, the team tested those 54 genes against urine samples from 761 men with elevated PSA levels who were scheduled for biopsy. This effort enabled them to pinpoint 18 genes that were consistently linked with high-grade cancer.
        The researchers applied the 18-gene test to urine samples of more than 800 men with elevated PSA levels who had biopsies and compared the results. The test correctly identified 95% of the medium-grade cancers and 99% of the high-grade cancers. According to the researchers, using the test would have reduced unnecessary biopsies by 37%.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/low-testosterone-levels-linked-to-shorter-life-span,Low testosterone levels linked to shorter life span,"Low levels of testosterone, the male sex hormone, were associated with a higher risk of death, especially from cardiovascular disease, in a study published online May 14, 2024, by Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers combined and analyzed data from 11 studies that together included more than 24,000 men ranging in age from 49 to 76. In each study, researchers measured men's testosterone levels at the start and then monitored how many deaths occurred during a follow-up period of at least five years.
        Normal testosterone levels in healthy men are between 10 and 35 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L). However, testosterone levels drop as men age. The analysis showed that men who started with testosterone levels below 7.4 nmol/L had a higher risk of dying during the study period compared with men who had higher levels. Men with levels below 5.3 nmol/L had an increased risk of heart-related deaths, such as heart attack, cardiac arrest, heart failure, and stroke.
        The possible link? The authors added that testosterone has important effects on men's body composition, which might contribute to their health outcomes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/increasing-energy-levels-for-sex,Increasing energy levels for sex,"Men want plenty of energy to fully enjoy sex. Yet as men age, many factors can diminish their energy levels and lower their libido and sexual stamina. For instance, muscle mass naturally declines, and the body becomes less efficient at producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy-carrying molecules found in cells. Testosterone levels also diminish, and sleep problems are common, leading to fatigue.
        ""Addressing these issues also can increase energy levels and keep you more active and mentally alert,"" says Dr. Martin Kathrins, director of the Men's Health Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Here's a look at these energy blockers and how to overcome them.
        ATP and muscle mass
        The best ways to increase ATP and muscle mass are with diet and strength training. Foods that contain polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and protein can boost ATP. Favoring plant-based foods, as with the DASH or Mediterranean diet can increase your intake of foods rich in these fatty acids, like fatty fish (salmon), avocados, olive oil, and nuts (almonds, walnuts).
        High-quality protein sources include beans, nuts, soy (soy milk, tofu), and poultry. Another protein source is protein powder from plants (soybeans, peas, rice, or hemp) or milk (casein or whey protein). The powder can be added to a smoothie, stirred into oatmeal, or mixed with water or milk (regular, soy, or almond).
        Strength training helps build muscle mass, which spurs your body to produce more ATP. More muscle mass also increases your basal metabolic rate, the amount of energy your body uses at rest. Like other kinds of physical activity, strength training boosts levels of energy-promoting neurotransmitters in the brain.
        Low testosterone
        Fatigue is a common side effect of male hypogonadism, a condition in which the testicles don't produce enough testosterone, the male sex hormone. On average, testosterone levels drop about 1% each year beginning in a man's late 30s and could fall by as much as 50% by age 70. (A blood test from your doctor can determine if you have low testosterone.)
        Testosterone replacement therapy, which is given via absorbable pellet implants, topical gels, patches, or injections, can often help spark energy and improve libido in men with low levels. Speak with your doctor about whether you should get your testosterone level checked and whether testosterone therapy is appropriate.
        Sleep
        Sleep is divided into two phases: REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep. Non-REM sleep involves three stages. Sleep experts believe that the last non-REM stage (known as deep sleep) plays the greatest role in energy, as it helps the body make ATP.
        Older adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. However, many older adults have trouble falling or staying asleep, which means less time spent in deep sleep and leads to daytime fatigue. Poor sleep also can increase stress levels and interfere with how your body and brain store and use energy.
        Specific problems can interfere with sleep, such as insomnia, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and nocturia (the need to urinate during the night). ""If you have problems sleeping through the night, consult your doctor to determine if you have any of these conditions,"" says Dr. Kathrins.
        Otherwise, practicing good sleep hygiene can help you get a good night's rest. For example, go to bed and get up at the same time every day, including weekends, to keep your sleep/wake cycle synchronized with your circadian rhythms.
        Establish a bedtime ritual where you give yourself an hour before sleep to bathe, brush your teeth, and relax. Use the bed only for sleeping or sex (no TV or electronic devices), and keep your bedroom dark and cool. If you take afternoon naps, keep them under 20 minutes, and don't nap later in the afternoon or within several hours of your regular bedtime.

Yang, a radiation oncologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""So far, it has been shown to help improve the care for men with prostate cancer in limited, yet effective ways.""
        A.I. refers to systems or computers capable of mimicking human thought processes to solve problems. With prostate cancer, A.I. is mainly used via software programs that apply complex computational algorithms to improve precision and efficiency in diagnosis, treatment, and management. Here's a closer look at three ways A.I. is being used in this area.
        Examining biopsies
        Men suspected of having prostate cancer based on high or rising blood levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) may have a biopsy to look for cancer. Typically, tissue samples are taken from many locations in the prostate and then examined under a microscope by a pathologist. The pathologist must determine whether the sample contains cancer cells and, if so, assign a Gleason score to indicate how aggressive the cancer cells appear to be. This can be challenging and time-consuming, particularly where there is only a small amount of cancer. The assignment of the Gleason score is also partially subjective and can vary between pathologists.
        A.I. may help speed up this process and increase the accuracy of a cancer diagnosis. Paige Prostate is the first FDA-approved A.I.-based software for this use. Like many other A.I. models, this one ""learned"" how to detect the presence of prostate cancer by training on many prostate samples where pathologists had indicated whether there is cancer present.
        The software analyzes a digital copy of the prostate biopsy slides. Then it identifies areas with the highest likelihood of harboring cancer, so the pathologist can review them. ""This can help the pathologist by flagging areas they should look at with more detail and decreases the time needed to find those areas during their initial review,"" says Dr. Yang. ""It's like putting a highlighter to the samples so some parts stand out."" This A.I. model can also provide a preliminary Gleason score for the pathologist to review and may help reduce some of the subjectivity of Gleason scoring.
        Working with MRIs
        A.I. is also starting to be used alongside MRI to more accurately identify prostate cancer. MRI is used as a diagnostic tool to identify areas within the prostate that might harbor cancer. These areas can then be directly biopsied.
        The integration of A.I. and MRI works like this: After an MRI scan is completed, the resulting images are run through A.I. software that measures the volume of the prostate gland and identifies suspicious lesions. The software assesses visible features, such as brightness and shadows, as well as those invisible to the human eye.
        When finished, the software creates a ""map"" on the image showing where cancer might lie. It provides a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score to indicate how likely a suspicious area is a clinically significant cancer. PI-RADS scores range from 1 (most likely not cancer) to 5 (very suspicious). The radiologist confirms the A.I.'s interpretation before it becomes available to other clinicians and patients.
        ""The advantage of this type of A.I. is that it aids the radiologist in more accurately and quickly identifying areas of possible cancer,"" says Dr. Yang. ""In addition to guiding prostate biopsies, this level of detailed information can help determine the cancer grade and potential treatment options. A man with low-risk cancer could go on active surveillance, while a man with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer may benefit from radiation therapy or surgery.""
        Androgen deprivation therapy
        Men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer who choose radiation therapy for the treatment of localized tumors also may benefit from A.I. Typically, these men are advised to add a short course of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to reduce their testosterone levels.
        ""However, we do not know which patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer would most likely benefit from ADT and which patients can be safely spared its side effects,"" says Dr. Yang.
        An A.I. tool called ArteraAI Prostate analyzes digitized prostate pathology slides to help identify which patients are most likely to be aided by ADT.
        ""More research is still needed to ensure this A.I. model's predictions are accurate, but preliminarily, it is an exciting potential tool that will help us make more personalized treatment recommendations,"" says Dr. Yang.
        Even with A.I.-assisted medical information in hand, doctors must still interpret the results and make their recommendations to their patients. ""It is still up to the physician to decide whether X or Y is the right diagnosis and best treatment option,"" says Dr. Yang. ""A.I. will continue to be a valuable tool, but it won't replace the human element of guiding you through the process of diagnosis, treatment, and management of your prostate cancer.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-many-roles-of-beta-blockers,The many roles of beta blockers,"Since the 1960s, beta blockers have been the most effective medicines for treating and managing many heart diseases. Today, they are one of the most prescribed classes of drugs in the United States.
        ""Beta blockers can treat a wide range of heart-related problems, and perhaps best of all, they're inexpensive and thus widely available for most people,"" says cardiologist Dr. Patrick O'Gara with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Here's a look at how beta blockers work, who may need them, and how their use has changed (or not) over the years.
        How beta blockers work
        Beta blockers lower blood pressure and slow the heart rate. The process works like this.
        Many cells throughout the body have what's known as beta receptors. There are beta receptors in the heart, blood vessel walls, lungs, kidney, and even the brain. These receptors are stimulated by the stress hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. Depending on the organ, the effects vary. In the heart and blood vessels, epinephrine and norepinephrine tend to accelerate heart rate, increase the force of heart contractions, and tighten blood vessel walls.
        Beta blockers work by blocking beta receptors. This action prevents epinephrine and norepinephrine from binding to these receptors and thereby inhibits their action inside cells. This, in turn, reduces stress on the heart, slows the heart rate, and lowers blood pressure. Of the many available beta blockers used to treat heart conditions, doctors most often prescribe metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL) or carvedilol (Coreg).
        
          
            
              
                Beyond the heart
                Beta blockers have uses not related to heart health, such as preventing migraine attacks; decreasing hand tremors; and reducing sweating, rapid heartbeat, and blushing associated with anxiety. Beta blocker eye drops are routinely prescribed to lower eye pressure in people with glaucoma.
              
            
          
        
        Old and new uses
        Many of the original heart-related uses for beta blockers have remained the same over the decades. For instance, people take beta blockers to manage atrial fibrillation (afib), an irregular and rapid heart rhythm. People with coronary artery disease take them to prevent chest pain.
        Doctors have long suggested taking a beta blocker if you have heart palpitations (a skipped, extra, or irregular heartbeat) caused by premature ventricular contractions. You also can be prescribed the drug as part of the standard therapy for heart failure — a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to provide your body with the oxygen and nutrients it needs.
        However, the use of beta blockers has evolved in some areas. For a long time, beta blockers were a mainstay for treating high blood pressure. Now, doctors have more effective therapies, such as calcium-channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor blockers. ""Beta blockers still may be prescribed if these other therapies have not worked,"" says Dr. O'Gara.
        Beta blockers play a major role in treating heart attacks. Most heart attacks are caused by insufficient blood flow to a portion of the heart, depriving heart tissue of oxygen. People hospitalized for a heart attack are given a beta blocker to slow their heart rate and reduce stress on heart muscle cells, which helps limit permanent damage.
        In the past, beta blockers were continued indefinitely after hospital discharge to protect against future heart attacks. However, new research suggests that might not be necessary for people whose heart was not damaged.
        In a study published April 18, 2024, in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers recruited 5,020 people (average age 65) who'd had a heart attack and had no significant heart damage based on an ejection fraction of at least 50%.
        Ejection fraction reflects how well the heart's left ventricle pushes out blood. An ejection fraction above 50% probably means there is no significant heart damage.
        Participants were randomly assigned to take a daily beta blocker or a placebo. They were followed for an average of 3.5 years. Afterward, the scientists found that the beta blockers provided no overall benefit. The risk of a second heart attack or death from any cause was similar regardless of whether people took the beta blocker or the placebo. The two groups also did not differ significantly in the risk of being hospitalized for afib or heart failure.
        According to Dr. O'Gara, the findings challenge the conventional belief that beta blockers are universally beneficial and necessary after a heart attack. ""This should start a conversation about the future role of beta blockers for these patients,"" he says. ""If there is no heart damage from the attack, many people can do fine using aspirin therapy and a high-dose statin to protect against another heart attack.""
        Like any medication, beta blockers have side effects. The most common are a slow heart rate and feeling cold, fatigued, or lethargic. If you suffer from any of these, talk with your doctor about modifying your dosage.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/get-moving-to-manage-arthritis,Get moving to manage arthritis,"It may be the ultimate Catch-22: many people with arthritis avoid exercise because of their painful joints, but exercise is one of the best ways to manage the pain.
        ""People with arthritis shouldn't be afraid of exercise,"" says Dr. Daniel Solomon, a rheumatologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Most exercises can be modified to match people's limitations, and the intensity adjusted as needed. Regular exercise can offer the support people need to manage their symptoms, stay active, and improve their quality of life.""
        Types of arthritis
        Although there are more than 100 types of arthritis, the most common are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
        Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage that cushions the space between bones wears away. The bones then rub against each other — particularly in the hands, shoulders, spine, knees, or hips — causing pain and stiffness in the joint and often pain in the muscles and ligaments surrounding it.
        Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system malfunctions and white blood cells attack healthy joint tissue. The result is pain, stiffness, warmth, redness, and swelling in the joints of the hands, wrists, feet, ankles, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, and even the neck.
        How exercise helps arthritis
        There is no cure for arthritis, but exercise can help you manage and reduce pain. A 2021 analysis found that exercise can raise a person's pain threshold, particularly at the affected site. So, when flare-ups do strike, they may not feel as intense. Regular exercise can help dampen inflammation and improve blood flow, which can help reduce pain. In addition, exercise increases muscle strength and helps with weight loss, which takes pressure off painful joints.
        But exercise is more than a pain reliever. ""It can increase mobility and improve balance, issues that people with arthritis struggle with,"" says Dr. Solomon. ""Exercise also is a proven mood booster and stress reducer.""
        Exercise choices for arthritis
        Which exercises are best for arthritis? It depends on the type of arthritis, its location, its severity, and other factors.
        ""This is why it's recommended you consult your doctor and see a physical therapist to tailor an exercise program around your limitations, goals, and current fitness level,"" says Dr. Solomon. ""Professional guidance also can offer safe instruction to avoid aggravating your arthritis and prevent injury.""
        While the types of exercise can vary, people with arthritis often need to focus on three areas to help manage pain and improve mobility: stretching, strength training, and low-impact aerobics.
        Stretching. Joints damaged by arthritis don't move with the same ease or range of motion as healthy joints. Activities that lengthen and strengthen the muscles surrounding your joints and improve flexibility, like yoga, tai chi, and qi gong, are especially important.
        ""A physical therapist also can prescribe an individualized stretching routine,"" says Dr. Solomon.
        Strength training. This type of exercise builds muscle, and larger, stronger muscles can reduce stress on painful joints. For example, lunges and squats help strengthen the quadriceps (muscles on the front of the thigh) and the hamstrings (muscles on the back of the thigh).
        The quads absorb some of the force when your foot strikes the ground, protecting the knee. The hamstrings help maintain full leg extension and range of motion. Strength training can be done in different ways, such as using body weight, hand weights like dumbbells and kettlebells, and resistance bands.
        Low-impact aerobics. Low-impact aerobic exercise improves endurance and mobility, which people with arthritis struggle with. ""Raising your heart rate and getting sweaty also helps reduce pain and stiffness,"" says Dr. Solomon. Good low-impact options include cycling (on the road or on a stationary bike), walking, swimming, pool aerobics, rowing, and using an elliptical trainer.
        Keep in mind that you might experience some discomfort when you begin exercising as your body adjusts to new types of movement. ""But with proper guidance and taking a slow-and-easy approach, exercise can help you control your arthritis, so it doesn't control you,"" says Dr. Solomon.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/depression-more-likely-during-perimenopause-than-before-or-after,Depression more likely during perimenopause than before or after,"Women in perimenopause are significantly more likely to experience depression than either before or after this stage, a new analysis suggests.
        The analysis, published July 15, 2024, in the Journal of Affective Disorders, reviewed seven earlier studies involving nearly 12,000 women to determine whether different stages of menopause were associated with varying depression risks. Participants' symptoms were measured using standardized questionnaires that gauged factors such as lack of interest in activities, sleep problems, and low mood.
        Researchers found that women in perimenopause — which typically lasts for three to five years before menopause and may involve mood changes — were 40% more likely to experience depression than either premenopausal or postmenopausal women. The findings emphasize the importance of screening women for depression during perimenopause and providing necessary support, study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-vacation-habits-to-continue-all-year,Healthy vacation habits to continue all year,"Picnics, beach outings, dozing in the shade: there's a reason many of us feel our best during summer getaways. But we tend to snap back into our everyday, task-oriented mindset soon after — at the expense of our bodies and minds.
        What if we could keep the best parts of our vacation routines and use them to fuel better health all year long? There are solid reasons to embrace a shift. More than four in 10 cancers are linked to lifestyle choices we can change, such as poor diet and physical inactivity. These risk factors are also among the top contributors to heart disease.
        They're also habits we tend to improve when we're away from the grind, says Dr. Kathryn Corelli, a primary care doctor and women's health specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        ""Vacation is when people take a step back and really give themselves permission and time to focus on what's important to them,"" Dr. Corelli says. ""But when they come back, suddenly those habits sort of snap back too. You lose a lot of those gains, the reasons you felt good.""
        Habits to foster
        Healthy activities we embrace on vacation and neglect the rest of the year tend to fall into two camps — doing more of some things and less of others.
        More time outdoors. Mounting evidence suggests that spending time in nature can improve a wide range of health factors, including blood pressure, by lowering stress and promoting exercise, according to a March 2023 paper in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine. ""Many of my patients spend a lot of time indoors during the year and they feel cooped up, anxious, and stressed,"" Dr. Corelli says. ""When they get outside, they always benefit.""
        More movement. Speaking of exercise, walking, swimming, biking, and hiking can seem far less of a chore when you're doing it for fun. ""Continuing some of those habits — whether going on walks or parking farther away from your destination — can be really powerful in the long term,"" she says.
        Less time online. We gain perspective when we pull back from virtual pursuits, a shift that pays big dividends for mental health. ""We spend a lot of time on screens. But that time takes away from something else, such as sleep or connecting with our kids,"" she says. ""Also, there are a lot of data supporting the idea that comparing ourselves to people online can be bad for anxiety.""
        More varied diet. Vacation food is sometimes overly rich and caloric — think of cruise ship buffets — but can also deviate gloriously from the humdrum by incorporating a wider array of mouth-watering fruits and vegetables and fewer processed foods. ""There's no perfect way to eat,"" Dr. Corelli says, ""but try to eat relatively healthy, unprocessed foods 80% of the time.""
        More dining with others. It's easier to munch more mindfully — which also helps you avoid overeating — when you're enjoying leisurely meals with family and friends instead of dashing off to the next commitment. ""We connect as humans over food; that's been in our cultural DNA for a long time,"" she says. ""People feel closer to family and friends after vacation, and we know socializing can help prevent cognitive decline.""
        More sleep. A significant part of revitalizing simply comes from getting better shuteye, without alarms or insomnia-inducing deadlines. But while those stressors may return, we can be more diligent about practicing good sleep hygiene when vacation ends by avoiding screens for an hour before bed and keeping consistent bed and wake times. ""Those things are really important for continuing the relaxation you've fostered on vacation,"" Dr. Corelli says.
        Novel brain engagement. There's a reason booksellers hawk ""beach reads"" in the summer months: people typically spend more time reading on vacation. Or maybe you while away the afternoons playing board games or completing sudoku or crossword puzzles. ""Think of it like stretching your brain — it's not on autopilot,"" she says. ""Doing this can help protect us from dementia in the long run.""
        Adjustment advice
        Before you plunge back into your everyday routine, Dr. Corelli advocates doing a bit of reflection. This could include devising a list of pros and cons for the things you did on vacation that you'd like to continue.
        ""This can be motivating,"" she says. ""Finding your own reasons for continuing or not continuing a behavior and thinking them through can get lost during our fast-paced everyday life,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/what-to-do-about-rotator-cuff-tendinitis,What to do about rotator cuff tendonitis,"Swinging a tennis racket, digging in the garden, placing a book on a high shelf, and reaching back to insert your arm into a sleeve — these are some of the movements made possible by the shoulder's enormous range of motion. We use this mobility in so many activities that when the shoulder hurts, it can be disabling. For younger people, sports injuries are the main source of trouble, but the rest of us have more to fear from the normal wear and tear that, over time, weakens shoulder tissues and leaves them vulnerable to injury. The risk is greatest for people with occupations or hobbies that require repetitive or overhead movements, such as carpenters, painting, tennis, or baseball.
        One of the most common causes of shoulder pain is rotator cuff tendonitis — inflammation of key tendons in the shoulder. The earliest symptom is a dull ache around the outside tip of the shoulder that gets worse when you push, pull, reach overhead, or lift your arm up to the side. Lying on the affected shoulder also hurts, and the pain may wake you at night, especially if you roll onto that shoulder. Even getting dressed can be a trial. Eventually, the pain may become more severe and extend over the entire shoulder.
        When severe, tendonitis can lead to the fraying or tearing of tendon tissue. Fortunately, rotator cuff tendonitis and even tears can usually be treated without surgery.
        Anatomy of the rotator cuff
        The rotator cuff comprises four tendons — the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis; each of them attaches a muscle of the same name to the scapula (shoulder blade) and the humerus, or upper arm bone (see illustration). The tendons work together to stabilize the joint, rotate the shoulder, and lift the arm above the head. Rotator cuff tendonitis usually starts with inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon and may involve the three other tendons as the condition progresses.
        
          
            
              
                Rotator cuff
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        Rotator cuff diagnosis
        Most clinicians diagnose rotator cuff tendonitis by taking a history and performing a physical examination. However, if you've suffered a traumatic injury or the shoulder hasn't improved with conservative therapy, or if a tear is suspected, an x-ray or MRI may be ordered. Your clinician will also check for tenderness at a point near the top of the upper arm (the subacromial space) and look for pain as the arm is raised and moved in certain ways. Your muscle strength and the shoulder's range of motion will also be tested. Pain with normal muscle strength suggests rotator cuff tendonitis; pain with weakness may indicate a tear (see ""What about a rotator cuff tear?""). Because it's difficult to assess strength when the shoulder hurts, your clinician may recommend an injection of a numbing agent (lidocaine) to deaden the pain before making an evaluation.
        
          
            
              
                What about a rotator cuff tear?
                As we get older, tendon tissue thins out and a tear becomes more likely. Up to one-third of older people with rotator cuff tendonitis have a tear. Minor ones can be treated conservatively, like tendonitis, but major ones may require an operation. Those caused by traumatic injury to the shoulder are often repaired surgically. However, recovery tends to be slow. Many orthopedic surgeons prefer to reserve surgery for younger patients, major tears that are diagnosed early, and older people whose occupations or activities place heavy demands on their shoulders.
                
                  
                
                The operation can be performed arthroscopically — a minimally invasive procedure in which surgical instruments are inserted through several tiny incisions — or through standard open surgery, which requires a larger incision. Some surgeons use a technique called ""mini-open repair,"" which is somewhat less invasive and uses a smaller incision. All three procedures have similar long-term results, although less invasive procedures usually result in shorter hospital stays and less postsurgical pain. However, not all types of tears can be treated arthroscopically.
              
            
          
        
        Rotator cuff treatment
        The minimum time for recovery from rotator cuff tendonitis or a small tear is generally two to four weeks, and stubborn cases can take several months. Early on, the aim is to reduce swelling and inflammation of the tendons and relieve compression in the subacromial space. Later, exercises can be started to strengthen the muscles and improve range of motion.
        During the first few days of rotator cuff tendonitis, apply an ice pack to the shoulder for 15 to 20 minutes every four to six hours. If you still have a lot of rotator cuff pain, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen, may be helpful. Your clinician may also suggest a corticosteroid injection, but there's no clear evidence that this offers any advantage in the long term over physical therapy and NSAID use.
        While you're in pain from rotator cuff tendonitis, avoid lifting or reaching out, up, or overhead as much as possible. On the other hand, you don't want to stop moving your shoulder altogether, because that can lead to ""frozen shoulder,"" a condition in which the tissues around the shoulder shrink and reduce its range of motion.
        Rotator cuff stretches
        The weighted pendulum exercise (see below) is recommended to reduce pressure on the rotator cuff by widening the space the tendons pass through. As your rotator cuff tendonitis improves, physical therapy with stretching and muscle-strengthening exercises becomes important. A physical therapist can help you with these exercises, but most of them you can also do on your own. Before exercising, warm up your muscles and tendons in a warm shower or with a heating pad. You may experience some mild soreness with muscle-toning exercises — ice applied to the shoulder should help relieve it — but if you develop sharp or severe pain, stop the exercises for a few days.
        
          
            
              
                Weighted pendulum exercise
                
                  
                    
                      
                    
                  
                
                Sit or stand holding a 5- to 10-pound weight in the hand of the affected shoulder. Use a hand weight or make one from a gallon container filled with water. Relax the shoulder and allow the arm to hang straight down. Lean forward at a 20- to 25-degree angle (if you're standing, bend your knees slightly for a base of support), and swing your arm gently in a small circle, about one foot in diameter. Perform 10 circles in each direction, once or twice a day. As symptoms improve, you can make the circle wider — but never force it.
              
            
            
              
                Stretching exercises
                
                  Warm your muscles before performing these exercises.
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
                Towel stretch. Grasp a dishtowel behind your back and hold it at a 45-degree angle. Use your good arm to gently pull the affected arm up toward the lower back. Do this stretch 10 to 20 times per day. You can also perform this exercise while holding the towel horizontally.
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
                Cross-body stretch. Sitting or standing, use the unaffected arm to lift the affected arm at the elbow and bring it up and across your body. Press gently, just above the elbow, to stretch the shoulder. Hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds. Do this exercise 10 to 20 times per day.
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
                Finger walk. Stand facing a wall at a distance of about three-quarters of an arm's length away. With the affected arm, reach out and touch the wall at about waist level. Slowly walk your fingers up the wall, spider-like, as far as you comfortably can or until you raise your arm to shoulder level. Your fingers should be doing most of the work, not your shoulder muscles. Keep the elbow slightly bent. Slowly lower the arm — with the help of your good arm, if necessary. Perform this exercise 10 to 20 times a day. You can also try this exercise with the affected side facing the wall.

                  Heat and stretch your shoulder joint before doing these exercises. Use flexible rubber tubing, a bungee cord, or a large rubber band to provide resistance.
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
                Inward rotation. Hook or tie one end of the cord or band to the doorknob of a closed door. Holding your elbow close to your side and bent at a 90-degree angle, grasp the band (it should be neither slack nor taut) and pull it in toward your waist, like a swinging door. Hold for five seconds.
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
                Outward rotation. Hold your elbows close to your sides at a 90-degree angle. Grasp the band in both hands and move your forearms apart two to three inches. Hold for five seconds.
                Do 15 to 20 sets of these exercises each day.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/big-toe-got-you-down-it-may-be-hallux-rigidus,Big toe got you down? It may be hallux rigidus,"The big toe may be small, but its role in our lives is enormous. Just imagine how hard it would be to walk, run, squat, bend over, rise up on the balls of the feet, or simply keep your balance without the aid of your big toes.
        A crucial element of big-toe function is the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, which joins the first long bone (metatarsal) in the forefoot to the first bone of the big toe (proximal phalanx). Every time you take a step, the MTP joint bends, allowing the foot to roll forward and push off. During this phase of the walking cycle, the joint supports 50% of the body's weight. If the joint doesn't function properly, not only walking, but also exercising and many other activities of daily life can be difficult, sometimes impossible. One of the most common ailments of the big toe joint is hallux rigidus — literally, ""stiff big toe.""
        
          
            
              
                Anatomy of hallux rigidus
                
                  
                
                In hallux rigidus, osteoarthritis breaks down the cartilage covering the ends of the bones that make up the big toe joint. Joint space narrows and bone spurs (osteophytes) may form.
              
            
          
        
        Hallux rigidus is the loss of flexibility in the big toe due to arthritis in the MTP joint. In an earlier stage of the condition, called hallux limitus, movement is only somewhat affected and conservative measures can often relieve pain and improve function. If pain and stiffness worsen, surgery is an option.
        How does hallux rigidus develop?
        In the MTP joint, like other joints in the body, the ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a slick substance that aids in smooth joint movement. Age-related degeneration, genetic factors, or acute injury can cause articular cartilage to break down — a process known as osteoarthritis or degenerative arthritis. Often there also is inflammation, which leads to more pain and stiffness.  Bone spurs (osteophytes) may develop on top of the bones, and the joint space may narrow, reducing the joint's motion. This can impinge on the way you walk and contribute to pain in the ball of the foot and even the back.
        It's not entirely clear why hallux rigidus develops in some people and not in others. Hereditary or congenital defects in the foot or faulty foot mechanics can place chronic stress on the big toe joint, triggering arthritis. Certain athletic injuries have also been implicated. For example, ""turf toe,"" so-named because it often happens to people who play games on artificial surfaces, is an injury to the MTP joint caused by the sudden bending back of the big toe. A toe stub or break can contribute to degeneration of the joint, as can an inflammatory condition such as rheumatoid arthritis and the metabolic disorder gout. Injury also occurs in certain dance disciplines (notably ballet) that require repetitive use of positions such as demi-pointe, which forces the MTP joint to flex at a 90° angle. Some research suggests that women are more likely to develop hallux rigidus, but studies are inconsistent.
        What to do about hallux rigidus?
        Early signs of hallux rigidus include pain and stiffness in the big toe joint during use, such as walking or exercising, especially as the foot rolls forward to push off. The joint may also become swollen and red. It's important to see a clinician early. If you wait until bone spurs develop or the toe is completely stiff or hurts all the time, restoring function can be more difficult. Also, you can develop other foot and joint problems if you start walking on the outer edge of the foot to avoid putting pressure on the toe.
        Your clinician will examine the toe and may order x-rays to check for bone spurs, cartilage degeneration, loss of space between the bones of the joint, and other possible toe problems. Treatment usually starts with conservative measures aimed at the following goals:
        
          Symptom relief. Rest, ice, and topical lidocaine or topical anti-inflammatory medications can help relieve pain. For severe pain, your clinician may recommend treating the joint with a corticosteroid injection, sometimes in combination with an anesthetic.
          Improved foot mechanics. For longer-lasting relief, it's important to correct some of the things that may be aggravating the big toe. High heels are out, and shoes with a spacious toe box are in. Your clinician may recommend a thick-soled shoe or one with a rocker bottom (like a clog), which allows the foot to roll forward as you walk, so that your big toe doesn't bend sharply. Shoe inserts (orthoses) may help correct abnormalities of the foot or problems with the way you walk that could be contributing to the problem. A shoe stretcher can be used to loosen the toe box and other areas of the shoe that come in contact with the big toe or big toe joint.
          Injury prevention. Try to avoid physical activity that places high-impact stress on the foot, such as running, jumping, and activities that involve bursts of activity and quick stops, like tennis. Swimming and bicycling are good alternatives. If the big toe isn't completely stiff, you may be able to improve its upward flexibility with some simple range-of-motion exercises. For example, grasp your big toe and gently pull it back until the point of resistance. Hold the position for 20 seconds. Repeat several times a day. A regular schedule of walking can also help.
        
        What about surgery for hallux rigidus?
        Surgery should be considered only if conservative treatment doesn't help your big toe joint pain and pain and stiffness are preventing you from wearing shoes or are limiting your normal activities. The choice of operation depends on several factors, including the extent of the osteoarthritis, the severity of pain and disability, and an individual's level of activity. Two of the  recommend procedures are cheilectomy (kye-LEK-tuh-me) and joint fusion (arthrodesis).
        During cheilectomy, the surgeon removes bone spurs and other bony material from the MTP joint through an incision along the top of the joint. Sometimes a cut (osteotomy) is made in the big toe bone to improve the toe's upward movement. A special shoe must be worn for two weeks after surgery, and swelling may last for several months. If osteotomy is involved, recovery takes longer, and weight must be kept off the foot during healing. Exercises and sometimes physical therapy are usually recommended to improve range of motion. Studies of people with mild to moderate osteoarthritis who undergo cheilectomy suggest that most of them experience big toe joint pain relief and improved joint function. Sometimes arthritis worsens, and additional surgery is recommended down the road.
        
          
            
              
                Surgery for hallux rigidus: Cheilectomy
                
                  
                
                During cheilectomy, bony material is cut away from around the joint, allowing it to bend upward more freely.
              
            
          
        
        If pain and stiffness are more severe, especially in very active people, joint fusion (arthrodesis) is usually recommended. The articular surfaces of the joint are removed, and the two bones are brought together and fixed in place. Several devices can be used to hold the bones together, including wires, pins, screws, and plates. The bones take about three months to fuse; during that time, crutches are used to keep weight off the foot. Since the resulting joint doesn't bend, the toe is turned slightly upward, to allow for walking, and shoes with rocker-type soles are usually needed. But the procedure eliminates most big toe joint pain, and people can often return to athletic activities.

                When pain and stiffness are severe, especially in very active people, surgeons often recommend joint fusion. In this procedure, the bones of the big toe joint are trimmed and joined with screws or another device.
              
            
          
        
        For moderate to severe hallux rigidus in older, less active people, surgeons often recommend arthroplasty, which removes bone from the big toe and aligns the bones of the joint with a pin (which is removed after healing). The bones don't fuse but are connected by scar tissue, which eliminates bone-on-bone problems. However, the toe loses some of its push-off power and weight-bearing ability. Transferring the weight to the smaller toes may result in pain in those joints. Artificial joint replacement is another option, but there's little data on long-term outcomes, and studies are needed to compare the procedure to fusion.",Unknown,"August 1, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/dont-judge-your-mucus-by-its-color-201602089129,Don't judge your mucus by its color,"A friend made an offhand comment the other day that caught me off guard:
        ""When I blow my nose, it's green, so I'm calling my doctor for some antibiotics.""
        I thought this myth had been debunked long ago. In fact, it has been well established that you cannot rely on the color or consistency of nasal discharge to distinguish viral from bacterial sinus infections, or even whether you're dealing with an infection at all. Seasonal allergies are a good example. They can cause all sorts of nasal discharge — thick or thin, yellow, green, or clear — even though there's no infection at all.
        Why mucus?
        Before getting into why my friend's nasal discharge might be green, it's worth thinking a bit about why we have mucus in the first place. And we do have a lot of mucus: the lining of the nose and sinuses makes a liter or more per day!
        There are a number of reasons, including:
        
          Think of mucus as the body's own moisturizer. It's found on the tissues within the body, such as the lining of the nose, sinuses, and mouth, that come into contact with elements from the outside world. These lining tissues, also called ""mucosa,"" have a tendency to dry out and crack if there is too little moisture so mucous serves an important role in keeping these tissues healthy.
          Providing a barrier. Mucus is thick and sticky, so it can trap dust, bacteria, or other unwanted passersby in our environment and prevent them from entering the body.
          Immune protection. Mucus also contains elements of the immune system (such as white blood cells and antibodies) that kill any bothersome trespassers it catches.
        
        There may even be other functions of mucus that haven't been discovered.
        Under normal circumstances, we barely notice its existence. And when we do notice, we generally think of it as disgusting or annoying, even when there's more of it or it's changing color only because it's doing its job (as with allergies or infections). It's fair to say that given all it does for us, mucus doesn't get the credit it deserves.
        Why so thick? Why so green?
        When the white blood cells in the mucosa encounter an irritant or infectious organism, they respond by producing enzymes to repel the invaders. These enzymes contain iron, and that's one of the reasons nasal discharge may be green. And if the mucus sits around (as when you're sleeping), it becomes more concentrated and so may appear darker yellow or green. This is the natural order of things, whether the offending agent is a virus (which is the most common cause of sinus infection) or a bacterium.
        Why does my doctor give me antibiotics for green mucus?
        Good question! If most sinus infections are viral, and viral infections will not improve with antibiotics, it makes little sense to treat every episode of thick, green mucus with antibiotics. Yet some patients request it and many doctors continue to prescribe them. It's likely that the improvement that follows antibiotic treatment would have happened even without antibiotics; yet that sequence of events tends to perpetuate the idea that antibiotics are necessary.
        There are times when antibiotics should be considered. For example, antibiotics might be worth considering when
        
          the infection drags on for more than 10 days, or if it gets worse after a week
          the discharge is thick and uniformly white (that is, it looks like pus)
          there is a high fever that isn't improving
          there are severe symptoms that do not respond to the usual over-the-counter sinus and cold remedies.
        
        Each case is different. So, talk to your doctor if your sinus symptoms have you thinking you may need antibiotics.
        The bottom line
        If you're prone to sinus infections or bothersome sinus discharge, remember these two things:
        
          Mucus is underappreciated.
          Most sinus symptoms are due to viral infections or allergies, not bacterial infections.
        
        My friend shouldn't expect to get antibiotics just because his mucus is thick and green. And it's likely that if he does take antibiotics and recovers, the latter had little to do with the former.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","August 1, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/recognizing-and-easing-the-physical-symptoms-of-anxiety,Recognizing and easing the physical symptoms of anxiety,"Simple strategies can reduce the headaches, upset stomach, and shortness of breath that may be triggered by emotional stress.
        
        
          
        
        You've had headaches on and off, or possibly nausea, or muscle pain. It could be emotions, rather than a physical illness, driving your symptoms.
        Blame your autonomic nervous system. This is a system in your body that you don't consciously control, but that regulates things like your heart rate, breathing, urination, and sexual function. It's also the system that reacts when you are under a physical threat. The autonomic nervous system produces your fight-or-flight response, which is designed to help you defend yourself or run away from danger.
        When you are under stress or anxious, this system kicks into action, and physical symptoms can appear — headaches, nausea, shortness of breath, shakiness, or stomach pain. Doctors see it all the time — patients with real pain or other symptoms, but nothing is physically wrong with them.
        In today's world, many people may be noticing new physical symptoms without realizing what's causing them. For some people, this situation is the start of a vicious cycle. Anxiety and stress themselves produce these physical symptoms, and on top of that your reaction to those symptoms can make them worse. The more you focus on them, the more alarmed you become, and the more intense your symptoms become. It can get really out of control and become so uncomfortable that you might not be able to do much more than sit and worry.
        Identifying and easing anxiety
        It's possible to become so fixated on the physical effects from your anxious state that you don't even realize you were anxious to begin with. So, how do you know if anxiety is causing your symptoms? And if it is, how can you feel better? Here are some tips to help you interrupt this cycle.
        Stop and assess. The first step is to pause for a second and observe what's going on with your body. Think about what you are experiencing and whether it relates to a feeling of emotional upset or a reaction to something alarming or stressful. If your symptoms followed a stressful event or period of time, it's possible these emotions triggered your symptoms. Also, be alert to signs that you are tensing your muscles, which can also indicate a stress reaction.
        Distract yourself. If you suspect anxiety is at the root of your physical symptoms, distraction can be a helpful tool. It's good to build a repertoire of things that can distract you from your focus on your body. Look at a photo album. Do the laundry. Even something as simple as watering the plants or putting together a jigsaw puzzle can help. This can fairly reliably get you out of a cycle of increased anxiety and increased physical symptoms. Very often, once you move on to another activity and take your mind off your symptoms, you'll start to feel better. Distractions are different for each person. Try different activities to figure out what takes your mind to a calm place.
        Relax your body — or work it. To relieve stress, try some deep breathing or relaxation exercises. There are numerous online resources and smartphone apps that can help guide you through relaxation techniques. Physical activity can also help you relieve tension. Try to squeeze in a daily walk or a run.
        Reassure yourself. If you believe your symptoms are being caused by anxiety, reassure yourself that what you are experiencing is not harmful or fatal. They're not serious, and they don't signal an impending medical disaster. The symptoms will pass when the anxiety eases.
        Get checked. There is a difference between anxiety that triggers physical symptoms and physical symptoms that trigger anxiety. For example, people who are having an asthma attack and therefore having trouble breathing will likely feel anxious. But anxiety is not causing their shortness of breath. If you have a physical problem that does not resolve with relaxation or other techniques, contact your doctor to have it checked out.
        Know when to seek help. Simple anxiety sometimes crosses the line and becomes an anxiety disorder. Signs that you might have a problem include shying away from activities because you are fearful, or being so preoccupied with worry that it affects your ability to function. If this sounds like you, it's time to seek some help. Anxiety disorders are very treatable using a variety of different approaches.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/testosterone-blocking-drugs-boost-heart-disease-risk-when-given-in-combination-202407263061,Testosterone-blocking drugs boost heart disease risk when given in combination,"Cancer treatment can involve difficult tradeoffs, and that's also true of the testosterone-blocking drugs used in treating prostate cancer. These drugs work in two different ways. Androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) shut down the body's production of testosterone, a hormone that fuels prostate cancer growth. A newer class of drugs called androgen-receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) block testosterone by deflecting the hormone from its cell receptor.
        ADT can slow or control prostate cancer, and mounting evidence shows that adding ARSIs also improves survival when the disease is in advanced stages. This treatment combination is called intensified ADT. Researchers are now testing intensified ADT for some men with early-stage prostate cancer as well.
        However, all drugs that block testosterone have challenging side effects, including metabolic changes that can compromise cardiovascular health. In June, British researchers reported that cardiovascular risks worsen when ADT and ARSIs are given together. The authors concluded that men who get intensified ADT should be counseled about the risks, and monitored for signs of heart disease before and after the treatment begins.
        Study goals and results
        The findings were derived from a systematic review of 24 clinical trials that assessed ADT and ARSI treatment for prostate cancer. Published between 2012 and 2024, the trials enrolled a combined total of 22,166 men ages 63 to 77. Their diagnoses ranged across the prostate cancer spectrum, from nonmetastatic cancer with aggressive features to metastatic prostate cancer that no longer responded to ADT by itself.
        The goal of the systematic review was to compare ADT and intensified ADT with respect to cardiac events, including hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats), blood clots, or — in the worst case — heart attack or stroke.
        Results showed that adding an ARSI to ADT approximately doubles the risk of a cardiac event across all prostate cancer states. Risks for severe ""grade 3"" events that can require hospitalization ranged between 7.8% and 15.6%. Notably, giving two ARSIs — abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide — led to a roughly fourfold increase in cardiac risk. Mounting evidence shows that combining abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide worsens side effects without improving prostate cancer survival. The use of that combination is now broadly discouraged by expert groups around the world.
        The authors emphasize that intensified therapy is riskier for men with pre-existing cardiac conditions than it is for healthier men. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Katelyn Atkins, a radiation oncologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, noted that cardiovascular disease is the second leading cause of death among men with prostate cancer.
        Candidates for traditional or intensified ADT, Dr. Atkins wrote, should be assessed for atherosclerosis, fatty plaques in coronary arteries that can accumulate asymptomatically. Fortunately, cardiac risk factors are treatable by lowering blood pressure, eating a heart-healthy diet, exercising, and in some cases using a cholesterol-lowering drug called a statin.
        Experts comment
        ""More and more research shows that intensive therapy prolongs survival, and may in some men even evoke a cure,"" said Dr. David Crawford, head of urologic oncology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus who was not involved in the study. ""We have learned time and again from the treatment of many cancers that it is not one drug followed by another and another that results in the best outcomes. Rather, it is combining drugs more effectively to treat the cancer.
        ""Still, we need to tackle the challenges of prostate cancer treatment and focus on preventing cardiovascular events and other side effects of ADT. As clinicians and in clinical studies, we have seen that men who maintain their weight, exercise, expand muscle mass, and maintain normal lipids and blood pressure do much better than men who gain weight and have a lot of cardiovascular risk factors.""
        ""This important study re-emphasizes the necessity to keep a patient's cardiovascular history front and center when treatment choices are made, "" said Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor-in-chief of the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases.
        ""Intensification of treatment — that is, adding several drugs earlier and earlier in prostate cancer management — is to be both encouraged and cautioned. The caution is for physicians to consider and discuss pre-existing risk factors and how to modify them when deciding upon treatment programs. The ARSI class of drugs have greatly improved outcomes. The goal is to maximize the best outcomes while minimizing the side effects.""",Charlie Schmidt,"July 26, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/parenting-isnt-easy-two-important-skills-can-help-202407243060,Parenting isn't easy: Two important skills can help,"They say that parenting is the greatest — and the most challenging — job that many of us will ever land. Life can be tough for kids too, especially when they go through emotionally trying times.
        What can parents do to help their kids manage episodes of anger, sadness, or anxiety triggered by school, siblings, and daily living? Whether you are a parent to an elementary-age child, a tweener ages 8 to 12, or a teenager, practicing two skills can help both you and your child: validation and coping.
        Practicing validation
        Validation teaches your children that feeling and expressing their emotions is okay.
        ""When parents use validation, they are affirming to their child that it's fine to feel emotions and they should not be suppressed,"" says Dr. Chase Samsel with the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Harvard-affiliated Boston Children's Hospital. ""It shows them you understand their feelings and point of view, and it establishes trust. This, in turn, can help a child feel supported and open to discussing solutions.""
        Start with acknowledgement
        Acknowledge their emotions with comments like, ""It sounds like you are frustrated or angry,"" or ""I can see that you've had a tough day at school.""
        But which emotion — or emotions — is your child feeling? ""It can be difficult for parents to recognize the genuine emotion their child is battling,"" says Dr. Samsel. ""Many times, kids have an emotional reaction but can't explain what's going on, or don't want to, or express various emotions at once.""
        Other times, different emotions lie underneath the one being shown. This is especially common among teenagers where they display anger, but often the real emotion is fear, anxiety, or sadness. ""In these incidences, just recognizing they are going through something difficult is enough,"" says Dr. Samsel.
        Practice validation often
        A child may not respond to validation at first — they may not want to talk about their emotions or may ignore your interest. But consistent validation will eventually pay off.
        ""By repeating validation when emotional crises arise, the child soon will become more comfortable expressing their emotion,"" says Dr. Samsel. ""Once they recognize that their parents welcome this and will not be reprimanded, they will be open to sharing details.""
        Building a coping skills toolbox
        Coping skills are ways parents can teach their children to manage emotional problems when they arise.
        Try a breathing exercise together
        Breathing exercises are a popular strategy, as they are easy to learn and quick to use. Dr. Samsel recommends any of the following: three-part breathing, ujjayi breathing, and belly breathing.
        Other coping skills include guided meditation, visualization, squeezing a ball for stress relief, taking a walk or playing outside, and reading together (ideal for preschool and elementary-age children).
        ""Sometimes just giving children alone time in their room or ""taking space"" works well,"" says Dr. Samsel.
        Tap into coping skills yourself
        It's also vital for parents to adopt these strategies when dealing with their own emotions, says Dr. Samsel. Not only will this help you feel calmer, but it's a great way to model that coping skills help everyone — adults, too!
        For example, try telling your kids when you feel upset or frustrated about something that happens during your day. Announce that you plan to take a walk to de-stress or do a breathing exercise. Later, share your strategies for problem-solving.
        ""Kids watch what their parents do and will often mimic their behavior,"" says Dr. Samsel. ""If they see you constructively working through your emotions, they will be more open to doing the same.""
        Be flexible
        Never insist on having older kids use a coping mechanism, even when situations call for it. That could feel like punishment and trigger an automatic resistance.
        Instead, Dr. Samsel suggests parents expose their children to different types of coping skills and then let them decide which ones they want to try. ""They may need to experiment to find techniques they can easily follow and that work for them,"" says Dr. Samsel.",Matthew Solan,"July 24, 2024"

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side,Blue light has a dark side,"What is blue light? The effect blue light has on your sleep and more.
        
          
        
        Although it is environmentally friendly, blue light can affect your sleep and potentially cause disease. Until the advent of artificial lighting, the sun was the major source of lighting, and people spent their evenings in (relative) darkness. Now, in much of the world, evenings are illuminated, and we take our easy access to all those lumens pretty much for granted.
        But we may be paying a price for basking in all that light. At night, light throws the body's biological clock—the circadian rhythm—out of whack. Sleep suffers. Worse, research shows that it may contribute to the causation of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.
        What is blue light?
        Not all colors of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths—which are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost attention, reaction times, and mood—seem to be the most disruptive at night. And the proliferation of electronics with screens, as well as energy-efficient lighting, is increasing our exposure to blue wavelengths, especially after sundown.
        Light and sleep
        Everyone has slightly different circadian rhythms, but the average length is 24 and one-quarter hours. The circadian rhythm of people who stay up late is slightly longer, while the rhythms of earlier birds fall short of 24 hours. Dr. Charles Czeisler of Harvard Medical School showed, in 1981, that daylight keeps a person's internal clock aligned with the environment.
        Is nighttime light exposure bad?
        Some studies suggest a link between exposure to light at night, such as working the night shift, to diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. That's not proof that nighttime light exposure causes these conditions; nor is it clear why it could be bad for us.
        Exposure to light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences circadian rhythms. Even dim light can interfere with a person's circadian rhythm and melatonin secretion. A mere eight lux—a level of brightness exceeded by most table lamps and about twice that of a night light—has an effect. Light at night is part of the reason so many people don't get enough sleep, and researchers have linked short sleep to increased risk for depression, as well as diabetes and cardiovascular problems.
        Effects of blue light and sleep
        While light of any kind can suppress the secretion of melatonin, blue light at night does so more powerfully. Harvard researchers and their colleagues conducted an experiment comparing the effects of 6.5 hours of exposure to blue light to exposure to green light of comparable brightness. The blue light suppressed melatonin for about twice as long as the green light and shifted circadian rhythms by twice as much (3 hours vs. 1.5 hours).
        In another study of blue light, researchers at the University of Toronto compared the melatonin levels of people exposed to bright indoor light who were wearing blue-light–blocking goggles to people exposed to regular dim light without wearing goggles. The fact that the levels of the hormone were about the same in the two groups strengthens the hypothesis that blue light is a potent suppressor of melatonin. It also suggests that shift workers and night owls could perhaps protect themselves if they wore eyewear that blocks blue light. Inexpensive sunglasses with orange-tinted lenses block blue light, but they also block other colors, so they're not suitable for use indoors at night. Glasses that block out only blue light can cost up to $80.
        LED blue light exposure
        If blue light does have adverse health effects, then environmental concerns, and the quest for energy-efficient lighting, could be at odds with personal health. Those curlicue compact fluorescent lightbulbs and LED lights are much more energy-efficient than the old-fashioned incandescent lightbulbs we grew up with. But they also tend to produce more blue light.
        The physics of fluorescent lights can't be changed, but coatings inside the bulbs can be so they produce a warmer, less blue light. LED lights are more efficient than fluorescent lights, but they also produce a fair amount of light in the blue spectrum. Richard Hansler, a light researcher at John Carroll University in Cleveland, notes that ordinary incandescent lights also produce some blue light, although less than most fluorescent lightbulbs.
        Protect yourself from blue light at night
        
          Use dim red lights for night lights. Red light is less likely to shift circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin.
          Avoid looking at bright screens beginning two to three hours before bed.
          If you work a night shift or use a lot of electronic devices at night, consider wearing blue-blocking glasses or installing an app that filters the blue/green wavelength at night.
          Expose yourself to lots of bright light during the day, which will boost your ability to sleep at night, as well as your mood and alertness during daylight.

          Q.
          I have heard that you should not exercise at night because it can cause sleep problems. Is this true?
        
        A. Traditionally, experts have recommended not exercising at night as part of good sleep hygiene. However, a small study, published in Sports Medicine suggests that some people can exercise in the evening as long as they avoid vigorous activity for at least one hour before bedtime.
        The researchers examined 23 studies that evaluated sleep onset and quality in healthy adults who performed a single session of evening exercise compared with similar adults who did not. They found that not only did evening exercise not affect sleep, it seemed to help people fall asleep faster and spend more time in deep sleep. However, those who did high-intensity exercise — such as interval training — less than one hour before bedtime took longer to fall asleep and had poorer sleep quality.
        Despite the findings in this particular study, I generally recommend against strenuous physical activity for at least two hours before getting into bed.
        In addition to regular exercise, you can help achieving quality sleep by doing the following:
        
          
            Set a regular bedtime and adopt a relaxing bedtime routine.
          
          
            Turn off devices that give off light, such as the TV, computer, and phone, at least 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime.
          
          
            Be sure your bed is comfortable and your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.
          
          
            Don't take long naps during the day. If you need a nap, restrict it to 20 to 30 minutes in the early afternoon.
          
          
            If you can't fall asleep after 15 to 20 minutes, go to another room. Read quietly with a dim light until you feel sleepy.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/6-ways-to-ease-neck-pain,6 ways to ease neck pain,"Everyday life isn't kind to the neck. You may be all too familiar with that crick you get when you cradle the phone between your shoulder and ear, or the strain you feel after working at your computer.
        Neck pain rarely starts overnight. It usually evolves over time. And it may be spurred by arthritis or degenerative disc disease, and accentuated by poor posture, declining muscle strength, stress, and even a lack of sleep.
        The following six tips can help you find neck pain relief:
        
          Don't stay in one position for too long. It's hard to reverse bad posture, but if you get up and move around often enough, you'll avoid getting your neck stuck in an unhealthy position.
          Make some ergonomic adjustments. Position your computer monitor at eye level so you can see it easily. Use the hands-free function on your phone or wear a headset. Prop your tablet on a pillow so that it sits at a 45° angle, instead of lying flat on your lap.
          If you wear glasses, keep your prescription up to date. When your eyewear prescription is not up to date, you tend to lean your head back to see better.
          Don't use too many pillows. Sleeping with several pillows under your head can stifle your neck's range of motion.
          Know your limits. For example, before you move a big armoire across the room, consider what it might do to your neck and back, and ask for help.
          Get a good night's sleep. Sleep problems increase the risk for several different conditions, including musculoskeletal pain.
        
        Generally, neck pain is nothing to worry about, but if it's occurring with other, more serious symptoms, such as pain radiating into an arm or lower down in the body, weakness, or numbness of an arm or leg, make sure to see your doctor. Other key things that might make one more concerned are having a fever or weight loss associated with your neck pain, or severe pain. Let your doctor know about these symptoms.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/chest-pain-a-heart-attack-or-something-else,Chest pain: A heart attack or something else?,"When is chest pain serious? That dull burning feeling in your chest doesn't seem to be going away, and even feels like it is getting worse. Is it a heart attack, or something else?
        It's a vexing question, one that millions of people — and their doctors — face each year. What's the problem? Chest pain can stem from dozens of conditions besides heart attack, from pancreatitis to pneumonia or panic attack.
        Millions of Americans with chest pain are seen in hospital emergency departments every year. Only 20% of them are diagnosed with a heart attack or an episode of unstable angina, a warning sign that a heart attack may happen soon. A few have another potentially life-threatening problem, such as pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs) or aortic dissection (a tear in the inner layer of the aorta). Some are experiencing ""regular"" angina, which occurs when part of the heart isn't getting as much oxygen-rich blood as it needs during periods of physical exertion or emotional stress. Most of them, though, had a condition unrelated to the heart or arteries.
        The other tricky problem with heart attacks is that different people experience them in different ways. Some have classic chest pain. Others have jaw pain or back pain. Still others become breathless, or extremely fatigued, or nauseated.
        
          
            
              
                Chest pain and heart attack symptoms
                Chest pain is only one of the possible signs of an impending heart attack. If you notice one or more of the signs below in yourself or someone else, call 911 or your local emergency number right away.
                
                  Uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, burning, tightness, or pain in the center of the chest
                  Pain, numbness, pinching, prickling, or other uncomfortable sensations in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or stomach
                  Shortness of breath
                  Sudden nausea or vomiting
                  Lightheadedness or dizziness
                  Unusual fatigue
                  Heat/flushing or a cold sweat
                  Sudden heaviness, weakness, or aching in one or both arms.
                
              
            
          
        
        Describe chest pain to your doctor
        Doctors use several pieces of information to determine who is, and who isn't, having a heart attack. In addition to the description of your symptoms and your heart risk profile, doctors use the results of an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a blood test called cardiac troponin. But sometimes these don't immediately show abnormalities. So, what you describe to the doctor and your medical history are extremely important in determining the initial steps in your treatment.
        Here are some things your doctors will want to know about what you are experiencing:
        
          What is it that you are feeling (pain, pressure, tightness, etc.)?
          Where is the discomfort?
          When did it start?
          Has it gotten worse or stayed the same?
          Is the feeling constant, or does it come and go?
          Have you felt it before?
          What were you doing before these feelings started?
        
        Clear answers to these questions go a long way toward nailing down a diagnosis. A few seconds of recurrent stabbing pain is less likely to be a heart attack (see box), while pain centered in the chest that spreads out to the left arm or jaw is more likely to be one.

        When chest pains are serious
        Unlike an achy knee or crabby lower back, chest pain isn't something to shrug off until tomorrow. It also isn't something to diagnose at home. Don't play doctor — go see one, fast, if you are worried about pain or discomfort in your chest, upper back, left arm, or jaw; or suddenly faint or develop a cold sweat, nausea, or vomiting. Call 911 or your local emergency number to summon an emergency medical crew. It will whisk you to the hospital in a vehicle full of equipment that can start the diagnosis and keep you stable if your heart really is in trouble.
        There are oh-so-many reasons to delay calling for help.
        
          I'm too young (you aren't — even 20-somethings can have heart attacks).

          I have a family to take care of (all the more reason to get to the hospital fast).
          I don't want to bother anyone (you'd be a bigger bother with advanced heart failure, or dead).

                Pain from a heart attack isn't confined to the area around the heart. The most typical locations are marked in dark red; light red shows other possible areas.
              
            
          
        
        What if it isn't a heart attack? You will be evaluated as if you are having one and, when it is ruled out as the cause of your symptoms, your doctors will look for the actual cause. They will work with you to get at the root of your chest pain and ease it. If the cause was indigestion, a panic attack, or another possibly recurring condition, the emergency department doctors and your primary care physician can help you interpret what your body is telling you.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/spinal-stenosis-treatment-options-for-managing-symptoms,Spinal stenosis: Treatment options for managing symptoms,"Spinal stenosis is a condition that causes narrowing in the spinal canal. It is a common cause of neck and low back pain in older adults.
        This condition can cause substantial discomfort, disrupting daily activities and, in severe cases, leading to progressive disability. Understanding spinal stenosis and exploring the treatment options available can greatly help in managing its symptoms and improving one's quality of life.
        What is spinal stenosis?
        Spinal stenosis is a condition in which the space within your spine narrows, putting pressure on the spinal cord and nerves that travel through the spine. This narrowing can happen in any part of the spine but is most common in the lower back (lumbar spine) and the neck (cervical spine).
        The condition can cause a range of symptoms, which can vary from mild to severe and can significantly impact daily activities. Mild spinal stenosis may cause no symptoms.
        Common symptoms of spinal stenosis
        Symptoms of spinal stenosis vary depending on the location and severity of the spinal narrowing. Common symptoms include:
        
          pain in the lower back or neck. Pain tends to be worse when the spine is straight, and may be improved by leaning forward (for lumbar spinal stenosis) or bending the neck forward (for cervical spinal stenosis) as this creates more space in the spinal canal.
          numbness, tingling, weakness, or a combination of these in the hands, arms, feet, or legs
          difficulty walking or maintaining balance
          in severe cases, problems with bladder or bowel control.
        
        If any of these symptoms occur suddenly and worsen rapidly, particularly a loss of bladder or bowel control, see a doctor right away. This may be a sign of a serious condition caused by compression of nerve roots in the lower part of the spinal cord that can cause permanent damage if not treated promptly.
        What can cause spinal stenosis?
        The most common causes of spinal stenosis are conditions related to the natural aging process. As we get older, joint and disc degeneration in our spines can lead to conditions like osteoarthritis and degenerative disc disease. These can cause changes that lead to squeezing and narrowing of the spinal canal and nerve openings, causing pain and discomfort.
        Any changes that cause narrowing of the spinal canal can contribute to the development of spinal stenosis. Examples include:
        
          Osteoarthritis. This common form of arthritis can cause bony enlargement of the small joints in the spine (facet joints), leading to narrowing of the spinal canal.
          Herniated discs. Intervertebral discs act as cushions between the vertebrae. They can dry out and crack, allowing some of the inner material to escape and press on the spinal cord or nerves.
          Spinal injuries. Trauma from car accidents or other injuries can dislocate or fracture the vertebrae, leading to spinal stenosis. Scar tissue can also form, leading to narrowing.
          Spondylolisthesis. This is a condition in which one or more spinal vertebra slips out of alignment, narrowing the spinal canal.
          Tumors. Abnormal growths can develop inside the spinal cord, within the membranes covering the spinal cord, or in the space between the spinal cord and vertebrae.
          Congenital spinal stenosis. Some people are born with a small spinal canal, which increases their risk of developing spinal stenosis.
        
        Certain bone diseases and autoimmune disorders can affects bones and joints in the spine, causing spinal stenosis. For example, ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that causes inflammation in the spine. Over time, vertebrae may fuse together and stiffen. This can narrow the spinal canal and put pressure on the spinal cord and nerves.
        Managing symptoms
        Managing the symptoms of spinal stenosis often involves a combination of treatments. Initial treatment may involve physical therapy that focuses on stretching, strengthening, and aerobic exercises to enhance muscle stability and improve posture. These exercises can help relieve pressure on the spine and reduce pain.
        Other common nonsurgical options include:
        
          Medications. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) can help reduce pain and inflammation. In some cases, doctors may prescribe stronger pain medications, muscle relaxants, or nerve pain medications.
          Steroid injections. Corticosteroid injections can reduce inflammation and relieve pain in the affected area. These injections are not a long-term solution, but can provide temporary relief.
          Alternative therapies. Some people find symptom relief through acupuncture, chiropractic care, or massage therapy. Discuss these options with your doctor to ensure they are safe and appropriate for your condition.
        
        Using a cane or walker can improve balance and help reduce pain while walking. Losing weight, practicing good posture, and avoiding activities that worsen symptoms can also help.
        Surgical treatments for spinal stenosis
        Surgery is usually reserved for people who don't get better with other treatments, or whose symptoms are causing major disability.
        Several surgical options are available, and each has its risks and benefits. The right one for any given individual will depend on the cause and location of the stenosis.
        
          Laminectomy. This procedure involves removing part of the lamina, the thick bone that forms the roof of the spinal canal. This creates more space within the spinal canal, relieving pressure on the spinal cord and nerves.
          Minimally invasive decompression. In this surgery, parts of bone or tissue that are pressing on the nerves are removed. This creates more space in the spinal canal, reducing pain, numbness, and weakness in the legs.
          Interspinous process spacers. These small devices are inserted between the bones of the spine to keep the space open and reduce pressure on the spinal nerves.
          Spinal fusion. This procedure may be necessary if spinal stenosis has caused instability in the spine. It involves fusing two or more vertebrae together to stabilize the spine and reduce pain.
        
        Surgery can provide significant relief for many people, but it also comes with potential complications and a recovery period that can vary in length.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","July 22, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/is-extra-virgin-olive-oil-extra-healthy,Is extra-virgin olive oil extra healthy?,"Q.
          I know olive oil is part of a heart-healthy diet, but is extra-virgin olive oil healthier than regular olive oil?
        
        A. Many studies continue to confirm the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, which cuts the risk of heart disease and stroke. The diet's nutritional benefits probably come from various sources, but the generous use of olive oil appears to be a key contributor.
        Regardless of the type, olive oil is high in monounsaturated fatty acids, containing about 75% by volume. When substituted for saturated fat, monounsaturated fats help lower your ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. The health benefits of olive oil have been attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In fact, observational studies have shown a link between lower risks of cardiovascular disease, some cancers, and even dementia in people who consume higher amounts of olive oil than those who use little or none.
        Still, extra-virgin olive oil does offer something extra that regular olive oil does not. Extra-virgin olive oil is pressed mechanically from ripe olives and processed without high heat or chemical solvents. This protects chemicals in the oil called phenols. In contrast, regular, highly processed olive oils lose these chemicals. Small laboratory-based experiments suggest that higher concentrations of phenols may provide extra antioxidant effects. Even so, there are no definitive studies that show extra-virgin olive oil has a greater ability than refined oil to prevent heart problems, cancer or other diseases.
        Keep in mind that olive oil is not the sole healthy ingredient in a Mediterranean diet. Think of it as just one aspect of the Mediterranean style of eating, which includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and nuts; whole grains; and limited amounts of red meat.

        Even if you don't know what's causing your sciatica, you can take steps to relieve your pain at home. Call your doctor if the pain isn't manageable or under certain other circumstances.
        Cold and heat
        Both ice packs and heat can be used to ease the pain of sciatica and help you function better.
        For the first few days, place ice packs on your lower back to reduce inflammation of the sciatic nerve. Be careful not to give yourself frostbite. Icepacks shouldn't directly touch the skin; wrap them in a cloth or towel. Leave them in place for no more than 15 to 20 minutes at a time, with at least a 15- to 20-minute break in between. Try a cycle of on-off-on-off-on (this will take between 75 and 100 minutes). Then take a break to see how you feel.
        Another way to apply cold to a painful area is an ice massage. Freeze water in a paper cup and then tear away the top half of the cup. Using a circular motion, massage the lower back with the ice. Cover an area about six inches in diameter, and keep the cup moving to prevent frostbite. Avoid the bony part of the spine. Massage for no more than 10 minutes and wait at least an hour between massages.
        It's okay to try some gentle stretches between ice applications, though better to wait about half an hour for the area to warm. Three to five applications per day may help relieve some of the pain.
        Heat can be used next, when some healing has taken place and the pain is subsiding. (If the pain has not subsided at all after a week, visit the doctor.) Heat treatments will increase the flow of blood to the area, which can speed healing. Heat also will relax the muscles to allow for gentle stretching that can help to relieve the pain.
        You can use a hot water bottle or heating pad wrapped in a towel, or soak in a warm bath. If you use a water bottle or heating pad, apply it to your lower back. Improperly applied heat treatment can cause burns, so follow a few rules:
        
          Place a cloth barrier between the heat source and your body (if using a hot water bottle or heating pad).
          Make sure that the treatment feels warm, not hot; if it is uncomfortably warm, it's too warm.
          Apply heat for at least 15 minutes, but no longer than two hours. The duration depends on your pain level.
          If using a heating pad, take care not to fall asleep while applying it.
        
        Movement
        Moving is probably the most important thing you can do to help your pain.
        Many people with sciatica put themselves on bed rest, or lean back in an easy chair, thinking that this will help them to heal. It doesn't!
        It's okay to rest for the first couple of days after sciatica pain starts; after that, staying in bed usually makes things worse, not better. Moving helps your pain in several ways:
        
          It strengthens your muscles, which helps to support your spine.
          It can improve flexibility and range of motion.
          It boosts blood flow to all areas of the body, including injured areas, which speeds healing.
          It reduces the perception of pain.
        
        If you have sciatica, move as much as you can as soon as you can. If moving seems to make the pain worse, it's best to see a doctor and talk through what's going on.
        Once your sciatica is under control, keep moving to decrease the likelihood that it will return. Sitting for long periods of time isn't good for anyone. Extended sitting can increase your risk of sciatica and also can make sciatica worse once you have it.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/osteoporosis-drugs-which-one-is-right-for-you,Osteoporosis drugs: Which one is right for you?,"Throughout our lives, our bones undergo constant renovation. In a process called bone turnover, cells called osteoclasts break down and remove old bone, and then cells called osteoblasts lay down new bone. After menopause, the rate of bone removal speeds up, and bone formation doesn't always keep pace. The net result can be bone loss and ultimately the weakened, brittle bones of osteoporosis.
        Even if you've been diagnosed with osteoporosis, a fracture isn't inevitable. Many drugs available today can slow the rate of bone loss—and can rebuild bone strength.
        Your doctor will determine whether you have osteoporosis by measuring your bone density—usually at the hip and spine—using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The result, expressed as a number called a T-score, compares your bone density with that of a healthy 30-year-old woman.
        The doctor will likely recommend medicine if you have
        
          a T-score of –2.5 or lower—the definition of osteoporosis
          a history of hip or vertebral (spinal) fracture caused by a fall while standing (in contrast to a fall from a height)
          a T-score between –1.0 and –2.5 (called osteopenia) and a high risk of hip or osteoporosis-related fracture in the next 10 years according to a fracture risk calculator.
        
        Osteoporosis treatment: Where to start
        To slow bone breakdown, many doctors first turn to one particular class of drugs. If someone has a very low T-score, doctors typically start with the bisphosphonates.
        There are several bisphosphonates to choose from, such as:
        
          pills, such as alendronate (Fosamax), ibandronate (Boniva), or risedronate (Actonel, Atelvia), taken daily, weekly, or monthly
          injections of ibandronate (Boniva), given once every three months
          intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid (Reclast), given once a year.
        
        Your doctor will also consider where your bone loss is centered. Alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate have all been shown effective for reducing spine fractures. For women with a history of hip or non-spinal fractures, alendronate and risedronate may be better options than ibandronate.
        If you have gastrointestinal problems like reflux, or if you can't sit or stand upright for the full 30 to 60 minutes required after taking an oral bisphosphonate, then your doctor may put you on an injection or infusion of these drugs, which works about as well as the oral versions.
        You might have read about risks associated with bisphosphonate drugs—particularly fractures of the thighbone (femur) and osteonecrosis (bone death) in the jaw. Though these concerns are real, they are more common in people taking intravenous bisphosphonates to treat cancer that has spread to the bones, or in women who are on long-term, high-dose bisphosphonates.
        Doctors acknowledge that the risk of these side effects also increases with long-term use of bisphosphonates, so most women take these drugs for about five years. The good news is that the bone-protective benefits continue even after you stop taking bisphosphonates.
        Other drug options
        For postmenopausal women who aren't starting with a bisphosphonate, or those who've already been on one for five years, here are a few other options.
        Raloxifene (Evista), a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), is perhaps best known for its role in breast cancer prevention and treatment, but it serves double duty in treating osteoporosis, too. It works by binding with estrogen receptors around the body to produce estrogen-like effects, one of which is to decrease bone turnover. For people with osteoporosis of the spine, raloxifene reduces the risk of vertebral fractures. The main side effects are hot flashes, muscle pain, and an increased risk of blood clots in the leg (deep-vein thrombosis).
        Teriparatide (Forteo)and abaloparatide (Tymlos) are synthetic versions of parathyroid hormone that increases bone density and strength. They can reduce the risk of fractures significantly in the spine and other bones. They are a reasonable option for someone with very low bone density and vertebral fractures. Doctors usually limit  this particular treatment to two years and then switch patients to a bisphosphonate to maintain bone density. Women on teriparatide or abaloparatide need to give themselves a daily injection.
        Denosumab (Prolia) is a monoclonal antibody given as a twice-yearly injection. It prevents bone-dissolving osteoclast cells from forming. Denosumab may be an option if a woman cannot tolerate bisphosphonates. Once started, women usually stay on this therapy indefinitely because if stopped bone resorption will accelerate.
        Romosozumab (Evenity) is another monoclonal typically reserved for women with severe osteoporosis, usually considered after a woman has had a fragility fracture. It acts by blocking sclerostin, a protein that inhibits bone formation. The medication is injected once a month using two separate prefilled syringes for a full dose. Romosozumab should only be taken for one year, because its bone-making activity wanes after 12 months.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/degenerative-disc-disease-managing-this-common-cause-of-back-pain,Degenerative disc disease: Managing this common cause of back pain,"As we age, the discs in our spine can degenerate, causing chronic pain and discomfort in the back and neck that can significantly impact daily life. Understanding what degenerative disc disease (DDD) is, its symptoms, causes, and the available treatment options can help you manage this common condition and improve your quality of life.
        What is degenerative disc disease?
        Degenerative disc disease is a condition that affects the discs between the vertebrae in your spine. Each disc has a gelatinous center and a tougher outer covering. These discs act like cushions, absorbing shock and allowing flexibility and movement in your back. Over time, the discs can degenerate. This can lead to pain and discomfort in your back and neck from the loss of protective cushioning.
        DDD is a natural part of aging. It is not actually a ""disease,"" but rather a condition that can cause symptoms if the discs deteriorate significantly. When discs are damaged, the inner part can push out and press on the spinal cord or nerve. This is known as a herniated or ""slipped"" disc, and it may cause weakness. The disc can also become so worn out that the vertebrae start to rub together.
        DDD is one of the most common causes of back pain, especially in older adults.
        Common symptoms of degenerative disc disease
        The symptoms of degenerative disc disease can vary widely from person to person. Some people may experience severe pain, while others may have little to no discomfort. Symptoms usually arise as the condition progresses. In addition to the back, persistent pain can also occur in the buttocks, thighs, or neck, depending on which discs are affected. Other common symptoms include:
        
          Sharp pain: Sudden, intense pain that can be triggered by movements like bending or twisting. Over 90% of herniated discs happen in a region of the lower back called the lumbar spine. Pinched nerves in this area cause pain to spread down the back of the leg and the top of the foot. But shooting pain can also occur in the arms from degenerated discs in the neck.
          Pain that worsens with activity: Physical activities, especially those that involve lifting or twisting, can make the pain worse. Even light exercise such as walking can cause pain if the disc has degenerated enough.
          Numbness, tingling, and/or weakness: If the degenerated disc presses on nearby nerves, it can cause numbness, tingling, weakness, or a combination of these in the arms (from pinched nerves in the neck) or legs (from pinched nerves in the back).
        
        Lying down can often provide relief from pain because it reduces the stress on the spine.
        What can cause degenerative disc disease?
        Degenerative disc disease is primarily caused by the natural aging process. As we get older, the discs in our spine lose their water and protein content, making them less flexible and more prone to wear and tear. However, several factors can increase the risk of developing DDD or cause worsening symptoms. These include:
        
          Genetics: A family history of degenerative disc disease can make you more susceptible to the condition.
          Injury: A back or neck injury can damage the discs and lead to future development of DDD.
          Repetitive stress: Jobs or activities that involve repetitive lifting, bending, or twisting can put extra stress on the discs. With time, this wear and tear can worsen disc degeneration.
          Obesity: Excess body weight puts additional pressure on the spine, accelerating disc degeneration.
        
        Managing symptoms of degenerative disc disease
        While there is no cure for degenerative disc disease, there are several ways to manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life.
        Physical therapy and lifestyle changes are essential parts of treatment and prevention. Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles that support your spine, improving flexibility and helping to reduce pain. A physical therapist can design a personalized program, typically with emphasis on stretching and strengthening exercises, to address your specific needs.
        Maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding activities that put excessive strain on your back can also help manage the symptoms of DDD. Regular exercise, especially low-impact activities like walking or swimming, can also help.
        For relief of pain and discomfort, other treatment options include:
        
          Medications: Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve), or acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help reduce pain and inflammation. In some cases, doctors may prescribe stronger medications or muscle relaxants.
          Hot and cold therapy: Applying heat or cold packs to the affected area can provide relief from pain. Heat helps relax muscles and improve blood flow, while cold can reduce inflammation and numb the painful area.
          Alternative therapies: Some people find relief through alternative treatments like acupuncture, chiropractic care, or massage therapy. Discuss these options with your doctor to ensure they are safe and appropriate for your condition.
        
        Emerging treatment options such as growth factor and stem cell injections are also being actively researched.
        Surgical treatments
        In most cases, degenerative disc disease can be treated without surgery. However, in severe cases when conservative treatments are not effective, surgery may be an option. If symptoms due to disc degeneration worsen and affect daily activities, surgery can relieve pressure and stabilize the spine. The most common surgical options include:
        
          Spinal fusion: In this procedure, two or more vertebrae are permanently connected to eliminate movement between them. This can help reduce pain but may limit flexibility.
          Artificial disc replacement: This surgery involves replacing the damaged disc with an artificial one to maintain motion in the spine. It is a newer procedure and not suitable for everyone.
          Laminectomy: A laminectomy involves removing part of the vertebra to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. This can help reduce pain and improve mobility.
          Discectomy: A discectomy is the removal of the damaged portion of a disc that is pressing on a nerve. It can provide significant pain relief, and is often done as a minimally invasive procedure.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","July 18, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-to-get-rid-of-a-sinus-headache,How to get rid of a sinus headache,"Sinus headaches cause pain and pressure that's typically felt behind your eyes, nose, cheeks, or forehead. When you experience a sinus headache, you want relief — fast. Treating a sinus headache typically involves a combination of over-the-counter medications and other therapeutic options that target inflammation and congestion in the sinuses.
        What causes sinus headaches?
        The sinuses are air-filled cavities situated around your eyes and on either side of your nose. These cavities play an important role in warming and moistening the air you breathe. Healthy sinuses allow mucus to drain and air to circulate throughout the nasal passages.
        Sinuses are prone to inflammation, known as sinusitis, which may lead to the common symptoms of pressure and pain. The most common cause of sinusitis is a viral infection, but both bacteria and fungi can be the culprits. Allergies can also cause sinus inflammation.
        Less often, sinus pain and pressure are triggered by exposure to secondhand smoke, perfume, or other inhaled chemicals. Structural issues, like nasal polyps or a deviated septum, can prevent the sinuses from draining properly and allow inflammation to take hold. Sudden changes in air pressure can also cause pain without inflammation.
        Treating sinus headaches
        Treating sinus headaches most often involves reducing inflammation and congestion in the sinuses. The most common treatments include the following:
        
          Decongestants can relieve nasal congestion and improve sinus drainage by reducing swelling of blood vessels in your nose. Oral pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) and nasal oxymetazoline (Afrin nasal spray, Zicam nasal spray) are common over-the-counter decongestants. Pseudoephedrine is a stimulant and may cause side effects such as insomnia, racing pulse, and jitteriness. It's best to avoid the drug if you have high blood pressure or a heart condition unless you have your doctor's okay. Nasal decongestants act locally in the nose and sinuses, which limits the potential adverse effects on other body parts. However, you should not use nasal decongestant sprays for more than a few days to avoid a rebound effect where symptoms can worsen after stopping the medication.
          Antihistamines block the action of histamine, a substance released during allergic reactions that causes mucus production and swelling in the mucosal lining of the sinuses. They are particularly effective if the sinus headache is triggered by allergies. Antihistamines are available over the counter and by prescription.
          Nasal steroid sprays reduce the swelling of nasal membranes and are particularly useful for people with allergies. They are also available over the counter and by prescription. Nasal steroid sprays take up to one week to start working, with maximal effects two to three weeks later. They are designed for longer-term use. They are also available over the counter and by prescription.
          Saline nasal sprays do not contain medication. They add moisture to the nasal passages, thin mucus secretions, and flush out inflamed cells and germs.
          Pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve) can alleviate sinus pain.
          Antibiotics might be prescribed if a bacterial infection is present, although many sinus infections improve without antibiotic treatment.
        
        How to relieve sinus pressure
        Since sinus pressure is caused by inflammation and congestion, you'll want to do what you can to restore proper drainage of the sinus cavities. The following approaches can help:
        
          Drink plenty of water to keep mucus thin and loose.
          Apply a warm compress to your face.
          Inhale steam. Spend time in a hot shower, or boil water and inhale the steam from a pot. Even steam inhaled from hot tea or chicken soup can help. Aim to inhale steam three to four times a day.
          A neti pot or another sinus rinsing system may provide relief. Always use distilled, purified, or boiled water that is allowed to cool.
          Elevate your head while sleeping. If the pain is on one side, sleep on the pain-free side.
          Use saline nasal sprays to loosen mucus and rinse the sinuses.
        
        Preventing sinus headaches
        To prevent sinus headaches, avoid triggers such as allergens and cigarette smoke that can cause sinus inflammation. Speak to your doctor about treatment for nasal polyps or a deviated nasal septum if you have either of these conditions.
        Because most sinus headaches are caused by viral infections, do your best to avoid these germs by washing your hands properly and keeping your distance from people who are ill. If you catch a cold, blow your nose gently without pinching it tightly to avoid forcing germs up into your sinuses.
        You can also protect your sinuses by staying well hydrated and keeping your sinuses moist with steam inhalation and nasal irrigation.",Jenette Restivo,"July 17, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/exposure-therapy-what-is-it-and-how-can-it-help,Exposure therapy: What is it and how can it help?,"Exposure therapy is a way to help people conquer their fears, stress, or anxiety. Exposure therapy has been scientifically proven to be a safe and effective treatment for a variety of psychological issues.
        What is exposure therapy?
        Exposure therapy is a type of psychological therapy used to help people overcome problems such as phobias, panic attacks, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It involves exposing a person, in a safe environment, to the object, activity, or situation that they fear or struggle with.
        When people are afraid of something, they tend to avoid it. While this may work in the short term, over time the fear may become worse and negatively impact a person's life.
        Exposure therapy is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. It can help break the cycle of avoidance and fear.
        Who might benefit from exposure therapy?
        Exposure therapy has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for people of all ages, including children and teenagers, in helping them overcome their fears.
        Examples of people who may benefit from exposure therapy are veterans with combat-related PTSD, adults with anxiety disorders including specific phobias, and children who have experienced traumatic events.
        What to expect from exposure therapy
        Exposure therapy starts with a provider learning more about you and what you are afraid of. You'll typically meet with the therapist once a week for several weeks to a few months, usually averaging between eight and 12 sessions.
        There are several different types of exposure therapy that can be used, based on your need and circumstances.
        Real exposure involves directly facing the object, situation, or activity that you are afraid of. The exposure starts gradually and is slowly increased. For example, someone with a fear of spiders may be shown a live spider across the room, then asked to observe it up close, and eventually may be encouraged to handle it.
        Imagined exposure involves imagining the object, situation, or activity that you fear. For example, a veteran may be asked to remember and describe the sights and sounds of being in combat.
        Simulation exposure involves using virtual reality technology to simulate what you are afraid of. It's used when real exposure is not possible, such as for people with a fear of flying on planes.
        Sensation awareness, also called interoceptive exposure, involves creating physical sensations that are harmless but feared. For example, the provider may ask someone who gets panic attacks to run on a treadmill to make their heart rate go up, to show them that this sensation is not dangerous.
        Prolonged exposure is therapy that is provided more slowly, over a period of several months, so that a person has time to accept the exposure and sufficiently process the experience. This type of exposure therapy is often used to treat PTSD. It is not typically used for other anxiety disorders.
        Exposure therapy is sometimes combined with relaxation exercises, to help associate a feared object or situation with relaxation.
        Benefits of exposure therapy
        Untreated fear, stress, or anxiety can have a profound impact on your quality of life.
        Exposure therapy can help in several ways. Over time, it can help weaken the negative association you previously had with something you feared.
        Exposure therapy can also show that you are capable of confronting your fears and managing your anxiety. It can restore a feeling of power and control that comes from facing and overcoming your fears or negative circumstances.
        Exposure therapy can result in significant symptom reduction, with benefits continuing for years after treatment.
        Which mental health professionals practice exposure therapy?
        Not all therapists or counselors are trained in, or provide, exposure therapy. Licensed psychologists (PhD or PsyD), licensed professional counselors (LPC), or licensed clinical social workers (LCSW) can all deliver exposure therapy.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","July 15, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/what-is-malaise,What is malaise?,"Have you ever felt a vague sense of discomfort or unease without being able to pinpoint exactly why? That feeling is known as malaise. It's a general term used to describe feeling tired, weak, or generally unwell.

What is malaise?

Malaise is a French word that translates to ""discomfort"" or ""unease."" In medical terms, it refers to a feeling of overall weakness or discomfort.

According to Dr. Robert Shmerling, Senior Faculty Editor at Harvard Health Publishing and former Clinical Chief of the Division of Rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, malaise can be difficult to describe because the symptoms are nonspecific.

""I define malaise as a sense of feeling generally unwell. People with malaise often find it hard to put into words. They may describe a vague sick feeling, or a sense that they're 'coming down with something.' It's often accompanied by feeling tired, but not always,"" Dr. Shmerling explains.

Malaise can vary in intensity. For some it might be a mild sense of tiredness, while for others it can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. It is not a disease or condition in and of itself, but rather a symptom that something else is going on in the body. Because it is so general, it can be challenging to diagnose the exact cause of malaise without further medical investigation.

Common causes of malaise

Malaise is often one of the first signs that something is wrong in the body, even if other specific symptoms have not yet appeared. ""I would never start out assuming it's 'nothing' or 'imagined' or 'just stress' or 'just getting older.' The symptom should be taken as seriously as any other and evaluated appropriately,"" says Dr. Shmerling.

Malaise can result from a wide range of causes, from infections to chronic diseases and even lifestyle factors. Here are some common causes:

Infections. Viral and bacterial infections, such as colds and flu and COVID-19, can cause malaise. It is often the body's initial response to fighting off an infection.

Chronic diseases. Conditions such as diabetes, anemia, and heart disease can lead to feelings of malaise due to the ongoing stress they place on the body.

Mental health issues. Depression, anxiety, and stress can contribute to malaise. These conditions can drain your energy and make you feel generally unwell.

Medications. Some medications have side effects that can include malaise. If you start feeling unwell after beginning a new medication, tell your doctor.

Nutritional deficiencies. Not consuming enough of essential nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, can cause malaise. For example, deficiencies in vitamin D or iron are well-known causes of fatigue and general weakness.

Sleep disorders. Conditions like insomnia or sleep apnea can prevent you from getting enough restorative sleep, leading to feelings of malaise.

Lifestyle factors. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and inadequate sleep can all contribute to feeling unwell, which can worsen malaise. Our bodies need balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, proper hydration, and adequate sleep to function properly.

How is malaise managed?

Managing malaise involves a two-pronged approach of identifying and treating the underlying cause and addressing symptoms.

Addressing the underlying cause of malaise

The first step in managing malaise is to determine its root cause. This often requires one or more visits to a health care provider who can carefully review your symptoms, examine you, and perform various tests if needed.

Your doctor will likely ask you detailed questions about your medical history and symptoms to start to narrow things down. For example:


	How long have you been feeling this way? How would you rate the severity of your symptoms on a scale of 1 to 10?
	What makes your symptoms better or worse? Do they come and go or stay constant? Do they go away or improve if you are distracted or on vacation?
	Do you have any prior experience with, or episodes of, malaise?
	Are there any other symptoms such as cough, chest pain, fever, fatigue, pain, weight change, bleeding, changes in your stool or urine, rash, or loss of appetite?
	Do you take any medications or supplements? Are any of these new?
	Do you have a history of thyroid problems?
	Have you been feeling depressed or have any new stressors in your life?
	Have you traveled recently?
	Describe your sleep patterns, exercise, and dietary habits.


Your doctor will also perform a thorough physical examination and may order certain laboratory tests.

Treatment will depend on the underlying cause. If an infection is causing your malaise, antibiotics or antiviral medications may be prescribed. For chronic diseases such as high blood pressure or diabetes, managing the condition through medication, lifestyle changes, and ongoing medical care is essential.

In cases where mental health issues may factor into the malaise, talk therapy and sometimes medication can help alleviate the feelings of malaise. If a medication you are taking is causing the problem, your doctor might adjust the dosage or switch you to a different drug.

Lifestyle changes to manage symptoms

Regardless of the underlying cause, certain lifestyle changes may help manage and reduce malaise by improving your overall health and well-being. But according to Dr. Shmerling, you should be cautious about making drastic changes prior to getting your symptoms sorted out by a doctor.

""Sometimes, a lifestyle suggestion is premature. For example: exercise might be great for someone who is deconditioned and otherwise healthy; but it might be impossible or even make things worse (at least in the short run) if the person turns out to have new, untreated heart disease,"" says Dr. Shmerling. ""That said, I would encourage other standard recommendations for a healthy lifestyle, which include a healthy diet, adequate sleep, and stress management, while the work-up is ongoing.""

Healthy lifestyle changes you can discuss with your doctor include:

Improving your diet. Ensure you are eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Sometimes, supplements might be necessary if you have specific deficiencies.

Staying hydrated. Drinking enough water throughout the day is crucial. Dehydration can lead to feelings of fatigue.

Regular exercise. Incorporating regular physical activity into your routine can boost your energy levels and improve overall well-being. Even light exercises like walking can make a difference.

Prioritizing sleep. Good sleep hygiene is essential. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, create a relaxing bedtime routine, and ensure your sleeping environment is comfortable.

Managing stress. Techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga, and deep-breathing exercises can help reduce stress levels and improve your sense of well-being.

Avoiding alcohol and smoking. Both can contribute to feelings of malaise. Cutting down or quitting can improve your overall health.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","July 10, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/dreaming-of-a-good-nights-rest,Dreaming of a good night's rest,"Sleep problems are an all-too-common reality for most older adults. Maybe they have trouble falling asleep, or wake up several times during the night, or have to take naps during the day to fight fatigue.
        Some of these sleep issues are age-related. For example, older adults often sleep less deeply than younger people and are more easily awakened. They also may take specific medication that have sleep-disrupting side effects.
        Older adults also are more likely to suffer from conditions that affect sleep, like sleep apnea (where you experience short pauses in your breathing many times during the night) and restless legs syndrome (an uncontrollable urge to move the legs).
        Rest and renew
        Proper sleep is as important as diet and exercise for optimal health. When you sleep, your body's cells repair and recharge themselves, so you feel energized the next day. Sleep also clears toxins from the brain, which keeps your brain sharp.
        The amount of sleep people need does not change as they age, according to Dr. Salma Batool-Anwar, who specializes in sleep disorders at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Older adults still require seven to nine hours of sleep per night, just like when they were younger,"" he says.
        Healthy sleep also means uninterrupted sleep. A good night's rest consists of completing four to five continuous sleep cycles. Each cycle includes periods of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, when you dream, and non-REM sleep, when you have deep, dreamless slumber.
        ""If your sleep gets disrupted or becomes fragmented, you could lose a chunk of either non-REM or REM sleep,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar.
        
          
            
              
                Healthy sleep leads to a healthier brain
                Fragmented sleep can lead to a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. A study published by Current Biology measured sleep quality of adults in their 60s and 70s in a lab over an eight-hour night of sleep and periodically measured beta-amyloid protein in their brains with a PET scan over several years. (Beta-amyloid buildup is linked with Alzheimer's disease.) People with poor sleep quality also had higher amounts of beta-amyloid. Those with more restorative sleep had lower levels.
              
            
          
        
        Pillow talk
        See your doctor if you feel you suffer from a sleep-related disorder. Otherwise, the following strategies can help keep your sleep cycle running smoothly.
        Review your medications. Diuretics (water pills) used to control blood pressure can make you wake up to use the bathroom. Some antidepressants cause daytime drowsiness and make it hard to fall asleep at night. ""Consult your doctor about possibly changing medication, lowering the dose, or taking it at different times, like at night rather than in the morning,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar.
        Watch your naps. Regular naps reduce fatigue and increase alertness and mood. But they also can interfere with your sleep cycle if you take them later in the day. ""Schedule them during a specific time of day, like in the early to late afternoon,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Keep naps to 15 to 20 minutes (set a timer to make sure you don't oversleep). Sleeping longer can make you feel groggy.
        Set stimuli cutoffs. For example, don't watch TV or use a computer at least an hour before bedtime. If your bladder often wakes you up, don't drink any liquids at least two hours beforehand. Also, avoid caffeine at least three hours before bedtime; caffeine reaches a peak level in your body within an hour after consumption, but it takes three to five hours for half of it to be eliminated. While regular exercise can help with sleep quality, working out within three hours of bedtime may lead to fragmented sleep.
        Create a sleep routine. Go to bed around the same time, and give yourself about an hour beforehand for bedtime rituals like bathing, brushing your teeth, and putting on comfortable pajamas. ""The structure teaches your body and mind how to properly wind down, which makes falling and staying asleep easier,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar.
        Prepare a soothing sleep setting. Make sure the bedroom is dark and cool. Listen to a relaxing sound machine. Or wear eyeshades or earplugs if you are sensitive to light or noise. Buy new sheets and pillows. Also, don't keep any stimulating electronics in the bedroom like a TV, computer, or phone.
        Establish a time limit. If you don't fall asleep within about 20 minutes, don't lie in bed awake. ""This can make insomnia even worse,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Go to another room and read or listen to soothing music. ""But don't watch TV or a computer or anything stimulating,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. When you feel relaxed, try to sleep again.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/can-your-blood-tests-predict-your-future-risk-of-stress-anxiety-or-depression,"Can your blood tests predict your future risk of stress, anxiety, or depression?","When the doctor says your blood sugar or cholesterol levels are off, you might worry about diabetes or heart disease. But a large study published online April 2, 2024, by JAMA Network Open suggests that abnormal levels of those biomarkers might also signal a risk for developing chronic stress, anxiety, or depression years later. Researchers at facilities around the world, including Harvard, analyzed the health information of more than 211,000 people in Sweden. At the start of the study, participants were middle-aged (42 on average) and free of chronic stress or mood disorders. Each person was tested for levels of blood sugar and fats, such as triglycerides and HDL (good) cholesterol. After 21 years, people who'd had high blood sugar and high triglycerides at the start of the study were more likely to have developed chronic stress or mood disorders by age 60, compared with people who'd had low or normal blood sugar levels and triglycerides. On the flip side, people who'd had high levels of HDL were less likely to develop chronic stress or mood disorders compared with people who'd had low levels of HDL. This study doesn't answer the question of whether abnormal levels of sugar and fats lead to chronic stress, anxiety, or depression, or if the connection is more complicated or involves other factors. However, we know for sure that it's important to keep levels of sugar and fats normal to reduce the risk for many diseases.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heart-failure-might-be-the-most-common-complication-of-atrial-fibrillation,Heart failure might be the most common complication of atrial fibrillation,"Doctors have long warned that atrial fibrillation (afib), a common heart rhythm disorder, can lead to a stroke. Afib describes a condition in which the heart's upper chambers beat erratically, which can make blood pool and form clots that travel to the brain or other parts of the body. But a large observational study from Denmark, published online April 17, 2024, by The BMJ, suggests that heart failure might be an even bigger risk from afib. Researchers evaluated the health information of more than three million people (ages 45 to 95) who were afib-free and followed for more than 20 years. Among people who developed afib during the study, heart failure occurred about twice as often as a stroke (41% vs. 21%) and more than three times as often as a heart attack (41% vs. 12%). How does afib contribute to heart failure? The erratic and ineffective beating of the upper chambers of the heart probably forces the lower chambers to work harder. Over time, that toll can reduce the heart's ability to pump enough blood to meet your needs. That's one more reason why it's important to seek treatment for afib and minimize symptoms. For more information, check out the Harvard Special Health Report Managing Atrial Fibrillation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/reaching-the-climax,Reaching the climax,"Regular orgasms offer numerous health benefits for men, such as lowering stress, boosting mood, and improving sleep quality. Some research has suggested that they may help reduce the risk of heart disease and prostate cancer.
        However, as they age, men can face obstacles to achieving orgasms. They may be unable to have an orgasm during sex (a condition known as anorgasmia), or it may take a frustratingly long time to climax (what's called delayed orgasm). Men also may have trouble maintaining an erection long enough to have sex. Sometimes, lack of arousal can prevent them from reaching an orgasm.
        ""Men don't have to achieve an orgasm every time during sex to have a satisfying experience with their partner,"" says Dr. Sharon Bober, director of the Sexual Health Program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""But if men are unable to have regular orgasms during sex, there are ways to help.""
        Many issues can contribute to problems having orgasm, such as low testosterone levels, medication side effects, and psychological problems like anxiety and stress, so first check with your doctor. Still, sometimes men only need extra stimulation or sexual excitement to reach orgasm. Or they may require help maintaining an erection (and don't want to rely on erectile dysfunction medication). In these cases, Dr. Bober suggests trying the following strategies.
        Masturbate more
        Masturbating alongside your partner or enlisting their help can increase excitement. ""Masturbation helps reduce the stress of performance or climaxing within a certain period, since you can take your time and go at your own pace,"" says Dr. Bober.
        Men also may benefit from frequent solo masturbation. ""Men know what arouses them, and masturbating more by themselves can help them focus on their own pleasure,"" says Dr. Bober. ""This may help lower expectations with partner sex because they don't have to view having an orgasm as the ultimate goal of their satisfaction. Instead, they can focus on the experience of connecting with their partner, which can increase arousal.""
        Get erotic
        Reading erotic literature together can stimulate sexual desire through storytelling, imagery, fantasy, and language. ""Reading and listening stimulate your largest sexual organ: your brain,"" says Dr. Bober.
        There are now many erotic novels and short story anthologies that cater specifically to older adults. (You can find a wide selection with an Internet search and via websites for publishing houses and booksellers.)
        Play with toys
        Many kinds of sex toys and devices help increase stimulation and help maintain erections. For instance, the penile vibratory device is placed around the penis and vibrates to stimulate the nerves in the base of the penis to encourage an orgasm. It's used before sex and can be incorporated into foreplay. To help maintain an erection, men could try a penile band, also known as an ED ring. It fastens around the base of an erect penis to keep blood from escaping. Bands are made of rubber, plastic, or silicone and can be bought online.
        Another helpful device is a vacuum pump. You place your penis into an airtight plastic cylinder that's attached to a handheld pump. Air is pumped out of the cylinder to create a vacuum, which increases blood flow to the penis. It takes about five minutes to get an erection. You then remove your penis from the cylinder and fit a penile band around its base to prevent blood from draining.
        The erection lasts until the band is removed. Some pumps are manual, while others operate on a battery. You can find them in many pharmacies and online.
        Go exploring
        Devote more time to the excitement of hugging, kissing, and exploring each other's bodies, and experiment with different foreplay like giving each other a massage or giving and receiving oral sex. Also, talk with your partner about what they are interested in trying. This could include fantasies, role playing, or different sexual positions.
        ""Many times, just having the conversation can boost arousal for both people,"" says Dr. Bober.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/when-walking-becomes-a-pain,When walking becomes a pain,"Walking can be hampered for a number of reasons, such as arthritis, a joint injury, or muscle strain. With these conditions, you most often already have pain before you begin walking.
        But if you are pain-free and then pain arises as you walk faster or longer, it could be a vascular or nerve cause, especially peripheral artery disease, sciatica, or lumbar spinal stenosis.
        Ironically, the best strategy when facing these is to keep walking and stay active, even if it means a little more pain with movement.
        Peripheral artery disease (PAD)
        PAD occurs when the arteries that carry blood to the leg muscles narrow, most often because of a buildup of fatty plaque.
        The first PAD symptom typically is pain in one or both legs when walking that goes away when you slow down or stop. When you walk, your leg muscles need more blood flow to deliver oxygen to the muscles. Narrowed leg arteries won't allow the blood flow to increase, so the muscles hurt from a lack of oxygen. With severe PAD, people can develop leg pain at rest.
        Plaque buildup can affect more than the legs. ""If you have blockages in your leg arteries, you probably have blockages in the arteries leading to your heart and brain, which can raise your risk for a heart attack or stroke,"" says Dr. Mohamad Hussain, a vascular and endovascular surgeon with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Diagnosing PAD begins with a detailed review of your symptoms and a physical exam. Your doctor feels the pulses in both legs and feet to identify any reduction in blood flow. The next assessment is often a comparison of the blood pressures and blood flow in your legs versus your arms using ultrasound and a blood pressure cuff. This allows a calculation of the ankle-­brachial index, a more accurate indicator of PAD. Depending on the results, your doctor might also order an imaging test, such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI, to identify artery blockages.
        Unfortunately, PAD can't be cured once you have it. The goal is to control its progression by addressing the main risk factors. That means adopting a heart-healthy diet, not smoking, and beginning a regular walking program.
        ""Walking increases blood flow in the smaller arteries of the legs and helps create new channels to move blood around the blockages,"" says Dr. Hussain. ""This, in effect, brings more blood flow and oxygen to your leg muscles.""
        Of course, if you have PAD, walking is the ultimate Catch-22 — it helps the condition, but can also cause pain. The solution is to begin slowly and pace yourself. Walk every other day at first, and then progress to more days and longer periods.
        ""As you improve, you should find that walking becomes easier and you have fewer stop-and-rest periods,"" says Dr. Hussain. ""Eventually, you want to build up to walking for at least 30 minutes at a time, five times a week. This is a good target to help prevent PAD, too.""
        Sciatica
        Sciatica is the term for pain that happens because of pinching or irritation anywhere along the route of the sciatic nerve, which runs from the spine through the buttock and down the leg.
        Symptoms of sciatica can vary from dull soreness, numbness, or tingling to feelings of an electric shock, throbbing heat, or stabbing pain. While increased pain with walking may be one person's predominant symptom, usually there are other symptoms, such as low back pain and difficulty sitting.
        A common culprit for sciatica is a herniated disc (also referred to as a ruptured disc, pinched nerve, or slipped disc). But the pain can also originate from arthritis, an inflamed or narrowed sciatic notch in the pelvic bone, or piriformis syndrome, in which the piriformis muscle in the buttock compresses the sciatic nerve.
        Your doctor can often diagnose sciatica just based on your history and a physical exam. If the symptoms are severe or unusual, your doctor might order an imaging test, most often MRI. Once again, you need to find ways to stay physically active.
        ""Many people fear that activity will cause or worsen sciatica pain, but low-impact activity and exercise can help strengthen the areas along the nerve and prevent future attacks or at least lower their intensity and frequency,"" says Dr. Jeffrey N. Katz, a professor of medicine and orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School.
        Examples include riding a stationary bike, doing daily back stretching, and yoga. ""Physical therapy can also help strengthen muscles around the spine, which may take some pressure off your discs,"" says Dr. Katz. If the pain is especially intense or persists, you may opt for a corticosteroid injection or a short course of an oral corticosteroid, usually prednisone.
        Lumbar spinal stenosis
        In lumbar spinal stenosis, the space inside the lowest part of the spinal canal narrows, usually from degeneration of discs, ligaments, or any of the joints between the interlocking vertebrae that form the spine. This puts pressure on the spinal cord and the nerves.
        Pain that occurs only when walking may be the only symptom of lumbar spinal stenosis. Many people discover that immediately squatting or sitting helps lessens the pain. Other symptoms include
        
          low back pain
          pain in the groin, buttocks, and upper thigh that does not move down the leg (unlike the pain of sciatica)
          pain that feels worse when you lean back and becomes less intense if you lean forward.
        
        A definitive diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis usually requires an imaging test, such as an MRI or CT scan.
        As with back pain, PAD, and sciatica, staying physically active is a must. Walk as much as you can tolerate. ""Riding a stationary bike also can be a useful exercise,"" says Dr. Katz. Physical therapy is helpful, too: a physical therapist can guide you through maneuvers and exercises to maintain core and leg strength.
        Over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers can ease discomfort. Your doctor may discuss corticosteroid injections, though the evidence is mixed regarding their effectiveness.
        If your symptoms don't improve, surgery called laminectomy may be the next step. Here, the surgeon removes the bony plate on the back of the vertebra where the stenosis is located, which opens up more space for the spinal nerves.

        Using data from a Japanese health insurance association, researchers identified nearly 140,000 married couples in which one person had a cardiovascular-related problem. (Most were men, with an average age of 58). They then compared these couples to a control group of similar couples without heart problems.
        During the follow-up period, which lasted a median of 2.5 years, people whose spouses had cardiovascular disease had a 14% higher risk of being diagnosed with depression.
        People whose spouses have heart disease often cope with grief as well as caregiving and financial burdens, the study authors noted. Their findings suggest that more attention to and support for them is needed.

Their average LDL (bad) cholesterol level was about 140 mg/dL. In general, LDL levels should be 100 or lower and even less (below 70 or even 55) for people with heart disease.
        Nearly 91% of the participants correctly determined whether they should or shouldn't take a statin, as compared with a doctor's assessment. Most continued on to the six-month treatment phase, and 98% correctly used the recommended drug (a 5-milligram dose of rosuvastatin [Crestor]), achieving a 35% drop in their LDL levels.
        The app is being developed by the drug's maker, AstraZeneca, based on FDA guidance, but it still requires regulatory approval. The goal is to enable people to assess their need for a statin and start the drug without a physician's prescription.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/protect-your-heart-during-the-dog-days-of-summer,Protect your heart during the dog days of summer,"During the summer of 2023, record-breaking high temperatures scorched many regions of the United States. Not surprisingly, emergency department visits for heat-related illnesses also rose over that time period, according to the CDC. This worrisome trend is expected to continue as climate change ushers in longer, hotter, and more frequent episodes of extreme heat.
        People who have underlying health problems — especially cardiovascular disease — are more vulnerable to the hazards of high temperatures. Air pollution, another threat to the heart, can also pose problems during the summer months.
        Why heat is hard on the heart
        ""People who have or are at risk for cardiovascular disease should be a bit more cautious exercising outside in hot weather,"" says Dr. Prashant Rao, a sports cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. When the temperature soars, exercise is more taxing because your heart has to pump extra blood not only to your muscles but also to your skin to help radiate away excess heat, he explains. But when the air temperature approaches body temperature (around 98° F), this process no longer works. Sweating also helps cool your body: heat from your body turns liquid sweat into water vapor. This works well on dry days, but when humidity levels climb above 75% or so, the water vapor already in the air makes evaporation more difficult.
        Hot-weather hints
        ""It's still important to exercise during warm weather, but you may need to crank down your intensity a couple of notches,"" says Dr. Rao. He offers these additional tips for exercising safely during heat waves:
        Avoid outdoor activity during the hottest part of the day. Temperature usually peaks between noon to 3 p.m., so consider doing outdoor exercise in the early morning or early evening—but away from traffic-heavy areas (see below).
        Choose the right attire. Lightweight, light-colored clothing made from sweat-wicking material will keep you cooler.
        Stay hydrated. Drink water throughout the day, but especially when you're active outdoors. Plain water is fine, but if you're exercising in the heat for more than an hour (for instance, a long tennis match or round of golf) sports drinks are a better option. These beverages contain electrolytes — minerals such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium — that can replenish what you lose from sweating. People who take blood pressure medications (especially diuretics) are more prone to becoming dehydrated in hot weather, so they should be extra careful to drink plenty of water, says Dr. Rao.
        Exercise in water or work out in an air-conditioned space. Sometimes it's simply uncomfortable to even walk outdoors. On those days, consider swimming or doing water aerobics, or head to an air-conditioned fitness center.
        Air quality concerns
        During the summer, high temperatures speed up the chemical reactions that create air pollution. Smog and haze result from a combination of dust, water vapor, and tiny airborne particles from industrial power plants, vehicle emissions, and wildfires. Wildfires, which tend to strike in summer and early fall, are now more frequent due to climate change and play an increasing role in overall air quality.
        Air pollution contains invisible particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter — so minuscule they aren't trapped by filters in your nose and upper airway. Known as PM2.5, they pass through your lungs into your bloodstream, where they can interact with receptors and trigger nerves that help regulate your heart rate and breathing. These particles also spur inflammation — the outpouring of immune system cells and other substances that accelerate atherosclerosis (buildup of fatty plaque inside the arteries).
        Even low levels of air pollution appear to increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and irregular heart rhythms. That's why it's worth keeping tabs on the air quality in your area. Local news outlets sometimes report this information, which is also featured on many weather-based smartphone apps and available from the Environmental Protection Agency at AirNow.
        There's still a lot of learn about air pollution's effect on the heart and the best prevention strategies. Still, people should heed the warnings about staying inside if the air quality is poor, and be mindful of when and where they exercise, says Dr. Rao.
        ""When my primary care provider recently asked me about my exercise routine, I told him I run by Charles River as part of my marathon training. He pointed out that the route is right near a very busy road and that I should avoid running there during rush hour,"" says Dr. Rao.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/meditation-a-heartfelt-habit,Meditation: A heartfelt habit?,"Meditating sounds so simple: Just sit comfortably and quiet your mind. Yet even seasoned practitioners will tell you that settling into a meditative state isn't easy, especially when you're anxious, worried, or stressed. But meditation may benefit people prone to cardiovascular disease, so it's worth giving this mind-calming technique a try (see ""How meditation may help your heart"").
        ""When you start any new activity, coaching or guidance can really help, and that's also true when learning to meditate,"" says Dr. Darshan Mehta, medical director of the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Many communities have meditation centers where you can take classes in person. But online courses, which are more convenient and accessible, can be just as effective, he says. Another option is to try a smartphone app that offers guided meditations; popular ones include Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer, and 10% Happier.
        
          
            
              
                How meditation may help your heart
                An article published Feb. 15, 2024, in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews looked at the potential cardiovascular benefits from two forms of meditation: mindfulness-based practices and Transcendental Meditation. The authors analyzed 81 randomized controlled trials involving a total of nearly 7,000 people.
                Over all, the findings were mixed, which may reflect some of the inherent challenges of studying meditation. For one thing, creating an appropriate placebo or control group for meditation is tricky. Often, the controls are either people on a waiting list to receive meditation training (inactive controls) or those who do crossword puzzles or attend education sessions (active controls). For another, the people most likely to volunteer for a meditation study are often already sold on meditation's benefits and may differ from those who aren't interested in the practice.
                Still, the review found that mindfulness-based interventions probably reduce stress and may also lower anxiety, depression, and blood pressure. Transcendental meditation may also reduce blood pressure. According to the authors, some of meditation's effect may be indirect: when people feel calmer, that may help them avoid unhealthy ways of coping with stress, such as drinking alcohol or making poor food choices.
              
            
          
        
        Attention and awareness
        Meditative practices fall into two broad categories: focused attention and open monitoring. With focused attention, you concentrate on one thing: counting, a mantra (a word or phrase such as ""peace"" or ""may I be well""), or an object (a candle, a tree, or prayer beads, for example). One well-known form, Transcendental Meditation, uses mantras. With open monitoring, you open your awareness to everything you're experiencing, including thoughts, feelings, sounds, and bodily sensations.
        Mindfulness meditation, which has become popular in recent decades, incorporates both attention and awareness. Other forms of meditation include samatha (calming and concentration) meditation, vipassana (insight) meditation, and metta (loving-kindness) meditation.
        Cultivating a meditation practice
        These tips may help you foster a regular meditation practice:
        Practice when it's practical. For some people, mornings are most convenient. Others prefer to meditate at the end of the day.
        Stick with it. Make it a habit once you've found your ideal time of day to meditate.
        Don't have high expectations. You won't emerge from your first session as a changed human being. Meditation is a process. Give it time, and you'll see improvements gradually.
        Take your practice with you. Meditate wherever you can find quiet moments alone — in your bedroom, at work, or while walking in the park.
        Accessorize. To focus your mind, use something meaningful to you, such as a candle, a piece of art, or a photo of a loved one.
        Be prepared to be uncomfortable. Stilling your thoughts is harder than it sounds. It could take a while for you to feel comfortable in the practice.
        Don't fight the feeling. Relax into the practice. Let your thoughts drift away. Ease into your breath. Even if you feel slightly uncomfortable, try to give in to the feeling and not push back against it.
        Be kind to yourself. If you don't get the hang of meditation right away, forgive yourself and try again. You will eventually get it.
        Check in with yourself. After each session, pause and take stock of your feelings. Have you let go of any tension or anxiety you were carrying? If not, do you need to relax for a few minutes more?

        The analysis, published in December 2023 by JAMA Network Open, involved more than 460,000 adults (average age 56, 55% women) who participated in the UK Biobank study over a four-year span. Participants reported how frequently they added salt to meals: never or rarely, sometimes, often, or always.
        Researchers tracked participants for an average of nearly 12 years to determine how many developed CKD, which increases the risks of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. After adjusting for factors such as smoking, weight, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, the researchers found that participants who regularly added salt to meals faced higher odds of CKD. The risk increased by 2% among occasional salters, 5% among frequent salters, and 6% among people who said they always added salt.

        The Harvard-led study, published March 5, 2024, in the Journal of the American Heart Association, analyzed CDC data collected from 2016 to 2020 from nearly 435,000 adults ages 18 to 74. About three-quarters of the 35,000 participants who said they used cannabis reported smoking as the most common way they got high. Participants also may have vaped or consumed edibles.
        Compared with people who never used cannabis, participants who did so once a week had a 3% higher risk of heart attack and a 5% higher risk of stroke during the four-year study period. But those who used cannabis daily faced 25% greater odds of a heart attack and were 42% likelier to have a stroke. The study was observational, meaning it couldn't prove that cannabis use causes cardiovascular problems — just that an association exists. But people who use cannabis should understand this association, especially as its use is becoming more popular, the study's authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-is-leaky-gut-syndrome,What is leaky gut syndrome?,"Q.
          I've been gassy and bloated in recent months, and my sister suggested that I may have leaky gut syndrome. What's that?
        
        A. For starters, anyone who's been dealing with chronic intestinal symptoms like yours should see a doctor. There are many reasons for gas and bloating to persist, and a medical evaluation will help get to the bottom of things.
        Beyond that, while leaky gut syndrome isn't a clinical diagnosis, it may be one possible contributor to your symptoms. A ""leaky gut"" happens when the barrier between the gut and bloodstream breaks down due to inflammation in the small intestine. The resulting bacteria and toxins that seep through the gut lining can trigger a variety of intestinal problems, including bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or gastroparesis (which prevents proper stomach emptying).
        To determine what's causing your distress, your doctor will likely ask what foods, supplements, and medications you consume. She may also perform blood tests or endoscopic exams of the digestive tract to detect any infections or structural reasons for your symptoms. Sometimes, a simple change of diet — such as cutting out certain foods or adding others — does the trick. But getting properly assessed is your next step.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/guidelines-for-healthy-eating-with-diabetes,Guidelines for healthy eating with diabetes,"""What can I eat?"" is one of the most common questions that people with diabetes ask. The American Diabetes Association no longer makes specific recommendations about proportions of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Instead, its guidelines focus on developing healthy eating patterns, with the help of your doctor and a registered dietitian who has experience working with people who have diabetes.
        The guidelines include the following recommendations:
        
          Reduce overall carbohydrates. When you do eat carbs, they should come from nutrient-rich sources, such as vegetables (particularly non-starchy ones), whole grains, fruits, legumes, and dairy products, rather than from processed foods with added fat, sugar, and sodium.
          Limit your intake of saturated fat (found mainly in animal products).Even good fats such as olive oil should be eaten in moderation.
          Replace sugar-sweetened beverages (including those sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup or sucrose) with water.
          Reduce sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day, or lower if you have high blood pressure.
          Drink alcohol in moderation only if you can account for the calories in your daily meal plan. Moderate drinking is defined as one standard drink a day for women and up to two a day for men. You must be cautious, however. Alcohol can worsen low blood sugar reactions in people who take insulin or certain other diabetes medications. And because some effects of alcohol (such as drowsiness or slurred speech) resemble those of hypoglycemia, it can be hard to recognize a true diabetic emergency if you have one.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/exercise-can-ease-rheumatoid-arthritis-pain,Exercise can ease rheumatoid arthritis pain,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can cause pain and stiffness that makes moving the last thing you want to do. But staying active is important. Not only is it beneficial for your general health — it's also a way to strengthen the muscles around your joints, improve your range of motion, and give you the opportunity to take part in the activities you enjoy.
        For people with RA, it's best to take a cautious and strategic approach when starting an exercise program. An individualized program — ideally developed with the help of a physical therapist — can help you protect vulnerable joints while strengthening surrounding muscles. A well-rounded exercise program should include each of these elements:
        Aerobic conditioning. Exercise that increases your heart rate and breathing rate has many benefits, including lowering your chances of developing conditions such as diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. When choosing aerobic activities, people with RA should consider low-impact exercises such as swimming, bicycle riding, and walking.
        Resistance training. Weak muscles, whether related to inactivity or side effects of medications like steroids, can diminish your stamina and leave joints less stable. Isometric exercises — exercises that involve muscle contractions with no movement, such as clasping your hands and pressing your arms together — can be a great way to start resistance training. When pain is under control, free weights or weight machines are good options for building muscle and increasing strength.
        Stretching and flexibility exercises. Joints damaged by RA don't move with the same ease or to the same degree (also called range of motion) as healthy joints. That makes activities that lengthen and strengthen the muscles surrounding your joints, such as stretching exercises, tai chi, and yoga, especially important for people with RA.
        Balance exercises. Having RA can cause problems with gait and balance, leaving you more vulnerable to stumbles and falls. A physical therapist can recommend individualized balance-training exercises. These may include practicing standing on one leg or exercises to strengthen core muscles.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/4-ways-to-eat-your-way-to-lower-cholesterol,4 ways to eat your way to lower cholesterol,"Many people can lower their cholesterol levels simply by changing what they eat. For example, eating less meat (and leaner cuts) and more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains can potentially lower your total cholesterol by 25% or more.
        Here are four steps for lowering your cholesterol through diet.
        
          Stick with unsaturated fats and avoid saturated and trans fats. Most vegetable fats (oils) are made up of ""healthy"" unsaturated fats that are good for your heart. Foods that contain healthy fats include oily fish, nuts, seeds, and some vegetables. At the same time, try to limit your intake of foods high in saturated fat, such as many meat and dairy products. 
          Get more soluble fiber. Eating more soluble fiber, such as that found in oatmeal and fruits, can lower blood cholesterol levels when eaten as part of a healthy-fat diet.
          Include plant sterols and stanols in your diet. These naturally occurring plant compounds are similar in structure to cholesterol, so when you eat them, they help limit the amount of cholesterol your body can absorb. Plant sterols and stanols are found in an increasing number of food products such as spreads, juices, and yogurts.
          Find a diet that works for you. When a friend or relative tells you how much his or her cholesterol level dropped after trying a particular diet, you may be tempted to try it yourself. If you do, and after a few months you discover that you're not getting the same benefits, you may need to chalk it up to genetic and physiological differences. There is no one-size-fits-all diet for cholesterol control. You may need to try several approaches to find one that works for you.
        
        Although diet can be a simple and powerful way to improve cholesterol levels, it plays a bigger role for some people than for others. Don't be discouraged if you have followed a diet but haven't reached your goal blood level. Keep it up. Even if you do end up needing medication to keep your cholesterol in check, you likely will need less than if you didn't make any dietary changes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/5-exercises-to-improve-hand-mobility,5 exercises to improve hand mobility,"If you find daily tasks difficult to do because you suffer from stiffness, swelling, or pain in your hands, the right exercises can help get you back in motion.
        Therapists usually suggest specific hand exercises depending on the condition. Some help increase a joint's range of motion or loosen tight muscles and tendons via stretching. Other exercises strengthen muscles around a joint to generate more power or to build greater endurance.
        Below you will find five commonly recommended exercises for hand and wrist problems. However, if your hand condition is painful or debilitating, it's best to get exercise advice from a physical therapist.
        Range-of-motion hand exercises
        Your muscles and tendons move the joints through arcs of motion, as when you bend and straighten your fingers. If your normal range of motion is impaired, for example, if you can't bend your thumb without pain, you may have trouble doing ordinary things like opening a jar.
        These exercises move your wrist and fingers through their normal ranges of motion and require all the hand's tendons to perform their specific functions. Hold each position for 5 to 10 seconds. Do one set of 10 repetitions, three times a day. All exercises should be done slowly and deliberately to avoid pain and injury. If you feel numbness or pain during or after exercising, stop and contact your doctor.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/stretching-and-strengthening-exercises-to-relieve-and-prevent-lower-back-pain,Stretching and strengthening exercises to relieve and prevent lower back pain,"Lower back pain is a common medical problem, affecting millions of people worldwide. Stretching and strengthening exercises may help prevent episodes of low back pain. Exercising while experiencing low back pain can also help, but requires a slow and cautious approach.
        Stretching and strengthening exercises to prevent lower back pain
        One of the best things you can do to prevent low back pain is to strengthen your back. Stronger and more flexible muscles are less likely to get injured.
        Back muscle training may help protect you from injury and back pain. It's also important to stretch and strengthen core muscles, which help to support the spine. Therefore, a stretching and strengthening regimen should target the back, abdominal, buttock, and upper leg muscles.
        Muscle-strengthening and stretching exercises such as the ones below can be very helpful. Try to do these exercises at least twice a week.
        Knee to chest stretch
        
          
        
        
          Lie on your back with both knees bent.
          Pull one knee toward your chest and hold it for 5 to 10 seconds.
          Return to the starting position.
          Repeat with the other leg.
          Do this 5 to 10 times with each leg.
        
        Pelvic tilts
        
          
            
          
        
        
          Lie on your back with both knees bent and your feet on the floor.
          Gently flatten your lower back to the floor and hold for 5 to 10 seconds, then relax.
          Do this 5 to 10 times.
        
        Knee cradle
        
          
        
        
          Lie on your back with your legs straight out.
          Bend your right knee and rotate your hip so that the lower leg is across your chest, pointing to the left. You should feel this stretch in your thigh.
          Hold for 5 to 10 seconds, then return to the starting position.
          Do this 5 times with each leg.
        
        Bridge
        
          
        
        
          Lie on your back with both knees bent and your feet on the floor.
          Gently raise your buttocks off the floor 4 to 6 inches, hold for 5 seconds.
          Return to the starting position.
          Do this 5 to 10 times.
        
        Stretching and strengthening exercises to relieve lower back pain
        It may be a good idea to consult with your doctor before starting any exercise if you are experiencing back pain. Depending on the cause of your pain, certain exercises might make it worse. For example, if you have sciatica, certain stretches or movement may aggravate your pain and condition.
        Otherwise, you may be able to gradually start gentle daily exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles supporting your lower back once you are no longer in severe pain. In addition, try to get up regularly and walk around to the extent you can.
        Low back pain caused by muscle strain or spasm can often be improved with exercises such as those described above. Research has found that certain exercises like tai chi, yoga, Pilates, and core or stabilization exercises can significantly help people with chronic low back pain. With any exercise, keep in mind that pushing muscles and joints too far too fast can lead to injury, so take a gradual and cautious approach.
        Moderate cold or heat, along with over-the-counter pain relievers, can also help to ease discomfort.
        How to prevent low back pain
        Preventing back pain is easier than treating it. Fortunately, there are many things you can do to prevent this type of pain:
        
          Lift properly. Use your legs, not your back, when lifting objects. Bend at your knees and keep your back straight. Stand close to the object and hold the object close to your body. Tighten your stomach muscles and lift with your leg muscles.
          Maintain good posture. Avoid slouching when standing or sitting. Sit up straight with your back against the chair and feet flat on the floor. Stand tall with your head up and shoulders back. Take regular breaks from sitting: If you work at a desk, take regular breaks to move around.
          Maintain a healthy weight. Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight reduces the strain on your back.
          Stay active. Regular physical activity keeps your back muscles strong. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week.
          Get enough calcium and vitamin D. These nutrients keep your bones strong and help to prevent osteoporosis, which can cause back pain if it affects the spine.
          Quit smoking. Research shows that smokers have more frequent episodes of back pain than nonsmokers, and the more people smoke, the higher the risk.
        
        Understanding lower back pain: Why does it hurt?
        Your lower back, which consists of the five vertebrae in the lower part of your spine between the lower ribs and pelvis, supports your body. The vertebrae are cushioned by spinal discs, which act as shock absorbers for the spine. Nerves, ligaments, and muscles in the lower back are also important for your body's movement and control.
        Because your lower back supports the weight of your body, many problems can arise in this area. Whether it flares up after a fall, or after a movement as subtle as lifting a laundry basket, low back pain can be debilitating.
        There are two types of low back pain. Acute low back pain is a sudden, sharp pain and usually short-term. Chronic low back pain is a dull, constant ache and lasts longer. Chronic low back pain is a leading cause of disability worldwide.
        In addition to pain, lower back discomfort may be characterized by:
        
          tightness
          stiffness
          muscle spasms
          radiating pain
          tingling/numbness.
        
        What causes lower back pain?
        Although many episodes of back pain can be traced back to a specific event, such as a fall or straining a muscle at the gym, that's not always the case. For example, nonspecific back pain results from muscle strain due to activities like lifting or bending, but is not linked to a specific injury.
        Many medical conditions, several of which can take years to develop, can also lead to low back pain.
        Degenerative disc disease refers to a condition in which spinal discs become damaged and cause discomfort. The damage may include cracks, tears, or loss of fluid.
        Bulging and herniated discs occur when wear and tear has progressed to a point where the discs bulge, or herniate, potentially pressing on nerves and causing leg pain (sciatica).
        Osteoarthritis can affect the spine's facet joints, which connect the bones of the spine, leading to painful joint degeneration, inflammation, and bony growths (bone spurs).
        Spondylolisthesis is a condition in which one or more bones in the lower spine slips forward, causing severe low back pain as well as discomfort in the hips and thighs.
        Lumbar spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal. This can cause nerve compression, resulting in pain.
        Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of arthritis in which inflamed spinal joints can become fused so they are no longer able to move independently. The condition can cause pain and stiffness.
        Serious spinal conditions such as spinal infection, tumors, and cauda equina syndrome are rare.",Jenette Restivo,"June 21, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ultra-processed-foods-just-say-no-202406173051,Ultra-processed foods? Just say no,"Americans love their ultra-processed foods, whether they come as cereal (like Cap'n Crunch, a favorite of mine as a kid), snack foods (like Cheetos), entr'es (like hot dogs), or desserts (like Twinkies). Sure, loading your plate with vegetables, fruits, fish, healthful oils, and grains in a Mediterranean-style diet boosts heart and brain health. But if you also eat some ultra-processed foods, is that bad for your brain health?

What to know about this new study

A new study appears to deliver resounding yes: eating ultra-processed foods is linked to a greater risk of cognitive impairment and strokes.

This well-designed observational study examined data from the REGARDS (REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke) project, a longitudinal study of non-Hispanic Black and white Americans ages 45 years and older. Study participants were initially enrolled between 2003 and 2007 and were given a number of questionnaires evaluating health, diet, exercise, body mass index, education, income, alcohol use, mood, and other factors. In addition, tests of memory and language were administered at regular intervals.

To examine the risk of stroke and cognitive impairment, data from 20,243 and 14,175 participants, respectively, were found usable based on the quality of the information from the questionnaires and tests. Approximately one-third of the sample identified as Black and the majority of the remaining two-thirds identified as white.

The results of the study


	According to the authors' analysis, increasing the intake of ultra-processed foods by just 10% was associated with a significantly greater risk of cognitive impairment and stroke.
	Intake of unprocessed or minimally processed foods was associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment.
	The effect of ultra-processed foods on stroke risk was greater for individuals who identified as Black compared to individuals who identified as white.


Study participants who reported following a healthy diet (like a Mediterranean, DASH, or MIND diet) and consumed minimal ultra-processed foods appeared to maintain better brain health compared to those who followed similar healthy diets but had more ultra-processed foods.

Why might ultra-processed foods be bad for your brain?

Here are some biologically plausible reasons:


	UPFs are generally composed of processed carbohydrates that are very quickly broken down into simple sugars, equivalent to eating lots of candy. These sugar loads cause spikes of insulin, which can alter normal brain cell function.
	Eating ultra-processed foods is associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome and obesity, well-established conditions linked to high blood pressure, abnormal blood lipid levels, and type 2 diabetes.
	There are unhealthy additives in ultra-processed foods to change the texture, color, sweetness, or flavor. These additives disrupt the microbiome in the gut and can lead to gut inflammation that can cause
	
		the production of microbiome-produced metabolites that can affect brain function (such as short-chain fatty acids and lipopolysaccharides)
		leaky gut, allowing toxins and inflammatory molecules to enter the bloodstream and go to the brain
		altered neurotransmitter function (such as serotonin) that can impact mood and cognition directly
		increased cortisol levels that mimic being under chronic stress, which can directly impact hippocampal and frontal lobe function, affecting memory and executive function performance, respectively
		an increased risk for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases due to inflammatory molecules traveling from the gut to the brain.
	
	
	Because ultra-processed foods have poor nutritional value, people will often be hungry shortly after eating them, leading to overeating and its consequences.


The take-home message

Avoid processed foods, which can include chips and other snack foods, industrial breads and pastries, packaged sweets and candy, sugar-sweetened and diet sodas, instant noodles and soups, ready-to-eat meals and frozen dinners, and processed meats such as hot dogs and bologna. Eat unprocessed or minimally processed foods, which — when combined with a healthy Mediterranean menu of foods — include fish, olive oil, avocados, whole fruits and vegetables, nuts and beans, and whole grains.","Andrew E.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-rid-of-bloating-tips-for-relief,How to get rid of bloating: Tips for relief,"Why am I so bloated? Chances are, you've thought this at some point. Bloating is very common: nearly one in seven Americans reported experiencing it over the course of a week, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology.
        That tight, full feeling of bloating can be uncomfortable. And it's often accompanied by distension, in which the abdomen swells in size. The good news is there's a lot you can do with lifestyle, including diet and exercise, to relieve symptoms.
        Understanding bloating: Causes and triggers
        Bloating results when too much gas builds up in the abdomen. Here's a quick look at some of the most common reasons for excess gas buildup and bloating.
        Swallowing too much air. You swallow air every time you eat or drink. But if you consume food or fluid very quickly, you may gulp down extra air every time you swallow.
        Certain foods. Fruits, veggies, whole grains, and beans are all good for you, but they are harder for your gastrointestinal (GI) tract to digest. Vegetables like cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli, for example, all contain the carbohydrate raffinose. Your body can't break this substance down until it reaches your colon, where the bacteria who devour it release gas.
        Food intolerance. Some people are lactose intolerant, which means they have trouble digesting the milk sugar lactose. As a result, they may notice bloating after they eat or drink dairy products. Others have fructose intolerance, which means they develop GI symptoms after they eat foods high in fructose, a sugar naturally found in fruits and honey as well as table sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup.
        A slowing system. As you get older, your digestive system tends to slow down. This can cause gas to build up in your GI tract and trigger bloating.
        SIBO. Some people have too many bacteria in their small intestine, a condition known as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO can lead to an imbalance of bacteria that support digestion, leading to symptoms like bloating as well as constipation and diarrhea.
        Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Bloating is a common symptoms of IBS, a condition characterized by chronic belly pain and altered bowel habits.
        Most people get bloated occasionally. But if it happens a lot, or if you have other symptoms like stomach pain, unexplained weight loss, or bloody stools, see your doctor. They'll want to check for a more serious condition like inflammatory bowel disease or even colon cancer.
        Dietary changes to reduce bloating
        The following dietary tweaks can help to reduce bloating.
        Keep a diary. For a few weeks, note what you ate, when you ate, and when you felt especially bloated. This may help you and your doctor identify foods that are problematic.
        Remove or decrease quantities of key culprits. Some of the top offenders for bloating include:
        
          carbonated beverages like soda and beer
          dairy products: you can switch to lactose-free milks (Lactaid, others) or plant-based milks like almond milk instead
          sugar-free gum and candies — they contain artificial sweeteners that can cause bloating
          beans
          fruits high in fructose such as apples, apricots, bananas, peaches, pears, and dried fruit
          cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower.
        
        Consider a low-FODMAP diet. If the above steps don't help, you may want to consider this eating pattern, which avoids certain types of carbohydrates that are hard to digest. Since this diet can be very restrictive, it's best to do it under the guidance of a nutritionist.
        Mindful eating practices to prevent bloating
        If you gobble down your meals, you may find that you're bloated afterwards. When you eat fast, you swallow air. You may also overeat. Both contribute to bloating.
        One way to help prevent this is to practice mindful eating. That means you focus on your food rather than your phone, TV, or another distraction. Some ways to eat mindfully include:
        
          Eat with chopsticks, or with your non-dominant hand (so if you're a righty, eat with your left hand).
          Chew your food 30 times per bite.
          Eat in a screen-free zone — that means no smartphone, computer, or TV.
          Plate your food rather than eating it straight from a container or serving dish.
          Eat sitting down.
          Make your meal last at least 20 minutes.
        
        Physical activities to keep bloating at bay
        Staying active is good for your brain, heart, and even your gut. According to a 2023 review published in the Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine, exercise — whether it's walking, running, biking, swimming, or doing yoga — appears to help relieve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, which include bloating. It may also help relieve stress, which has also been linked to worsening of bloating.
        If you can't fit in a regular workout, at least try to take a stroll after meals. People who took a 10-to-15-minute walk after they ate reported less bloating, according to a 2021 study.
        Home remedies for bloating relief
        There are a lot of products out there claiming to cure bloating. While there's no magic way to instantly relieve gas, here are a few things you can try at home.
        Cook with anise. This herb has also been shown to reduce bloating in people with IBS and dyspepsia.
        Try over-the-counter medications. The most popular one is simethicone, found in products like Gas-X or Maalox Anti-Gas. Simethicone helps to break up gas bubbles. Other products, like CharcoCaps, contain activated charcoal. These products may help with occasional bloating, but there's no good evidence any work.
        Consider alpha-d-galactosidase. Also known as Beano, this over-the-counter product helps to break down certain difficult-to-digest carbohydrates found in beans and some vegetables.",Hallie Levine,"June 11, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-bird-flu-primer-what-to-know-and-do-202405083039,A bird flu primer: What to know and do,"A bird flu strain that began circulating in 2020 continues to evolve globally and locally within the United States. If you're wondering what this means, understanding the basics — what bird flu is, how it spreads, whether foods are safe, and prevention tips — can help. More information will come in as scientists learn more, so stay tuned.
        1. What is bird flu and how does it spread?
        Bird flu, or avian flu, is a naturally occurring illness. Just as certain flu viruses spread among humans, Type A influenza viruses often spread among wild birds. The strain of virus circulating now is H5N1, named for two proteins on its surface.
        Avian flu infections are highly contagious. Infection often spreads first among wild water birds, such as ducks, geese, and gulls, and shore birds, such as plovers and sandpipers. The viruses are carried in their intestines and respiratory tract and shed in saliva, mucus, and feces. Wild birds can easily infect domestic poultry, such as chickens, turkeys, and ducks.
        Some bird species, including ducks, may carry and spread infection without appearing sick. Domestic flocks are more likely to sicken and possibly die from bird flus. However, not all avian flu viruses are equally harmful:
        
          Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) may cause no signs of illness, or signs of mild illness like fewer eggs or ruffled feathers in domestic poultry.
          Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) causes more severe illness and high rates of death in infected poultry. The current H5N1 virus is considered an HPAI.
        
        2. Can humans get bird flu?
        Yes, though this doesn't usually happen.
        When flu viruses mutate, they may be able to move from their original hosts — birds in this case — to humans and other animals. As of early April 2024, only two cases of bird flu in humans had been reported in the US since 2022. In May, two more cases were reported. Newer case numbers of bird flu will continue to be reported by the CDC, which offers weekly snapshots of influenza in the US.
        The virus may be introduced into the body through the eyes, nose, or mouth. For example, a person may inhale viral particles in the air (droplets, tiny aerosolized particles, or possibly in dust). Or they might touch a surface contaminated by the virus, then touch their eyes or nose. Bird flu in humans typically causes symptoms similar to seasonal flu, such as fever, runny nose, and body aches.
        3. Which animals have been affected by bird flu?
        A surprisingly long list of animals affected by the current H5NI bird flu infection includes:
        
          wild birds, chickens, ducks, geese, and other domestic and commercial poultry in 48 states and more than 500 countries
          livestock, such as dairy cows in nine states at this writing, and other farm animals
          marine animals, such as seals, sea lions, and even dolphins
          wild animals, such as foxes, skunks, and racoons, and some domestic animals, such as farm cats.
        
        4. Why are experts concerned about this bird flu outbreak?
        It might seem odd that there's been so much concern and news coverage about bird flu lately. After all, bird flu has been around for many years. We've long known it sometimes infects nonbird animal species, including humans.
        But the current outbreak is unique and worrisome for several reasons:
        
          Fast, far-reaching spread. The virus has been found throughout the US, Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, multiple sub-Saharan African countries, and even Antarctica.
          Many species have been infected. Previously uninfected species have been affected, including animals in our food supply.
          Economic impact. If large numbers of beef and dairy cows and chickens sicken or must be culled (killed) to contain outbreaks, this could have a major economic impact on farmers, agriculture businesses, and affected countries' economies. This could also mean higher prices at the grocery store.
          Opportunities for exposure. Though only two human infections were reported in the US in recent years — both in people working with animals — the more exposure humans have to bird flu, the more chances the virus has to develop mutations that allow easier spread to humans.
          Potential for fatalities. Severe strains of bird flu have led to H5N1 infections in nearly 900 people in 23 countries since 2003. More than half of these reported cases were fatal. Keep in mind that the math isn't straightforward. It's likely that many more cases of bird flu in humans occurred, yet people experiencing few or no symptoms or those not tested weren't counted, so lethality is likely overestimated.
          New mutations. It's rare, but possible: If this H5N1 bird flu develops mutations that enable efficient person-to-person spread, bird flu could become the next human pandemic.
        
        5. Are milk, beef, chicken, and the rest of our food supply safe?
        Public health officials emphasize that the food supply is safe.
        But concern has understandably run high since the discovery that this outbreak has spread from birds to dairy cows for the first time. More alarming? A study found fragments of bird flu DNA — which is not the same as live virus — in 20% of commercially available milk in the US.
        So far, there's been no indication that bird flu found in pasteurized milk, beef, or other common foods can cause human illness. Even if live bird flu virus got into the milk supply, studies show that routine pasteurization would kill it. Initial tests did not find the virus in ground beef.
        Of course, if you are particularly concerned, you could avoid foods and beverages that come from animals affected by bird flu. For example, you could switch to oat milk or almond milk, even though there's no convincing scientific justification to do so now.
        6. What if you have pets or work with animals?
        Bird flu rarely spreads to pets. While that's good news, your pets could have exposure to animals infected with bird flu, such as through eating or playing with a dead bird. So, it's safest to limit your pet's opportunities to interact with potentially infected animals.
        If you work with animals, especially birds or livestock, or hunt, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends precautions to minimize your exposure to bird flu.
        7. What else can you do to stay safe?
        The CDC recommends everyone take steps to avoid exposure to bird flu, including:
        
          Avoid contact with sick or dead animals and keep pets away from them.
          Avoid animal feces that may be contaminated by birds or bird droppings, as might be common on a farm.
          Do not prepare or eat raw or undercooked food.
          Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat raw milk cheese or raw or undercooked foods from animals suspected of having bird flu infection.
          Wear personal protective equipment (PPE), such as safety goggles, gloves, and an N95 face mask, when working near sick or dead animals or their feces.
        
        Right now, available evidence doesn't support more dramatic preventive measures, such as switching to an all-plant diet.
        8. Is there any good news about bird flu?
        Despite all the worrisome news about bird flu, this recent outbreak may wind up posing little threat to human health. Virus strains may mutate to spread less efficiently or to be less deadly. Efforts are underway to contain the spread of bird flu to humans, including removing sick or exposed animals from the food supply and increased testing of dairy cattle before transport across state lines.
        And there is other encouraging news:
        
          Some birds appear to be developing immunity to the virus. This could reduce the chances of continued spread between birds and other animals.
          Developing a vaccine to protect cattle from bird flu may be possible (though it's unclear if this approach will be successful).
          If spread to humans does occur, genetic tests suggest available antiviral medicines could help treat people.
          So far, human-to-human transmission has not been detected. That makes it less likely that the H5N1 bird flu will become the next pandemic.
          And if human infections with bird flu did become more common, researchers are working on human vaccines against bird flu using virus strains that match well with those causing the current outbreak.
        
        9. How worried should you be about bird flu?
        Though there's much we don't know, this much seems certain: bird flu will continue to change and pose challenges for farmers and health experts to stay ahead of it. So far, public health experts believe that bird flu poses little health risk to the general public.
        So, it's not time to panic about bird flu. But it is a good idea to take common sense steps to avoid exposure and stay current on related news.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/prostate-cancer-brachytherapy-linked-to-long-term-risk-of-secondary-malignancies-202406033046,Prostate cancer: Brachytherapy linked to long-term risk of secondary malignancies,"When cancer patients are treated with radiation, it's possible that the therapy itself may cause new tumors to form in the body later. Radiation kills cancer cells by damaging their DNA, but if the treatments cause genetic damage to normal cells near the radiation target, there's a small risk that these secondary malignancies may arise over time.
        Just over 10 years ago, Canadian researchers set out to assess the risk of secondary malignancy among men with prostate cancer who were treated with a type of radiation called brachytherapy. Unlike radiation delivered from sources outside the body, brachytherapy is accomplished by implanting dozens of radioactive pellets, or ""seeds,"" directly into the tumor site. Those seeds, which are never removed, emit radiation at a dose that declines toward zero over the course of a year.
        Brachytherapy has the advantage of convenience. Instead of traveling for repeat sessions of radiation, men need only one treatment, usually given in an outpatient setting. But brachytherapy is also falling out of favor, in part because newer types of external beam radiation deliver high-precision doses with fewer side effects.
        Study methodology and results
        The Canadian study compared rates of secondary malignancies in the pelvis among men treated either with brachytherapy or with surgery to remove the prostate. All the treatments took place in British Columbia between 1998 and 2000. The brachytherapy group included 2,418 men with an average age of 66, while the surgically-treated group contained 4,015 men whose average age was 62. Within that group, 2,643 men had been treated with surgery alone, and 1,372 men with surgery plus external beam radiation given later.
        After median follow-ups of between 5.8 years (brachytherapy) and 6.4 years (surgery), the study team reported in 2014 that there was no difference in rates of secondary malignancies between the groups, or with cancer incidence in the general population.
        But that's no longer the case: In April 2024, the researchers published updated findings. This time, rates of new cancers in the pelvis — including the bladder and rectum — were higher in the brachytherapy group. Specifically, 6.4% of brachytherapy-treated men had secondary malignancies at 15 years of follow-up, increasing to 9.8% after 20 years. By contrast, 3.2% and 4.2% of surgically-treated men developed secondary pelvic malignancies over the same durations. There was no difference in deaths from secondary malignancies between the groups.
        The strength of the association with bladder cancer in particular is ""similar to that seen with smoking,"" wrote the author of an accompanying editorial. Results from the study ""should be considered when treating men with localized prostate cancer who have a long life expectancy,"" the authors concluded.
        Commentary from experts
        ""I do believe that this study reveals a dark truth about radiation for prostate cancer that has been long suspected,"" says Dr. Anthony Zietman, a professor of radiation oncology at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, and a member of the advisory and editorial board for the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases. ""As the decades pass after radiation therapy of any kind — brachytherapy or external beam — the risk for radiation-induced malignancies rises.
        ""These malignancies are usually in adjacent organs like the bladder and rectum, or within the prostate itself. They may be very curable, and thus the survival rates are the same for radiation or surgically treated patients, but there is little doubt that, for these patients, they represent a 'sting in the tail' long after the radiation has been given and forgotten. This data certainly gives us pause when offering radiation to very young men with several decades of life expectancy ahead of them, and it also reminds us of the value of follow-up visits.""
        ""The fact that second cancers arise in the area where radiation was given is not surprising, but the magnitude of the long-term increases is concerning,"" added Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases. ""There are other common and troublesome urinary side effects of brachytherapy — independent of second cancers — that patients should fully consider before selecting it as a treatment option. This is especially true given the availability of other convenient and similarly effective prostate cancer therapies.""",Charlie Schmidt,"June 3, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/are-you-getting-essential-nutrients-from-your-diet,Probiotics and prebiotics: what's really important,"Probiotics and prebiotics are a hot topic these days. You've likely seen many ads on television and online for supplements and foods that promise to deliver helpful bacteria and their benefits. Here's what you need to know before purchasing these products.
        Your large intestine contains 100 trillion ""good"" bacteria that are essential to health. Called the microbiome, these beneficial microbes help maintain healthy bowel function, and may even help with conditions like inflammatory bowel disease. Research suggests they may even play a role in regulating weight and mood.
        Everyone starts with their own unique microbiome at birth. We add to these through the foods we eat.
        Here are some of the best ways to add healthful bacteria to your microbiome:
        
          Yogurt and kefir. Be sure to look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label to make sure you are getting live cultures.
          Fermented foods. Beneficial microbes are the ""cooks"" for some familiar foods. For example, they turn cabbage into sauerkraut, cucumbers into sour pickles, soybeans into miso, and sweetened tea into kombucha. When the products have been pasteurized — as most packaged fermented foods are — the microbes will be dead. The best solution is to buy from delis where they do the pickling themselves, or natural food stores that carry fermented foods. Or make your own; you can find clear and easy instructions in books and online.
        
        There are also probiotic supplements on the market, of course. But none have proven medical indications. It's best to stick with dietary sources rich in pre- and probiotics. 
        You can help your body produce healthy gut bacteria. Here's how:
        
          Include plenty of foods rich in insoluble fiber, which tend to contain the most prebiotics. You'll find them whole-grain products such as oatmeal and whole-grain breads, as well as in vegetables like asparagus, leeks, onions, and garlic, and starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes and corn. Beans, lentils, and peas are also good sources.
          Limit sugar, saturated fat, and processed foods. These can deplete the good bacteria in the gut. As always, try to stick with whole, unprocessed foods.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/how-to-silence-snoring,How to silence snoring,"Snoring is generally harmless, but it can be annoying, especially for your bed partner. Fortunately, you can take steps to alleviate the problem. Start by making lifestyle changes and trying simple home remedies. You can also try one of the many products marketed as stop-snoring aids.
        But if you snore and you also wake up gasping for air or frequently feel sleepy or tired during the day, you likely have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea can cause hypertension and more serious medical problems. Consult a doctor if your snoring affects the quality of your sleep.
        
          Lifestyle changes and home remedies
        
        You can try these do-it-yourself suggestions to help keep your airway open during sleep:
        Avoid alcohol — or don't drink alcohol within three hours of bedtime. This will help prevent your airway muscles from becoming slack while you sleep.
        Lose weight if you are overweight or obese. Extra fat tissue in the neck and throat can narrow the airways. Losing some weight could help to open the airways for someone who is overweight or obese, although many people who are lean also snore.
        Try home remedies for nasal obstruction issues. If your nose is stuffy due to mucus, try rinsing your sinuses with saline. If you have allergies, reduce dust mites and pet dander in your bedroom or use an allergy medication. If swollen nasal tissues are the problem, a humidifier or medication may reduce swelling.
        If you smoke, quit. In addition to smoking's many other negative health effects, people who smoke are also more likely to snore. Possible reasons include nightly nicotine withdrawal, which can disrupt sleep, as well as increased swelling and irritation in the upper airway. In fact, even secondhand smoke from another member of your household may increase your risk of snoring.
        Sleep on your side or elevate your head. When you sleep flat on your back, your tongue falls back and presses against the top of your airway, so sleeping on your side may help. To help you stay on your side, try pressing a long, oversized body pillow against your back. You can also wear a small fanny pack filled with tennis balls, or tape a tennis ball or rolled-up pair of socks to the back of your pajamas. This makes lying on your back uncomfortable.
        Or you can try elevating your head by using an extra pillow or a wedge pillow, or by propping up the head of your bed using blocks of wood under the top of the bed frame.
        These lifestyle changes and home remedies may help with simple snoring. However, if you have periods of gasping during sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness as well as snoring, it could be sleep apnea and let your doctor know.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-you-become-a-super-ager,"Can you become a ""super-ager""?","The 2024 presidential election, in which the two leading candidates will turn 78 and 82 during the year, has raised the issue about cognitive health as people age.

But individuals known as ""super-agers"" have shown that for some, age really is only a number. ""Super-agers are known to maintain peak mental prowess well into their 90s and avoid Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,"" says Dr. Daniel Daneshvar, chief of the Division of Brain Injury Rehabilitation at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. ""While the general thinking is that memory declines and brain functions slow as we age no matter what, studies on super-agers suggest this is not inevitable, and there may be ways to maintain high levels of cognitive function for much longer in life.""

The aging brain

The average brain declines in volume and weight by about 5% per decade after age 40, with a steeper decline after age 70. Brain shrinkage particularly affects the brain regions involved with learning and memory, like the frontal lobe and hippocampus. A smaller brain volume is also linked to less robust communication between brain regions, which leads to slower processing speed and can impair other cognitive functions.

""These usual age-related brain changes can affect thinking and make it harder to recall words and names, focus on tasks, and process new information,"" says Dr. Daneshvar.

The brains of super-agers, however, shrink at about half the average rate, and their memory and cognitive skills stay on par with younger brains. What goes on inside super-ager brains that accounts for this? Harvard investigators, publishing in the November 2021 issue of Cerebral Cortex, offer a clue.

They recruited 40 older adults who were identified as super-agers. The super-agers took a memory test while their brains were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which shows the activity of different brain areas. For comparison, the researchers also carried out the memory test and fMRI scan on 41 young adults (average age 25). The super-agers performed similarly to the younger people on the memory tests. The fMRI also showed that activity in the super-agers' visual cortex, the brain area that processes visual input, was similar to that in the younger brains.

What's super about super-agers?

Studies have found that genetics is the greatest component in the state of aging brains.

""Science has identified about 100 genes common among super-agers, although it's unclear which ones in particular are linked with neurological benefits,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. ""If you win the lottery and are born with those genes, you have a good chance of becoming a super-ager."" But what if your genetic scratch-off is a bust? Can you still be a winner with super-aging?

""Super-agers also tend to follow a healthy lifestyle, and many reach their 90s free of problems like heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Here's a look at the healthy daily habits of many super-agers and how they may help protect your brain.

Eat more ""superfoods."" Many super-agers follow diets rich in foods high in antioxidants, polyphenols, and omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients have been shown to fight inflammation and help protect the body from disease-causing cell damage. Examples include berries, whole grains (oatmeal, quinoa), fatty fish (salmon, trout), nuts (walnuts, almonds), olive oil, cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower), avocados, and green tea.

Unsurprisingly, these foods are staples in many plant-based diets associated with brain and heart health, like the MIND, DASH, and Mediterranean diets. It's not certain which of the foods or amounts are ideal, so focus on meals that contain a variety of them.

Be more active. Super-agers tend to engage in more physical activity. Regular exercise has been found to help maintain brain volume and cognitive function, even if you begin later in life. Exercise sparks physiological changes in the body, such as the production of growth factors — chemicals that enhance brain cell function and survival and can actually stimulate formation of new brain cells. Many studies have suggested that the parts of the brain that control thinking and memory are larger in volume in people who exercise than in people who don't.

It doesn't matter what type of exercise you do. Research has found that walking, swimming, other aerobic activity (especially high-intensity interval training, or HIIT), strength training, tai chi, and yoga are all associated with improved memory. But consistency is key. ""Being active on a regular basis leads to greater brain benefits,"" says Dr. Daneshvar.

Be more social. Super-agers tend to have more social interactions. Studies have shown that regular social engagement is associated with healthier brains. The opposite is also true: social isolation is linked to lower volume of gray matter in brain regions related to cognition.

Challenge yourself. Super-agers challenge their brains, and studies have shown that learning new things as you age aids memory. For instance, study a second language, learn a musical instrument, or adopt a new hobby.

Get good sleep. Super-agers also prioritize sleep. (Guidelines suggest seven to nine hours nightly.) ""During sleep, the brain clears away metabolic waste that builds up early in the development of Alzheimer's disease,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. A study in the November 2022 issue of the journal Sleep found that trouble falling or staying asleep three or more nights per week for three months boosted the risk for worsening memory in older adults.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/hot-weather-tied-to-increased-odds-of-stroke,Hot weather tied to increased odds of stroke,"High temperatures may leave people more vulnerable to stroke, according to a study in the February 2024 issue of JAMA Network Open.
        The study included data from more than 82,000 people across China who were hospitalized for an ischemic stroke during the warm seasons from 2019 to 2021. (Ischemic strokes occur when blood supply to part of the brain is blocked or reduced, usually because of a blood clot.) By checking hourly temperature records for up to 24 hours before a person's stroke symptoms began, researchers found that as temperatures rose, so did the risk of stroke.
        The risk was nearly twice as high when temperatures were around 92°F compared to when the temperature was 54°F. The risk was highest immediately after a person was exposed to high temperature and lasted for 10 hours. High temperatures may trigger dehydration, which can make the blood more viscous and more likely to clot. People at increased risk of stroke should ""exercise with caution, reduce outdoor activities, and use air conditioning to protect themselves from high temperatures,"" according to the study authors.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/microplastics-in-arteries-linked-to-heart-disease-risk,Microplastics in arteries linked to heart disease risk,"Concerns about the health effects of microplastics continue to mount. Now, a new study finds that people with microplastics in the plaque clogging their neck arteries were far more likely to have a heart attack or stroke than people with plastic-free plaque.
        When researchers tested the plaque removed from the neck arteries of 257 people, they found tiny particles of plastic — mostly polyethylene but also polyvinyl chloride — in 58% of the people. After nearly three years, the rate of heart attack, stroke, and death was 4.5 times higher in people with microplastics in their plaque than those without.
        These observational findings can't pinpoint microplastics as the culprit, as other unmeasured exposures or habits may be to blame, says the authors, whose study was published in the March 7, 2024, issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.
        Used to make plastic bags and bottles, polyethylene slowly breaks down and is found in food and water, which may explain how microplastics enter the body.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/many-older-adults-still-follow-outdated-aspirin-advice,Many older adults still follow outdated aspirin advice,"A nationwide poll suggests that one in four older adults takes aspirin regularly in hopes of preventing a heart attack or stroke, even though updated guidelines from 2019 advise against that practice in many cases.
        Aspirin helps prevent blood clots that can cause a heart attack or stroke, but the drug can also cause serious bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and brain. Thanks to a better appreciation of that risk, daily low-dose aspirin is now recommended mainly for people who've already had a heart attack or face a very high risk of one. But 57% of adults who said they take aspirin regularly also said they have no history of cardiovascular disease. And nearly one-third of these people don't appear to know about aspirin's bleeding risk.
        People who do not have heart disease should talk to their doctor before starting, continuing, or stopping daily aspirin use. The March 2024 poll, from the University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Aging, surveyed a national sample of 2,657 adults ages 50 to 80.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/rna-targeted-drugs-for-heart-disease,RNA-targeted drugs for heart disease,"Many people swallow two to three drugs daily to lower their cholesterol and blood pressure to healthy levels. What if they could achieve the same results with medications that require just a few injections per year — no pills?
        This isn't just a far-flung promise. Inclisiran (Leqvio), a long-lasting injectable drug that dramatically lowers LDL cholesterol, was approved in 2021. It's the first cholesterol-lowering medication that works through RNA interference, a technique that's the basis for an expanding class of novel therapies for treating a variety of diseases. Several additional RNA-targeted drugs for cardiovascular disease are currently in late-stage trials. How exactly do these drugs work, and who might benefit from them?
        Harnessing the power of RNA
        Found in all living cells, RNA is the molecule that copies and transfers genetic instructions from DNA (the cell's genetic blueprint) to create proteins. The human body contains tens of thousands of different proteins that provide countless functions, including supporting tissues and organs, carrying out biochemical reactions, and ferrying different molecules around the body. Many diseases, it turns out, result from problems with proteins.
        For example, in people with very high cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), the body produces too much low-density lipoprotein (LDL), one of the proteins that transports cholesterol. While cholesterol is vital for making cell membranes, many hormones, and vitamin D, excess cholesterol in the bloodstream contributes to artery-clogging plaque. Certain drugs for hypercholesterolemia use antibodies to block PCSK9, a protein made in the liver that regulates LDL. But inclisiran prevents PCSK9 from being made in the first place.
        ""Many of these therapies work by interfering with the strand of RNA before it has the opportunity to be translated into a protein,"" says cardiologist Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Some, known as small-interfering RNA (siRNA) drugs, have long-lasting effects. After being injected, the drug travels to the liver and, in the case of inclisiran, interferes with the creation of PCSK9. Among people with stubbornly high cholesterol who are already taking the maximum dose of a statin, the drug reduces blood levels of LDL by about half.
        Silencing Lp(a)
        Other RNA-interfering drugs in development target a different particle called lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). These particles feature an extra lipoprotein molecule that makes them ""stickier,"" which appears to accelerate fatty plaque buildup inside arteries even more than regular LDL. High levels of Lp(a) — which affect about one in five people in the general population — have been linked to a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis).
        Because Lp(a) levels are largely based on genetic factors, eating and exercise habits don't seem to affect the levels in your bloodstream. As yet, there are no FDA-approved drugs shown to effectively lower Lp(a), which is frustrating for patients and doctors alike. However, there are many promising drugs in the pipeline. Pelacarsen, olpasiran, zerlasiran, and lepodisiran are given by injection every one to six months and have been shown to lower Lp(a) levels between 70% and 100%. Larger, longer trials looking at whether these drugs will help prevent heart-related problems are currently under way, with results expected within the next few years, says Dr. O'Donoghue, who is a lead investigator on the clinical trials of olpasiran.
        Decreasing blood pressure
        Another siRNA drug, zilebesiran, interferes with the liver's production of angiotensinogen, a protein that plays a key role in blood pressure regulation. Nearly half of all adults have high blood pressure, defined as a reading at or above 130/80 mm Hg. And fewer than half of people with the condition have it under control, despite the availability of more than 200 different blood pressure medications.
        In an early study, zilebesiran led to meaningful drops in blood pressure that persisted for six months; ongoing studies are testing it in combination with different blood pressure drugs. One concern about this particular drug, however, is that its effects can't be quickly reversed, which could pose problems for people who receive it and then later develop a serious infection or another condition that causes dangerously low blood pressure.
        To date, side effects from all these medications are uncommon and include mild redness or pain at the injection site. ""None have been studied on a large enough scale that we can be completely confident about their efficacy and safety. That's what the ongoing trials will answer. But so far, the evidence is encouraging,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/migraine-and-cardiovascular-disease-whats-the-link,Migraine and cardiovascular disease: What's the link?,"What do cardiovascular disease and migraines have in common? For one, both conditions involve changes in blood vessels, blood flow, and inflammation. Another link: migraine sufferers younger than 45 who experience odd visual or physical sensations prior to the headache (see ""What is a migraine aura?"") may face an increased risk of stroke. Finally, the most common and effective class of drugs to treat migraine, triptans, have been linked to a higher risk of stroke and heart attack in people at risk for those cardiovascular conditions.
        But if you're among the one in six people who copes with these debilitating, painful headaches, there's reassuring news: both of those risks are extremely small. Read on for more perspective, plus advice for migraine sufferers.
        
          
            
              
                What is a migraine aura?
                About one-third of people with migraine experience aura: a visual or other sensory disturbance that strikes within the hour before the headache takes hold. (Some people experience auras without a subsequent headache.) Vision changes can include blind spots (scotomas), shimmering spots, zigzag lines that float across your visual field, and flashes of light.

        Anatomy of a migraine
        ""During a migraine, blood vessels lining the brain dilate in response to abnormal activity in cells in the cerebral cortex, the largest area of the brain. This triggers a cascade of inflammation and other processes that can spread throughout the brain,"" says Dr. Natalia Rost, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the Stroke Division at Massachusetts General Hospital. It's why migraines can cause a wide range of symptoms, including nausea, fatigue, or sensitivity to light. People tend to experience their own particular combination of symptoms that progress gradually during the migraine, often in a predictable pattern.
        In contrast, the symptoms of a stroke appear suddenly. ""If you feel numb or weak on one side of your face or body, are unable to speak normally, or lose vision, that's a 911 situation,"" says Dr. Rost. In people who get migraines, those same symptoms might be related to an aura. But play it safe and seek medical attention right away, she advises.
        Most common in women
        Migraines are about three times as common in women than men, for reasons that aren't entirely clear. Up to 30% of women ages 20 to 40 get migraines, but strokes are very rare among young women. Even if their risk of stroke doubled (as one study of people who have migraine with aura found), the overall prevalence is still very low. Still, women who have migraine with aura should be sure to tell their primary care provider or gynecologist about their headaches. Taking estrogen-containing birth control pills or hormone therapy may further raise stroke risk in these women. As a result, they might want to consider nonhormonal or estrogen-free treatment options.
        Treating migraines
        Last year, a study based on real-world data from patients ranked the class of drug known as triptans as the most helpful treatment option for quelling their migraine symptoms. But these drugs — which include eletriptan (Relpax) and zolmitriptan (Zomig) — aren't recommended for people with cardiovascular disease, based on evidence that these drugs may raise the risk of stroke and heart attack. Earlier this year, findings from a study of more than 400,000 people who received a triptan prescription confirmed that observation. However, the absolute risk of a cardiovascular problem was very low — around one in 30,000. Most of the stroke and heart attacks occurred in people with risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.
        ""What struck me was how rare these events were among this huge population,"" says Dr. Rost. Still, she recommends a personalized approach when selecting medications for migraine sufferers who have or are at risk for cardiovascular problems. Newer migraine drugs known as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors don't appear to have any significant side effects related to blood vessels, but the long-term effects are still unknown. CGRP inhibitors approved for acute migraine treatment include oral rimegepant (Nurtec) and ubrogepant (Ubrelvy) and nasal zavegepant (Zavzpret).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-low-should-ldl-cholesterol-go,How low should LDL cholesterol go?,"When it comes to reducing ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, how low should you go? ""People who are at high risk for cardiovascular diseases can benefit from driving LDL levels as low as possible to help reduce their risk for heart attacks and strokes,"" says cardiologist Dr. Christopher Cannon, editor in chief of the Harvard Heart Letter. ""Across many large clinical trials, for LDL, the lower the better.""
        The good and the bad
        Cholesterol is a fatty substance that occurs naturally in the body. The body uses it to make cell membranes and certain hormones. The fat you consume from food is absorbed in the intestine and transported to the liver, which converts it into cholesterol and then releases it into the bloodstream.
        Eating high-cholesterol foods often has only a modest impact on cholesterol in the blood, but many such foods are also high in saturated fats, which have a greater effect on cholesterol levels. ""Most of your cholesterol level is determined genetically,"" says Dr. Cannon.
        There are two main types of cholesterol: LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).  LDL is called ""bad"" because excess amounts in the bloodstream can lodge inside artery walls. These deposits, called plaques, can rupture and trigger clotting that blocks blood flow to the heart or brain, causing a heart attack or stroke.
        By comparison, HDL has in the past been considered ""good"" because some forms of HDL collect excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and artery walls. Still, notes Dr. Cannon, ""many clinical trials have found that raising blood levels of HDL does not lower the risk of heart attack or stroke, so the focus is on lowering LDL.""
        By the numbers
        Current guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology set optimal LDL levels for the general population at below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL); 100 to 159 mg/dL is deemed high, and 160 mg/dL and higher is considered dangerous.
        People with known cardiovascular disease should aim for LDL levels below 70 mg/dL. ""Thus, across the spectrum of patients, the higher risk ones have a lower goal for LDL,"" says Dr. Cannon.
        Besides high LDL levels, having one or more other factors also can contribute to your cardiovascular risk, such as
        
          a family history of premature heart disease (a father or brother who was diagnosed at 55 or younger, or a mother or sister diagnosed before age 65)
          smoking
          obesity
          diabetes
          high blood pressure
          low levels of HDL (below 40 mg/dL).
        
        Why the focus on 70 mg/dL? ""Studies have shown that when LDL falls below this number, plaques in arteries get smaller and they stabilize, which lowers the risk for heart attacks and stroke,"" says Dr. Cannon.
        But how far below 70 mg/dL should you go? Clinical trials have shown and European guidelines recommend that people with cardiovascular disease at the highest risk should aim for LDL levels below 55 mg/dL. Dr. Cannon notes that the U.S. guidelines have not been updated since 2018, and believes they will eventually follow Europe's lead and make 55 mg/dL the new target for high-risk individuals.
        What about people who are not at high risk? In most people in this group, LDL levels between 100 and 130 mg/dL may be acceptable. ""However, we still generally aim for LDL levels below 100, since benefits have been seen in trials that look at ways to prevent cardiovascular disease,"" says Dr. Cannon. ""Ultimately, your doctor can suggest the ideal target LDL based on your cardiac risk factors and history.""
        Lifestyle and medications
        The first step to lowering high LDL levels is making dietary changes — cutting down on saturated fat by adopting a heart-healthy diet like the Mediterranean, DASH, or other similar plant-based diets — losing weight, and increasing exercise.
        But often medication is needed to help drive down very high LDL levels and keep them low. This usually begins with a type of drug called a statin.
        Statins work to lower LDL by blocking an enzyme in the liver that helps make cholesterol. The drugs also have anti-inflammatory properties, and inflammation is a known contributor to plaque buildup. Another benefit: statins help prevent plaques from breaking open and releasing chemicals that stimulate blood clot formation, which leads to heart artery blockage and a heart attack. Depending on your LDL level, your doctor will recommend the best statin and dosage for your situation.
        The downside to statins is the possible side effects. The most common are achy muscles. If this happens to you, your doctor can temporarily lower the dose or switch to a different statin.
        While statins are the first-line drug choice, three other classes of medications also can help reduce LDL — ezetimibe (Zetia), bempedoic acid (Nexletol), and PCSK9 inhibitors (Repatha, Praluent, or Leqvio). ""Any of the three can be added to or substituted for statin therapy if people have not reached their LDL goal, or if they cannot tolerate statin side effects,"" says Dr. Cannon.
        Ezetimibe blocks cholesterol absorption in the intestine. Bempedoic acid and PCSK9 inhibitors work on liver cell receptors to increase the uptake and destruction of LDL cholesterol, thereby lowering LDL blood levels.
        Can your LDL be too low? Not really, says Dr. Cannon. ""Driving down LDL to really low levels might increase the risk of medication side effects, but there are no problems directly related to very low LDL levels.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/the-perception-of-pain,The perception of pain,"Most people experience occasional musculoskeletal pain, which is pain in the muscles, joints, ligaments, and tendons. For instance, you may get sore muscles or achy joints after exercising or doing yard work. The pain usually goes away after you rest or take an over-the-counter pain medication.
        But when is pain a sign of trouble?
        ""Not all pain is the same, and it should never be ignored if it begins to affect your daily life,"" says Dr. Mohammed Issa, medical director of the pain management center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""While some temporary pain is normal, it's never normal to live with pain.""
        Pain in the brain
        Research has found that older adults who develop more sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) have a higher risk for musculoskeletal pain. (Muscle mass tends to decrease about 3% to 5% each decade after age 30.) Older adults also are more likely to experience musculoskeletal pain from dealing with the general wear and tear of aging as well as health conditions that can cause pain.
        But people also become more sensitive to pain as they age. ""Pain receptors in the brain change, so we feel pain more often and at a higher level,"" says Dr. Issa. Still, many older adults feel they can live with pain and adjust their lifestyle to accommodate it. ""They also don't want to appear complaining, so they keep their pain to themselves,"" says Dr. Issa. ""Eventually, this makes their pain feel worse than it needs to be and makes it harder for them to cope.""
        Acute or chronic?
        One way to determine if your musculoskeletal pain is a cause for concern is to identify whether it's acute (short-term) or chronic (long-lasting).
        Acute. Most acute pain comes from damage to body tissues caused by physical trauma, such as a sport or exercise injury, or a household accident, like a bruising fall, or bumping into something. The pain might feel sharp, aching, or throbbing, and it often heals within a few days to a few weeks. Acute pain from these types of injuries should diminish with a combination of rest, home remedies, and over-the-counter pain medication.
        Chronic. Chronic pain lasts longer than acute pain. It can be related to ongoing tissue injuries, persistent inflammation, or irritated nerves. Symptoms may include a dull ache, shooting, burning, stabbing, or electric shock–like pain and sensations like tingling and numbness. Chronic pain lasts at least two or three months, often long after you have recovered from any injury or illness that precipitated it, and may even become permanent.
        
          
            
              
                Explain the pain
                It can be challenging to describe pain. But the more detail you can provide, the easier it is for your doctor to diagnose the problem. Here are ways you might explain the pain:
                10-point scale. Use a number ranking, with zero meaning no pain and 10 meaning extreme pain.
                Frequency and duration. When does the pain occurs, like time of day or after certain activities or movements. Does the pain come on regularly, or does it strike out of nowhere? Does it go away after a while or linger?
                Description. Use adjectives that best describe the sensations. Is the pain dull, sharp, burning, nagging, throbbing?
                Location. Where exactly in the body does it hurt? Does the pain move around or stay in one place?
              
            
          
        
        Addressing the pain
        Most acute musculoskeletal pain from injuries can be treated with home remedies. Dr. Issa recommends beginning with what's known as the RICE regimen — rest, ice, compression, elevation. This includes resting the body, applying cold to the sore area, wearing an elastic wrap to compress the painful area, and elevating the sore area, like propping up your leg on pillows.
        Many people find relief with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). To avoid side effects, take the lowest effective dose for the shortest period. People who have kidney disease, have had a peptic ulcer, or take blood thinners should not take NSAIDs unless directed by their doctor.
        Another option is acetaminophen (Tylenol). High doses of acetaminophen can damage the liver, so it's important not to take more than 3,000 milligrams per 24-hour period. Many pain relievers contain acetaminophen without highlighting it on the packaging, so be sure to read all the details on the labels.
        The bottom line is that you should never ignore ongoing pain. Take the appropriate action to treat acute pain to help prevent it from becoming chronic. ""Any pain that lingers, even if partially relieved with medication, needs medical evaluation,"" says Dr. Issa. ""Pain is your body telling you something is wrong.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/time-to-stop-active-surveillance,Time to stop active surveillance?,"Active surveillance (AS) is now the most common choice for men facing a diagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer, in which the tumor is confined to the prostate gland and unlikely to grow or spread. AS is not a passive option. It involves monitoring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels for changes and having regular digital rectal exams to check for abnormal areas on your prostate.
        ""You follow a firm schedule of regular testing and follow-ups, so you are constantly monitoring your condition,"" says urologist Dr. Adam Kibel with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""AS is like a highway that you cruise along on, but if anything unusual happens, you can easily exit and choose a treatment option.""
        But can AS be a journey that lasts forever? When do you know when you should take the off-ramp?
        Making the choice
        The goal of AS is to defer=""defer"" surgery or radiation to avoid possible side effects of these treatments, such as erectile dysfunction, incontinence, and bowel function problems. The choice to follow AS begins after a prostate biopsy to identify the cancer's size and probability of spreading. ""AS is a great option for men who have low-volume, low-risk cancer that hasn't spread,"" says Dr. Kibel.
        A PSA test measures the amount of a specific protein in the blood produced by both cancerous and noncancerous prostate tissue. PSA levels are measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). In general, a PSA level between 4 and 10 ng/mL is considered the borderline range and suggests about a 25% chance of having prostate cancer. Levels higher than 10 ng/mL increase the cancer risk to more than 50%. Also, a continuous rise in PSA levels over time may be a sign of cancer.
        The Gleason scale uses a 2-to-5 ranking to grade how the two most common cell types in the tumor taken from a prostate biopsy look compared with normal prostate cells. The numbers for each are added together to get a Gleason score. A grade no higher than 6 often means you have low-risk prostate cancer and will be offered active surveillance as a treatment option.
        If you choose AS, the usual plan includes a PSA test and a digital rectal exam about every six months and repeat prostate biopsies approximately every other year. If your PSA level suddenly rises or your rectal exam suggests an abnormality, your doctor will also likely recommend a prostate MRI or an earlier prostate biopsy to see if the cancer has become more aggressive.
        ""If there's evidence the cancer has become more active, then you and your doctor will discuss treatment options such as radiation, hormonal therapy, or surgery to remove the prostate gland,"" says Dr. Kibel.
        The waiting game
        How long can you stay on AS? ""Unless there's a change in your condition, you can stay on AS indefinitely,"" says Dr. Kibel. Men may continue on AS for 10 years or even longer.
        Still, certain situations may encourage men to rethink staying on AS. One is psychological — the constant worry and anxiety that something could be wrong. ""For men with a family history of aggressive prostate cancer, the prolonged wait-and-see process may become too stressful,"" says Dr. Kibel. ""If they feel they may eventually need treatment, they may want to move forward and not wait any longer."" Another similar factor is so-called AS fatigue where men tire of the constant monitoring required by AS.
        Increasing age might lead someone to end AS, but without moving to treatment. If you're still on AS in your late 70s or early 80s with an estimated life expectancy of less than 10 years, you may want to consider shifting to a less intensive approach known as watchful waiting. With watchful waiting, you still may want to have periodic doctor visits. But monitoring the prostate cancer stops, including no more biopsies, in order to avoid the stress and potential side effects of continuous testing.
        ""The goal is to no longer cure you of the cancer but simply follow it,"" says Dr. Kibel. ""The bet is that the cancer is so slow growing it isn't a long-term threat even if it does progress,"" says Dr. Kibel.
        If you later develop symptoms that indicate the cancer has advanced — such as extreme fatigue, weight loss, urinary retention, or bone pain — you can consult with your doctor about your goals and what options you have to reduce cancer-related symptoms.
        Ultimately, men must remember that they are always in the driver's seat when on AS. ""It comes down to weighing risks and benefits and working with your doctor to determine whether staying on AS is best, or whether it's time to make a change,"" says Dr. Kibel.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/mediterranean-diet-may-help-ease-depression,Mediterranean diet may help ease depression,"Consuming a Mediterranean diet — which emphasizes plant-based dishes and healthy fats — helps ease depression symptoms in people with the mood condition, a new research review suggests.
        The analysis, published online Jan. 14, 2024, by Nutrition Reviews, involved 1,507 adults ages 22 to 53 (72% women) with depression characterized as mild, moderate, or severe. Researchers evaluated five earlier randomized, controlled trials lasting between six and 48 weeks in which some participants were advised how to change eating habits to follow a Mediterranean-style diet, which is rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, fish, and olive oil. These participants were educated about the diet using various methods, including individual counseling and cooking workshops. Study participants in the control groups, who weren't advised on the Mediterranean diet, consumed their regular diet or took placebo supplements. Participants who followed a Mediterranean diet experienced a greater reduction in depression symptoms than those in control groups.
        The study was observational. This means that the researchers couldn't prove a Mediterranean diet eases depression, only that an association exists.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/migraines-plus-early-menopause-symptoms-may-add-up-to-cardiovascular-risks,Migraines plus early menopause symptoms may add up to cardiovascular risks,"Women who cope with a combination of migraine headaches and early menopause symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats may face higher risks of heart disease or stroke in midlife, a new analysis suggests.
        The study, published in the March 2024 issue of Menopause, tracked 15 years of data from nearly 2,000 women who were 18 to 30 years old at the study's start. Participants who reported having migraines and persistent ""vasomotor symptoms"" — the medical term describing hot flashes and night sweats — earlier in adulthood were 51% more likely to develop cardiovascular disease over the next 15 years when compared with women who seldom or never experienced the same problems. Stroke risk was even higher — 70% — among women with migraines and persistent vasomotor symptoms over the study period.
        Women who experience both migraines and early, persistent hot flashes and night sweats can offset the risks for heart disease and stroke by quitting smoking and promptly treating conditions such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, the study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/want-better-sleep-aim-for-at-least-an-hour-of-exercise-per-week,Want better sleep? Aim for at least an hour of exercise per week,"Regular exercise promotes better sleep quality and reduces the risk for insomnia. But how much exercise does it take to get sleep benefits? A study published online March 26, 2024, by BMJ Open suggests an answer. Researchers evaluated the sleep questionnaire responses of about 4,400 people (ages 39 to 67) in Europe. Participants reported on their overall health and various aspects of their physical activity and sleep habits (including how long they usually slept each night and any insomnia symptoms they had, such as difficulty falling asleep, nighttime awakenings, or daytime sleepiness). Answers were collected at two points in time, 10 years apart. People who said that they exercised at least twice a week (for a total of at least an hour a week) for the entire 10 years were much less likely to report sleeping difficulties compared with people who reported that they were either inactive or less active during the study period. The study is observational and can't prove conclusively that exercising an hour or more per week will improve sleep. But we know that any amount of exercise is beneficial for health. This study provides an additional incentive to get more active.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/best-treatments-for-this-common-finger-problem,Best treatments for this common finger problem,"Your grip is slowly eroding in one hand, the result of your ring or pinky finger gradually bending toward your palm, so that you can't lay your hand flat on a tabletop. Now this crippling change is making it harder to shake hands, grasp objects, type on a keyboard, get dressed, and more. It's a problem called Dupuytren's contracture. Fortunately, several fixes can help straighten your finger again.
        What is Dupuytren's?
        Dupuytren's (pronounced ""DOOPA-trenz"" in the United States) is believed to be a genetic condition. ""It develops when a thick tissue called collagen builds up between the skin of the palm and the tendons that move the fingers. The collagen forms lumps and cordlike structures that tug on the tendons and pull the fingers toward the palm,"" says Dr. Abhiram Bhashyam, a hand and arm surgeon at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        While Dupuytren's most often involves the ring or pinky fingers, it can occur anywhere in your palm, and tug on any finger. ""In the early stages, Dupuytren's starts to pull the finger down. Sometimes, it then gets slowly worse. In later stages, it's pulled down so far that you can't even open your hand, and it creates a quality-of-life problem,"" Dr. Bhashyam says.
        Early-stage approaches
        If you discover a thickening in your palm and suspect Dupuytren's, but it's not interfering with your ability to do anything that's important to you, you probably don't need to do anything about it, though it can be helpful to see a hand surgeon. ""If the thickening is just a lump, and it's not interfering with your life, we just watch it to make sure it doesn't get worse. We'll have you monitor it at home,"" Dr. Bhashyam says.
        He recommends a simple test: ""On the first of every month, put your hand flat on a table. If you can do that, there's no treatment that will make you better,"" Dr. Bhashyam says. ""If you can't put your hand flat on a table, you'll need to see a hand surgeon.""
        Later-stage approaches
        For the later stage of Dupuytren's, doctors can choose from three treatments. Each one targets the thick collagen tissue, freeing the tendons so that the fingers can straighten out. Medicare covers each one.
        Needle aponeurotomy. For this in-office treatment, also called percutaneous needle fasciotomy, the doctor uses a needle to break up the collagen tissue.
        Collagenase injection. This is also an in-office treatment. Doctors inject an enzyme called collagenase into the hand. The enzyme dissolves the collagen tissue.
        For either a collagenase injection or a needle aponeurotomy, recovery involves wearing a splint at night for about four weeks to keep the finger straight, and four to six weeks of hand therapy.
        Surgery. You'll have to go to a surgery center for this procedure. While you're under anesthesia, the surgeon will make an incision in your hand and remove the collagen tissue. For a week or two after surgery, you'll have to wear a splint day and night. After that, you'll wear the splint at night only, for about a month. You'll also need six to eight weeks of hand therapy.
        Recurrence
        Regardless of which treatment you have, the condition can return. Dr. Bhashyam says that five years after treatment, Dupuytren's recurs about 20% of the time after needle aponeurotomy, 10% of the time after surgery, and somewhere in between after a collagenase injection.
        What happens then? ""If you've had a needle aponeurotomy or a collagenase injection, then surgery is the most common treatment,"" Dr. Bhashyam says. ""If you already had surgery, reoperation is possible, but more challenging for the surgeon.""
        Which procedure is best?
        An in-office procedure is obviously less involved than surgery. But the treatment choice primarily depends on the severity of your condition (severe cases usually require surgery) and the location of the collagen tissue. ""If it's near certain arteries and nerves in the hand, I'll recommend surgery because I can better visualize them, with less risk of damaging them compared to an in-office procedure,"" Dr. Bhashyam says.
        If the thick tissue is clear of those arteries and nerves, Dr, Bhashyam often recommends trying the collagenase injection first. ""Either the injection or a surgical procedure can help restore your quality of life.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/will-drinking-alcohol-or-caffeinated-drinks-trigger-my-atrial-fibrillation,Will drinking alcohol or caffeinated drinks trigger my atrial fibrillation?,"Q. 
          I've had three past attacks of a heart rhythm problem, atrial fibrillation. I'm okay now. The doctor says drinking alcohol or drinks with caffeine can make it start again. Is that true?
        
        A. I'm afraid it's at least half true. A group of experts from the American Heart Association and other prestigious organizations reviewed the evidence about your question in the medical journal Circulation, published Jan. 2, 2024.
        Atrial fibrillation (afib) is, unfortunately, pretty common: about 9% of people ages 65 or older in the United States have it. It's more likely to occur in people with high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, heart failure, obesity, diabetes, an overactive thyroid gland, sleep apnea, or other conditions. Like you, I'm someone who has had several attacks of afib in the past.
        Afib is a condition in which the heart's two upper chambers, the atria, start beating erratically. Instead of pumping blood effectively down into the lower chambers of the heart, the walls of the atria start quivering. As a result, the heartbeat becomes irregular and usually more rapid. Some people feel breathless. Also, blood tends to pool in the quivering atria, and clots can form. And if clots form, they can travel in the bloodstream to the brain, causing a stroke.
        So, you don't want to go back into atrial fibrillation; I sure don't. As for alcohol, I'm afraid the evidence is pretty strong that alcoholic beverages can increase your risk of another attack of afib. Studies find that alcohol in the blood makes the heart more likely to develop afib. And randomized trials have shown that people with recurring afib who are assigned to be abstinent are less likely to have another attack than people who are not abstinent. For people like you, the experts recommend no more than three alcoholic drinks per week.
        What about caffeine? Here, the news is better. Both observational studies and randomized trials have found that drinking caffeinated beverages in ""usual amounts"" does not increase the risk of a new attack of afib. However, each of us is different. If you think caffeine may have triggered a past attack, I would avoid it; you could be especially sensitive to caffeine. What's a ""usual amount"" of caffeine? I limit myself to two cups of coffee in the morning. And I surely avoid energy drinks containing high doses of caffeine.
        Speaking of lifestyle, being physically active — like brisk walking for 150 minutes per week — and not using tobacco also protect you from a recurrent attack.
        Unlike you and me, some people have afib constantly, and will for the rest of their lives. So, placing limits on alcoholic or caffeine-containing beverages won't help with their afib, but it will have other health benefits.

But don't use them to monitor your blood sugar if they claim they can do it without piercing your skin. The FDA warns that it has not reviewed the safety and effectiveness of these devices, and using them could result in inaccurate blood sugar measurements. That could be dangerous for people with diabetes, who must manage their condition by checking their blood sugar levels regularly — typically with a finger prick blood test or a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) that uses tiny sensor wires that pierce the skin frequently and send information to a smartphone app. The FDA warning does not apply to CGMs, only to smart rings or smart watches with marketing promises for needle-free monitoring. If you have concerns about the accuracy of your monitor, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about whether it's an FDA-authorized, reliable blood glucose–measuring device.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/when-the-heart-suddenly-starts-racing,When the heart suddenly starts racing,"You expect your heartbeat to accelerate if you're exercising or feeling extremely anxious. But in a small number of people, an electrical glitch in the heart's upper chamber causes their heart rate to suddenly soar for no apparent reason—sometimes as high as 200 beats per minute.
        Called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), the condition is usually not dangerous (see ""What is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia?""). ""People often describe the symptoms as palpitations or a fluttering sensation in the chest,"" says Dr. Paul Zei, director of the Comprehensive Atrial Fibrillation Program at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. While these episodes typically appear out of the blue, exercise, stress, or certain foods and drugs (such as caffeine or other stimulants) sometimes trigger an episode. For some people, bending over at the waist can set off PSVT, he says.
        The frequency and duration of the episodes varies widely. Some people have a bout just once every few years, while others have them several times a day. The episode may last just a few seconds or minutes. Others last for hours or, in rare cases, even days. These rapid-fire beats mean the ventricles don't have time to fill before the heart contracts. As a result, blood flow to the brain and body may drop, causing symptoms such as lightheadedness, breathlessness, and fainting, says Dr. Zei.
        
          
            
              
                What is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia?
                
                  
                
                The heart's natural pacemaker, the sinoatrial node, generates electrical impulses that tell the heart to beat. But in a person with PSVT, the heart's steady rhythm undergoes sudden, periodic (paroxysmal) disruptions. An errant electrical signal from above the ventricle (supraventricular) overrides the sinoatrial node's normal signal and creates a series of very fast heartbeats (tachycardia). The vast majority of PSVTs are not life-threatening, although in rare circumstances, they can be dangerous, which is why people who experience repeated bouts of a racing heart should tell their doctor.

        How is PSVT diagnosed?
        Fewer than about three in every 1,000 people have PSVT. It occurs in people of all ages, from babies to older adults, but half of all cases are in people ages 50 to 64. Women account for just over two-thirds of all cases.
        Because a fast heartbeat and breathlessness are also common symptoms of anxiety, primary care doctors (who often aren't familiar with PSVT) may misdiagnose the problem as anxiety, especially in women, Dr. Zei says. An accurate diagnosis requires an electrocardiogram (ECG), a recording of the heart's electrical signature, at the time symptoms occur. Because the episodes don't last long, the heartbeat has usually returned to its normal rate by the time a person seeks medical attention. As a result, people with suspected PSVT usually need to wear a small ECG monitor on their chest for several days or weeks to confirm the diagnosis. Using a smartwatch or other device that can record an ECG is another option. ""If a specialist examines the data, these readings can be quite accurate for diagnosing PSVT,"" says Dr. Zei.
        Treatment options
        People with bothersome symptoms can try a handful of simple tricks that stimulate the vagus nerve, which helps slow the conduction of electrical impulses through the heart and may resolve the tachycardia. They include
        
          coughing or gagging
          putting an ice-cold, wet towel on your face
          pressing gently on your closed eyes
          holding your breath while bearing down as if for a bowel movement.
        
        The most effective technique, the modified Valsalva maneuver, involves sitting upright while blowing into a straw or small tube for 15 seconds. Next, you lie flat on your back and raise your legs to a 45° angle with another person supporting your legs for another 15 seconds. But if these methods don't work, people with persistent tachycardia usually need to go to urgent care or the emergency room to receive an injection or infusion of medication to return the heart to a normal beat. A nasal spray containing the experimental drug etripamil for treating PSVT is currently under FDA review.
        Zapping away the problem
        People with frequent, bothersome symptoms may want to consider catheter ablation, a short procedure done under mild sedation (meaning you're awake but relaxed and pain-free). After a doctor threads a catheter through a vein up to the heart, a zap of radiofrequency energy emitted from a device inside the catheter destroys the small area of tissue causing the errant electrical signal. For PSVT, catheter ablation has a 98% success rate and is quite safe. ""It's one of the few cardiac procedures for which we can almost always tell patients they've been cured, and the problem won't ever occur again,"" says Dr. Zei. As with any procedure, make sure you understand all the pros and cons beforehand.",Julie Corliss,"June 1, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/is-niacin-safe-for-the-heart,Is niacin safe for the heart?,"Q. 
          I've been taking a product called Niagen (nicotinamide riboside) as an anti-aging supplement. But I recently read that niacin may increase the risk of heart disease. Could that be a concern with Niagen as well?
        
        A. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is a water-soluble vitamin that helps your body convert food into energy. Niacin is the generic name for nicotinic acid and nicotinamide (also called niacinamide) and related derivatives such as nicotinamide riboside, the product you take.
        Niacin occurs naturally in many foods, including poultry, nuts, beans, and grains. It's also found in multivitamin supplements, B complex supplements, and supplements containing only niacin. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are the two main forms found in supplements. High-dose nicotinic acid is also available as a prescription medication for improving blood lipid levels.
        Niacin can lower triglycerides and raise high-density lipoprotein levels, usually requiring 1,500 to 2,000 milligrams (mg) a day to achieve this. However, prescription niacin has not been shown to lower the risk of death, heart attack, or stroke. A large study of more than 25,000 patients tested niacin in combination with cholesterol-lowering statin drugs found little additional benefit when compared with statins alone. What's more, high-dose niacin was associated with many worrisome side effects, including a higher risk of new-onset diabetes, worsening control of diabetes in those already had it, and a higher risk of serious gastrointestinal symptoms requiring hospitalization.
        As a result, in 2016, the FDA withdrew its approval of niacin for use in combination with statins or other lipid-lowering agents. Since then, niacin use in people with heart disease has fallen.
        The recent news about niacin you're referring to comes from a study of about 1,100 people with heart disease who were followed for three years. Researchers found that higher blood levels of two breakdown products of excess niacin were linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. However, they had no information about the participant's dietary niacin intake, and because this wasn't a clinical trial, the results cannot prove that niacin is to blame for this observation.
        In addition, we know that the amount of niacin found in multivitamins is not harmful. According to the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, the daily upper limit (the largest daily intake of a nutrient considered safe for most people) for niacin from dietary supplements is 35 mg for adults. Nicotinamide has fewer side effects than nicotinic acid. But at high doses — 500 mg per day or more — nicotinamide can cause diarrhea and easy bruising and can increase bleeding from wounds. So that's something to keep in mind when taking nicotinamide supplements. Also, based on the scientific evidence to date, this supplement appears to have little benefit for people.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/salmonella-is-sneaky-watch-out-202405293044,Salmonella is sneaky: Watch out,"Pop quiz: what is Salmonella? If you've ever had a run-in with this bacteria, you know it can cause a food-borne illness called salmonellosis, a form of food poisoning. But you may not know that Salmonella bacteria sicken an estimated 1.35 million people and hospitalize 26,500 every year in the United States. What's more, it kills more total people than any other type of food poisoning.
        And Salmonella bacteria can be sneaky — not only by triggering unusual complications, but infecting people in startling ways, says Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital. One patient she treated showed up with an abdominal aortic aneurysm — a dangerous bulge in the lower section of the body's largest artery — that looked infected. Testing revealed a culprit some would find surprising: Salmonella.
        ""It's just an interesting organism and it can be kind of scary,"" she says.
        How do people get infected by Salmonella?
        Many of the foods Salmonella bacteria lurk in are raw or undercooked. Breaded raw chicken products like nuggets and chicken Kiev are one way it may reach your table. But a variety of foods have been implicated — including organic basil, cantaloupes, ground beef, nut butters, raw cookie dough, eggs, raw or unpasteurized milk, and flour.
        Even small pets such as turtles and frogs, along with dog food, have contributed to Salmonella outbreaks in recent years.
        You can also become infected by handling contaminated food and spreading the bacteria from your hands to your mouth. Additionally, you can spread it to others on your hands or even on your clothes without becoming sick yourself.
        ""It's a bug that's carried in stool and animal feces and is also present in the environment,"" Dr. Hohmann says. ""So it can set up shop in lots of different inanimate objects, soils, and machinery, especially in moist environments.""
        What symptoms can Salmonella cause?
        Most of the time, Salmonella infection leads to gastroenteritis, usually causing just an upset stomach, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. These symptoms can start as soon as six hours after ingesting the bacteria. Typically, symptoms resolve on their own within two to three days.
        Some people have such mild symptoms they're barely noticeable. ""The classic case might be a college student who eats a burrito from a sketchy place, gets sick for a couple of days, gets better, and doesn't think anything of it,"" says Dr. Hohmann.
        Sometimes symptoms are more serious, such as severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea, or unexplained high fever and marked fatigue. These symptoms require a call to your doctor.
        How is salmonellosis treated?
        Most people will get better on their own without any medicines. Replacing lost fluids by sipping water or electrolyte drinks to avoid dehydration will help.
        Call a doctor if you have
        
          diarrhea and a fever higher than 102° F
          diarrhea that doesn't improve after three days
          bloody stools
          vomiting so severe it prevents you from keeping liquids down.
        
        Treating the infection with medicine comes with an annoying paradox, Dr. Hohmann says. If doctors decide to prescribe antibiotics, the person taking the medicine may shed the organism for longer than if they were never treated. ""Then that person may have the opportunity — either through poor personal hygiene, sex, or working as a food worker — to spread it to others,"" she explains. ""It's challenging.""
        What complications can Salmonella lead to?
        Some people get sicker with salmonellosis than others, with seemingly no rhyme or reason. But certain folks are especially vulnerable to serious infection, including:
        
          adults 65 and older
          pregnant women
          children under 5
          people whose immune systems are weakened by diseases (such as cancer) or treatments (such as immunosuppressing drugs).
        
        A small percentage of those infected can have Salmonella in their blood, which can spread the infection to other parts of the body such as the urinary tract, bones, joints, or central nervous system (brain and spinal fluid).
        And, like Dr. Hohmann's patient with the abdominal aortic aneurysm, on rare occasions Salmonella can lead to unusual blood vessel complications in people who already have atherosclerosis, blockage of the arteries caused by plaque buildup.
        ""It's not that common,"" she says. ""Many physicians are aware of it, so they take special care if Salmonella is found in a person with vascular disease.""
        What steps can you take to avoid Salmonella?
        While new USDA rules that take effect in 2025 may help fuel recalls of certain foods, we all can take steps to avoid the food poisoning, illness, and hospitalizations that Salmonella exposure can cause.
        Dr. Hohmann and the CDC suggest these strategies:
        
          Using hot water and soap, wash cutting boards or plates on which you cut into raw foods — including vegetables and fruit — before using those surfaces for other purposes. If possible, use separate cutting boards for produce, meat, and fish.
          Refrigerate or freeze foods that are perishable, prepared, or left over within two hours to thwart salmonella growth.
          Always wash hands well with soap and water before preparing food and after contact with animals, using the toilet, or changing diapers.
          If you have a sick pet, take extra care handling its feces and wash your hands thoroughly afterward.
        
        Take additional steps to help more vulnerable people stay healthy:
        
          Don't let young children touch high-risk animals, such as turtles, frogs, chickens, or ducks. ""And if you're taking young children to a petting zoo, they should not be petting animals unless you can disinfect their hands immediately afterward,"" she says.
          Older adults and those with compromised immune systems should take extra care to wash and cook foods thoroughly.
          People who have had a transplant (such as a kidney transplant) should not keep reptiles or amphibians as pets.
        
        ""You hate to make people paranoid, so that we're washing our lettuce leaves with soap, but it's worth thinking about these things, particularly if you have people in your household who are susceptible — which is an increasing number of people,"" Dr. Hohmann says.",Maureen Salamon,"May 29, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/continuous-glucose-monitors-cgms-for-type-2-diabetes-when-and-for-whom-are-they-useful,Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for type 2 diabetes: When and for whom are they useful?,"Continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, offer valuable and accurate insights into blood sugar levels, allowing some individuals with diabetes to make better-informed decisions about medications, diet, exercise, and overall diabetes management. As their popularity increases, it's important to understand who CGMs are most appropriate for.
        What are continuous glucose monitors (CGMs)?
        A CGM is a device that can monitor blood sugar levels continuously throughout the day and night.
        Unlike traditional fingerstick tests, which provide periodic, infrequent snapshots of blood sugar levels, CGMs measure glucose levels every five minutes, allowing a person with diabetes to know if their blood sugar is trending high or low. The devices offer greater convenience, accuracy, and potential for control for individuals with this condition.
        According to Dr. David Nathan, director of the Diabetes Center and Clinical Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School, continuous glucose monitoring has been revolutionary for some patients with diabetes.
        How do continuous glucose monitors work?
        CGMs need three parts to work: a sensor, a transmitter, and a receiver. In older models, the sensor and transmitter are separate devices. But newer models combine the sensor and transmitter in one device.
        The sensor is a tiny catheter that is inserted under the skin and held to the skin by an adhesive. It must be changed every 10 to 14 days. According to Dr. Nathan, the sensor is painless; most people forget they are wearing one. Newer CGMs are about the size of three quarters stacked together.
        The sensor measures glucose levels every one to five minutes in the interstitial fluid between your cells. It then communicates those levels to the transmitter, which sends the glucose readings to a receiver or smartphone app.
        Using advanced algorithms, CGMs analyze the data to provide users with insights into their blood sugar trends and patterns throughout the day and night. ""CGMs show you where your blood sugar levels are and where they are going,"" says Dr. Nathan. ""It shows you the graph of whether you're on the up slope or the down slope.""
        However, users should be aware that there is a delay of about 20 minutes between the levels the CGM displays and levels of glucose in the blood.
        Benefits of continuous glucose monitoring
        With a more detailed picture of glucose levels and patterns, an individual with diabetes can make informed decisions regarding diet, exercise, medication, and overall diabetes management.
        CGMs not only offer continuous monitoring, but can also sound alarms if glucose levels deviate from target ranges, enabling intervention to prevent dangerous highs or lows. It's important for a person with diabetes to maintain blood glucose levels within a target range to reduce the risk of short-term complications like dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and long-term complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision problems.
        Who can benefit from using CGMs?
        As continuous glucose monitoring provides a continuous stream of information regarding glucose levels, it enables patients with fluctuating glucose levels — which means patients with type 1 diabetes, for the most part — to either choose the right doses of insulin or for insulin pumps to choose the right doses.
        ""They really do improve blood sugar control in type 1 diabetes, and more safely than we were able to do before. And that's been well shown,"" says Dr. Nathan.
        The benefit of CGMs is less clear in patients with type 2 diabetes, which is far more common than type 1 diabetes. Of the 38 million people in the United States with diabetes, 90% to 95% have type 2 diabetes. Of people with type 2 diabetes, according to Dr. Nathan, a small fraction need complex insulin regimens that involve multiple daily insulin injections.
        ""And for them, it's been suggested that CGM may also be helpful because they are also vulnerable to low blood sugars,"" explains Dr. Nathan. ""In insulin-treated persons with type 2 diabetes, CGM can provide them with an early warning sign if their blood sugars are dropping.""
        ""But people with type 2 diabetes, even those treated with insulin, actually have much less frequent, severe hypoglycemia compared to people with type 1 diabetes,"" says Dr. Nathan. ""So as a safety measure, the vast majority of people with type 2 diabetes really don't need it. They're not even on a medication that will cause low blood sugar.""
        However, limited, early evidence hints that there might be a role for the devices in the future to help a wider range of patients, including those with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.
        Are there any downsides to CGMs?
        CGMs are generally safe and not difficult to wear, though they are usually worn 24 hours a day and for 365 days a year. The sensors should be replaced at least every 14 days. A small fraction of people may develop irritation or allergic reaction to the adhesive that secures it to the skin. Local skin infections are ""extremely rare,"" says Dr. Nathan. ""And there really is no other complication.""
        One of the biggest concerns for users of CGMs is cost. CGMs can cost thousands of dollars a year. Medicare covers the devices for eligible patients — those who are on insulin therapy and performing four or more blood sugar checks per day. Private insurance coverage can vary.
        As CGMs have become more popular, some people have started to use them to monitor blood sugar, even if they do not have diabetes. ""I tend to draw the line at type 1 diabetes and for selected patients with type 2,"" says Dr. Nathan. ""For everyone else, there are almost no data to support using these devices on a regular basis.""
        Dr. Nathan cautions that overuse of CGM devices by people who do not need them could translate into a strain on supply of the devices, making them less available to people with diabetes for whom they have proven benefit.",Jenette Restivo,"May 29, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/panic-attacks-recognizing-and-managing-panic-attacks-and-preventing-future-attacks,Panic attacks: Recognizing and managing panic attacks and preventing future attacks,"When you are in a stressful situation, such as giving a presentation at work or being confronted by an angry driver on the road, your body responds in a physical way. You may notice your heart is beating quickly, you start to sweat or tremble, and your muscles tense. This is your body's autonomic nervous system, or ""fight-or-flight"" response, kicking into gear.
        This response was a great survival technique for our ancestors when exposed to life-threatening situations — preparing them to flee from danger or fight off a threat. It can be useful for modern-day humans too, such as when you quickly swerve out of the way to avoid being hit by an oncoming car.
        Unfortunately, this inherited stress response can be triggered without warning in susceptible people, causing a panic attack. Panic attacks cause overwhelming fear and challenging symptoms that are out of proportion to any actual threat or danger. Understanding the signs of a panic attack and learning coping strategies can help you manage a difficult episode.
        What is a panic attack?
        A panic attack is an episode where a person experiences a sudden wave of fear and anxiety, often in a situation where there is no real threat or danger. The incident can last anywhere from several minutes to an hour, and is usually accompanied by physical symptoms, such as sweating and a racing heartbeat.
        If you suffer from panic attacks, this may be a sign of another mental health issue such as panic disorder. However, not all people who experience a panic attack will go on to develop panic disorder. Panic attacks can also occur in people with other mental health conditions such as depression, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
        Panic disorder
        People with panic disorder suffer from recurrent panic attacks. Other features of panic disorder include persistent
        
          worry about future attacks
          fear of losing control
          concern the panic attacks will cause harm (such as triggering a heart attack).
        
        Eventually this fear leads to changes in your everyday life. For example, you might avoid traveling or social events out of fear you will have another attack. These avoidant behaviors start to negatively impact your job, relationships, hobbies, and overall well-being.
        Panic disorder is a common mental health condition that is estimated to affect nearly 5% of the US population.
        Symptoms of panic attacks
        Panic attacks occur suddenly and abruptly — you may feel only slightly anxious or even calm before it starts. The main symptom of a panic attack is an intense feeling of fear or discomfort. This feeling usually lasts for several minutes but subsides within an hour.
        Panic attacks are also accompanied by physical signs and symptoms of anxiety. These include:
        
          rapid heart rate
          sweating
          trembling
          feeling short of breath
          chest pain or discomfort
          nausea or an upset stomach
          feeling dizzy or faint
          numbness or tingling sensations in the body
          feeling you are losing control
          feeling detached from your body or reality
          feeling like you might die.
        
        What can trigger a panic attack?
        Panic attacks can occur in the absence of any cause or trigger. As a result many panic attacks are unexpected, and you cannot always predict when they will occur.
        In other cases, panic attacks may be triggered by external stressors. Someone with panic disorder may perceive these stressors as more serious than the actual threat they represent.
        Examples of potential triggers include:
        
          social situations such as parties and meetings
          individual performances such as giving a speech
          situations, objects, or activities that cause fear or anxiety such as heights, airplanes, or needles
          traumatic events such as physical or emotional trauma
          reminders or memories of prior traumatic events.
        
        In addition, certain activities and substances can stimulate the body in similar ways to actual acute stress and prime your fight-or-flight response, causing panic-like symptoms that can trigger a full-blown panic attack. Examples include:
        
          excessive intake of caffeine
          alcohol abuse and withdrawal
          intense physical exercise.
        
        Treatment and preventing future panic attacks
        If you think you are having panic attacks, seek evaluation with your doctor or a mental health professional. He or she will determine if you have an anxiety disorder such as panic disorder. Your doctor can also identify or rule out medical conditions, such as heart or thyroid problems, which could be causing or contributing to your symptoms. Treating underlying medical conditions such as a cardiac arrhythmia or thyroid problem can sometimes eliminate the panic attacks.
        Common treatment options for panic attacks, panic disorder, and other anxiety disorders include:
        
          Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). A form of psychotherapy, CBT teaches you coping behaviors that can be used before and during a panic attack. You'll learn to reframe your thoughts and implement behavior strategies that lessen the frequency and severity of panic attacks over time.
          Antidepressants. Even if you don't have depression, these medications can reduce the symptoms of anxiety. It can take several months to achieve their maximum benefit, but they can eventually help to prevent panic attacks.
          Anti-anxiety medications such as benzodiazepines. These medications can be taken during a panic attack to rapidly improve symptoms. They can also prevent panic attacks, and are often prescribed to be taken twice a day in people with panic disorder. Benzodiazepines can be habit-forming and should only be taken as prescribed by your doctor.
        
        Research suggests that breathing exercises, meditation, light- or moderate-intensity exercise, and muscle relaxation techniques can help prevent panic attacks when practiced regularly. The workbook Mastery of Your Anxiety and Panic, by David H. Barlow and Michelle G. Craske, provides descriptions of practices that can help to reduce symptoms.
        In addition, grounding techniques can help you to cope during an attack. Grounding techniques refer to strategies that help you stay present and attuned to your body. You gain a sense of control by focusing on the ""here and now"" rather than your negative emotions and symptoms. A few helpful techniques include:
        
          Practice deep breathing. Place your hand gently on your belly. Take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on breathing slowly and deeply, noticing your hand rising and falling with each breath.
          Redirect your focus. Concentrate on an object in your immediate environment or on another task in your head. Consider repeating a mantra to yourself or reciting the lyrics to your favorite song.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/social-anxiety-disorder-treatments-and-tips-for-managing-this-challenging-condition,Social anxiety disorder: Treatments and tips for managing this challenging condition,"Many of us experience social anxiety from time to time such as feeling uneasy before attending a cocktail party, or having ""butterflies"" before a presentation at work. It is normal to feel shy, nervous, or anxious in situations where we are outside of our comfort zone. But when this social anxiousness causes intense distress and starts to impact daily life, it could be indicative of a common condition called social anxiety disorder.
        What is social anxiety disorder?
        Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also called social phobia, is a common mental health disorder that is estimated to affect up to 7% of adults in the US every year. SAD is characterized by an extreme fear of social situations, from giving performances or speeches to attending a party. Those who suffer from SAD fear they will be scrutinized and humiliated by other people. This fear causes intense distress and can keep those affected from doing things they want to do.
        Symptoms of social anxiety disorder
        The main symptom of social anxiety disorder is an extreme fear of being scrutinized or embarrassed by other people. The fear is so great that it can cause a person to avoid social settings altogether.
        There are also physical symptoms of anxiety that may accompany the fear. For example:
        
          feeling sweaty
          blushing
          having a rapid heartbeat
          trembling
          nausea
          feeling short of breath.
        
        There are two types of social anxiety disorder. Most people with SAD have generalized social anxiety, meaning they fear all social situations such as meetings or parties. In people with SAD, discomfort with social situations usually begins during the childhood or teenage years. Symptoms typically get worse over time. Symptoms of social anxiety disorder, as opposed to normal everyday nervousness, are constant and severe. This stress starts to affect relationships, jobs, daily routines, and overall quality of life.
        Another type of SAD, performance-only social anxiety, is much less common. People with performance anxiety only fear times when they are the center of attention such as giving a speech or a performance. Performance anxiety is not as impairing as generalized social anxiety and starts later in life.
        Causes and risk factors
        Social anxiety disorder is thought to be caused by both biological and environmental factors: an influence of both nature and nurture. Scientists believe SAD develops in response to a complex interaction of neural factors (meaning what's going on in the brain and nervous system), as well as psychosocial factors — the influence of life events, thoughts, and behaviors.
        Causes of SAD related to the brain and nervous system include:
        
          a hyperactive nervous system. This means even small emotional triggers can result in the release of cortisol, a stress hormone in the body.
          decreased amounts of serotonin (a hormone involved in controlling mood) in the brain
          abnormal levels of glutamate and oxytocin in the brain. These hormones control how you respond in social settings and the intensity of anxiety symptoms.
          increased sensitivity in areas of the brain that control mood and emotion.
        
        Psychosocial causes of SAD include early childhood trauma such as a history of abuse and neglect, and childhood teasing. Overprotective and hypercritical parenting styles have also been associated with the disorder. These events influence how you interact with others and respond in social situations.
        Other risk factors for development of social anxiety disorder include:
        
          female sex
          family history of social anxiety disorder
          shy personality
          demonstrating intense fear of new people and withdrawal from new situations during childhood.
        
        How is social anxiety disorder diagnosed?
        Your doctor can help distinguish social phobia from other anxiety disorders. He or she uses certain criteria to make the diagnosis. You may be diagnosed with social anxiety disorder if you:
        
          have extreme fear of social interactions (such as having a conversation, attending a party, or meeting new people), being observed (such as while eating or drinking), or performing in front of people (such as giving a speech)
          worry about being judged, embarrassed, or humiliated by other people
          avoid social situations because of your fear and anxiety
          feel that your social anxiety hinders your social and personal life.
        
        These symptoms must be present for at least six months in order to be diagnosed with the condition.
        If you are concerned you may have SAD, talk with your doctor. Because people who suffer from SAD are at increased risk of developing depression and other mental health problems, proper diagnosis and treatment are important.
        Treatment options
        The two most common treatment approaches for social anxiety disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy and prescription medications.
        Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
        Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy, is a first-line treatment for SAD. Trained professionals help you understand your triggers and learn coping strategies. The goal of CBT is to challenge your negative thoughts and learn behavioral strategies to overcome them.
        CBT can be done in an individual or group setting. Most people start with a weekly session and gradually decrease the frequency. Once your symptoms are well controlled, attending two to four sessions per year is recommended to prevent relapse.
        Medications
        Your doctor may prescribe medications to use alone or in combination with CBT. Antidepressants are usually prescribed first for social anxiety disorder. Even in people who do not have depression, these medications can help with symptoms of anxiety. The two most prescribed antidepressant drug classes are:
        
          selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft)
          serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as venlafaxine (Effexor).
        
        These medications help normalize the levels of hormones in the brain that contribute to SAD. It may take up to three months of treatment before you notice the full effect of these medications on your symptoms, but you should begin to notice some benefit before then.
        If you suffer from performance anxiety, your doctor may prescribe an anti-anxiety medication to use on an as-needed basis, such as before you give a presentation. These include:
        
          beta blockers such as propranolol (Inderal)
          benzodiazepines such as clonazepam (Klonopin) and lorazepam (Ativan).
        
        These medications provide short-term relief by slowing the heart rate and calming the nervous system, and can be taken as needed before an anxiety-producing situation.
        Complementary strategies
        Self-help techniques can be used to complement other treatments. Many of these measures are easy to implement and may provide benefits beyond building social confidence.
        
          Practice mindfulness. Mindfulness refers to the practice of being present without judgment. When you are mindful, you are aware of your surroundings and emotions but do not react to them. Research shows that mindfulness can improve symptoms of SAD and overall quality of life.
          Treat sleep problems. Studies have shown that people who suffer from social anxiety disorder have higher rates of sleep problems. Poor sleep is linked to worsening anxiety and may increase social avoidance over time. Consider creating a relaxing sleep routine and avoiding screen time later in the day to improve the quality of your sleep.
          Exercise. Regular exercise can help improve anxiety symptoms. Research suggests aerobic exercise is even more beneficial for social phobia when combined with CBT.
          Avoid or minimize alcohol and caffeine intake. Many people use alcohol as a way to lessen their social anxiety, but alcohol has been shown to worsen anxiety in the long run. Similarly, caffeine can cause or worsen anxiety, especially at higher doses.
          Find a support group. Talking through your fears and hearing the experiences of others can help to validate your emotions and reduce social isolation. It may also help enhance your coping skills as you practice vulnerability in a social setting. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) provides a list of virtual and in-person support groups, including one for individuals with social anxiety.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","May 20, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ptsd-how-is-treatment-changing-202405153041,PTSD: How is treatment changing?,"Over the course of a lifetime, as many as seven in 10 adults in the United States will directly experience or witness harrowing events. These include gun violence, car accidents, and other personal trauma; natural or human-made disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina and the 9/11 terrorist attacks; and military combat. And some — though not all — will experience post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
        New guidelines released in 2024 can help guide effective treatment.
        What is PTSD?
        PTSD is a potentially debilitating mental health condition. It's marked by recurrent, frightening episodes during which a person relives a traumatic event.
        After a disturbing event, it's normal to have upsetting memories, feel on edge, and have trouble sleeping. For most people, these symptoms fade over time. But when certain symptoms persist for more than a month, a person may be experiencing PTSD.
        These symptoms include
        
          recurring nightmares or intrusive thoughts about the event
          feeling emotionally numb and disconnected
          withdrawing from people and certain situations
          being jumpy and on guard.
        
        The National Center for PTSD offers a brief self-screening test online, which can help you decide whether to seek more information and help.
        Who is more likely to experience PTSD?
        Not everyone who experiences violence, disasters, and other upsetting events goes on to develop PTSD. However, military personnel exposed to combat in a war zone are especially vulnerable. About 11% to 20% of veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan have PTSD, according to the National Center for PTSD.
        What about people who were not in the military? Within the general population, estimates suggest PTSD occurs in 4% of men and 8% of women — a difference at least partly related to the fact that women are more likely to experience sexual assault.
        What are the new guidelines for PTSD treatment?
        Experts from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense collaborated on new guidelines for treating PTSD. They detailed the evidence both for and against specific therapies for PTSD.
        Their findings apply to civilian and military personnel alike, says Dr. Sofia Matta, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital and senior director of medical services at Home Base, a nonprofit organization that provides care for veterans, service members, and their families.
        The circle of care is widely drawn for good reason. ""It's important to recognize that PTSD doesn't just affect the person who is suffering but also their families and sometimes, their entire community,"" Dr. Matta says. The rise in mass shootings in public places and the aftermath of these events are a grim reminder of this reality, she adds.
        Which treatment approaches are most effective for PTSD?
        The new guidelines looked at psychotherapy, medications, nondrug therapies. Psychotherapy, sometimes paired with certain medicines, emerged as the most effective approach.
        The experts also recommended not taking certain drugs due to lack of evidence or possible harm.
        Which psychotherapies are recommended for PTSD?
        The recommended treatment for PTSD, psychotherapy, is more effective than medication. It also has fewer adverse side effects and people prefer it, according to the guidelines.
        Which type of psychotherapy can help? Importantly, the most effective therapies for people with PTSD differ from those for people with other mental health issues, says Dr. Matta.
        Both cognitive processing therapy and prolonged exposure therapy were effective. These two therapies teach people how to evaluate and reframe the upsetting thoughts stemming from the traumatic experience. The guidelines also recommend mindfulness-based stress reduction, an eight-week program that includes meditation, body scanning, and simple yoga stretches.
        Which medications are recommended for PTSD?
        Some people with severe symptoms need medication to feel well enough to participate in therapy. ""People with PTSD often don't sleep well due to insomnia and nightmares, and the resulting fatigue makes it hard to pay attention and concentrate,"" says Dr. Matta.
        Three medicines commonly prescribed for depression and anxiety — paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), and venlafaxine (Effexor) — are recommended. Prazosin (Minipress) may help people with nightmares, but the evidence is weak.
        Which medications are not recommended for PTSD?
        The guidelines strongly recommended not taking benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety drugs often taken for sleep). Benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax) and clonazepam (Klonopin) offer no proven benefits for people with PTSD. They have several potential harms, including negative cognitive changes and decreased effectiveness of PTSD psychotherapies.
        What about cannabis, psychedelics, and brain stimulation therapies?
        Right now, evidence doesn't support the idea that cannabis helps ease PTSD symptoms. And there are possible serious side effects from the drug, such as cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (severe vomiting related to long-term cannabis use).
        There isn't enough evidence to recommend for or against psychedelic-assisted therapies such as psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and MDMA (ecstasy). ""Because these potential therapies are illegal under federal law, the barriers for conducting research on them are very high,"" says Dr. Matta. However, recent legislative reforms may make such studies more feasible.
        Likewise, the evidence is mixed for a wide range of other nondrug therapies, such as brain stimulation therapies like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation.",Julie Corliss,"May 15, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/type-2-diabetes-mellitus-a-to-z,Type 2 diabetes mellitus,"What is type 2 diabetes?
        Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease. It is characterized by high levels of sugar in the blood. Type 2 diabetes is also called type 2 diabetes mellitus and adult-onset diabetes. That's because it used to start almost always in middle and late adulthood. However, more and more children and teens are developing this condition. Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes, and is really a different disease. But it shares with type 1 diabetes high blood sugar levels and the complications of high blood sugar.
        During digestion, food is broken down into basic components. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose. Glucose is a critically important source of energy for the body's cells. To provide energy to the cells, glucose needs to leave the blood and get inside the cells.
        Insulin traveling in the blood signals the cells to take up glucose. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen. When levels of glucose in the blood rise (for example, after a meal), the pancreas produces more insulin.
        Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body's cells resist the normal effect of insulin, which is to drive glucose in the blood into the inside of the cells. This condition is called insulin resistance. As a result, glucose starts to build up in the blood.
        In people with insulin resistance, the pancreas ""sees"" the blood glucose level rising. The pancreas responds by making extra insulin to maintain a normal blood sugar. Over time, the body's insulin resistance gets worse. In response the pancreas makes more and more insulin. Finally, the pancreas gets ""exhausted."" It cannot keep up with the demand for more and more insulin. It poops out.  As a result, blood glucose levels start to rise.
        Type 2 diabetes runs in families. Obesity greatly increases the risk of diabetes.
        Symptoms of type 2 diabetes
        The symptoms of diabetes are related to high blood glucose levels. They include:
        
          excessive urination, thirst and hunger
          weight loss
          increased susceptibility to infections, especially yeast or fungal infections.
        
        Extremely high blood sugar levels also can lead to a dangerous complication called hyperosmolar syndrome. This is a life-threatening form of dehydration. In some cases, hyperosmolar syndrome is the first sign that a person has type 2 diabetes. It causes confused thinking, weakness, nausea and even seizure and coma.
        The treatment of type 2 diabetes also can produce symptoms. Too much glucose-lowering medicine, relative to dietary intake, can lead to the complication of low blood sugar (called hypoglycemia). Symptoms of hypoglycemia include:
        
          sweating
          trembling
          dizziness
          hunger
          confusion
          seizures and loss of consciousness (if hypoglycemia is not recognized and corrected).
        
        You can correct hypoglycemia by eating or drinking something that has carbohydrates. This raises your blood sugar level.
        Type 2 diabetes affects all parts of the body. It can cause serious, potentially life-threatening complications. These include:
        
          Atherosclerosis — Atherosclerosis is fat buildup in the artery walls. This can impair blood flow to the all the organs. The heart, brain and legs are most often affected.
          Retinopathy — Tiny blood vessels in the retina (the back of the eye that sees light) can become damaged by high blood sugar. The damage can block blood flow to the retina, and can lead to bleeding into the retina.  Both damage the ability of the retina to see light. Caught early, retinopathy damage can be minimized by tightly controlling blood sugar and using laser therapy. Untreated retinopathy can lead to blindness.
          Neuropathy — This is nerve damage. The most common type is peripheral neuropathy. The nerves to the legs are damaged first, causing pain and numbness in the feet. This can advance to cause symptoms in the legs and hands. Damage to the nerves that control digestion, sexual function and urination can also occur.
          Foot problems — Sores and blisters on the feet occur for two reasons:
	If peripheral neuropathy causes numbness, the person may not feel irritation in the foot. The skin can break down, form an ulcer, and the ulcer can get infected.Blood circulation can be poor, leading to slow healing. Left untreated, a simple sore can become infected and very large.  If medical treatment cannot heal the sore, an amputation may be required.
          Nephropathy — Damage to the kidneys. This is more likely if blood sugars remain elevated and high blood pressure is not treated aggressively.
        
        Diagnosing type 2 diabetes
        Diabetes is diagnosed by testing the blood for sugar levels. Blood is tested in the morning after you have fasted overnight.
        Typically, the body keeps blood sugar levels between 70 and 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), even after fasting. If a blood sugar level after fasting is greater than 125 mg/dL, diabetes is diagnosed.
        Your doctor will examine you to look for:
        
          obesity, especially abdominal obesity — a condition that greatly raises a person's risk for type 2 diabetes
          high blood pressure — a condition often present in people with type 2 diabetes that, together with diabetes, greatly increases the risk of heart disease and strokes
          deposits of blood or puffy yellow spots in the retina of your eyes — complications of both diabetes and high blood pressure that increase the risk of blindness
          decreased sensation in the legs, which can cause a person with diabetes to fail to notice developing foot sores, particularly sores on the underside of the feet
          weak pulses in the feet — a condition that can slow or prevent the healing of foot sores, and possibly lead to amputation
          blisters, ulcers, or infections of the feet.
        
        Laboratory tests are also used routinely to evaluate diabetes. These include:
        
          Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test. Blood is taken in the morning after fasting overnight. Normally, blood sugar levels remain between 70 and 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Diabetes is diagnosed if a fasting blood sugar level is 126 mg/dL or higher.
          Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Blood sugar is measured two hours after drinking 75 grams of glucose. Diabetes is diagnosed if the 2-hour blood sugar level is 200 mg/dL or higher.
          Random blood glucose test. A blood sugar of 200 mg/dL or greater at any time of day combined with symptoms of diabetes is sufficient to make the diagnosis.
          Hemoglobin A1C (glycohemoglobin). This test measures the average glucose level over the prior two to three months. Diabetes is diagnosed if the hemoglobin A1C level is 6.5% percent or higher.
          Blood creatinine and urine microalbumin. Tests for evidence of kidney disease.
          Lipid profile. Measures levels of triglycerides and total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol. This evaluates the risk of atherosclerosis. People with diabetes who also have high levels of total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol are at greatly increased risk for heart disease and strokes.
        
        Expected duration of type 2 diabetes
        Diabetes is a lifelong illness. However, people with type 2 diabetes can sometimes restore their blood sugar levels to normal just by eating a healthy diet, regularly exercising, and losing weight.
        Aging and episodic illness can cause the body's insulin resistance to increase. As a result, additional treatment typically is required over time.
        Preventing type 2 diabetes
        If a close relative — particularly, a parent or sibling — has type 2 diabetes, or if your blood glucose test shows ""prediabetes"" — defined as blood glucose levels between 100 and 125 mg/dL — you are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes. You can help to prevent type 2 diabetes by:
        
          Maintaining your ideal body weight.
          Exercising regularly, like a brisk walk of 1-2 miles in 30 minutes at least five times a week, even if that does not result in you achieving an ideal weight. That's because regular exercise reduces insulin resistance, even if you don't lose weight.
          Eating a healthy diet.
          Taking medication. The medication metformin (Glucophage) offers some additional protection for people with pre-diabetes.
        
        If you already have type 2 diabetes, you can still delay or prevent complications:
        
          Keep tight control of your blood sugar. This reduces the risk of most complications.
          Lower your risk of heart-related complications:
	Consider taking low-dose aspirin daily.Aggressively manage other risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as:
		high blood pressurehigh cholesterol and triglyceridescigarette smokingobesity
          Visit an eye doctor and a foot specialist every year to reduce eye and foot complications.
        
        Treating type 2 diabetes
        Diet and exercise
        In most cases, type 2 diabetes treatment begins with weight reduction through diet and exercise. A healthy diet for a person with diabetes is:
        
          low in saturated fats and cholesterol
          without any trans fats
          low in total calories
          nutritionally balanced with abundant amounts of
	whole-grain foodsmonounsaturated oilsfruits and vegetables.
        
        For some people, type 2 diabetes can be controlled just with aggressive weight loss and exercise. Even if medications are required, diet and exercise remain important for controlling diabetes.
        Medications
        Metformin. Oral metformin remains the first go-to drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It's available as a generic, so it's very affordable. Also, metformin does not cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) when used alone. The most common side effects are abdominal discomfort and irregular bowel habits.
        According to new guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), doctors should consider adding either a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT-2 inhibitor if blood sugar levels are still too high despite metformin or a person has an increased risk of cardiovascular or kidney disease. The ADA recognizes that the high cost of these newer drugs can be an obstacle to their use.
        Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. These drugs mimic the effects of a substance the gut produces naturally to spur the pancreas to make more insulin. These drugs also slow down the emptying of the stomach, which may make people feel full longer. Examples include liraglutide (Victoza), semaglutide (Ozempic) and dulaglutide (Trulicity).
        Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. These drugs work by blocking the kidney's ability to reabsorb sugar. They act as diuretics and produce other effects on the kidney, which are likely what makes them effective in preventing heart disease and lowering blood pressure. Examples include empagliflozin (Jardiance), canagliflozin (Invokana), and dapagliflozin (Farxiga).
        Both have side effects. When a SGLT2 blocks the kidney's ability to reabsorb sugar, it increases sugar levels in the urine, exposing your kidneys and bladder higher levels of glucose. This can lead to infections. These medications are associated with a fourfold increase in vaginal yeast infections and a more modest increase in urinary tract infections. GLP-1 receptor agonists slow down digestion, which can help with weight loss but can also produce unpleasant symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, in 15% to 45% of people who take them.
        GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors have additional health benefits beyond helping with blood sugar control:
        Weight loss. Both can help a person with diabetes shed pounds. But the GLP-1 receptor agonists are more effective for weight reduction compared with the SGLT-2 inhibitors.
        Heart disease. Drugs from both classes lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with diabetes. For people with heart failure and diabetes, SGLT-2 inhibitors have been shown to decrease hospitalizations and improve survival. Because of these benefits, doctors are beginning to use SGLT-2 inhibitors even in nondiabetic heart failure patients.
        Chronic kidney disease. SGLT-2 inhibitors can slow down the progression of diabetic kidney disease and may help prevent kidney failure related to other conditions.
        Insulin
        Because type 2 diabetes develops when the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance. In advanced type 2 diabetes, or for people who want to tightly control glucose levels, insulin may be needed more than once per day and in higher doses.
        Treatment plans that include both very long-acting insulin and very short-acting insulin are frequently the most successful for controlling blood sugar. Very short-acting insulin is used with meals, to help control the spike in blood sugar levels that occur with a meal. If a person does not eat on a regular schedule, very short-acting insulin can be particularly helpful.
        The most worrisome side effect of insulin is low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). The usual symptoms are sudden weakness, sweating, feeling unwell and not thinking clearly. However, people with low standing diabetes may lose the ability to feel these symptoms even with a dangerously low blood sugar level.
        Other medicines
        In addition to medicines that help control the level of blood sugar, people with type 2 diabetes often take other medicines that reduce the risk or to slow the onset of the complications of diabetes. These include medications that:
        
          slow the worsening of kidney disease. If the person is not taking an SGLT2 inhibitor, they should consider taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).
          lower cholesterol. All diabetics should consider taking medication to lower their cholesterol, usually one of the statin medications.
          lower blood pressure. Diabetics should use medication to control high blood pressure if it can't be improved by lifestyle changes.
          protect against heart attacks. People with diabetes may benefit from daily low-dose aspirin.
        
        When to call a professional
        If you have diabetes, see your doctor regularly.
        People with high blood sugar levels have a higher risk of dehydration. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop vomiting or diarrhea and are not able to drink enough fluids.
        Monitor your blood sugar as advised by your health care team. Report any significant deviations in blood sugar levels.
        Prognosis
        Your treatment plan is likely to require adjustment over time. Insulin resistance increases with age. And the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas may wear out as the pancreas tries to keep up with the body's extra insulin needs.
        After the first few years, the majority of people with type 2 diabetes require more than one medicine to keep their blood sugar controlled.
        The prognosis in people with type 2 diabetes varies. It depends on how well an individual modifies his or her risk of complications. Heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease can result in premature death. Disability due to blindness, amputation, heart disease, stroke, and nerve damage may occur. Some people with type 2 diabetes become dependent on dialysis treatments or require a kidney transplant because of kidney failure.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/new-urine-test-may-help-some-men-with-elevated-psa-avoid-biopsy-202405063038,New urine test may help some men with elevated PSA avoid biopsy,"When a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test produces an abnormal result, the next step is usually a prostate biopsy. A biopsy can confirm or rule out a cancer diagnosis, but it also has certain drawbacks. Prostate biopsies are invasive procedures with potential side effects, and they often detect low-grade, slow-growing tumors that may not need immediate treatment — or any treatment at all.
        Researchers are exploring various strategies for avoiding unnecessary biopsies. Specialized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, for instance, can be useful for predicting if a man's tumor is likely to spread. A blood test called the Prostate Health Index (PHI) measures various forms of PSA, and can help doctors determine if a biopsy is needed.
        In April, researchers at the University of Michigan published results with a test that screens for prostate cancer in urine samples. Called the MyProstateScore 2.0 (MPS2) test, it looks for 18 different genes associated with high-grade tumors. ""If you're negative on this test, it's almost certain that you don't have aggressive prostate cancer,"" said Dr. Arul Chinnaiyan, a professor of pathology and urology at the University, in a press release.
        Gathering data and further testing
        To create the test, Dr. Chinnaiyan and his colleagues first turned to publicly-available databases containing over 58,000 prostate cancer-associated genes. From that initial pool, they narrowed down to 54 genes that are uniquely overexpressed in cancers classified as Grade Group 2 (GG2) or higher. The Grade Group system ranks prostate cancers from GG1 (the least dangerous) to GG5 (the most dangerous).
        The team tested those 54 genes against archived urine samples from 761 men with elevated PSA who were scheduled for biopsy. This effort yielded 18 genes that consistently correlated with high-grade cancer in the biopsy specimens. These genes now make up MPS2.
        Then the team validated the test by performing MPS2 testing on over 800 archived urine samples collected by a national prostate cancer research consortium. Other researchers affiliated with that consortium assessed the new urine test's results against patient records.
        Interpreting the results
        Study findings showed that MPS2 correctly identified 95% of the GG2 prostate cancers and 99% of cancers that were GG3 or higher. Test accuracy was further improved by incorporating estimates of the prostate's size (or volume, as it's also called).
        According to the team's calculations, use of the MPS2 would have reduced unnecessary biopsies by 37%. If volume was included in the measure, then 41% of biopsies would have been avoided. By comparison, just 26% of biopsies would have been avoided with the PHI.
        Dr. Chinnaiyan and his co-authors emphasize that ruling out high-grade cancer with a urine test offers some advantages over MRI. The specialized multi-parametric MRI scans needed to assess high-grade cancer in men with elevated PSA aren't always available in community settings, for instance. Moreover, the interpretation of mpMRI results can vary from one radiologist to another. Importantly, the MPS2 can be updated over time as new prostate-cancer genes are identified.
        Commentary
        Dr. Boris Gershman, a urologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, and a member of the advisory and editorial board for the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases, described the new study results as promising. ""It does appear that the performance of the 18-gene urine test is better than PSA alone,"" he says.
        But Dr. Gershman adds that it will be important to consider how such a test will fit into the current two-stage approach for PSA screening, which entails prostate MRI when the PSA is abnormal. Where MRI delivers a yes/no result (meaning lesions that look suspicious for cancer are either present or not), the MPS2 provides numerical risk estimates ranging between 0% and 100%. ""The challenge with clinical implementation of a continuous risk score is where to draw the line for biopsy,"" Dr. Gershman says.
        ""This research is very encouraging, since many men in rural areas may not have access to prostate MRI machines or the added sophistication that is needed in interpreting these MRI scans,"" says Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""A widely available urine test may eventually help provide more precision in determining who should undergo a prostate biopsy, and may also help to assess the probability that a cancer is clinically significant and in need of treatment.""",Charlie Schmidt,"May 6, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/dupuytrens-contracture-of-the-hand-202404303037,Dupuytren's contracture of the hand,"One of the more unusual conditions affecting the hands and fingers is Dupuytren's contracture (also called Dupuytren's disease). Here, one or more fingers become curled, which can make it difficult to pick up or hold objects or perform everyday activities.
        Legend says the condition originated with the Vikings of Northern Europe, although this is debated. It was later named after the 19th-century French surgeon Guillaume Dupuytren, who did the first successful operation on the condition. Fast-forward to the 21st century, and Dupuytren's contracture now affects about one in 20 Americans.
        What is Dupuytren's contracture?
        Fascia is a sheet of fibrous tissue beneath the skin of the fingers and the palm. Dupuytren's contracture is a thickening and shortening of this tissue.
        This thickened area begins as a hard lump called a nodule. Over years to decades, it may progress to a thick band called a cord that causes one or more fingers to curl toward the palm and become stuck in a bent position. This can make it difficult to grasp objects, button clothes, use a computer, or perform other daily tasks.
        The condition does not always get progressively worse. It may be stable for years or even improve in some people.
        Which fingers are most likely to be affected?
        The ring and pinky fingers are most often affected. But the condition can strike all fingers and the thumb.
        ""In about half of cases, the condition can affect both hands,"" says Dr. Phillip Blazar, an orthopedic surgeon and Division Chief of Hand and Upper Extremity at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Fortunately, it rarely causes pain.
        What causes Dupuytren's contracture?
        Currently, the cause is unclear. Still, several factors can increase a person's risk, such as
        
          Genetics: This condition is more common in people with Northern European, British Isles, or Scandinavian ancestry.
          Gender: Men are affected more often than women.
          Age: The condition often occurs after age 50.
          Family history of the disease.
        
        People with diabetes and seizure disorders are also more likely to have Dupuytren's. The condition may appear and/or worsen after trauma to the hand.
        How is Dupuytren's contracture treated?
        Although there is no cure, treatments and occupational or physical therapy can help address symptoms and improve finger mobility. ""Many people who have mild cases of Dupuytren's find it has little impact on their ability to use their hands,"" says Dr. Blazar.
        However, moderate or severe cases can interfere with hand function. It's possible to restore normal finger motion with nonsurgical treatments, such as:
        
          Collagenase injection. This procedure is done in the doctor's office. An enzyme called collagenase is injected into the cords of your hand, which breaks down and dissolves the thickened tissue. At a follow-up visit, your doctor will give you local anesthesia and then snap the cords by manipulating and straightening your fingers in the direction in which they are unable to move.
          Needle aponeurotomy. This in-office procedure involves passing a hypodermic needle back and forth through the restrictive cords to weaken and break them.
        
        ""Your hand surgeon will discuss both treatment options to determine which is best for your situation,"" says Dr. Blazar. ""There are also some variations in the anatomy of the disease which may make one treatment or the other less favorable for a particular person or finger."" Both of these treatments don't remove the cords, and the condition can return and require additional treatment.
        What about surgical treatment?
        If nonsurgical treatment does not relieve symptoms or you have a severe condition, surgery may be recommended. Surgical approaches include:
        
          Fasciotomy. An incision is made in your palm to divide the thickened tissue in the cord.
          Subtotal palmar fasciectomy. A zigzag incision is made along the creases in the hand to remove the abnormal tissue and cord. Occasionally, a skin graft may be needed to help the wound heal.
        
        You wear a splint on the repaired hand during recovery. People should expect some pain, stiffness, and swelling afterward. The length of recovery varies for each individual, and also with how many fingers were operated on and which ones.
        ""Most people largely recover by three months, but some may not feel fully recovered for quite a bit longer,"" says Dr. Blazar. Hand therapists can also help with strength and flexibility exercises to speed recovery.
        Most people's fingers move better after surgery. However, as with nonsurgical treatments, the contracture can come back, so some people may need additional surgery later on.",Matthew Solan,"May 3, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/sleeping-apart-good-for-your-sex-life,Sleeping apart: Good for your sex life?,"A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that one-third of respondents reported occasionally or regularly sleeping in separate rooms to accommodate a bed partner.

This may seem like a sign of a troubled relationship, but the practice is quite common and can lead to couples being happier and closer, according to Sharon Bober, associate professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and founding director of the Sexual Health Program at Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""Just because you don't always sleep in the same bed doesn't mean that you feel separated as a couple,"" she says.

Contributing issues

The main motivation behind separate sleeping is not about lack of physical desire or emotional intimacy, but simply the need for both people to get a good night's rest.

""Sharing a bed means you share the other person's sleep behavior,"" says Bober. ""If a person snores, grinds their teeth, thrashes and twitches, or gets up repeatedly at night, this can disrupt their partner's sleep, making partners more tired and irritable, which can strain the relationship.""

Other issues that could contribute to sleeping apart include environmental factors (one partner needs the bedroom to be cooler or warmer) and sleeping schedules (one might like to stay up later reading or watching TV, or might need to get up early).

""Getting restful sleep is essential for good health and a good sex life,"" says Bober. ""Sometimes sleeping in separate rooms, both people can sleep better and feel rested. Instead of resulting in something negative, this might allow for both partners to have more energy, better mood, and consequently more desire for sex.""

Pillow talk

Sometimes just one person expresses the desire to sleep separately, which can make their partner feel rejected and worry about their relationship.

""If either partner feels concerned about not sleeping in the same bed, the couple needs to talk about what might feel worrisome,"" says Bober. ""The conversation might reveal an issue not related to intimacy that has been lingering for a while.""

Before sleeping apart, another option may be to consider compromises that address the issues of disrupted sleep and are acceptable to both people.

For example, if your partner's snoring wakes you up, wear earplugs, use a bedside sound machine, or wear earbuds and listen to a podcast as you fall asleep. The snoring partner could try sleeping on their side or see a doctor to find out whether there's an underlying health problem, like sleep apnea.

Even when a couple agrees to a new sleeping arrangement, Bober suggests several strategies to enhance and maintain connection while also making the transition smoother for both partners:

Set a schedule. At first, agree to sleep apart during the week or on specific days when partners need the most rest, but choose to sleep together on the weekends and make adjustments as needed.

Make both sleeping spaces cozy. ""You both need a comfortable sleeping environment,"" says Bober. ""Make sure both people are happy with their sleeping space.""

Have a snuggle time. Before bedtime, spend time together in bed to snuggle, talk, read together, or have some romantic time; then, when it's time for sleep, move to your separate beds. You can also do the reverse: get in bed together in the morning and connect with coffee and conversation. ""This kind of flexibility can help couples continue to associate the bed with closeness, pleasure, and intimacy,"" says Bober.

Make a date for sex. Not sleeping together can interfere with spontaneous sex. If you and your partner are concerned about a declining sex life, schedule time for intimacy. ""This can create a sense of excitement and allow for anticipation,"" says Bober. To enhance the experience, tie your get-together to a date night or a romantic evening at home.

Nap together. Another idea is napping together during the day. ""Even a short nap together can help maintain the bedroom bonding and is something couples can do either on occasion or more regularly,"" says Bober.

Assess the arrangement regularly. Check in with each other every day to see what's working and what isn't. It's not good enough if sleeping separately feels helpful only for one person in the relationship. You can always go back to the drawing board and come up with a revised plan. Sleeping apart, either once in a while or more regularly, can be beneficial, if both partners are happy with the setup, sleep well, and continue to feel connected as a couple.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/10-habits-for-good-health,10 habits for good health,"The foundation of a healthy lifestyle consists of lasting habits like eating right, watching your weight, exercising regularly, managing your mental health, and getting routine medical exams. But even daily, small steps toward these goals also can have a significant impact.
        Here are some practices that can help support your ongoing health journey. While you might find it unrealistic to follow them all the time, try to include them in your daily life as much as possible.
        1. Do a morning stretch
        Stretching before getting out of bed wakes up the body, improves circulation, and promotes relaxation, helping to set the day's tone. While you're still lying in bed, move the covers aside, then flex and release your lower limbs several times. Bend your knees and lift your legs into the air. With your legs still elevated, flex your feet up and down and rotate them side to side. Next, sit up and slowly look left and then right. Roll your shoulders several times. Flex your wrists up and down, and open and close your hands repeatedly.
        2. Stay hydrated
        Proper hydration supports digestion, improves brain performance, and increases energy, among other health benefits. Drink a big glass of water after you wake up and a glass with every meal.
        3. Floss
        Maintaining good oral health includes daily flossing, but make sure you do it right. First, wrap the floss around your middle fingers, which helps you reach the back teeth. Then loop the floss around one side of a tooth, so it makes a C shape. Beginning at the gum line, slide it up and down the tooth several times. (Don't move the floss back and forth in a sawing motion. You miss cleaning the entire tooth, and the friction can irritate the gum.) Repeat on the other side of the tooth, and then the other teeth.
        4. Apply sunscreen
        Sunscreen is the best defense against skin-damaging rays. After washing your face in the morning, apply a facial moisturizer that contains sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Or blend equal parts sunscreen and a regular moisturizer. Use one or two nickel-sized dollops to cover your entire face, neck, ears, and any bald or thinning spots on your head.
        5. Go nuts
        When you crave a snack, reach for unsalted nuts and seeds like almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and cashews. They contain many beneficial nutrients and help prevent cravings for highly processed foods. Nuts are high in calories, so keep to a palm-sized portion.
        6. Nap
        Afternoon naps can recharge a weary body and may boost cognitive function. A study published online on Jan. 25, 2021, by General Psychiatry found that nappers scored higher on cognitive tests than non-nappers. The researchers found that shorter and less frequent naps — lasting less than 30 minutes, no more than four times a week — were associated with the most benefit. Schedule naps for the early afternoon, and use a timer so you don't oversleep.
        7. Bust some moves
        Break up bouts of sitting with small bursts of movement. For example, dance across a room instead of walking. When you brush your teeth, suck in your lower gut for 30 seconds, which activates your abdominal muscles. Do 10 air squats or push-ups (on the ground or against the kitchen counter). Make it a habit to stand up ""twice"" each time you stand up — that is, get up, sit back down, and then get back up.
        8. Take a breather
        Alternate-nostril breathing, in which you breathe through one nostril at a time, is believed to help reduce stress by slowing your breathing rhythm and forcing you to take deep, full breaths. Using a finger or thumb, close one nostril and slowly breathe in and out through the open nostril. After about five to 10 breaths, switch and close the other nostril and repeat the breathing pattern. For a variation, try inhaling through one nostril with the other closed, changing finger/thumb positions, and exhaling through the previously closed nostril. Then, inhale through that one, close it, and exhale through the other nostril. Go back and forth like this for a few minutes.
        9. Enjoy a hobby
        A study published online Sept. 11, 2023, by Nature Medicine suggests that having a hobby is good for people's overall health and mood. Hobbies involve creativity, sensory engagement, self-expression, relaxation, and cognitive stimulation. One way to pick up a new hobby is with a project kit designed to teach you a skill like gardening, building a model, carving wood, or making beer, soap, hot sauce, or jewelry. The kits come with instructions and all the materials you need to start. You can find kits at local bookstores or hobby stores, or go online: just type ""how-to kits"" or ""project kits"" into a search engine.
        10. Be social
        Social interactions can stave off loneliness and protect against depression and cognitive decline. Strive to have some kind of social engagement every day: make a phone call, send an email, or chat with a neighbor. Another option is to create your own social pod — a small, intimate group that you interact with regularly, like meeting for coffee or conversing over a Zoom call. Casual conversations are also helpful; for example, chat with a grocery store employee or interact with a stranger on the street.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/keto-diet-is-not-healthy-and-may-harm-the-heart,Keto diet is not healthy and may harm the heart,"The ketogenic (keto) diet — which is high in fat and protein and low in carbohydrates — doesn't meet standards for a healthy diet and may not be safe for some people with heart disease, according to a review in the March 2024 issue of Current Problems in Cardiology.
        The review summarized the current evidence on how keto diets may raise heart disease risk. While the diet may dramatically reduce fat mass and weight over the short term, there is scarce evidence for any long-term benefit. Ketogenic diets appear to lower blood levels of triglycerides but raise levels of artery-clogging LDL cholesterol. With respect to lowering blood sugar and blood pressure, the observed short-term benefits fade over time.
        The diet's extreme carbohydrate restrictions may lead people to shun most vegetables and fruits and consume large amounts of leafy greens. But the vitamin K in these foods may interfere with the anti-clotting drug warfarin taken by some heart patients. And drugs known as SGLT-2 inhibitors, which are used to treat diabetes and heart failure, may be incompatible with a keto diet, according to the review.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/hpv-infection-linked-to-higher-cardiovascular-risk,HPV infection linked to higher cardiovascular risk,"Women with high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) — a well-known cause of cervical cancer — may face a higher risk of dying from heart disease, new research suggests.
        Published online Feb. 7, 2024, by the European Heart Journal, the study included more than 163,000 young and middle-aged Korean women without heart disease. As part of a national health exam, they were screened for high-risk HPV and tracked for up to 17 years. After adjusting for factors that affect heart disease risk, researchers found that women infected with high-risk HPV were four times more likely to die of heart disease than uninfected women.
        Viral infections can trigger inflammation (a key player in heart disease), and that may explain the association, according to the study authors. But more research, including studies in men, are needed to confirm the findings. Vaccines against HPV — which is the most common sexually transmitted infection — are extremely effective for preventing cervical cancer. Future studies of these vaccines could also track heart-related outcomes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/caregiving-crisis,Caregiving crisis,"If a traditional caregiving scenario were captured on time-lapse video, Katherine Lyman contends that early scenes would depict an adult daughter accompanying her aging parent to a doctor's appointment looking ""put together"" and on top of things. Just a few years later, however, the daughter would appear drastically different — ""really disheveled, because she isn't taking care of herself.""
        ""I cannot tell you how many times I've leaned forward, looked the daughter in the eyes, and asked, 'How are you coping with all of this? What are you doing to let off steam? It's great that you're keeping all these plates spinning, but it comes at a cost,'"" recounts Lyman, a geriatric nurse practitioner at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Increasingly, that cost is caregivers' own health and well-being. Indeed, the story of caregiving in the United States is becoming something of a cautionary tale as troubling forces collide.
        More caregivers are on tap than ever, with 43 million Americans providing unpaid assistance to a family member or another loved one. Nearly three-quarters are 50 or older themselves, while more than 75% are women, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance. Meanwhile, an estimated 73 million Americans will be 65 or older by 2030, potentially fueling the need for additional caregivers.
        Longevity is perhaps the biggest contributor to the brewing storm, Harvard experts say. ""A lot of us are living into our late years and living very well and independently, but not all of us,"" Lyman says. ""Those years may come with increased infirmity or cognitive impairment, or both.""
        Spectrum of responsibilities
        As people age, several core issues tend to prompt the need for spouses, adult children, or others to step in to help. Let's dub the problem areas the three M's: mobility, memory, and medications. Yet caregiving is far from a one-size-fits-all proposition, with duties falling on a spectrum from occasional to relentless and minor to suffocating.
        ""It runs the gamut from actually living with the person to living in a different state and putting cameras in different rooms to check on them,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, clinical chief of gerontology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""Some caregivers come periodically, fill pill boxes, take people to doctor's appointments, or take them shopping. But caregiving can also be financial: paying the bills, organizing the taxes, or taking over as power of attorney.""
        Whether they're popping in a few times a week or handling daily bathing, dressing, and toileting — or something in between — caregivers often wear many hats, Lyman notes. ""You become not just their caregiver, but their confidante, psychiatrist, chef, grocery shopper, laundress, chauffeur, and pharmacist,"" she says.
        Health fallout
        Such comprehensive responsibilities can exact an underappreciated physical and mental toll — especially if your loved one's deterioration is prolonged — and create a downward spiral that affects both caregiver and recipient. Six in 10 caregivers work part or full-time, spreading themselves even thinner.
        Copious research has focused on the mental health fallout. Between 40% and 70% of caregivers deal with significant symptoms of depression. And those who are women fare worse than men who take on such duties, reporting higher levels of depression and anxiety.
        Similarly, a wide range of studies point to caregiving's physical consequences, especially pain. Caregivers are prone to headaches and often suffer back injuries or cope with arthritis, Dr. Salamon says.
        A Sept. 1, 2023, study published by The Gerontologist that gathered data from nearly 2,000 caregivers (average age 62) showed just over half suffered pain of some kind. About 30% said their pain limited the ways they could provide care.
        Caregivers also face an increased risk of heart disease, and women caring for a spouse are more likely to report having high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance.
        ""Many caregivers in their 50s, 60s, and 70s have their own health issues,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""It gets more stressful as time goes on and the patient and caregiver both get older.""
        About 10% of caregivers acknowledge their own health has suffered as a result of their responsibilities. But that doesn't mean they're vigilantly attending to it. Nearly three-quarters reported not having gone to a doctor as often as they should, while more than half had missed medical appointments, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance.
        ""People start losing weight, not eating properly, and not paying attention to themselves,"" Lyman says. ""Their health takes a back seat, and so do their interests.""
        
          
            
              
                How to rally the troops
                Even in large families, the lion's share of caregiving responsibilities often falls to one sibling when Mom or Dad is declining. But family members should recognize that the caregiver isn't a hero—and shouldn't be expected to perform like one.
                ""I don't think a lot of family members realize how stressful caregiving is, and they don't offer to help,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, clinical chief of gerontology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""They leave it to the caregiver to ask them, and that's not right. They need to wholeheartedly offer.""
                To smooth that process—and the sometimes-fraught dynamic between caregiver and other relatives—Harvard experts offer these tips:
                Call a family meeting. This can be held in person or over Zoom, ideally including the patient's doctor or a geriatric care manager. The best result: everyone gets on the same page about day-to-day problems and caregiving responsibilities that require attention.
                Create a schedule. This might include setting up a shared online calendar for family members to sign up for tasks and time periods to chip in.
                Rotate care. ""Set up a schedule so every day 'belongs' to a different child,"" Dr. Salamon suggests.
                Match people's tasks to their abilities. If your sister is a finance whiz, she's probably the right one to handle Dad's taxes. Your brother is a lawyer? Ask him to sort out the legal nuances of Mom's property sale.
                Be specific. If you're the caregiver, you may want two hours to go to a social event or appointment. Say so. ""It's very important to make your requests concrete, tell others exactly what you need, and do it in spite of any guilt,"" Dr. Salamon says.
                Ask how you can help. If you're not the main caregiver, can you take over one evening each week or stay for a weekend? Or perhaps you can coordinate services such as housecleaning, yard work, or transportation to medical appointments. Be explicit about what you can provide. ""Say, 'I can take Mom to the hairdresser on Wednesday afternoon,' or, 'I'm coming on Wednesday for two hours—why don't you take some time off?'"" Dr. Salamon says.
              
            
          
        
        Finding help
        Even as they feel the strain, caregivers are often loath to seek support. ""They're good at giving help, but lousy at asking for it,"" Lyman says.
        Still, it's crucial to make that leap. Harvard experts offer these strategies for caregivers to preserve body and soul:
        Look into respite care. Some assisted living or nursing facilities provide temporary care so family members can take a vacation. Adult day programs can provide a daily break. ""Sometimes they only run from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., but that can be huge,"" Lyman says. ""And some provide transportation.""
        Call your local Agency on Aging. Some offer housekeeping services to eligible older adults, while others coordinate volunteers who can pinch-hit and ""stay for a few hours so the caregiver can get out and be free for a little while,"" Dr. Salamon says.
        Sniff out informal help. ""Ask friends who drive if they can pick Mom up and bring her to the senior center or to her hair appointment,"" Lyman suggests.
        Explore houses of worship. Local religious groups may have cadres of helpers. ""Some have volunteers who pick up people who want to go to their service and take them home afterward,"" Lyman says.
        Consider therapy. Nearly four in 10 caregivers describe their responsibilities as emotionally stressful. Talking to a therapist can bring relief.
        Tap into telehealth. Schedule virtual visits with doctors or therapists to get the care you need. ""You don't have to leave Mom unattended,"" Lyman says. ""You can go into the next room and shut the door for a half-hour or hour.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-the-difference-between-age-spots-and-sun-spots,What's the difference between age spots and sun spots?,"Q.
          I have a couple of brown skin patches that look like age spots. But my friend says they might be sun spots, which can develop into skin cancer. How can I tell the difference?
        
        A. It's an important question, since distinguishing sun spots from age spots — or ""liver"" spots, as our grandmothers called them — can help us determine when to seek a doctor's evaluation. Both spots tend to appear on areas that get a lot of sun exposure, such as the face, hands, arms, and shoulders.
        The color of age spots ranges from pink to tan to brown. They're bigger than freckles and usually oval-shaped. They're often found in clusters. Age spots can be unsightly, but they are harmless.
        Sun spots, known medically as actinic keratoses, come in a variety of colors. The biggest difference between harmless age spots and sun spots (actinic keratoses) is the texture. Age spots are smooth and flat, but potentially dangerous actinic keratoses usually feel rough and scaly. Actinic keratoses can develop into skin cancer, so it's vital that you show any such spots to your doctor. And if you're in doubt about any type of skin changes, it's also wise to point those out.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/the-latest-thinking-on-drinking,The latest thinking on drinking,"If your Dry January quickly turned damp and later splashed into nightly cocktails on the patio, you probably weren't enthused by a recent analysis suggesting women's risks of dying early rise markedly when we drink an average of just under two alcoholic beverages a day.
        But perhaps another recent study made you nod with satisfaction — one suggesting alcohol lowers the risk of heart attack and stroke by improving stress signaling in the brain.
        What to believe? Not what the headlines blare, since most scientific evidence surrounding alcohol's health effects is decidedly weak, Harvard experts say. Tracking it — and gleaning useful insights into how we should shape our drinking habits — is not unlike watching an annoying ping-pong match. One day, drinking is touted as beneficial; the next, it's terrible. Back and forth, back and forth, until you want to ignore it all.
        ""Everything that comes out seems to capture our attention, but the evidence has always been prone to being misunderstood or misinterpreted,"" says Dr. Kenneth Mukamal, an internist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who studies how alcohol and other lifestyle factors affect health. ""With this yo-yo effect, every new study seems important, because we don't have strong evidence. It makes people's heads explode.""
        Research holes
        For context, here's how drinking levels are categorized. A standard drink equals 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits, a 12-ounce beer, or a 5-ounce glass of wine. The CDC defines moderate drinking as one standard drink or less per day for women and two drinks or less for men. Heavy drinking is eight or more drinks a week for women and 15 or more per week for men.
        But while those amounts seem clear, the related research is anything but. Part of the problem is that alcohol's health effects have never been studied in what's considered a scientifically rigorous way.
        ""There's never been a large-scale randomized controlled trial that's tested how reducing or increasing alcohol intake affects health,"" says Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. This gold-standard study design would pit one scenario directly against the other, rather than rely on observations that could be influenced by extraneous factors.
        Another conundrum is that drinking and other lifestyle habits that influence health, like exercise, sleep, and social connectedness, can't easily be teased apart in study findings. The 2023 research review suggesting women's risks of dying early rise significantly from consuming just under two alcoholic drinks a day was intended to correct some of those design flaws. That study's authors said earlier analyses didn't point out that people considered light or moderate drinkers tend to have other healthy habits that improve their overall health — making it appear that alcohol contributes to good health outcomes. Conversely, ""nondrinkers"" in study comparison groups have often included people who once drank and quit because of addiction or other health problems. This factor skewed study findings to suggest drinking moderately was healthier than not drinking at all.
        ""We now understand those findings were likely spurious,"" Dr. Manson says.
        Breast cancer caveat
        One of the more robust findings involving alcohol's effects on health pertains specifically to women: drinking has been convincingly linked to developing breast cancer, as well as other cancers.
        A 2021 report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer estimated that alcohol accounts for about 4% of newly diagnosed cancers globally — most commonly those of the breast, esophagus, and liver. And breast cancers accounted for almost half of the more than 23,000 new cancer diagnoses in Europe traceable to light-to-moderate drinking in 2017, according to a January 2023 study in The Lancet Public Health.
        While the number of women who develop breast cancer every year due solely to alcohol is small, it's something we should consider before we imbibe. ""The alcohol–breast cancer link is among the strongest evidence we have,"" Dr. Mukamal says. ""Women who drink alcohol have higher levels of sex hormones like estrogen. If you're prone to breast cancer, this feeds it in a way it wouldn't if you weren't drinking.""
        Any woman concerned about her breast cancer risk — or whose mother, sister, or daughter has had the disease — should consider reducing or eliminating alcohol, says Dr. Manson, who is also a professor of medicine and women's health at Harvard Medical School. ""It would be a strategy to mitigate risk,"" she says.

                How do you know if you need to quit drinking?
                If you reach for a drink just to feel normal, alarm bells should be ringing. That's a clear sign alcohol is more than just an enjoyable pursuit — it's a problem, says Dr. Robert Doyle, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
                But many warning signs that suggest you stop drinking are more subtle, and it's common to slide into alcohol misuse by gradually drinking more and more without realizing it's excessive, Dr. Doyle says.
                ""A person who develops alcohol use disorder tends to be someone who, early on, is able to handle their alcohol,"" he says. ""They don't seem to get drunk so easily, but then they start to drink more and their body becomes accustomed to it. It tends to sneak up on them.""
                Watch for these other signs that suggest you are drinking too much:
                You crave alcohol to feel relaxed. People with alcohol use disorder often say that's why they drink, but they're usually imbibing to avoid the physical symptoms of withdrawal.
                You drink alone. ""You're wanting to just drink instead of socialize,"" Dr. Doyle says.
                Your job or relationships have suffered. ""You might miss work because you pass out and oversleep,"" he says, ""or you're not meeting your obligations because of your drinking.""
                You hide your drinking. That might mean drinking in secret or concealing bottles around your home.
                You drive after drinking. ""The wake-up call is getting pulled over for a DUI or the threat of it,"" he says.
                Your family tells you you've got a problem. ""Pay attention to what they say, or ask your family, 'Do you think I overdo it?' Tell them you won't be mad at them for being honest,"" Dr. Doyle suggests. ""Family members usually have your best interests at heart.""
                If you realize you need help to quit, ask your doctor how to get started. ""Therapists and primary care doctors are all trained to recognize alcohol use disorder and help people find appropriate treatment,"" Dr. Doyle says.
              
            
          
        
        The bottom line
        Where does this leave us? There's no perfect answer. But if you're healthy and already drink lightly or moderately, it's probably fine to continue to do so, Dr. Manson says — with some caveats.
        ""If someone drinks moderately and they're doing well, I don't push them to stop. If, however, they ask whether they should start to drink, or should drink more, to improve their health, the answer would be an emphatic no,"" Dr. Manson says.
        ""Many people find that drinking moderately reduces their stress. It's something they enjoy,"" she adds. ""But it shouldn't be perceived as a health-promoting activity.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/certain-exercises-may-offer-effective-treatment-for-depression,Certain exercises may offer effective treatment for depression,"Regular exercise is known to help manage symptoms of depression. But which types of exercise are most effective? An analysis of 215 studies published online Feb. 14, 2024, by The BMJ compared how several different forms of exercise help with depression. The options included walking, running, yoga, tai chi, qi gong, aerobic exercise, and strength training. The researchers also looked at the effectiveness of exercise when combined with therapy and antidepressants.
        The study found that for people using exercise as the only treatment for depression, the most effective types were walking, running, yoga, strength training, and dancing. Among people who combined exercise with talk therapy, the standouts were yoga, tai chi, and aerobic exercise, especially for men and older adults. People who took antidepressants and did any form of exercise fared better than those who only took medication.
        The researchers noted that while higher-intensity exercise was most helpful for depression, any consistent exercise is better than none. It also didn't matter how long people exercised during a typical workout or if they exercised only once a week or more.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/noise-exposure-may-raise-risks-of-cardiovascular-problems,Noise exposure may raise risks of cardiovascular problems,"Long-term exposure to transportation noise from cars, trucks, trains, and planes may raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, a new study suggests.
        The Harvard-led analysis, published online Dec. 4, 2023, by Environmental Health Perspectives, evaluated three decades of data from 114,116 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. Using a geospatial noise model created by the National Park Service — which estimates noise levels in various locations using data gathered from monitoring sites across the United States — researchers assessed the connection between noise levels where participants lived and their incidence of cardiovascular disease.
        Researchers found that the more transportation noise participants were exposed to long-term, the higher their cardiovascular disease risk. Each four-decibel increase in noise over a baseline level was associated with about a 4% increase in cardiovascular problems such as coronary artery disease and stroke. Earlier studies also linked noise exposure to short-term changes in circulation, including blood pressure, heart rate, and blood vessel narrowing, study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/surprising-symptoms-of-chronic-heartburn,Surprising symptoms of chronic heartburn,"With a name like heartburn, it's easy to assume that the condition always shows up as a fiery feeling in your chest or stomach. While that's certainly the classic symptom, chronic heartburn can also make its presence known in other ways, such as a tingling feeling in the nose, chest pressure, a bitter or metallic taste, a hoarse voice, tooth damage, or a dry cough.
        What's the link between these symptoms and that spicy spaghetti you had for dinner? Stomach acid. It can leak up into the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. Chronic leakage is a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is responsible for symptoms that you might mistake for other conditions.
        Heart symptoms
        Sometimes acid reflux irritates the upper part of the stomach or the esophagus, which can cause chest pain or pressure, mimicking pain from a partial blockage in a heart artery or even a heart attack.
        What you should do. If you're worried about sudden pain in your chest, don't try to figure out if it's heartburn. ""This is especially true for people with heart disease risk factors,"" says Dr. Christopher Cannon, a cardiologist and editor in chief of the Harvard Heart Letter.
        But discerning the difference between heartburn and heart problems is complicated, and it's best to talk to a doctor about it.
        ""Chest pain can come from many causes, like acid reflux, but also stress, lung irritation, or muscle aches,"" Dr. Cannon says. ""We have to consider your heart disease risk factors. For example, do you have high blood pressure or diabetes? Does the pain come with exercise? Those could all point to heart trouble, and we might order tests. If the pain comes when you lie down after eating a heavy meal, and taking an antacid makes it better, then it's likely heartburn.""
        
          
            
              
                Lifestyle strategies to combat heartburn
                Lifestyle habits are an important part of thwarting heartburn. Try as many of the following as possible:
                
                  Avoid foods and drinks that seem to trigger heartburn symptoms, such as anything spicy, fatty, fried, greasy, or acidic (like tomato sauces or citrus); foods with onions or garlic; alcohol; soda; and anything with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or chocolate.
                  Eat smaller meals.
                  Stay upright for at least two hours after meals.
                  Avoid late-night eating or drinking (especially alcohol).
                  Sleep on a wedge pillow.
                  Quit smoking.
                  Lose weight if you need to.
                
              
            
          
        
        Nose or throat symptoms
        In GERD, stomach acid can get up high in the throat and even the area behind the nose, triggering a number of potential symptoms.
        ""The upper airway isn't built to have the same protections as the stomach or esophagus, so when reflux comes up, it causes injury, almost like a low-level chemical burn. It can cause a dry cough, a sore throat, a hoarse voice, a feeling like there's a lump or mucus plug in the back of the throat, or a tingling feeling in the nose,"" says Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya, an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ENT) at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        Because these symptoms overlap with many other conditions, such as a cold or allergies, it can be a long time before you recognize that you have GERD.
        What you should do: If you suspect GERD might be causing your symptoms, talk to your primary care provider or an ENT. ""We usually recommend that someone go on a four-week trial of heartburn medications, such as over-the-counter omeprazole, and make temporary lifestyle changes to avoid heartburn triggers,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. (See ""Lifestyle strategies to combat heartburn."")
        ""If symptoms improve after four weeks, it's a good indicator that you probably have reflux disease,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says.
        Mouth or dental symptoms
        For some people, GERD symptoms might seem more like mouth or dental problems.
        ""If the acid reaches your mouth, you might develop mouth sores or ulcers, erosion or wear on your teeth, or cavities. The cavities could be due to the acid, sugary heartburn medications, your diet, poor oral hygiene, or a combination of those factors,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, a prosthodontist in the Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Acid reflux can also create a bitter or metallic taste in the mouth.
        What you should do. If you suspect that acid reflux is reaching your mouth, rinse frequently with water to neutralize it and protect your gums, soft tissues, and teeth. ""Wait 30 minutes after meals or after detecting reflux to brush your teeth. This allows your saliva — and water that you rinse with or drink — to neutralize the mouth's acidity,"" Dr. Jiang says. ""Just before brushing, rinse with water to eliminate the acid first, so you don't accidentally brush the acid against your teeth and cause more extensive wear. And get your teeth cleaned at least twice a year.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/trending-now-home-sleep-tests,Trending now: Home sleep tests,"Want to find out if the snoring, gasping, or choking sounds you're making during sleep are actually signs of obstructive sleep apnea? Until recently, you would have had to go to a sleep lab, get hooked up to dozens of sensors, and spend the night. Now, thanks to the miniaturization of sophisticated technology, you can conduct a basic sleep test in your own bed. ""Home sleep tests are often the preferred approach to detect sleep apnea, not just by doctors, but also by insurance companies. Many are no longer covering in-lab studies, which cost thousands of dollars. A home sleep test costs a few hundred dollars, and it's usually covered,"" says Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        However, she cautions that you can't always rely on results from a home test.
        What's involved?
        You need a prescription for a home sleep test. You can talk to your primary care physician or a sleep specialist about it. Or you can order a home sleep test online from any number of companies. You visit a company's website, purchase the test, and talk to a company-affiliated doctor via telemedicine. The doctor can prescribe the test if it's right for you.
        Dr. Javaheri has reservations about arranging a test online. ""You won't know if it's the best-quality sleep test or the best interpretation of the results. A lot of those companies just send a standardized blurb about the results,"" she says.
        Taking the test
        Either you will pick up your test from your doctor's office or the test will be delivered to you. It involves wearing a few small sensors overnight, typically
        
          a nasal cannula, a loop of thin tubing worn under the nose to measure your breathing patterns
          a pulse oximeter, a small gadget placed on the finger to measure oxygen levels in your blood
          a chest strap, an adjustable belt that measures the effort or movement your body is making to breathe.
          Each of those sensors plugs into a small data monitor, which is worn on the chest strap.
        
        A newer type of home sleep test has even less equipment. The data recorder is worn on the wrist, like a watch. It connects to a pulse oximeter and a small chest sensor. The chest sensor measures breathing effort and snoring sounds.
        Test results
        While it's not as detailed or as accurate as an in-lab sleep study, a high-quality home sleep test yields fairly reliable results. ""You have an 80% chance that the test will be right,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""But we compare the results with your symptoms to help make sure the results are accurate and to determine the best treatment options.""
        If the test results don't match your symptoms—for example, if you have sleep apnea symptoms and a negative test result — your doctor will have to investigate further. ""We'll look at the context of the results and the circumstances of the test. It could be that you had nasal congestion on the night of the test, you were breathing through your mouth, and the nasal sensor didn't pick that up,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""If we have strong suspicions that you have sleep apnea, we'll need to schedule an in-lab study.""
        
          
            
              
                What is obstructive sleep apnea?
                
                  
                
                Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition marked by 10- to 30-second pauses in breathing during sleep. Those pauses are called apneas and can occur hundreds of times per night. The breathing disruptions occur when the airway in your nose or throat becomes partially or completely blocked by large tonsils, a large tongue, or too much tissue in the airway. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, daytime sleepiness, and car accidents.

        Should you consider a home test?
        The tests aren't for everyone. People with a serious chronic condition, such as heart failure or a breathing disorder, may need additional data from an in-lab study to help determine treatment. For people who don't have serious chronic conditions, a home sleep test can be a game changer.
        ""If you have a straightforward case, it's the best way to go,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""It's cost-effective, and it's more comfortable than an in-lab study. And since you are doing the test at home, it is more likely to capture your natural sleep habits.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-lowdown-on-a-low-heart-rate,The lowdown on a low heart rate,"The steady beat of your heart depends on a tiny cluster of cells located in the upper right chamber of your heart. Known as the sinoatrial node or sinus node, these cells generate a tiny jolt of electricity that triggers the heart to contract and pump blood throughout the body. Because the sinus node sets the heart's pace and rhythm, it's often referred to as the body's natural pacemaker. But several ""backup generators"" elsewhere in the heart can keep this vital system functioning (see illustration).
        A normal heart rate ranges between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm), although it may drop as low as 40 during deep sleep. A heart rate below 60 bpm during the day is considered a low heart rate, or what doctors call bradycardia.
        If your heart rate is low and you don't have any symptoms, there's no reason to worry. But if you do have symptoms — such as feeling dizzy, lightheaded, fatigued, breathless, or confused, or if you faint — seek medical care right away. Here's the lowdown on the possible causes of bradycardia and how it's diagnosed and treated.
        
          
            
              
                The heart's electrical conduction system
                
                  
                
                The sinoatrial (SA) node emits tiny electrical impulses that signal the atria to contract, filling the ventricles with blood. The atrioventricular (AV) node, located between the right atrium and ventricles, conducts the electrical signal from the atria to the ventricles. The ventricles then contract, pumping blood into the circulation.
                A low heart rate (bradycardia) can occur if the SA node falters. When that happens, the AV node takes over and maintains a heart rate of about 50 to 60 beats per minute. If the electrical signals passing through this area are slowed or blocked, it's known as AV block or heart block.
                Next in the conduction pathway are the left and right bundle branches, which are the final signals telling the ventricles to contract. If all those backups fail, the heart muscle may still contract, but only about 20 to 40 beats per minute — too slow to provide enough blood to the brain.

        What causes a low heart rate?
        ""The most common cause of bradycardia is age-related degenerative changes in the heart's conduction system,"" says Dr. Matthew Yuyun, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Just as your skin, joints, and other parts of your body reveal signs of wear and tear as you age, so too can the structures inside your heart. It's why bradycardia that requires treatment is more common in older adults, usually after age 70.
        Other heart-related issues can leave people more prone to bradycardia. They include a previous heart attack, heart failure, a heart procedure (such as bypass surgery or a valve replacement), or heart inflammation caused by an infection, says Dr. Yuyun. One example is Lyme disease, a tick-borne infection common in New England that, if left untreated, can infiltrate heart tissue and interfere with electrical signals.
        Other problems that can cause bradycardia include
        
          repeated breathing pauses during sleep (obstructive sleep apnea)
          low thyroid function (hypothyroidism)
          an imbalance of minerals in the blood, such as potassium or calcium
          certain medications, such as blood pressure drugs (especially beta blockers), sedatives, and opioids
          diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and hemochromatosis.
        
        However, in athletes and very physically active people, a low heart rate, even down to 45 bpm, is perfectly normal. ""Regular exercise makes the heart stronger and more efficient,"" says Dr. Yuyun. Because each beat delivers more blood to the body, the heart doesn't need to beat as quickly, he adds.
        Diagnosis and treatment
        Because episodes of bradycardia may come and go, a brief measurement of the heart's electrical activity (an electrocardiogram) may not pick up the problem. Instead, people often need to wear a portable heart monitor that records the heart's rate and rhythm for at least a day and sometimes several weeks.
        Treatment depends on the cause and severity. Addressing the underlying condition or adjusting medications some-times helps. In other cases, people need a pacemaker, a small battery-powered device that sends pulses of electricity through wires to your heart.
        Irreversible damage to the heart's electrical system requires a permanent pacemaker. These devices, which are placed during a minor surgical procedure, are programmed to stimulate your heart as needed to keep it beating normally. Most are implanted under the skin in the upper chest, but some people receive a tiny wireless device the size of a vitamin pill that is inserted in the right side of the heart.",Julie Corliss,"May 1, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/taming-high-triglycerides,Taming high triglycerides,"When you get a cholesterol test (also known as a lipid panel or lipid profile), the most important value is your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, sometimes called ""bad"" cholesterol. High LDL levels track closely with the artery-clogging process at the root of most heart disease. But a lipid panel also reveals your blood level of triglycerides, which are the most common form of fat both in food and in your bloodstream. Because levels rise after you eat, triglycerides need to be measured after at least eight hours of fasting to get an accurate reading for treatment decisions. When and why should you pay attention to your triglyceride value?
        For healthy adults, a normal level is less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), but 25% to 30% of Americans have values that exceed that level. Values of 151 to 200 mg/dL are borderline high; those 201 to 499 are high, and those 500 and higher are very high.
        When does risk start to rise?
        Many studies have linked high triglycerides to a heightened risk of heart disease. ""But when you adjust for having related problems, such as obesity or type 2 diabetes, the association isn't quite as strong,"" says Dr. Nicholas Marston, a preventive cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Still, a recent study found that the risk of heart-related problems starts to rise at triglyceride levels greater than 89 mg/dL — far lower than the 150 mg/dL value long considered to be normal. The study, published Feb. 6, 2024, in the Journal of the American Heart Association, included more than 14,000 Italian adults who were followed for an average of just over 11 years.
        How to lower triglycerides
        The good news is that lifestyle changes can have a big impact on triglyceride levels.
        ""If people with high triglycerides eat a healthier diet, exercise regularly, and lose weight, they can lower their levels by more than 50%,"" says Dr. Marston. These tips can help:
        Choose carbs wisely. Cut back on easily digested carbohydrates like white bread, white rice, chips, sugar-laden breakfast cereals, and anything else — including beverages — with a lot of added sugar.
        Watch fats. Cut back on saturated fats from meat and butter, which can elevate triglycerides. Try to eat more unsaturated fats from plants, oils, and fish, which bring down triglycerides.
        Avoid excess alcohol. Moderate drinking (one drink per day for women, two for men) may be reasonable. But less is better if your triglycerides are high.
        Get moving. Regular exercise lowers triglycerides.
        Aim for a healthy weight. If you qualify as obese or overweight, reaching a healthy body weight can drive your triglycerides down to a normal range. Dropping even just 5% to 10% of your weight can help.
        Medication for high triglycerides
        Anyone with a triglyceride level of 150 to 499 should be checked and treated for any underlying health problems that might be to blame, including diabetes, obesity, a low thyroid level (hypothyroidism), and liver or kidney disease. But when triglycerides remain high after addressing these issues and making lifestyle changes, medication may be a good idea, especially for people at risk for cardiovascular disease.
        Many people in this category are already taking a cholesterol-lowering statin, which lowers triglycerides by about 30%. Drugs known as fibrates, including fenofibrate (Antara, TriCor, others) and gemfibrozil (Lopid) lower triglyceride levels by about 50%, but they do not lower the risk of heart attack or stroke when added to a statin. Icosapent ethyl (Vascepa), which contains a highly purified form of a specific fat in fish oil, lowers triglycerides by about 30%. And when people with diabetes or heart disease take icosapent ethyl with a statin, it lowers their risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from cardiac causes by about 25%.
        On the horizon
        Very high triglyceride levels (500 mg/dL and above) sometimes have a genetic component. An extreme example is familial hyperchylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), which affects just one to two in a million people. These people — whose blood appears milky from the high fat levels — are prone to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Serious cases can be life-threatening. Two investigational drugs, plozasiran and olezarsen, are RNA-targeted therapies that put the brakes on a protein that controls triglyceride metabolism. Both drugs lower triglyceride levels dramatically and eliminate the risk of pancreatitis, says Dr. Marston. These drugs may also prove helpful for treating people with moderately elevated triglycerides levels, he adds.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sleep-and-brain-health-whats-the-connection,Sleep and brain health: What's the connection?,"Asleep shortfall doesn't just make you feel groggy and grumpy the next day. Over time, insufficient sleep can harm your cardiovascular health. The evidence is so compelling that the American Heart Association (AHA) added healthy sleep duration to its ""Life's Essential 8"" recommendations to lower heart attack and stroke risk.
        Adults should strive for seven to nine hours of sleep each night. But the quality of your sleep is also important, says Dr. Susan Redline, the Peter C. Farrell professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School. Various sleep problems can cause disrupted or fragmented sleep (see ""What's sabotaging your sleep?"").
        ""Even if you sleep for at least seven hours, sleep disruptions can prevent you from getting enough deep sleep and may also cause unhealthy blood pressure surges,"" says Dr. Redline. Those problems may increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease and cognitive issues, according to a scientific statement by the AHA published in the March 2024 issue of the journal Stroke. Cerebro­vascular disease includes conditions that affect the brain's blood vessels, including ""silent"" strokes, which go unrecognized.
        
          
            
              
                What's sabotaging your sleep?
                These disorders can affect not only the duration but also the depth and continuity of sleep.
                Insomnia refers to the inability to fall or stay asleep, which is commonly linked to stress or anxiety. Other possible sleep disrupters include painful medical conditions; caffeine or alcohol use; and environmental factors such as light, noise, an uncomfortable bed, or a room that's too hot or cold.
                Obstructive sleep apnea is marked by repeated pauses in breathing caused by narrowing of the throat during sleep, which can lead to drops in oxygen levels and to multiple awakenings throughout the night.
                Periodic limb movement disorder is characterized by involuntary jerking or twitching movements in the legs during sleep.
                For more information, see Harvard Health Publishing's Special Health Report Improving Sleep.
              
            
          
        
        Why deep sleep is vital
        Over the course of the night, people cycle through different phases of sleep, spending about a quarter of the time in deep (slow-wave) sleep — a phase that's vital to restoring energy and supporting memory, says Dr. Redline, who co-authored the AHA statement. Blood pressure and heart rate are at their lowest point during deep sleep. Meanwhile, the brain's housekeeping system — a series of channels called the glymphatic system, which drains cerebrospinal fluid — flushes away toxins, including beta-amyloid and other proteins linked to Alzheimer's disease.
        When people don't get sufficient amounts of deep sleep, blood pressure may not decline as it should. This can trigger activity in cells in blood vessel walls and activate damaging inflammation. The glymphatic system, whose function depends on healthy brain blood vessels, may falter.
        Foiled by fragmented sleep?
        Brief awakenings during the night, especially those caused by sleep apnea, can cause surges in the hormone epinephrine and raise blood pressure, a problem known as nocturnal hypertension. ""These blood pressure elevations can leave people at risk for cerebrovascular problems,"" says Dr. Redline. Small blood vessels deep in the brain may be damaged by tiny clots or microbleeds, causing so-called silent strokes, which cause no noticeable symptoms. But a series of such strokes over time can lead to a condition known as multi-infarct dementia.
        What you can do
        If you don't feel rested and refreshed when you wake up in the morning despite getting at least seven hours of sleep, you might have a sleep disorder. Talk to your doctor for help identifying and addressing the problem, Dr. Redline advises. If your bed partner or family member says you snore loudly, see ""Should you be tested for sleep apnea?"" in the May 2023 Heart Letter.
        Even if you don't think you have insomnia, you might be experiencing frequent, brief awakenings without noticing them. Wearable devices (monitors worn on the wrist or finger) feature apps that measure sleep efficiency. The data may provide clues about brief awakenings as well as limb movements during sleep, says Dr. Redline.
        Make an effort to follow all the steps in Life's Essential 8, which are closely interrelated. ""Think of sleep as one of the vital habits that helps reinforce all the other healthy practices,"" says Dr. Redline.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/repairing-a-thoracic-aneurysm,Repairing a thoracic aneurysm,"Q.
          I have a thoracic aortic aneurysm that was discovered nearly five years ago. I've been getting yearly scans to monitor the size, and so far, it seems to be growing very slowly. But if it reaches a certain size, my cardiologist says I might need surgery. Are there any less invasive options to fix this problem?
        
        A. Yes, some aortic aneurysms can be repaired with a nonsurgical procedure known as endovascular repair. However, the most appropriate treatment for an aortic aneurysm depends on not only the size but also the location of the aneurysm, as well as your age, overall health, and whether you've had any previous heart surgeries.
        An aortic aneurysm is a weakened area in the wall of the aorta, the main pipeline for blood from the heart to the body. The section that curves out of the heart, the thoracic aorta, ends at the diaphragm, which separates the chest (a region known medically as the thorax) from the abdomen. Thoracic aneurysms can occur in the section closest to the heart (ascending aorta) or the straight section after the curved arch (descending aorta). Most occur in people with risk factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol. But some ascending aortic aneurysms occur in younger people with connective tissue disorders or a bicuspid aortic valve, in which the valve has two flaps instead of three.
        Thoracic aortic aneurysms that stay small and stable are relatively harmless. But those that grow too large may bulge outward and rupture, which can lead to catastrophic bleeding. The size threshold for recommending a repair varies depending on the person.
        Aneurysms in the descending aorta can sometimes be repaired with an endovascular stent graft (a tube made from a special fabric). For this procedure, the doctor inserts the folded graft through a tiny cut in a blood vessel at the top of the thigh, threads it up the aorta to the bulging section, and unfolds it. According to my colleague Dr. Eric Isselbacher, co-director of the Thoracic Aortic Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, this approach is much more technically challenging for aneurysms in the ascending aorta. As he explains, the graft needs to be snugly attached to the wall of the aorta where it arises from the heart, but this is where blood flow is most forceful. There are also other anatomical challenges, including the curve of the aorta and the coronary arteries that branch out from it. In the future, endovascular techniques may evolve to address those challenges. But for now, aneurysms in the ascending aorta need to be repaired with open heart surgery, in which the surgeon replaces the bulging part of the aorta with a graft and sews it into place.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/how-to-thaw-a-frozen-shoulder,How to thaw a frozen shoulder,"Frozen shoulder, or adhesive capsulitis, occurs when inflammation and scar tissue invade the shoulder joint. In some cases, frozen shoulder starts with inflammation of the joint and leads to scarring. In other cases, the scarring occurs with little inflammation.
        Symptoms of a frozen shoulder include:
        
          stiffness that worsens at first, but gradually begins to improve over time
          dull, aching pain that increases as the disease progresses, and may worsen when you move your arm.
        
        Although the exact cause of frozen shoulder isn't clear, it is more common in people with conditions like diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and thyroid disease. Frozen shoulder can also develop after the shoulder has been immobilized for a long period of time — for example, following an injury, a stroke, or surgery. It is more common in women than men, and affects between 2% and 5% of people.
        Frozen shoulder typically progresses through three stages. The duration of each stage varies from person to person.
        Stage 1: Freezing. The shoulder becomes inflamed and the shoulder capsule progressively shrinks, leading to increasing pain and stiffness. This stage can last from two to nine months.
        Stage 2: Frozen. The shoulder remains stiff, limiting range of motion. However, the pain begins to recede. This stage lasts from four to six months.
        Stage 3: Thaw. The stiffness improves, and more motion is gradually gained in the shoulder. Most of the time the condition gets better on its own, yet it can take between six months and two years to fully regain movement and function in the affected shoulder.
        Treatment goals for frozen shoulder are straightforward: improve range of motion and reduce pain. Doctors often recommend a corticosteroid injection into the shoulder.
        While physical therapy is usually recommended, results of studies looking at long-term outcome have been mixed. The right balance of physical therapy is crucial. Too much stretching can worsen the condition, while too little will allow it to continue. Often, physical therapists will start with stretches that are very gentle and brief (one to five seconds), and then slowly progress to muscle strengthening and mobility exercises as the shoulder condition improves. The therapist also can provide specific instruction on how to safely stretch at home.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-and-why-to-fit-more-fiber-and-fermented-food-into-your-meals-202404263036,How — and why — to fit more fiber and fermented food into your meals,"An F may mean failure in school, but the letter earns high marks in your diet. The two biggest dietary Fs — fiber and fermented foods — are top priorities to help maintain healthy digestion, and they potentially offer much more. How can you fit these nutrients into meals? Can this help your overall health as well as gut health?
        Fiber, fermented foods, and the gut microbiome
        The gut microbiome is a composed of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms living in the colon (large intestine). What you eat, the air you breathe, where you live, and many other factors affect the makeup of the gut microbiome. Some experts think of it as a hidden organ because it has a role in many important functions of the body — for example, helping the immune system function optimally, reducing chronic inflammation, keeping intestinal cells healthy, and providing some essential micronutrients that may not be included in a regular diet.
        Your gut communicates with your brain through pathways in the gut-brain axis. Changes in the gut microbiome have been linked with mood and mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. However, it's not yet clear that these changes directly cause these types of problems.
        We do know that a healthy diet low in processed foods is key to a healthy gut microbiome. And increasing evidence suggests that fiber and fermented foods can play important parts here.
        Fiber 101
        Fiber's main job is to make digestion smoother by softening and adding bulk to stool, making it pass quickly through the intestines.
        But fiber has other benefits for your microbiome and overall health. A high-fiber diet helps keep body weight under control and lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Research has found that eating enough fiber reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.
        What to know about fiber
        There are two types of fiber: insoluble (which helps you feel full and encourages regular bowel movements) and soluble (which helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar). However, recent research suggests people should focus on the total amount of fiber in their diet, rather than type of fiber.
        If you're trying to add more foods with fiber to your diet, make sure you ease into new fiber-rich habits and drink plenty of water. Your digestive system must adapt slowly to avoid gas, bloating, diarrhea, and stomach cramps caused by eating too much too soon. Your body will gradually adjust to increasing fiber after a week or so.
        How much fiber do you need?
        The fiber formula is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories consumed. Your specific calorie intake can vary depending on your activity levels.
        ""But instead of tracking daily fiber, focus on adding more servings of fiber-rich foods to your diet,"" says Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        Which foods are high in fiber?
        Fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are all high in fiber. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans has a comprehensive list of fiber-rich foods and their calorie counts.
        What about over-the-counter fiber supplements that come in capsules, powders that you mix with water, and chewable tablets? ""If you have trouble eating enough fiber-rich foods, then these occasionally can be used, and there is no evidence they are harmful,"" says Rimm. ""But they should not serve as your primary source of dietary fiber.""
        Fermented foods 101
        Fermented foods contain both prebiotics — ingredients that create healthy changes in the microbiome — and beneficial live bacteria called probiotics. Both prebiotics and probiotics help maintain a healthy gut microbiome.
        What to know about fermented foods
        Besides helping with digestion and absorbing vital nutrients from food, a healthy gut supports your immune system to help fight infections and protect against inflammation. Some research suggests that certain probiotics help relieve symptoms of gut-related conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, though not all experts agree with this.
        Many foods that are fermented undergo lacto-fermentation, in which natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food, creating lactic acid. Not only does this process remove simple sugars, it creates various species of good bacteria, such as Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium. (Keep in mind that some foods undergo steps that remove probiotics and other healthful microbes, as with beer or wine, or make them inactive, like baking and canning.)
        The exact amounts and specific strains of bacteria in fermented foods vary depending on how they are made. In addition to probiotics, fermented foods may contain other valuable nutrients like enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids.
        How often should you eat fermented foods?
        There is no recommended daily allowance for prebiotics or probiotics, so it is impossible to know precisely which fermented foods or quantities are best. The general guideline is to add more to your daily diet.
        Which fermented foods should you choose?
        Fermented foods have a range of tastes and textures because of the particular bacteria they produce during fermentation or that are added to foods. Yogurt is one of the most popular fermented foods (look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label). Still, many options are available if you are not a yogurt fan or want to expand your fermented choices. Kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, and pickles are a few examples.
        As with fiber, probiotics are also marketed as over-the-counter supplements. However, like all dietary supplements, they do not require FDA approval, so there is no guarantee that the types of bacteria listed on a label can provide the promised benefits — or are even in the bottle. ""Therefore, it is best to get your probiotics from fermented foods,"" says Rimm.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-blood-sugar-monitoring-without-diabetes-worthwhile-202106112473,Is blood sugar monitoring without diabetes worthwhile?,"Here's an ad you haven't seen, but it could be coming soon: A man jogs along a dirt path meandering through idyllic countryside. He pauses at an overlook and glances down at his cellphone. The phone screen flashes a number, telling him his blood sugar is normal. He smiles and resumes his run.
        What's different about this ad, you wonder? The jogger doesn't have diabetes. So, how does his phone know his blood sugar? And why, in the middle of a run, does he want to know the result? Read on.
        If you don't have diabetes, should you monitor your blood sugar?
        Several companies are working hard to make this sort of ad a reality, as they begin marketing implantable blood sugar measuring devices to people without diabetes. Called continuous glucose monitoring systems, or CGMs, they are often used by people with diabetes. These companies could reap enormous profits by convincing healthy people without diabetes (or other blood sugar problems) to start monitoring blood sugar.
        CGMs use tiny sensor wires, or filaments, that pierce the skin to frequently and easily assess blood sugar levels. The filaments remain in place, usually on the upper arm or abdomen, protected by an adhesive patch. Results are displayed on a receiver or transmitted to the user's phone.
        While CGMs have required a prescription in the past, recent FDA clearance of over-the-counter CGMs may tempt healthy people to begin using these systems without a specific medical reason to do so.
        Where's the health benefit in this?
        Already, many of us monitor our weight, heart rate, or steps per day — so why not monitor blood sugar? And, is there any evidence of benefit for healthy people without diabetes to continuously monitor their blood sugar levels with CGMs? There's little published research to help answer these questions.
        The best study I could find found nothing particularly surprising: among 153 people who didn't have diabetes, about 96% of the time blood sugar levels were normal or nearly so. In fact, many of the abnormal levels were considered implausible or a mistake. Another small study looked at sedentary individuals without diabetes who were overweight or obese. Participants completed a counseling session about the effects of physical activity on blood sugar and used a CGM device and an activity tracker for 10 days. Afterward, they reported feeling more motivated to exercise. Yet another analysis of CGM use for rare conditions causing low blood sugar among children found no evidence of health benefit.
        But I could find no published study suggesting that monitoring translates into improved health for healthy people without diabetes or other blood sugar problems.
        So, until more studies prove the value of CGM for people without diabetes, we won't know whether the cost and time it takes to implant one of these systems is accomplishing anything or is just the latest health monitoring fad wasting effort and money.
        Speaking of cost, CGMs aren't cheap: they can cost several thousand dollars a year. And it's unlikely that health insurers will cover CGMs for people without diabetes, at least until there is compelling evidence that they're actually helpful.
        Blood sugar monitoring for people with diabetes offers undeniable health benefits
        For people with diabetes, a major goal of therapy is to keep the blood sugar close to the normal range. This helps to prevent symptoms and complications, prolong life, and improve quality of life.
        The development of CGM devices that can frequently and easily monitor blood sugar levels without finger sticks has revolutionized care for millions of people with diabetes. Besides providing results of blood sugar levels, some devices have alarm settings that alert the user, or other people, if blood sugar becomes dangerously low or high. And some systems can transmit results directly to the user's doctor, if desired.
        If knowledge is power, why not monitor your blood sugar?
        So, why would a person who doesn't have diabetes want to monitor their blood sugar? Possible reasons include
        
          Detecting prediabetes. In prediabetes blood sugar is slightly high, but not high enough to meet the definition of diabetes. For healthy people, blood sugar testing is typically recommended every three years or so; if prediabetes is diagnosed, repeat testing is recommended more often, at least yearly. CGM might allow earlier diagnosis of prediabetes or diabetes. This could be particularly helpful for people at higher risk for diabetes due to family history or other factors, and people taking medicines that can raise blood sugar.
          The notion of ""optimizing"" blood sugar for peak mental or physical performance. Not surprisingly, some CGM makers suggest knowing your blood sugar can help you make changes to keep it in an ""ideal range"" that will help you perform your best, prevent diabetes, or improve health in some other way. For example, you might change what or when you eat. None of these marketing notions has been proven, or even well studied. And guess what — even the ideal blood sugar range for a person who isn't diabetic is uncertain.
          A sense of control. Having more information about your body may provide you with a feeling of control over your health, even if you take no immediate action.
          Curiosity. Let's face it, it's tempting to gather information about our bodies that might be interesting (even when we're not sure what to do with it).
        
        But truly, knowledge that is useless, redundant, or inaccurate doesn't make you powerful! It may even be harmful. For example, if biologically insignificant drops in blood sugar lead you to snack more (""to avoid hypoglycemia""), you could gain weight and actually increase your risk of developing diabetes. If the monitoring system sometimes provides inaccurate information or false alarms, unnecessary anxiety, calls or visits to the doctor, visits to an emergency room, and even inappropriate treatment may follow.
        The bottom line
        Unfortunately, some makers of CGM systems aren't waiting for solid research results to market these devices to healthy people. So, consumers and marketing professionals — not researchers or doctors — may wind up driving demand for the product.
        For any new technology there's a scientific learning curve to figure out when to use it. In my view, we're at the very beginning of the learning curve for home monitoring of blood sugar in people without diabetes. Before buying into what may be the next fad in health monitoring, I think we need to learn a lot more.
        There is wisdom in the teachings of one of my favorite professors in medical school: ""Just because you can measure something doesn't mean you should.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-importance-of-stretching,The importance of stretching,"You may think of stretching as something performed only by runners or gymnasts. But we all need to stretch in order to protect our mobility and independence. A lot of people don't understand that stretching has to happen on a regular basis. Ideally, it should be daily.
        Why stretching is important
        Stretching keeps the muscles flexible and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion in the joints. Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight. Then, when you call on the muscles for activity, they are unable to extend all the way. That puts you at risk for joint pain, strains, and muscle damage.
        For example, sitting in a chair all day results in tight hamstrings in the back of the thigh. That can make it harder to extend your leg or straighten your knee all the way, which inhibits walking. Likewise, when tight muscles are suddenly called on for a strenuous activity that stretches them, such as playing tennis, they may become damaged from suddenly being stretched. Injured muscles may not be strong enough to support the joints, which can lead to joint injury.
        Regular stretching keeps muscles long, lean, and flexible, and this means that exertion won't put too much force on the muscle itself. Healthy muscles also help a person with balance problems avoid falls.
        Where to start
        With a body full of muscles, the idea of daily stretching may seem overwhelming. It's most important to focus on the body areas needed for critical for mobility: your lower extremities: your calves, your hamstrings, your hip flexors in the pelvis and quadriceps in the front of the thigh. Stretching your shoulders, neck, and lower back is also beneficial. Aim for a program of daily stretches, or at least three or four times per week.
        Find a physical therapist (your local Y is a good place to start) who can assess your muscle strength and tailor a stretching program to fit your needs.
        Proper execution
        Stretching the muscles before they're warmed up can actually hurt them. When everything is cold, the fibers aren't prepared and may be damaged. If you exercise first, you'll get blood flow to the area, and that makes the tissue more pliable and amenable to change. All it takes to warm up the muscles before stretching is five to 10 minutes of light activity, such as a quick walk. You can also stretch after an aerobic or weight-training workout.
        Hold a stretch for 30 seconds. Don't bounce, which can cause injury. You'll feel tension during a stretch, but you should not feel pain. If you do, there may be an injury or damage in the tissue. Stop stretching that muscle and talk to your doctor.
        Try a hamstring stretch
        A hamstring stretch will keep the muscles in the back of your thigh flexible. Sit on the floor with your legs in front of you. Slide your hands down your legs until you feel a burning sensation. Hold for 30 seconds, then slowly return to a sitting position.
        The cumulative effect of stretching
        Stretching once today won't magically give you perfect flexibility. You'll need to do it over time and remain committed to the process. It may have taken you many months to get tight muscles, so you're not going to be perfectly flexible after only a few sessions. It takes weeks to months to get flexible, and you'll have to continue working on it to maintain it.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-eggs-risky-for-heart-health,Are eggs risky for heart health?,"For most people, an egg a day does not increase your risk of a heart attack, a stroke, or any other type of cardiovascular disease.
        In the past, it seemed logical to think eggs would be bad for your heart health. We knew that the cholesterol in eggs came from the egg yolks, and we knew that high levels of cholesterol, especially LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood increased the risk of cardiovascular disease. So, it seemed logical that avoiding cholesterol in the diet made sense.
        Since then, however, research has shown that most of the cholesterol in our body is made by our liver — it doesn't come from cholesterol we eat. The liver is stimulated to make cholesterol primarily by saturated fat and trans fat in our diet, not dietary cholesterol. But a large egg contains little saturated fat — about 1.5 grams (g). And research has confirmed that eggs also contain many healthy nutrients: lutein and zeaxanthin, which are good for the eyes; choline, which is good for the brain and nerves; and various vitamins (A, B, and D). In fact, just one large egg contains 270 international units (IU) of vitamin A and 41 IU of vitamin D. One large egg also contains about 6 g of protein and 72 calories.
        The evidence that cholesterol in one egg a day is safe for most people comes from huge studies — many conducted here at Harvard Medical School — that have followed hundreds of thousands of people over decades. They regularly report what they eat and all of the medical conditions that they develop. It is those studies that do not find higher rates of heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular diseases in people who eat up to one egg per day.
        Of course, it matters greatly what you eat with your eggs. The saturated fat in butter, cheese, bacon, sausage, muffins, or scones, for example, raises your blood cholesterol much more than the cholesterol in your egg. And the highly refined ""bad carbs"" in white toast, pastries, home fries, and hash browns may also increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-i-worry-about-my-fast-pulse,Should I worry about my fast pulse?,"Q. My pulse is usually on the fast side. Does a high heart rate mean I have a problem with my heart?
        A. In otherwise healthy people, a heart rate at rest should be less than 100 beats per minute at rest. Heart rates that are consistently above 100, even when the person is sitting quietly, can sometimes be caused by an abnormal heart rhythm. A high heart rate can also happen because the muscles that make up the left ventricle of the heart have become weakened. That forces the heart to contract more often to pump enough blood to the rest of the body.
        Usually, though, a fast heartbeat is not due to heart disease, because a wide variety of noncardiac factors can speed the heart rate. These include fever, a low red blood cell count (anemia), an overactive thyroid, or overuse of caffeine or stimulants like some over-the-counter decongestants. The list goes on and includes anxiety and poor physical conditioning.
        Many people today wear a wrist band that shows their heart rate. Or you can check your heart rate the old fashioned way by feeling the pulse in your wrist or neck. You count the number of beats over 15 seconds and multiply it times four. If your heart rate is consistently high, you should make an appointment with your doctor.",Unknown,"April 16, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/treating-female-pattern-hair-loss,Treating female pattern hair loss,"About one-third of women experience hair loss (alopecia) at some time in their lives; among postmenopausal women, as many as two-thirds suffer hair thinning or bald spots. Hair loss in women often has a greater impact than hair loss does on men, because it's less socially acceptable for them. Alopecia can severely affect a woman's emotional well-being and quality of life.
        The main type of hair loss in women is the same as it is men. It's called androgenetic alopecia, or female (or male) pattern hair loss. In men, hair loss usually begins above the temples, and the receding hairline eventually forms a characteristic ""M"" shape; hair at the top of the head also thins, often progressing to baldness. In women, androgenetic alopecia begins with gradual thinning at the part line, followed by increasing diffuse hair loss radiating from the top of the head. A woman's hairline rarely recedes, and women rarely become bald.
        There are many potential causes of hair loss in women, including medical conditions, medications, and physical or emotional stress. If you notice unusual hair loss of any kind, it's important to see your primary care provider or a dermatologist, to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. You may also want to ask your clinician for a referral to a therapist or support group to address emotional difficulties. Hair loss in women can be frustrating, but recent years have seen an increase in resources for coping with the problem.
        
          
            
              
                Patterns of female hair loss
                
                  
                
                Clinicians use the Ludwig Classification to describe female pattern hair loss. Type I is minimal thinning that can be camouflaged with hair styling techniques. Type II is characterized by decreased volume and noticeable widening of the mid-line part. Type III describes diffuse thinning, with a see-through appearance on the top of the scalp.
              
            
          
        
        What is androgenetic alopecia?
        Almost every woman eventually develops some degree of female pattern hair loss. It can start any time after the onset of puberty, but women tend to first notice it around menopause, when hair loss typically increases. The risk rises with age, and it's higher for women with a history of hair loss on either side of the family.
        As the name suggests, androgenetic alopecia involves the action of the hormones called androgens, which are essential for normal male sexual development and have other important functions in both sexes, including sex drive and regulation of hair growth. The condition may be inherited and involve several different genes. It can also result from an underlying endocrine condition, such as overproduction of androgen or an androgen-secreting tumor on the ovary, pituitary, or adrenal gland. In either case, the alopecia is likely related to increased androgen activity. But unlike androgenetic alopecia in men, in women the precise role of androgens is harder to determine.
        In either sex, hair loss from androgenetic alopecia occurs because of a genetically determined shortening of anagen, a hair's growing phase, and a lengthening of the time between the shedding of a hair and the start of a new anagen phase. (See ""Life cycle of a hair."") That means it takes longer for hair to start growing back after it is shed in the course of the normal growth cycle. The hair follicle itself also changes, shrinking and producing a shorter, thinner hair shaft — a process called ""follicular miniaturization."" As a result, thicker, pigmented, longer-lived ""terminal"" hairs are replaced by shorter, thinner, non-pigmented hairs called ""vellus.""
        
          
            
              
                Life cycle of a hair
                
                  
                
                Each hair develops from a follicle — a narrow pocket in the skin — and goes through three phases of growth. Anagen (A), the active growth phase, lasts two to seven years. Catagen (B), the transition phase, lasts about two weeks. During this phase, the hair shaft moves upward toward the skin's surface, and the dermal papilla (the structure that nourishes cells that give rise to hair) begins to separate from the follicle. Telogen (C), the resting phase, lasts around three months and culminates in the shedding of the hair shaft.
              
            
          
        
        A clinician diagnoses female pattern hair loss by taking a medical history and examining the scalp. She or he will observe the pattern of hair loss, check for signs of inflammation or infection, and possibly order blood tests to investigate other possible causes of hair loss, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and iron deficiency. Unless there are signs of excess androgen activity (such as menstrual irregularities, acne, and unwanted hair growth), a hormonal evaluation is usually unnecessary.
        How to stop thinning hair: Hair loss treatment for women
        Medications are the most common treatment for hair loss in women. They include the following:
        Minoxidil (Rogaine, generic versions). This drug was initially introduced as a treatment for high blood pressure, but people who took it noticed that they were growing hair in places where they had lost it. Research studies confirmed that minoxidil applied directly to the scalp could stimulate hair growth. As a result of the studies, the FDA originally approved over-the-counter 2% minoxidil to treat hair loss in women. Since then a 5% solution has also become available when a stronger solution is need for a woman's hair loss.
        Clearly, minoxidil is not a miracle drug. While it can produce some new growth of fine hair in some — not all — women, it can't restore the full density of the lost hair. It's not a quick fix, either for hair loss in women. You won't see results until you use the drug for at least two months. The effect often peaks at around four months, but it could take longer, so plan on a trial of six to 12 months. If minoxidil works for you, you'll need to keep using it to maintain those results. If you stop, you'll start to lose hair again.
        How to use minoxidil: Be sure that your hair and scalp are dry. Using the dropper or spray pump that's provided with the over-the-counter solution, apply it twice daily to every area where your hair is thinning. Gently massage it into the scalp with your fingers so it can reach the hair follicles. Then air-dry your hair, wash your hands thoroughly, and wash off any solution that has dripped onto your forehead or face. Don't shampoo for at least four hours afterwards.
        Some women find that the minoxidil solution leaves a deposit that dries and irritates their scalp. This irritation, called contact dermatitis, is probably caused not by the minoxidil itself, but rather by the alcohol that is included to facilitate drying.
        Side effects and concerns: Minoxidil is safe, but it can have unpleasant side effects even apart from the alcohol-related skin irritation. Sometimes the new hair differs in color and texture from surrounding hair. Another risk is hypertrichosis — excessive hair growth in the wrong places, such as the cheeks or forehead. (This problem is more likely with the stronger 5% solution.)
        Because the patent on Rogaine (the brand-name version of minoxidil) has expired, many generic products are available. They all contain the same amount of minoxidil, but some include additional ingredients, such as herbal extracts, which might trigger allergic reactions.
        Anti-androgens. Androgens include testosterone and other ""male"" hormones, which can accelerate hair loss in women. Some women who don't respond to minoxidil may benefit from the addition of the diuretic drug spironolactone (Aldactone) for treatment of androgenic alopecia because this drug has anti-androgen properties. This medication is especially helpful for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) because they tend to make excess androgens. Doctors will usually prescribe spironolactone together with an oral contraceptive for women of reproductive age. (A woman taking one of these drugs should not become pregnant because they can cause genital abnormalities in a male fetus.) Possible side effects include dizziness, excess thirst, loss of appetite, weight gain, loss of libido, and fatigue. If spirolactone is not effective, another medication with anti-androgen properties such as finasteride may help.
        Iron supplements. Iron deficiency could be a cause of hair loss in some women. Your doctor may test your blood iron level, particularly if you're a vegetarian, have a history of anemia, or have heavy menstrual bleeding. If you do have iron deficiency, you will need to take a supplement and it may stop your hair loss. However, if your iron level is normal, taking extra iron will only cause side effects, such as stomach upset and constipation.
        Other treatments. If other treatments are not effective, laser therapy or platelet-rich plasma injections may be recommended.
        Hair transplantation
        Hair transplantation, a procedure used in the United States since the 1950s to treat androgenic alopecia, involves removing a strip of scalp from the back of the head and using it to fill in a bald patch. Today, 90% of hair-transplant surgeons use a technique called follicular unit transplantation, which was introduced in the mid-1990s.
        During this procedure, surgeons remove a narrow strip of scalp and divide it into hundreds of tiny grafts, each containing just a few hairs. Each graft is planted in a slit in the scalp created by a blade or needle in the area of missing hair. Hair grows naturally this way, in small clusters of one to four follicles, called follicular units. As a result, the graft looks better than the larger ""plugs"" associated with hair transplants of yesteryear.
        Not everyone with female pattern hair loss is a good candidate for hair transplantation, especially if hair loss is widespread and severe. In addition, hair transplantation is expensive, can be time-intensive, and is not always successful.",Unknown,"April 8, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-metformin-a-wonder-drug-202109222605,Is metformin a wonder drug?,"Ever wonder why certain medications are called ""wonder drugs""?
        Sometimes it's because of the tremendous health benefits the drug provides for a particular condition, like insulin for type 1 diabetes or antibiotics for pneumonia. Or, it might be because the drug is good for many different conditions: aspirin has often been called a wonder drug because it can relieve pain, treat or prevent cardiovascular disease, and even prevent cancer.
        Could metformin be joining this list? It's approved in the US to treat type 2 diabetes when used with diet and exercise by people ages 10 and older. But in recent years, interest has grown regarding its potential to prevent or treat a variety of other conditions, including aging. Yes, aging. If that's true, ""wonder drug"" might be an understatement.
        What is metformin?
        The history of metformin goes back hundreds of years. In Europe, the medicinal herb Galega officinalis was popular for digestive health and to treat urinary problems and other ailments. In 1918 a scientist discovered that one of its ingredients, guanidine, could lower blood sugar. Medicines containing guanidine, such as metformin and phenformin, were developed to treat diabetes. But they fell out of favor due to serious side effects caused by phenformin, and by the discovery of insulin.
        Metformin was rediscovered decades later and approved as a treatment for diabetes in Europe in the 1950s. It wasn't until 1995 that the FDA approved it for use in the US. It has since become the most widely prescribed medication for people with diabetes who cannot control their blood sugar through diet and exercise alone.
        Metformin's benefits may extend far beyond diabetes
        For decades we've known that metformin does more than just help lower blood sugar in people with diabetes. It also offers them cardiovascular benefits, including lower rates of death due to cardiovascular disease. And it sometimes helps people with diabetes lose excess weight.
        Metformin may also have health benefits for people who don't have diabetes. Doctors have long prescribed it off-label — that is, to treat conditions outside its approved use, including:
        
          Prediabetes. People with prediabetes have elevated blood sugar that isn't yet high enough to qualify as diabetes. Metformin may delay the onset of diabetes or even prevent it among people with prediabetes.
          Gestational diabetes. Pregnant women may develop elevated blood sugar that returns to normal after delivery. Metformin can help control blood sugar during pregnancy in such women.
          Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This disorder tends to affect young women whose ovaries develop multiple cysts. Menstrual irregularities and fertility problems are common. Although the results of clinical studies are mixed, metformin has been prescribed for years for women with PCOS to help with menstrual regulation, fertility, and elevated blood sugar.
          Weight gain from antipsychotic medicines. Antipsychotics are powerful medications prescribed for psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia. One common side effect is significant weight gain. Metformin may lessen weight gain among some people taking these drugs.
        
        In addition, researchers are investigating the potential of metformin to
        
          Lower the risk of cancer in persons with type 2 diabetes. These include cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate.
          Lower risks for dementia and stroke. Some studies have noted less cognitive decline and a lower rate of dementia, as well as a lower rate of stroke, among people with diabetes taking metformin compared with those who were not taking it.
          Slow aging, prevent age-related disease, and increase lifespan. Preliminary studies suggest that metformin may actually slow aging and increase life expectancy, possibly by improving the body's responsiveness to insulin, antioxidant effects, and improving blood vessel health.
        
        Because the vast majority of research regarding metformin included only people with diabetes or prediabetes, it's unclear whether these potential benefits are limited to people with those conditions, or whether people without diabetes may derive benefit as well.
        What about side effects?
        The safety profile for metformin is quite good. Side effects include nausea, stomach upset, or diarrhea; these tend to be mild. More serious side effects are rare. They include severe allergic reactions and a condition called lactic acidosis, a buildup of lactic acid in the bloodstream. The risk for this is higher among people with significant kidney disease, so doctors tend to avoid prescribing metformin for them.
        The bottom line
        Metformin is a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, according to current diabetes guidelines. It's relatively inexpensive and its potential side effects are well understood.
        If you have diabetes and need metformin to help lower your blood sugar, its other potential health benefits are a wonderful — not harmful — side effect. And if you don't have diabetes? Well, its role in preventing or treating diseases, and possibly even slowing aging and extending life expectancy, is much less clear.
        While the research so far is promising, we need more compelling evidence before endorsing its widespread use for people without diabetes. But, for clinical researchers hoping to repurpose an old medicine as a new wonder drug, metformin would seem like a great place to start.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/how-to-get-rid-of-muscle-cramps-in-your-legs,How to get rid of muscle cramps in your legs,"The muscles in your legs are made up of bundles of fibers that alternately contract and expand to produce movement. A cramp is a sudden, involuntary contraction (tightening) of one of these muscles, typically in your calf. Cramps can last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. They can be mild, or intense enough to wake you out of a sound sleep. A sudden, painful muscle spasm in the leg is called a charley horse, which legend has it is named after baseball player Charlie ""Hoss"" Radbourn, who reportedly suffered from frequent cramps back in the 1880s.
        Sometimes there is no obvious cause for a cramp. Exercise is a common trigger, especially after you've exercised for a long period of time or in the heat. Muscles that are tired or dehydrated become irritated and are more likely to cramp up. A deficiency of electrolytes such as magnesium or potassium in your diet can lead to more frequent cramping, by preventing your muscles from fully relaxing. The risk of a cramp increases during pregnancy, possibly because of circulatory changes and increased stress on the muscles from a growing belly. Age is another factor, with cramps becoming more frequent in middle age and beyond. Older muscles tire more easily, and they become increasingly sensitive to dehydration. Cramps can also be a side effect of medicines like statins, which are used to treat high cholesterol.
        Symptoms of muscle cramps
        They can include:
        
          Sudden pain and tightness in a muscle, typically in your calf
           A temporary hard lump or twitching under the skin
        
        Diagnosing muscle cramps
        You should be able to treat a cramp on your own, but see a doctor if your cramps are severe, you get them often, or you have other symptoms (like numbness or weakness) along with them. Rarely, cramps can signal a problem with the spine, blood vessels, or liver.
        Treating muscle cramps
        Most cramps will go away on their own within a few minutes. Massaging or gently stretching the muscle will help it relax. If the cramp begins while lying or sitting, standing up may be all that is needed. Heat is soothing to tense muscles. Apply a heating pad or warm wet washcloth to help loosen up the muscle.
        To avoid leg cramps in the future, drink plenty of fluids before and during exercise. Muscles need fluid to contract and relax properly. Prevent tightness by warming up your leg muscles before you work out with some walking in place or a slow jog. After each workout, stretch out your leg muscles for a few minutes. Do another set of stretches before bed if you tend to get cramps while you sleep.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/think-that-hip-pain-is-bursitis-think-again,Think that hip pain is bursitis? Think again,"Hip bursitis — an inflammation between your thighbone and nearby tendons — is commonly diagnosed when patients have pain on the outer side of the hip. However, several other conditions can cause similar pain, and require different treatments. ""Doctors often assume that pain on the outer side of the hip is due to bursitis. But 90% of the time, it's not bursitis,"" says Dr. Lauren Elson, a physiatrist with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        What's causing the pain?
        Dr. Elson says pain in the side of your hip most often results from one of the following conditions:
        Tendinitis. This is an inflammation of the tendons (fibrous bands of tissue) that connect the gluteal muscles in your buttocks to the hip bone. ""Tendinitis develops because of muscle imbalance. It could be from a lack of activity, crossing your legs, or even sitting on a wallet,"" Dr. Elson says.
        Overuse injury. When you walk or run, weak hip and buttock muscles can tighten and irritate the iliotibial (IT) band — a long band of connective tissue that runs from the knee to the hip. It merges with the gluteal muscles to stabilize the leg.
        Tight muscles in the buttocks and hip. If the gluteal muscles and IT band are too tight, they pull at the thighbone where they attach, and that causes pain on the side.
        Spine problems. ""The body isn't always smart in recognizing where the pain is coming from,"" Dr. Elson explains, ""and spine arthritis, a pinched nerve, or bones in the spine rubbing together can create pain in the side of your hip.""
        Symptoms and diagnosis
        With all of these conditions, the pain lingers or even worsens when you lie on your side, or when you sit and cross your legs. It may ease with activity. But left untreated, the pain can become so severe that you're unable to walk.
        You may need to seek treatment from a primary care physician or specialist (such as a physiatrist, sports medicine specialist, or physical therapist) who can interpret your symptoms and imaging tests to determine the cause of pain on the side of your hip.
        Starting your treatment
        The good news: ""Pain almost always goes away with targeted exercise and stretching,"" says Dr. Elson.
        She typically recommends massage and a course of physical therapy, which focuses at first on easing tight tissues by stretching them. These include the hip flexors, the IT band, and the piriformis muscles in the buttocks.
        It's also important to avoid habits that can tighten muscles and add to pain at the side of the hip, such as crossing your legs or sitting too long.
        
          
            
              
                Move of the month: Seated pretzel
                Stretches the buttocks, hips, and outer thighs.
                Reps: 2–4
                Hold: 10–30 seconds
                Starting position: Sit up straight in a chair and rest your left ankle on your right thigh above your knee. Place your hands on your thighs.
                Movement: Keeping your spine neutral, slowly hinge forward from your hips until you feel a stretch in your left hip and buttock. Hold. Slowly return to the starting position. Repeat with your right ankle on your left knee. This is one rep.
                Tips and techniques: Keep your spine neutral, not rounded, and your chest lifted as you lean forward. Keep your shoulders down and back, away from your ears, as you stretch. For a deeper stretch, gently press down with the hand on your bent leg.

        Strengthening the muscles
        Along with improving flexibility, physical therapy sessions aim to strengthen the abdominal or core muscles, such as the transversus abdominis muscle. ""This helps align the pelvis better, so you won't stress the hip when you stand or walk. Stronger abdominals also support your spine,"" explains Madhuri Kale, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        With a stronger core, you can then move on to strengthening the muscles at the hip that let you move your leg in various directions. ""We may have you do side or back leg lifts, performed while standing, with a resistance band. And clamshells are also helpful,"" Kale says. You do this exercise by lying on your side with your knees bent and raising and lowering only your top knee while keeping your feet together.
        In time, you can restore balance to the body and reduce pain. ""Pain comes on because of an imbalance from tight or weak muscles,"" Dr. Elson says. ""If you can restore balance, you can help the body function better and eliminate pain."" For more information, check out the Harvard Special Health Report The Joint Pain Relief Workout (/jprw).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/proton-pump-inhibitors,Proton-pump inhibitors: What you need to know,"Stomach acid is natural, a valuable chemical contributor to orderly digestion. But in excess or in the wrong place, it's a menace, inflaming and irritating the esophagus, typically causing heartburn and sometimes contributing to the development of ulcers in the stomach and the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.
        People have dealt with stomach acid–related woes in a variety of ways, proven and otherwise, for eons, but it wasn't until the mid-1970s and the introduction of cimetidine (Tagamet) that a treatment targeted the production of stomach acid itself. Cimetidine was a huge commercial success; by some accounts, it was the first blockbuster drug. Other drugs in the same class, known as H2 blockers, quickly followed suit.
        Now the proton-pump inhibitor drugs (PPIs) have eclipsed the H2 blockers as the most commonly prescribed agents to reduce stomach acid. Examples of PPIs include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (AcipHex), and esomeprazole (Nexium). They are prescribed to both prevent and treat ulcers in the duodenum (where most ulcers develop) and the stomach. They also counter the various problems that occur when stomach acid escapes into the esophagus, which — if it happens on a regular basis — is a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In most head-to-head trials, the PPIs have proved to be superior to the H2 blockers.
        Reducing stomach acid levels isn't one of medicine's glamour jobs, but it's yeoman's work, so PPIs are generally considered quite a success story: safe (more on that just below), effective medications that target the source of a lot of gastrointestinal distress.
        
          
            
              
                What is a PPI?
                
                  
                
                Many people take PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). By lowering stomach acid levels, they reduce acid reflux into the esophagus and the resulting heartburn symptoms.
              
            
          
        
        Appropriate use of proton pump inhibitors
        Taking a PPI makes sense if you have a chronic problem with stomach acid or the prospect of one developing. But the occasional case of mild heartburn does not need to be treated with a PPI. For that kind of spot duty, the old standbys of antacid medicine like Tums, Rolaids, and Maalox will most likely work just as well, as will any of the H2 blockers. In fact, it takes several days for PPIs to have their full effect on acid secretion, so an H2 blocker may be more effective for a mild, short-term problem with stomach acid. Yet people often take PPIs under the mistaken assumption that they are the better medication in all circumstances.
        If heartburn is the problem, there are also changes you can make that may help that don't involve taking anything. The commercials are right: gobbling down a large meal can give you heartburn, so eating smaller meals can help tame the problem. And if you're heavy, GERD and heartburn are on that very long list of problems that ease up and may even go away if you lose some weight.
        PPIs are the most potent inhibitors of stomach acid available, and they're a welcome addition to the medical armamentarium. But every pill — indeed, every medical intervention — is a risk-benefit balancing act. You don't need to take a PPI for the incidental case of heartburn. If you have a prescription, the reasons for it should be reviewed periodically to make sure they're still valid; it's common for people to take medications far longer than is necessary, and that is particularly true of the PPIs.
        For most people who need to take a PPI, it should be for the lowest dose and shortest amount of time as possible. However, there are conditions that indicate long-term and sometimes indefinite use of a PPI, such as in people with esophagitis due to GERD.
        There are differences in the chemical properties of the different PPIs and how they are metabolized. But comparative studies haven't yielded any clear-cut winners, so the less expensive PPIs are the best choice for most people.
        Side effects
        Initially, there was some worry that PPIs might increase the risk of developing stomach cancer. Those concerns were unfounded, but others have taken their place, partly because people often take PPIs on a daily basis for years, so the total exposure to the drug ends up being quite significant. Here's a rundown of the some of the side effects that are causing concern:
        Fracture risk. Some studies have shown an association between PPIs and the risk of fracture — particularly hip fracture — while others have not. Calcium is absorbed in the small intestine, not the stomach. But low stomach acid levels can have downstream effects, especially in the duodenum, and some research shows that one of them could be reduced absorption of calcium, which could lead to osteoporosis, weaker bones, and, consequently, a greater chance of breaking a bone. The fracture risk is probably pretty small, but it's another reason for not taking a PPI unless necessary.
        Pneumonia risk. Several studies have shown that people taking PPIs seem to be more likely to get pneumonia than those who aren't. The association has been documented among people living in the community and hospital patients alike. Normally, stomach acid creates a fairly inhospitable environment for bacteria, but if acid levels are reduced by PPIs, the bacteria count can go up. The thinking is that in people with GERD who take PPIs, bacteria-laden stomach contents may travel up the esophagus and then get inhaled into the windpipe and lungs, where the bacteria cause pneumonia.
        C. difficile risk. People typically develop Clostridium difficile infections in the hospital after taking antibiotics that have disrupted the natural bacterial ecology of the large intestine. The infections cause diarrhea but can also become a lot more serious, even life-threatening. Studies have shown a fairly strong statistical correlation between PPI use and C. difficile infection, although it's still just a correlation and not proof of direct cause and effect. Some experimental evidence suggests that PPIs may change conditions in the gut to be more favorable to C. difficile bacteria.
        Iron and B12 deficiency. Stomach acid helps render the iron and vitamin B12 from food into forms that are readily absorbed. So, there is worry that an unintended consequence of long-term use of PPIs might cause deficiencies of this vitamin and mineral because of lower stomach acid levels. Your doctor can periodically blood tests to make sure B12 and iron levels are in the normal range.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cannabidiol-cbd-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-2018082414476,Cannabidiol (CBD): What we know and what we don't,"Cannabidiol (CBD) is often covered in the media, and you may see it touted as an add-in booster to your post-workout smoothie or morning coffee. You can even buy a CBD-infused sports bra. But what exactly is CBD? And why is it so popular?
        How is cannabidiol different from marijuana, cannabis, and hemp?
        CBD, or cannabidiol, is the second most prevalent active ingredient in cannabis (marijuana). While CBD is an essential component of medical marijuana, it is derived directly from the hemp plant, a cousin of marijuana, or manufactured in a laboratory. One of hundreds of components in marijuana, CBD does not cause a high by itself.
        According to a report from the World Health Organization, ""In humans, CBD exhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or dependence potential…. To date, there is no evidence of public health related problems associated with the use of pure CBD."" A recent study in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology concluded that ""acute CBD alone is unlikely to significantly impair daily functioning or workplace performance.""
        Is cannabidiol legal?
        CBD is readily obtainable in most parts of the United States, though its exact legal status has been in flux. All 50 states have laws legalizing CBD with varying degrees of restriction. In December 2015, the FDA eased the regulatory requirements to allow researchers to conduct CBD trials. In 2018, the Farm Bill made hemp legal in the United States, making it virtually impossible to keep CBD illegal — that would be like making oranges legal, but keeping orange juice illegal.
        The Farm Bill removed all hemp-derived products, including CBD, from the Controlled Substances Act, which criminalizes the possession of drugs. In essence, this means that CBD is legal if it comes from hemp, but not if it comes from cannabis (marijuana) — even though it is the exact same molecule. Currently, many people obtain CBD online without a medical marijuana license, which is legal in most states.
        The evidence for cannabidiol health benefits
        CBD has been touted for a wide variety of health issues, but the strongest scientific evidence is for its effectiveness in treating some of the cruelest childhood epilepsy syndromes, such as Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), which typically don't respond well to antiseizure medications. In numerous studies, CBD was able to reduce the number of seizures, and, in some cases, stop them altogether. Epidiolex, which primarily consists of CBD, is the first cannabis-derived medicine approved by the FDA for these conditions.
        Animal studies, and self-reports or research in humans, suggest CBD may also help with:
        
          Anxiety: Studies and clinical trials are exploring the common report that CBD can reduce anxiety.
          Insomnia: Studies suggest that CBD may help with both falling asleep and staying asleep, in part by helping address chronic pain and anxiety.
          Chronic pain: Increasingly, human studies are substantiating the claims that CBD helps control pain. One animal study from the European Journal of Pain suggests CBD could help lower pain and inflammation due to arthritis when applied to skin. Other research identifies how CBD may inhibit inflammatory and neuropathic pain, which are difficult to treat.
          Addiction: CBD can help lower cravings for tobacco and heroin under certain conditions, according to some research in humans. Animal models of addiction suggest it may also help lessen cravings for other addictive substances such as alcohol, cannabis, opiates, and stimulants.
        
        Is CBD safe?
        Side effects of CBD could include nausea, fatigue, and irritability. CBD can increase the level of blood thinning and other medicines in your blood by competing for the liver enzymes that break down these drugs. Grapefruit has a similar effect with certain medicines. This interaction is particularly important if you are taking a blood thinner, an anti-epileptic, or an immunosuppressant medication, all of which need to have stable levels in your blood.
        People taking high doses of CBD may show abnormalities in liver-related blood tests. Many nonprescription drugs, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), have this same effect. You should let your doctor know if you are regularly using CBD so that he or she can check your liver enzymes periodically.
        A significant safety concern with CBD is that it is primarily marketed and sold as a supplement, not a medication. Currently, the FDA does not regulate the safety and purity of dietary supplements, and no one, really, is regulating the CBD market. So you cannot be sure that the product you buy has active ingredients at the dose listed on the label.
        In addition, the product may contain other unknown elements. If you buy CBD, it is safest to make sure that there is independent laboratory testing as attested to by a COA (certificate of analysis) that should accompany every CBD product.
        How can CBD be taken?
        CBD comes in many forms, including oils, tinctures, capsules, patches, vapes, and topical preparations for use on skin. If you're hoping to reduce inflammation and relieve muscle and joint pain, a topical CBD-infused oil, lotion or cream — or even a bath bomb — may be the best option. Alternatively, a CBC patch or a tincture or spray designed to be placed under the tongue allows CBD to directly enter the bloodstream. Dcotors don't recommend smoking anything, including CBD.
        Outside of the US, the prescription drug Sativex, which uses CBD as an active ingredient, is approved for muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis and for cancer pain. Within the US, Epidiolex is approved for certain types of epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis.
        The bottom line on cannabidiol
        Some CBD manufacturers have come under government scrutiny for wild, indefensible claims, such that CBD is a cure-all for cancer or COVID-19, which it is not. We need more research, but CBD is proving to be a helpful, relatively non-toxic option for managing anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain. Without sufficient high-quality evidence in human studies, we can't pinpoint effective doses, and because CBD currently is typically available as an unregulated supplement, it can be difficult to know exactly what you are getting, or to conduct studies.
        If you decide to try CBD, make sure you are getting it from a reputable source. Again, please discuss your use of CBD or any other supplements with your doctor to make sure that it won't affect any other medicines you take.","Peter Grinspoon, MD","April 4, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/9-tips-to-boost-your-energy-naturally,9 tips to boost your energy — naturally,"Most of us feel we need more energy. In fact, 14% of Americans said they did not have the energy they needed to get things done in one Gallup survey. Fortunately, there are things you can do to enhance your own natural energy levels. Here are nine tips:
        1. Control stress
        Stress-induced emotions consume huge amounts of energy. Talking with a friend or relative, joining a support group, or seeing a psychotherapist can all help diffuse stress. Relaxation therapies like meditation, self-hypnosis, yoga, and tai chi are also effective tools for reducing stress.
        2. Lighten your load
        One of the main reasons for fatigue is overwork. Overwork can include professional, family, and social obligations. Try to streamline your list of ""must-do"" activities. Set your priorities in terms of the most important tasks. Pare down those that are less important. Consider asking for extra help at work, if necessary.
        3. Exercise
        Exercise almost guarantees that you'll sleep more soundly. It also gives your cells more energy to burn and circulates oxygen. And exercising can lead to higher brain dopamine levels, which helps elevate mood. When walking, pick up the pace periodically to get extra health benefits.
        4. Avoid smoking
        Smoking siphons off your energy by causing insomnia. The nicotine in tobacco is a stimulant, so it speeds the heart rate, raises blood pressure, and stimulates brain-wave activity associated with wakefulness, making it harder to fall asleep. And once you do fall asleep, its addictive power can kick in and awaken you with cravings.
        5. Restrict your sleep
        If you think you may be sleep-deprived, try getting less sleep. This advice may sound odd but determining how much sleep you actually need can reduce the time you spend in bed not sleeping. This process makes it easier to fall asleep and promotes more restful sleep in the long run. Here's how to do it:
        
          Avoid napping during the day.
          The first night, go to bed later than normal and get just four hours of sleep.
          If you feel that you slept well during that four-hour period, add another 15–30 minutes of sleep the next night.
          As long as you're sleeping soundly the entire time you're in bed, slowly keep adding sleep on successive nights.
        
        6. Eat for energy
        Eating foods with a low glycemic index — whose sugars are absorbed slowly — may help you avoid the lag in energy that typically occurs after eating quickly absorbed sugars or refined starches. Foods with a low glycemic index include whole grains, high-fiber vegetables, nuts, and healthy oils such as olive oil. In general, high-carbohydrate foods have the highest glycemic indexes. Proteins and fats have glycemic indexes that are close to zero.
        7. Use caffeine to your advantage
        Caffeine does help increase alertness, so having a cup of coffee can help sharpen your mind. But to get the energizing effects of caffeine, you have to use it judiciously. It can cause insomnia, especially when consumed in large amounts or after 2 p.m.
        8. Limit alcohol
        One of the best hedges against the midafternoon slump is to avoid drinking alcohol at lunch. The sedative effect of alcohol is especially strong at midday. Similarly, avoid a five o'clock cocktail if you want to have energy in the evening. If you're going to drink, do so in moderation at a time when you don't mind having your energy wind down.
        9. Drink water
        What's the only nutrient that has been shown to enhance performance for all but the most demanding endurance activities? It's not some pricey sports drink. It's water. If your body is short of fluids, one of the first signs is a feeling of fatigue.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/co-regulation-helping-children-and-teens-navigate-big-emotions-202404033030,Co-regulation: Helping children and teens navigate big emotions,"When preschoolers are melting down or teens are slamming doors, parents face two difficult tasks: keeping themselves composed and supporting their kids' ability to self-soothe while building skills to handle future challenges.
        These abilities are at the heart of co-regulation, a parenting tool that requires patience and practice. But what exactly is involved, and how does it help support children and teens wrestling with big emotions?
        What is co-regulation?
        ""Co-regulation is a supportive, interactive, and dynamic process,"" says Lauren Marchette, a child, adolescent, and family psychologist and a lecturer in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
        Through warm and responsive interactions, caregivers help young people learn better ways to regulate their emotions during the inevitable upsets and challenges of life. ""At its heart, co-regulation is connecting with a child who's in distress and being able to evaluate what that child needs in the moment to help calm themselves.""
        But before a parent or trusted adult can help a child, they need to understand — and possibly expand — their own emotional skills and limitations. Emotions are often contagious, whether a person is upset or sharing a sense of calm.
        ""The tricky part of co-regulation is that adults have to recognize how they're feeling and be able to regulate their own emotions in difficult moments so they can help children to gain these same skills,"" Marchette says. ""But this will be so important for kids to develop healthy relationships over time, and affects how people do in school, work, and life in general.""
        How does building emotional skills help children and teens?
        As children grow up, they learn different skills — how to build a block tower, play a sport, or solve a math equation. They also learn emotional skills: how to recognize and handle feelings of anger or anxiety, for example.
        Known as self-regulation, such emotional skills are truly the basis of wellness in life, Marchette says. By consistently practicing co-regulation, parents and other trusted adults foster self-regulation skills in kids.
        The list of self-regulation skills is wide-ranging, involving
        
          emotional awareness and literacy, including the ability to identify emotions
          emotional regulation skills such as self-soothing
          perspective-taking, or the ability to ""walk in another's shoes""
          social skills such as taking turns and practicing patience
          paying attention and remaining focused when needed
          problem-solving
          thinking flexibly
          time management skills
          goal-setting.
        
        What are the potential benefits of co-regulation?
        Co-regulation enables kids to eventually learn to
        
          handle stress
          resist immediate gratification
          avoid hasty, ill-informed decisions
          make and stick to plans
          solve problems
          adapt to challenges
          take healthy risks.
        
        Some research suggests that having better self-regulation skills is linked to more positive outcomes in life, such as higher income and lower rates of substance use and violence.
        Who might especially benefit from co-regulation?
        Everyone wins when kids are better able to navigate frustrations and manage their reactions to their thoughts and feelings. Parents, teachers, coaches, guidance counselors, mentors, and other adults who interact closely with children also stand to benefit.
        As for kids themselves, it's hard to think of any whose lives won't be improved by adults who have invested themselves in practicing co-regulation, Marchette says.
        But practicing co-regulation skills with certain children and adolescents — including those whose families are experiencing economic hardship, substance abuse, divorce, or other distressing situations — can be especially important.
        Is there evidence that co-regulation works?
        ""While co-regulation is built upon a solid theoretical framework, not many studies have delved into its effectiveness — at least across all age groups,"" Marchette says. ""Research that does focuses mainly on infants and preschoolers.""
        ""Much less is known about how co-regulation interventions work for older youth,"" she says. ""The research is trying to catch up to what we know from years of clinical experience.""
        How can a parent coach a child through co-regulation?
        Co-regulation doesn't stand alone as a skill. It relies on fostering a warm, responsive relationship with children, providing structure, and setting limits. ""Children benefit from consistent, predictable routines with clear expectations and consequences,"" Marchette says.
        When a child begins experiencing big emotions, a co-regulation response will look different depending on the child and circumstances. But the steps to take are similar.
        ""First, the parent needs to pause and self-regulate their own emotions, such as by taking a deep breath,"" Marchette explains. ""The next steps are validating the child's feelings, observing the child's response, and then deciding how to respond next, including verbally and nonverbally, such as with a touch.""
        Marchette offers an example based on her own practice: 12-year-old ""Eric"" is tackling a writing assignment in his bedroom when his mother suddenly hears loud noises. She walks to his door and finds him throwing a stapler, notebook, and container of pens off his desk. ""What's wrong with me?"" he yells. ""I suck at writing and I hate school!"" Then Eric puts his head down on his desk.
        The sixth grader's mom knows he needs help calming down, so she pauses and takes a deep breath. Then she walks over and whispers his name, placing her hand on his shoulder. After more silence, Eric gradually starts sitting up in his chair. ""I can tell how frustrated you are with this assignment,"" she says to him, validating his feelings. ""It must be a really challenging one.""
        Eric's mother knows he needs a break after he mutters, ""I can't do it."" She suggests a getting a glass of ice-cold water, and Eric glumly follows her to the kitchen.

        What resources can help parents practice co-regulation?
        The Administration for Children and Families offers a free Co-Regulation in Action video series. And some therapists — especially those who specialize in behavioral parent training or cognitive behavioral therapy — can help parents who feel their skills need a boost.
        It's worth noting that it can be hard to have sufficient resources — emotional, financial, and other supports — to practice co-regulation consistently. Those who wish to try should give themselves some grace as they learn the process. ""Even parents who are thinking their own self-regulation skills aren't where they want them to be should realize this is a muscle they can strengthen,"" Marchette says. ""It's important to have that growth mindset.""",Maureen Salamon,"April 3, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/acetaminophen-safety-be-cautious-but-not-afraid,Acetaminophen safety: Be cautious but not afraid,"Cold, cough, and flu season is a good time to revisit the risks of acetaminophen — the pain and fever reliever in Tylenol and many other over-the-counter medications. Billions of doses of acetaminophen are consumed safely every year, but deaths still occur from accidental overdoses and thousands of people end up in the emergency room. More than 600 products contain acetaminophen, and inadvertently combining them can nudge you into the red zone.
        People don't realize that these doses all add up, and before you know it you've exceeded the recommended dose of acetaminophen.
        Acetaminophen safe dosage basics
        Acetaminophen controls pain and fever but does not reduce inflammation, as does aspirin and the other widely consumed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, generics) and naproxen (Aleve, generics). But unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not irritate the stomach and intestinal lining. That means a person who cannot tolerate NSAIDs can still take acetaminophen. It's an important drug for controlling chronic pain in older adults.
        The hitch is that acetaminophen also has a narrower window of safety compared with ibuprofen and naproxen. NSAIDs can make you sick, too, but it takes a larger amount to reach a dangerous overdose. Taking too much acetaminophen can damage the liver, sometimes leading to a liver transplant or death.
        The body breaks down most of the acetaminophen in a normal dose and eliminates it in the urine. But some of the drug is converted into a byproduct that is toxic to the liver. If you take too much — all at once or over a period of days—more toxin can build up than the body can handle.
        For the average healthy adult, the absolute maximum daily dose is no more than 4,000 milligrams (mg) from all sources. But in some people, doses close to the 4,000 mg daily limit for adults could still be toxic to the liver. It's safest to take only what you need, and to not exceed 3,000 mg a day whenever possible, especially if you use acetaminophen often.
        How to stay within limits
        If you ever have concerns about how much acetaminophen you can tolerate based on your age, body size, and health status, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Here are some general precautions for avoiding an accidental overdose of acetaminophen.
        
          Cold and flu remedies count. When you reach for an over-the-counter cough, cold, or flu product, take a look at the label. Does it contain acetaminophen?
          Know the milligrams in your pills. In acetaminophen products available over the counter, each pill may contain 325, 500, or 650 milligrams of the drug. Be extra cautious when taking 500 or 650 milligram pills.
          Stick to recommended doses. When taking acetaminophen, don't be tempted to add a little extra to the recommended dose. A small-bodied person should stay on the low end of the recommended dose range (3,000 mg).
          Easy on the alcohol. Drinking alcohol causes the liver to convert more of the acetaminophen you take into toxic byproducts. Men should not have more than two standard drinks per day when taking acetaminophen (one drink per day for women).
          Know if your medications interact. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your prescription medications could interact badly with acetaminophen.
        
        How much should you worry?
        Tens of thousands of people become ill every year from taking too much acetaminophen. In a smaller number of cases—several hundred per year — it leads to death. But it need not happen to you. Read the labels in all your over-the-counter and prescription drugs to look at the specific amounts of acetaminophen in each, and stick to the guidelines.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response,Understanding the stress response,"A stressful situation — whether something environmental, such as a looming work deadline, or psychological, such as persistent worry about losing a job — can trigger a cascade of stress hormones that produce well-orchestrated physiological changes. A stressful incident can make the heart pound and breathing quicken. Muscles tense and beads of sweat appear.
        This combination of reactions to stress is also known as the ""fight-or-flight"" response because it evolved as a survival mechanism, enabling people and other mammals to react quickly to life-threatening situations. The carefully orchestrated yet near-instantaneous sequence of hormonal changes and physiological responses helps someone to fight the threat off or flee to safety. Unfortunately, the body can also overreact to stressors that are not life-threatening, such as traffic jams, work pressure, and family difficulties.
        Over the years, researchers have learned not only how and why these reactions occur, but have also gained insight into the long-term effects chronic stress has on physical and psychological health. Over time, repeated activation of the stress response takes a toll on the body. Research suggests that chronic stress contributes to high blood pressure, promotes the formation of artery-clogging deposits, and causes brain changes that may contribute to anxiety, depression, and addiction. More preliminary research suggests that chronic stress may also contribute to obesity, both through direct mechanisms (causing people to eat more) or indirectly (decreasing sleep and exercise).
        Sounding the alarm
        The stress response begins in the brain (see illustration). When someone confronts an oncoming car or other danger, the eyes or ears (or both) send the information to the amygdala, an area of the brain that contributes to emotional processing. The amygdala interprets the images and sounds. When it perceives danger, it instantly sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus.
        
          
            
              
                Command center
                
                  
                
                When someone experiences a stressful event, the amygdala, an area of the brain that contributes to emotional processing, sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus. This area of the brain functions like a command center, communicating with the rest of the body through the nervous system so that the person has the energy to fight or flee.
              
            
          
        
        The hypothalamus is a bit like a command center. This area of the brain communicates with the rest of the body through the autonomic nervous system, which controls such involuntary body functions as breathing, blood pressure, heartbeat, and the dilation or constriction of key blood vessels and small airways in the lungs called bronchioles. The autonomic nervous system has two components, the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system functions like a gas pedal in a car. It triggers the fight-or-flight response, providing the body with a burst of energy so that it can respond to perceived dangers. The parasympathetic nervous system acts like a brake. It promotes the ""rest and digest"" response that calms the body down after the danger has passed.
        After the amygdala sends a distress signal, the hypothalamus activates the sympathetic nervous system by sending signals through the autonomic nerves to the adrenal glands. These glands respond by pumping the hormone epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) into the bloodstream. As epinephrine circulates through the body, it brings on a number of physiological changes. The heart beats faster than normal, pushing blood to the muscles, heart, and other vital organs. Pulse rate and blood pressure go up. The person undergoing these changes also starts to breathe more rapidly. Small airways in the lungs open wide. This way, the lungs can take in as much oxygen as possible with each breath. Extra oxygen is sent to the brain, increasing alertness. Sight, hearing, and other senses become sharper. Meanwhile, epinephrine triggers the release of blood sugar (glucose) and fats from temporary storage sites in the body. These nutrients flood into the bloodstream, supplying energy to all parts of the body.
        All of these changes happen so quickly that people aren't aware of them. In fact, the wiring is so efficient that the amygdala and hypothalamus start this cascade even before the brain's visual centers have had a chance to fully process what is happening. That's why people are able to jump out of the path of an oncoming car even before they think about what they are doing.
        As the initial surge of epinephrine subsides, the hypothalamus activates the second component of the stress response system — known as the HPA axis. This network consists of the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the adrenal glands.
        The HPA axis relies on a series of hormonal signals to keep the sympathetic nervous system — the ""gas pedal"" — pressed down. If the brain continues to perceive something as dangerous, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which travels to the pituitary gland, triggering the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This hormone travels to the adrenal glands, prompting them to release cortisol. The body thus stays revved up and on high alert. When the threat passes, cortisol levels fall. The parasympathetic nervous system — the ""brake"" — then dampens the stress response.
        Techniques to counter chronic stress
        Many people are unable to find a way to put the brakes on stress. Chronic low-level stress keeps the HPA axis activated, much like a motor that is idling too high for too long. After a while, this has an effect on the body that contributes to the health problems associated with chronic stress.
        Persistent epinephrine surges can damage blood vessels and arteries, increasing blood pressure and raising risk of heart attacks or strokes. Elevated cortisol levels create physiological changes that help to replenish the body's energy stores that are depleted during the stress response. But they inadvertently contribute to the buildup of fat tissue and to weight gain. For example, cortisol increases appetite, so that people will want to eat more to obtain extra energy. It also increases storage of unused nutrients as fat.
        Fortunately, people can learn techniques to counter the stress response.
        Relaxation response. At the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital people learn how to counter the stress response by using a combination of approaches that elicit the relaxation response. These include deep abdominal breathing, focus on a soothing word (such as peace or calm), visualization of tranquil scenes, repetitive prayer, yoga, and tai chi.
        Most of the early research evaluated how effective the relaxation response is at countering chronic stress in people with hypertension and other forms of cardiovascular disease. Those results suggest the technique may be worth trying — although for most people it is not a cure-all. For example, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 122 patients with hypertension, ages 55 and older, in which half were assigned to relaxation response training and the other half to a control group that received information about blood pressure control. After eight weeks, 34 of the people who practiced the relaxation response — a little more than half — had achieved a systolic blood pressure reduction of more than 5 mm Hg, and were therefore eligible for the next phase of the study, in which they could reduce levels of blood pressure medication they were taking. 
        Physical activity. People can use exercise to stifle the buildup of stress in several ways. Exercise, such as taking a brisk walk shortly after feeling stressed, not only deepens breathing but also helps relieve muscle tension. Movement therapies such as yoga, tai chi, and qi gong combine fluid movements with deep breathing and mental focus, all of which can induce calm.
        Social support. Confidants, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, relatives, spouses, and companions all provide a life-enhancing social net — and may increase longevity. It's not clear why, but the buffering theory holds that people who enjoy close relationships with family and friends receive emotional support that indirectly helps to sustain them at times of chronic stress and crisis.",Unknown,"April 3, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-to-recognize-the-signs-of-mental-health-issues,How to recognize the signs of mental health issues,"People too often don't recognize that an underlying mental health problem is why they feel unwell.
        A study published in the September 2023 issue of The Lancet Psychiatry analyzed data collected over 20-plus years from more than 150,000 adults across 29 countries. The results showed that about half of people will develop at least one mental disorder by age 75. Among men, the most common disorders were depression, phobias, and alcohol use disorder.
        Why may this be the case? ""Older adults are vulnerable to mental disorders because they are exposed to many life-changing and traumatic events like health issues, the death of loved ones, and physical limitations,"" says Dr. Ronald Kessler, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School and one of the study's co-leaders. ""Many also don't recognize the signs of a mental disorder and thus don't seek medical help, which can make the disorder worse.""
        Here are the warning signs and symptoms for depression, phobias, and alcohol use disorder that men should look out for. ""Men should find comfort in knowing that they are not alone when dealing with a mental disorder,"" says Dr. Kessler. ""Effective treatments are available, so they don't have to spend their life in pain.""
        Depression
        A depressed man may gain or lose weight, eat more or less than usual, have difficulty concentrating, and have trouble sleeping or sleep more than usual. He also may battle fatigue and low energy, so even small tasks may appear impossible to manage. Other symptoms of depression include one or more of the following:
        
          persistent sad or ""empty"" mood
          loss of enjoyment in favorite activities
          feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
          feelings of worthlessness and guilt about a specific life experience or in general
          increased boredom and apathy
          trouble concentrating or making decisions
          restlessness or irritability.
        
        Get help. Speak with your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms most days for two weeks or longer. The doctor can refer you for counseling, prescribe an antidepressant, or both.
        Phobias
        A phobia is a persistent, excessive, unrealistic fear of an object, person, animal, activity, or situation. Phobias are a type of anxiety disorder.
        A man with a phobia either tries to avoid the object or situation that triggers the fear or endures it with great anxiety and distress. He also may overreact to a potential threat. Some examples of common phobias are fear of heights, public places, social situations, or closed spaces.
        Physical symptoms may include rapid heartbeat, shallow or rapid breathing, sweating, dizziness, upset stomach (cramps, nausea, diarrhea), headaches, and general pains. (Symptoms such as these also may lead to a diagnosis of panic disorder.) It's also common for men with an anxiety disorder to suffer from depression and struggle with low self-esteem.
        Get help. The first step to dealing with a phobia is to try to identify the underlying cause and possible stressors. You may be referred to a mental health professional for evaluation and treatment. Treatment for an anxiety disorder often includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy.
        Alcohol use disorder
        Today many experts recommend that people limit their alcohol use to no more than a single standard drink per day. In the United States, a standard drink is approximately 12 ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol by volume, or ABV), 5 ounces of wine (12% ABV), or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof spirits (40% ABV).
        Moderate drinking wanders into excessive alcohol use disorder when someone regularly drinks more than he planned and continues to drink despite the concerns of others and frequent attempts to cut down or quit. He also may indulge in binge drinking (consuming five or more drinks on one occasion).
        After a man becomes dependent on alcohol, he will usually develop withdrawal symptoms such as headache, nausea and vomiting, anxiety, and fatigue if he can't get a drink.
        Get help. Your doctor can help diagnose alcohol use disorder through a series of screening questions. Treatment consists of a combination of psychotherapy, and medication, and participation in self-help groups like Alcoholics Anonymous.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/weighing-the-dangers-of-extra-weight,Weighing the dangers of extra weight,"An estimated 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI), a calculation that takes into account both height and weight.
        Standard definitions consider a healthy BMI as between 18.5 and 24.9, overweight as 25 to 29.9, and obese as 30 and higher. (Calculate your BMI using this online tool.)
        While far from perfect, BMI offers a simple gauge of whether someone's weight might pose a problem. Studies have found that a BMI higher than 25 increases your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and some types of cancer.
        But what if you have put on only a little extra weight in recent years — say, five pounds or so — and your BMI doesn't fall into the category of overweight? Is that still cause for concern?
        ""Any excess weight can pose a health risk and affect one's daily life,"" says Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""When you carry extra pounds, you also are more susceptible to joint pain, low energy, and problems sleeping.""
        Yet the greatest threat is the potential for gaining even more weight. ""It's easy for five pounds to quickly turn into 10 pounds and then 15 pounds, and as the weight increases, so do the health risks,"" says Dr. Willett.
        Why do you gain weight?
        It's common for men to gain some weight with age. Metabolism naturally slows, and lean muscle mass steadily declines, both of which cause the body to burn calories at a slower rate. In addition, most men consume more daily calories than they need."" When you take in extra calories and don't burn them off, they will be stored as fat,"" says Dr. Willett.
        But where you accumulate that extra fat is the real issue with weight gain.
        Based on its location, fat can be described as either subcutaneous or visceral. Subcutaneous fat is located just under the skin. Visceral fat lies deep within the abdominal cavity and pads the spaces between your abdominal organs.
        Of the two, visceral fat is more dangerous, as high amounts are linked with heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and high cholesterol levels. Do you have too much visceral fat? Check your waist size. ""For men, a waist of 40 inches or more is considered a sign of excess visceral fat,"" says Dr. Willett. ""But even a small change in your clothing, like pants that now feel snug or having to change notches in your belt, are signs of increasing visceral fat.""
        What is your ideal weight?
        There's no one-size-fits-all number for a person's ideal weight. The number depends on age, genetics, body frame, medical history, and average weight as a young adult.
        ""Your BMI can offer a clue about whether you need to lose excess weight, but consulting with your doctor can help determine your ideal healthy weight range,"" says Dr. Willett.
        Still, you should not ignore even small weight changes. ""A little weight gain may seem normal for many men, but that doesn't mean they should accept it and not do anything about it,"" says Dr. Willett. ""It's easier to make modest adjustments now than to wait until you gain a lot more weight.""
        You can turn back those extra pounds with a combination of aerobic exercise, strength training, and a healthy diet.
        Experts recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (for example, brisk walking, running, swimming, or cycling) most days of the week, plus at least two weekly weight or resistance training sessions to maintain muscle mass and strength. To avoid putting on more pounds, stick with a diet that prioritizes plant-based foods, like the Mediterranean or DASH diet.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/deep-vein-blood-clots-are-you-at-risk,Deep-vein blood clots: Are you at risk?,"If you cut or scrape your skin, blood clots come to the rescue to stop the bleeding. But clots that stop blood flow inside your body are a different story. If a clot blocks an artery supplying the heart or brain, it can trigger a heart attack or stroke.
        Clots can also form inside the veins, leading to a less familiar problem called venous thromboembolism. Most often, venous clots develop deep inside the leg, a condition known as deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). A more serious threat occurs if a clot breaks free and travels to one of the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE).
        Every year, an estimated 600,000 people in the United States have a DVT, and about 400,000 have a PE. But many people aren't aware of the symptoms (see ""Symptoms of venous thromboembolism"") or the potentially serious nature of venous clots.

        Who is at risk?
        ""In addition to recognizing the signs and symptoms of DVT, it's important to know that there are certain conditions and situations that put people at higher risk,"" says Dr. Behnood Bikdeli, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Anyone can develop a venous clot, but the risk rises with age. These are some other factors that leave people more vulnerable to a DVT:
        Decreased blood flow. The underlying reason is usually inactivity due to extended bed rest, prolonged travel (five hours or longer ), paralysis, or stroke.
        Hospitalization. Being hospitalized for any reason raises your risk.
        Recent major surgery. Clot risk remains high at least 30 days following a surgery such as a joint replacement, heart surgery, or hysterectomy.
        Major trauma or injury. This might be a serious car accident, a broken bone, or a severe muscle injury.
        Chronic medical conditions. These include obesity, varicose veins, heart failure, cancer, lung disease, kidney disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.
        Increased estrogen. Pregnancy or the use of birth control pills or hormone therapy (especially estrogen therapy) increases risk.
        Clotting disorder. Between 5% and 8% of people have one of several inherited disorders that make them more likely to develop clots.
        A COVID-19 infection (especially one that requires hospitalization) also leaves people more prone to venous thromboembolism, says Dr. Bikdeli. While some of the risk comes from being bedridden, COVID-19 in particular tends to promote inflammation, which encourages clot formation.
        
          
            
              
                Symptoms of venous thromboembolism
                Deep-vein thrombosis: These clots usually develop in the lower leg, thigh, or pelvis but occasionally the arm. The affected area may be

        Diagnosing and treating clots
        Testing may include a blood test for D-dimer, a protein fragment that forms as a byproduct of clot breakdown. Levels are often elevated in people with DVT or PE. People with low levels and no predisposing conditions may not need further testing. Imaging tests, such as ultrasonography of the veins, can confirm a DVT, while a person with a suspected PE will need a CT or other specialized scan.
        Treatment usually includes anti-clotting drugs such as apixaban (Eliquis) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto); very sick people may need injectable clot-preventing medications such as heparin. People usually stay on the oral drugs for several months and sometimes longer, especially if they have chronic health conditions that contribute to their risk, says Dr. Bikdeli. If that's the case for you, find a clinician who can give you targeted advice about preventing future clots with respect to exercise, travel, and any future surgeries, he suggests.
        If you have to sit for long stretches, the following tips may help prevent DVT:
        
          Walk around every hour or two.
          Flex and extend your ankles and knees every once in a while.
          Avoid crossing your legs.
          Change positions often while seated.

        Completed in 2016, the LOOK AHEAD trial followed more than 5,000 people for 12 years. It showed that a portion-controlled diet combined with exercise could help people with diabetes lose weight. Over all, however, their risk of heart disease did not decrease.
        Published in the March 2024 issue of Diabetologia, the new study looked specifically at LOOK AHEAD participants (about 18% of the total) who showed some evidence of diabetes remission, defined as needing no diabetes medications and a close-to-normal blood sugar value at some point in time.
        Those who achieved remission had a 40% lower rate of cardiovascular disease and a 33% lower rate of chronic kidney disease compared with those who didn't achieved remission. The authors say the benefits likely stemmed from improvement in the participants' weight, fitness, blood sugar, and LDL (bad) cholesterol.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/update-on-atrial-fibrillation,Update on atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation causes a rapid, chaotic heartbeat that usually comes and goes without warning. Commonly known as afib, it's caused by electrical misfires in the heart's upper chambers (atria). While some people don't notice any symptoms, others feel a fluttering, pounding sensation in their chest and may become lightheaded, dizzy, and breathless during a bout of afib. But the real danger is a heightened risk of serious strokes (see ""Atrial fibrillation and stroke"").
        An estimated one in 11 people ages 65 and older have afib, which becomes more common with age. ""There are many things you can do to both lower your risk and prevent the progression of afib,"" says Dr. Moussa Mansour, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of the Atrial Fibrillation Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. In fact, lifestyle modifications are now a prominent focus of the latest guidelines for managing afib, he says. Here's a summary of the updated recommendations, published Jan. 2, 2024, in the journal Circulation.
        
          
            
              
                Atrial fibrillation and stroke
                
                  
                
                During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (atria) quiver rapidly instead of contracting forcefully. Blood pools along the walls of the left atrium, eventually forming clots that may break free to travel through the left ventricle (lower chamber) to the aorta (the large vessel carrying blood out of the heart). If the clot lodges in an artery to the brain, it may block blood flow and cause an ischemic stroke.

        Alcohol and caffeine advice
        ""The most important advice is about alcohol use, which is one of the first things my patients ask about,"" says Dr. Mansour. Strong evidence from multiple studies shows that drinking alcohol raises the risk of afib. There's no magic number of drinks considered safe or risky, although the guidelines suggest no more than one per day. But it's clear that the less alcohol you drink, the better, he says.
        People also wonder if they should avoid coffee. In some people, caffeine seems to trigger palpitations — the sensation of a skipped, missed, or strong heartbeat. Still, observational studies haven't shown any increased risk of afib among coffee drinkers. In fact, one found that people who drink one to three cups of coffee daily are less likely to have afib than people who drink lower or higher amounts. ""Caffeine doesn't seem to be something people need to worry about,"" says Dr. Mansour.
        Weight
        Excess weight, on the other hand, is an issue for many people. Obesity, which is defined as a body mass index or BMI of 30 or higher, promotes afib on several fronts. First, it can worsen high blood pressure, and second, it makes people more prone to obstructive sleep apnea. ""In addition, clinical studies show that obesity increases fat around the heart,"" says Dr. Mansour. This promotes inflammation of the heart muscle, which may lead to changes in the structure of the atria, spurring the onset and progression of afib, he adds.
        The guidelines recommend that people strive for a BMI of 27 or lower. Research suggests that even modest weight loss (about 10% of your body weight) can help keep your heart rhythm more stable and is linked to better outcomes following treatment for afib.
        Exercise
        Exercise not only supports weight loss, it can also lower afib burden, which refers to both the duration and frequency of afib. The afib guidelines suggest 210 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, which may also help reduce afib symptoms. But Dr. Mansour keeps the advice to his patients simple: ""Aim for three to four hours of exercise every week, at a level of effort that's more than a casual walk, but nothing too crazy,"" he says.
        However, dedicated exercise buffs who work out far more than the average person can still develop afib. ""If you trained for marathons in your 30s and keep up that level of intensity into your 60s, the recommendation is to do less exercise if you develop afib,"" says Dr. Mansour. But if exercise is a big deal for you and important for your mental health, there's no hard-and-fast rule about dialing back, he says.
        Sleep
        Dr. Mansour recommends that anyone with afib who snores should be tested for sleep apnea, a condition marked by brief pauses in breathing that often triggers loud snoring, grunts, and gasps. More than one in five people with afib have sleep apnea, and treating the problem may lessen afib recurrence.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/afraid-to-visit-the-doctor,Afraid to visit the doctor?,"Even after many years of seeing Dr. Daniel Sands, a primary care doctor at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Maggie could best be described as a reluctant patient. ""She was deathly afraid of doctors and hospitals and very anxious every time she came in, but knew she had to sometimes,"" Dr. Sands recalls.
        But Maggie's hesitancy cost her dearly, preventing her from getting care that might have kept her healthier and stronger. She skipped vaccinations against illnesses that could worsen her chronic lung disease. And although she had terrible arthritis in her knees, she refused to even consider joint replacement surgery to make her more comfortable and mobile.
        Maggie (whose name has been changed to protect her privacy) is a prime example of medical anxiety, a sometimes crippling fear of doctors and medical settings. It's a pervasive issue: in 2023, nearly half of American adults reported feeling anxious before a doctor's appointment, an increase from 39% the previous year, according to a nationally representative survey of 2,000 people by market research company OnePoll.
        Dr. Sands sees patients with medical anxiety once or twice a month and encounters a severe case like Maggie's a few times a year. But four in 10 adults polled in 2023 said their anxiety compels them to put off seeing a doctor — a decision with potentially wide-ranging health implications.
        Serious consequences
        Why is health care hesitancy dangerous? It can dissuade people from seeking ongoing monitoring (such as cholesterol and blood pressure checks) or cancer screenings (such as mammograms and colorectal exams). Such anxiety can even stop some people from taking care of serious issues that might shorten their lives.
        ""So much of what we do depends on follow-up,"" Dr. Sands says. ""If you miss a cancer screening, you have a higher risk of developing cancer. With uncontrolled high blood pressure, you could have a stroke or heart attack or develop kidney or heart failure. Poorly controlled diabetes greatly increases the risk for heart attacks, kidney failure, blindness, and even amputations.""
        ""Depending on what the problem is, all those things are at play,"" he says. ""At worst,"" he adds, ""you could die before your time.""
        List of triggers
        Medical anxiety differs from health anxiety or hypochondria, which involves an extreme preoccupation with developing serious illnesses such as cancer, heart problems, or neurological illnesses. But it may overlap with ""white-coat hypertension,"" a surge in blood pressure experienced by as many as 30% of people when measured during a doctor's visit, according to American Heart Association research.
        For these folks, white-coat hypertension is essentially a fight-or-flight response marked by an increase in stress hormones. The trigger might be the stress of getting to the doctor's, or just the sight of a doctor. (The reaction is named for the traditional white lab coat many clinicians wear.) ""It might be the antiseptic smell of the doctor's office,"" Dr. Sands says. ""And for some people, it might just be being touched.""
        People who have undergone trauma or abuse may be especially prone to medical anxiety, Dr. Sands says. What else can provoke fear? Needles or shots are on the list, along with the prospect of a painful test or procedure or receiving bad news or a serious diagnosis. Those latter two reasons were cited by about 40% of the 2023 poll respondents who reported medical anxiety.
        Try relaxation techniques. Meditation or deep breathing can help allay anxiety while you're in the waiting room. ""It's a great way to relax and bring your blood pressure down,"" Dr. Sands says.
        
          
            
              
                Does asking for a second opinion insult your doctor?
                If your home needed a new roof, you might get quotes from several companies before making such a weighty financial decision. So why wouldn't you seek advice from more than one doctor if you're facing a weighty medical matter?
                Seeking a second opinion is fairly common. But some people are concerned their doctor would be insulted by the request—though they shouldn't be, says Dr. Daniel Sands, a primary care doctor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
                ""Patients should feel comfortable asking for a second opinion,"" Dr. Sands says. ""It shouldn't be a personal affront or a matter of ego to a doctor—it should be a matter of being open to hearing what another health professional says.""
                Most situations don't call for a second opinion. You don't need one for a minor health problem. And if you're pleased with your care, you don't need to ask if another doctor would approach it differently.
                But wanting a second opinion doesn't necessarily mean you don't trust your doctor. In certain situations, it's just wise to do so—especially if you need major surgery or cancer treatment, Dr. Sands says.
                ""For any life-changing diagnosis or potentially fatal condition, a second opinion is called for,"" he says. ""Cancer is a good example, since there may be more than one way to treat it, so it might be worthwhile to get information from two or three separate places.""
                If you feel trepidation about asking for a second opinion, Dr. Sands offers this approach. ""Ideally, I'd say, 'I appreciate the time you spent with me and the thought you've put into this. I think you'll understand why I'd like to get a second opinion. Is there someone you recommend I consult with?' A lot of times, they'll point you toward someone specific,"" he says.
                If you're uncomfortable with that tactic, Dr. Sands suggests speaking with your primary care doctor and asking for her guidance. ""She can help set up a second opinion,"" he says.
                If your doctor does seem insulted by your request, you don't need to confront her—but you should still follow your instincts. ""End your appointment in a normal way and seek a second opinion elsewhere,"" Dr. Sands says.
              
            
          
        
        Ways to cope
        Anxiety about medical care doesn't usually exist in a vacuum, Dr. Sands says. People with it often have generalized anxiety that also crops up outside of health care settings. ""In my experience, going to the doctor only makes it worse,"" he says.
        Dr. Sands recommends that people with medical anxiety seek treatment, which may include psychotherapy, medication, or both. ""These kinds of situations often call for professional help,"" he says.
        He offers these additional coping strategies if doctors or medical settings make you anxious:
        Identify what worries you. Doing so may take its power away or prod ideas about how to respond. ""If you can identify your triggers, you can try to talk yourself through them,"" he says. ""But you should also share them with your doctor. If your doctor doesn't ask, say, 'These are things that make me concerned or anxious.'""
        Do a cost-benefit analysis. Weigh the long-term health benefits of getting needed health care against your short-term discomfort. This is perhaps easier said than done when you're anxious, Dr. Sands acknowledges.
        Bring someone along. Having a trusted companion at your side during your appointment can calm frayed nerves.
        Request sedatives. Short-acting medications may help you stay more relaxed during anxiety-provoking procedures, but they can also involve drawbacks, such as being unable to drive afterward. For more involved, longer procedures, your doctor may have the option to perform them under anesthesia. Using either sedatives or anesthetics involves carefully weighing the risks and benefits. Ask your doctor about the pros and cons.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/appropriate-use-of-testosterone-therapy-does-not-appear-to-raise-prostate-cancer-risk,Appropriate use of testosterone therapy does not appear to raise prostate cancer risk,"A study published online Dec. 27, 2023, by JAMA Network Open confirms prior research showing that testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in men with documented low testosterone levels does not increase their risk of prostate cancer compared to men not using TRT.
        Researchers recruited 5,246 men with hypogonadism (a condition in which the testes don't produce enough testosterone), no family history of prostate cancer, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of less than 3 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml), a number associated with a low risk of prostate cancer. The researchers randomly divided the men into two groups.
        For 14 months, the men used either a topical testosterone gel at a dose designed to maintain normal testosterone levels, or an inactive (placebo) gel. Researchers measured PSA levels and conducted digital rectal exams of the prostate at regular intervals over the next three years. By the end of that period, the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer was equally low in both the testosterone and placebo groups. Those in the TRT group did see their PSA levels rise during the first year of using the gel. However, the increase was small, and PSA levels did not rise again after that, according to the researchers. The testosterone users also reported few symptoms of an enlarged prostate, such as frequent urination, difficulty urinating, and dripping.
        The study was limited to men with hypogonadism who had a low risk of prostate cancer, so it's not clear how TRT may affect higher-risk men or those who use testosterone in higher amounts, for longer periods of time, or for treating other conditions.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/night-owls-may-face-higher-diabetes-risks,Night owls may face higher diabetes risks,"Women who are night owls have a higher risk of developing diabetes and are more likely to practice unhealthful lifestyle habits compared with early birds, a new analysis suggests.
        In the Harvard-led study, published online Sept. 12, 2023, by Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers tracked nearly 64,000 female nurses ages 45 to 62 over eight years. The women had no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. Participants reported lifestyle behaviors that included diet quality, physical activity, alcohol use, body mass index, smoking, and sleep habits. They also reported whether they were diagnosed with diabetes.
        Women who fit an ""evening chronotype"" — preferring to stay up and wake up later — were 19% more likely to develop diabetes than those with a ""morning chronotype,"" who prefer to go to bed and wake up earlier. Additionally, night owls were 54% more likely than early birds to report unhealthy lifestyle behaviors such as smoking and poor sleep habits. Earlier research has also suggested that shorter or irregular sleep is linked with a higher risk of diabetes, the study authors noted. They theorized that ""circadian misalignment""—being a night owl, for example, but also working early morning shifts, which is common in nursing—could disrupt the body's ability to properly process sugar.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/two-workout-strategies-that-reduce-cardiovascular-disease-risk,Two workout strategies that reduce cardiovascular disease risk,"Doing regular aerobic exercise — the kind that works your heart and lungs — is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. Now, findings published online Jan. 17, 2024, by the European Heart Journal suggest that doing a combination of aerobics and strength training might reduce cardiovascular risk factors just as effectively. The study involved about 400 people (ages 35 to 70) classified as overweight or obese who also had high blood pressure. They were randomly assigned to one of four exercise programs: a 60-minute aerobic workout three times a week, a 60-minute strength training workout three times a week, a 60-minute combination of aerobics and strength training (30 minutes of each) three times a week, or no exercise at all. After one year, people in both the aerobics-only group and the combination exercise group (but not the strength-training-only group) had a significant reduction in a combined measure of cardiovascular risk factors, compared with people who didn't exercise. These risk factors included blood pressure, LDL (bad) cholesterol, blood sugar, and body fat. People doing the combined workouts also improved their muscle strength. What this means: it might be equally healthful to replace half of your aerobic workout with strength training, without adding additional exercise time.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/hearing-aid-use-linked-to-longer-life,Hearing aid use linked to longer life,"Hearing loss is a known risk factor for premature death. So will using hearing aids improve your longevity? Previous studies on the subject have been mixed. But new evidence published in the January 2024 issue of The Lancet Healthy Longevity offers hope. Researchers evaluated the hearing test results and questionnaire answers of almost 9,900 people (average age about 49 when the study began) who were followed for more than 10 years. After adjustments for participants' age, race, gender, level of hearing loss, medical history, socioeconomic status, other medical conditions, and type of insurance, the risk of premature death was 24% lower among people who used hearing aids regularly, compared with people who never used hearing aids. The study was observational and doesn't prove definitively that hearing aids protect people from early death; we'll need more evidence for that. However, we know that hearing aids can help people hear conversations again, which may help ward off loneliness and social isolation — two risk factors for many chronic diseases (including dementia) and early death. If you haven't been hearing as well lately (or at least, if that's what your family is telling you), it's best not to put off a hearing test.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-worst-headache-of-your-life,The worst headache of your life,"A terrible headache, like a migraine, can ruin your day and sideline you from activities. But the ""worst headache of your life"" is potentially much more dangerous. It's known as a ""thunderclap headache"" when the pain intensity surges within seconds to minutes. This worrisome symptom can be caused by a brain aneurysm — a weak spot on a brain artery that bulges like a little bubble on a hose.
        If that bubble ever leaks or bursts, it causes sudden, severe pain and bleeding that can be life-threatening. It requires an immediate call to 911.
        Who gets them?
        At any given time, up to 15 million people in the United States are believed to have brain aneurysms. But the aneurysms are hard to detect. They don't usually cause any symptoms unless they grow very large and push against nerves or unless they leak or rupture (which happens to about 30,000 people per year).
        To complicate matters, we don't know who'll develop a brain aneurysm. Most cases occur randomly and can happen to anyone at any age. Less frequently, brain aneurysms run in families. Risk factors for brain aneurysms include being female, older than 50, or a current smoker; having high blood pressure; and having a family history of brain aneurysms.
        Why they rupture
        Most of the time, brain aneurysms don't burst. In fact, you can have one your whole life and never know it.
        But certain features or lifestyle habits contribute to the risk of a rupture. ""The feature that is most predictive of rupture is the size of the aneurysm. Chronic high blood pressure and smoking may also lead to increased growth and rupture of the aneurysm,"" says Dr. Rose Du, director of cerebrovascular surgery at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Rupture symptoms
        When an aneurysm leaks or ruptures, it changes the pressure inside the skull. Normal pressure is very low. But as blood leaks out of the aneurysm and into the space around the brain, pressure skyrockets, causing damage, swelling, fluid buildup, and sudden, severe pain. ""Pain doesn't creep up; it's explosive and affects your entire head, not just one side or one spot,"" Dr. Du says. ""It's unlike any headache you've had before.""
        If the rupture is large, you also could become confused, nauseated, or sleepy. You may get blurry vision or a stiff neck, lose consciousness, and even slip into a coma. It could be fatal.
        If the leak is very small, Dr. Du says you'll experience sudden, severe headache pain, but probably not the other symptoms. You'll eventually feel better (in days to weeks) and you might assume that the event was just a horrible migraine.
        But it's important to note that a migraine comes on slowly. A headache from a brain aneurysm is sudden: five minutes ago you were perfectly fine, and suddenly you're in agony.
        
          
            
              
                Preventing brain aneurysm ruptures
                When an unruptured brain aneurysm is discovered — typically during imaging tests for other medical conditions — you may have several treatment options. ""First we have to decide if there's a high or low risk of rupture. That depends on your family history and the size and location of the aneurysm. If the aneurysm is small, we may just observe it periodically to make sure it isn't growing,"" says Dr. Rose Du, director of cerebrovascular surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
                If the rupture risk is high, and the aneurysm is about 5 millimeters wide or more, Dr. Du says your doctor may recommend a procedure to stop the flow of blood to the aneurysm. One option is traditional open brain surgery, during which doctors install a tiny clip at the neck of the aneurysm, where it meets the artery.
                Other procedures are less invasive, performed by threading a catheter (a long, thin tube) up through an artery and into the brain, where doctors can insert devices to route blood flow away from the aneurysm or materials that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm. The newest is an intrasaccular embolization device. It's basically a three-dimensional mesh shape, like a ball. You put it into the aneurysm to keep blood from going in,"" Dr. Du says.
                She also recommends making lifestyle changes, such as getting blood pressure under control and quitting smoking. ""If you quit smoking,"" Dr. Du says, ""your risk of rupture will go down.""
              
            
          
        
        Treating ruptured aneurysms
        Don't try to determine what type or degree of ""thunderclap"" headache you're experiencing. Any sudden, very severe headache is considered a life-threatening medical emergency and needs to be investigated at an emergency department as soon as possible.
        When the headache is due to a leaky or burst brain aneurysm, you might need to have fluid drained from the brain, and you might be eligible for a procedure to close off the aneurysm, depending on your condition.
        This might be performed with traditional open brain surgery or a less invasive procedure that involves inserting a catheter (a long, thin tube) up through an artery and into the brain.
        Prognosis
        It's important to emphasize that only a small minority of brain aneurysms rupture. And if one does, the person often survives, and may even recover completely.
        ""We now have a lot of very safe and effective treatments, and our critical care has steadily improved over the years so that most of our patients recover well afterward,"" Dr. Du says. ""The key is seeking care as soon as possible.""

Unfortunately, many people put off a call to the dentist — a potentially risky move, since dental problems can be more advanced than you realize.
        ""As we age, we can feel less pain in our teeth because the nerves inside them shrink, and dentin — a porous material beneath tooth enamel — builds up. So something can fester for a long time and turn into a bigger, more complex problem,"" says Dr. Lisa Thompson, a geriatric dentistry specialist at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
        Here's more on what causes dental pain, how to identify it, and when you should call your dentist or even 911.
        Tooth pain
        Tooth pain can stem from several problems. Perhaps the most common is a cavity, a tiny hole in the tooth. Plaque — a sticky mix of food particles and bacteria covering the outer layer of a tooth, the enamel — creates chemicals that break down the enamel. The deeper the cavity, the more likely the nerve in the tooth will be exposed, resulting in sharp pain and sensitivity to hot or cold foods. Those symptoms can also come from a cracked tooth or a cracked or loose filling, which can expose the nerve.
        Tooth pain might also be due to trauma, such as accidentally biting down on a fork. That can bruise the ligament holding your tooth in the jaw, generating an initially sharp and then dull ache in the tooth.
        If you experience tooth pressure when you bite down on food, have sinus pressure without nasal congestion, or a have a bad (acidic) taste in your mouth, it could be that a cavity or cracked tooth has led to a painful infection at the root of the tooth, creating a small pocket of pus called an abscess.
        Gum pain
        Gum pain tends to be an achy soreness rather than a sharp pain. It has many potential causes. It might be as simple as having sensitive gums, brushing your teeth too vigorously, or having irritation from a bit of food (such as a piece of popcorn) stuck in your teeth or in the space between your gum and teeth.
        Gum pain can also come from a cut if something poked you (such as a corn chip), irritation from toothpaste that contains sodium laurel sulfate, or canker sores (aphthous ulcers).
        Pain in the gums can also be due to dentures or partials that don't fit well or aren't cleaned regularly. ""You might see red bumps on the irritated area or have a burning sensation from a fungal infection,"" Dr. Thompson says.
        Another possibility: plaque buildup at the bottom of teeth is irritating the gums and causing gingivitis, an early stage of gum disease marked by swollen, bleeding gums. Untreated gingivitis can progress below the gum line (becoming periodontal disease). It can destroy the ligament holding the tooth in place as well as the bone, leading to gum pain, abscesses, and tooth loss. Signs of an abscess caused by gum disease include a pimple of pus on the gum or facial swelling.
        Jaw pain
        Jaw pain can be sudden and sharp, or a chronic tenderness that gradually increases over time.
        Dull, chronic jaw pain usually comes from a problem with the temporomandibular joint, where the jaw bone meets the skull on either side of your head. Trouble related to this joint is called a temporomandibular disorder, or TMD.
        ""You can get TMD from injury such as joint dislocation or from problems related to muscles, stress, arthritis, and even behaviors you aren't even aware of. Maybe you grind your teeth at night, chew gum, or bite on a pen,"" Dr. Thompson says.
        Be especially vigilant about a pain that suddenly affects your neck and lower jaw. That can be a form of the pain called angina caused by narrowed heart arteries — or it could even be a symptom of a heart attack. Heart-related jaw pain can occur without the more common heart attack symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath.
        What you should do
        Sudden neck and lower jaw pain can signal an emergency. Call 911, especially if you have known heart problems.
        All other tooth, gum, and jaw pain should trigger a call to your dentist — as soon as possible if you suspect a cracked filling or tooth, gum disease, or an abscess.
        ""Bacteria from the abscess can get into the bloodstream, and can travel to other spaces in your body, such as your brain or heart. It can be life-threatening. If your dentist can't see you immediately, go to an emergency department, although there's not much they can do but give you antibiotics until you can get to a dentist,"" Dr. Thompson says. ""And if you suspect that your diet, behavior, or brushing habits might be causing pain, go ahead and experiment: get a soft toothbrush, use a Waterpik, switch toothpastes. And keep brushing and flossing your teeth every day.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/pill-free-pain-treatments-that-wont-break-the-bank,Pill-free pain treatments that won't break the bank,"One of the most effective elixirs for chronic pain is a total freebie. You can administer it at home, at any time, in any manner you choose. This bargain treatment is exercise. Yet not everyone takes advantage of its many pain-relieving benefits.
        A recent CDC study found that one in four adults relies exclusively on over-the-counter or prescription painkillers to treat chronic pain, despite recommendations to use pill-free alternatives.
        ""Some people feel there's no care given unless they end up with a prescription. Or they have barriers to drug-free therapies, including cost, a lack of knowledge, and poor access to care. But many treatments are free or low-cost and easily accessible,"" says Dr. Jennifer Kurz, a physiatrist who specializes in alternative pain management strategies at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        First, the free stuff
        Many strategies that reduce pain are activities that support a healthy lifestyle. Take exercise, for example. While it is sometimes difficult to exercise if you are in pain, it also can bring relief. ""It strengthens and loosens your muscles, reduces stress, promotes weight control, and helps improve mood and sleep. All of those work together to relieve pain,"" Dr. Kurz says.
        Other activities that help relieve pain include yoga, stretching, tai chi, deep breathing, mindfulness meditation, stress management, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and staying socially connected. Here are free (or very low-cost) ways to help you practice them.
        Online videos. YouTube has thousands of free videos that relate to these methods of pain reduction. For example, you can find videos of exercise routines for chronic pain, ways to improve sleep, and meditation for beginners. Make sure the instructor in the video is certified in his or her field. Or search for videos on the websites of large hospitals and nonprofit groups you trust.
        Apps. Health apps for chronic pain can guide you to meditate, exercise, and more. Look for apps that are free (or have a small fee per month), have good reviews, don't collect too much information from you, and have hundreds of thousands or millions of downloads. Examples include Curable; Manage My Pain; Migraine Buddy; Better Sleep; and (for meditation) Insight Timer, Calm, or Headspace.
        Health club memberships. Some health insurance plans, including some Medicare Advantage and Medigap plans, include a free fitness membership called Silver Sneakers. It gives you access to 14,000 fitness and recreation clubs across the country. You might even strike up conversations with other exercisers, which is great for staying socially connected.
        Online lectures or classes. Large hospitals, academic research centers, and nonprofit organizations frequently offer free or low-cost lectures or classes related to chronic pain treatment. For example, Dr. Kurz founded a pain management program called FINER, which features free lectures from Harvard-affiliated physiatrists, physical therapists, and pain psychologists. It also has videos and links to helpful apps, books, podcasts, and more on its website.
        And Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital offers numerous online exercise classes — most are designed for people with limited mobility — for a low fee (such as $5). Slots fill up quickly, so sign up early if you're interested.
        Support groups. Support groups for chronic pain promote social connection and feelings of hope and control. Look for online groups on Facebook (search ""chronic pain support"") or through large nonprofit chronic pain associations, such as the U.S. Pain Foundation's Pain Connection. Or join a local in-person support group (a local hospital can probably connect you to one).
        Reasonably priced treatments
        If you can afford to spend money on drug-free strategies to treat pain, be careful: many are bogus. But the following are safe, effective, and reasonably priced.
        Physical therapy. The No. 1 treatment for pain reduction, physical therapy involves working with a therapist who assesses your physical strengths and weaknesses and designs a customized program that includes exercise and other therapies. It's covered under most insurance plans, though you'll have to make co-pays. Otherwise physical therapy costs $100 to $200 per session.
        Dietitian services. A dietitian can design a balanced eating plan to help you lose weight (if you need to) and eliminate many inflammatory foods in your diet. ""That might help you reduce fat and chronic inflammation, which will have an effect on your mood, your sensitivity to pain, and your overall health,"" Dr. Kurz says. The average cost for a dietitian is $100 to $200 per session, and you may only need a few visits. Insurance might cover a portion of the costs.
        Acupuncture. This ancient Chinese practice involves inserting hair-thin needles into nerve junctions. It doesn't work for everyone, but we know it's safe (if done by a certified acupuncturist). It's covered by Medicare and many other insurance plans for common chronic pain diagnoses, like back pain, if the practitioner is a medical doctor. Otherwise, an average session costs about $100.
        Massage. Therapeutic massage helps muscles, tendons, and joints; it relieves stress and anxiety; and it might interrupt pain messages to and from the brain. The average cost for a therapeutic massage is about $60 per hour. It's not covered by Medicare, but might be covered by other insurance plans.
        In-person exercise classes. You might want to join a particular health club or perhaps a yoga, dance, or martial arts studio. Membership typically costs about $100 or more per month.
        Talk therapy. There are many approaches to cope with the emotional and psychological side of pain, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, which redirects negative thoughts about pain; mindfulness-based psychologies, which help you focus on the present; and pain reprocessing therapy, which helps the brain ""unlearn"" the response to chronic pain. You can find free lectures for these online, but if you'd like to work with a therapist, it will cost $100 to $200 per hour. Insurance doesn't always cover visits. ""Each therapy works in a different way,"" Dr. Kurz says, ""but they all help you change your relationship with pain, which is essential for feeling better.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/concern-about-rising-calcium-score,Concern about rising calcium score,"Q.
          I am a 70-year-old man with a strong family history of serious, often fatal coronary artery disease. I exercise daily and eat a healthy, plant-based diet. My BMI is 21, and although my cholesterol has always been low, I started taking a statin in 2018. In 2019, I got a calcium scan and my score was 290. A repeat test in 2022 showed a score of 385. What else can I do to control the calcium buildup?
        
        A. Your healthy habits sound right on track. And given your family history, getting a CT scan to check for coronary artery disease is a good plan. But as I explain to my patients, the name of the test — a coronary calcium scan, or just calcium scan — can give the wrong impression. We look for calcium on the scan, but calcium is not actually the problem — it's the cholesterol. Plaque that builds up inside an artery contains a central core of cholesterol, lots of inflammatory cells, some fibrotic cells (scar tissue), and calcium deposits. On a CT scan, the cholesterol is not visible, but the calcium is very easy to see. Because there's a close correlation between the amount of calcium and the amount of plaque, a calcium score is a good indicator of the amount of plaque.
        Treatments for coronary artery disease aim to reduce the cholesterol inside the plaque and replace it with scar tissue, which forms a thick cap on top of the cholesterol. That reduces the chance that the plaque will break open and cause a heart attack or stroke. However, there is more calcium in these stabilized plaques, which means an increase in calcium in a person receiving treatment can be a good finding.
        Other tests can provide more detailed pictures of plaque inside the heart's arteries. Cardiac CT angiography uses a special dye visible on x-rays to create a three-dimensional view of the heart's arteries. Even more sophisticated tests use artificial intelligence–based algorithms that can identify the different components within the plaque; two leading tests are Cleerly and HeartFlow. However, this type of testing is not included in the current guidelines for assessing coronary disease. Studies are under way to monitor improvements in the plaque and see if such information can help guide treatment.
        For people like you with a high risk of coronary artery disease, we recommend an LDL cholesterol value of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter, but the lower the better. I also suggest that you check your blood level of Lp(a), which is another type of ""bad"" cholesterol that contributes to plaque (see ""The latest on lipoprotein (a), an inherited cause of early heart disease"" in the February 2023 Heart Letter).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/green-poop-what-stool-color-can-indicate-about-health,Green poop: What stool color can indicate about health,"Question:
          My poop sometimes turns green. What can cause green poop? What do changes in stool color mean about your health?
        
        Answer: Temporary changes in stool color from the usual brown most often do not indicate a serious medical problem. But certain color changes may require medical attention, especially if you have other symptoms.
        Green poop
        Intermittent green stool in someone who otherwise feels fine is usually related to eating dark green vegetables, such as spinach and kale. Another reason for green poop is the rapid passage of green bile from the small intestine when a person has diarrhea. Medications, including bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol), iron supplements, and some antibiotics, may also result in greenish colored stool.
        Very pale brown stool
        Pale stools can be a sign of liver or gallbladder conditions. If insufficient bile is produced by the liver or there is a blockage of the bile duct, the bile salts that aid digestion can be greatly reduced. Examples of conditions that can lead to pale stools include hepatitis, cirrhosis, and gallstones. People with pale stools due to one of these problems often have jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) and cola-colored urine.
        Yellow stool
        Excess fat in poop can give stool a yellow color. An extremely high-fat diet might cause the color change. However, if stool is yellow, greasy, floats in the toilet bowl, and smells bad, that probably means there is a problem with fat absorption. This can occur from liver disease, pancreatitis, a bile or pancreatic duct blockage, or a small intestine condition such as celiac disease. Some infections such as giardiasis can also cause yellowish stool.
        Red poop
        Red poop always raises the possibility of blood in the stool. Small amounts of blood in the toilet bowl or on toilet paper are most often from hemorrhoids. Larger amounts of bright red blood should always prompt an immediate call for medical advice. If a person also has lightheadedness, then emergency evaluation is needed. Anyone with persistent or recurrent rectal bleeding, even in minimal amounts, should make an appointment with their doctor. Some red foods such as beets and tomatoes and red food dyes can also cause red poop.
        Black stool
        Tarry, foul-smelling black stool can indicate bleeding from the stomach or upper small intestine. Stomach acid and digestive enzymes convert blood from a red color to black. This always requires immediate medical attention. Iron supplements, bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol), and activated charcoal may blacken stool. Blood sausage, blueberries, and black licorice are also possible causes.","Howard E. LeWine, MD","April 1, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/recovering-from-an-ankle-sprain,Recovering from an ankle sprain,"All it takes is a simple misstep, and suddenly you have a sprained ankle. An ankle sprain is one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries in people of all ages, athletes and couch potatoes alike. The injury occurs when one or more of the ligaments in the ankle are stretched or torn, causing pain, swelling, and difficulty walking. Many people try to tough out ankle injuries and don't seek medical attention. But if an ankle sprain causes more than slight pain and swelling, it's important to see a clinician. Without proper treatment and rehabilitation, a severely injured ankle may not heal well and could lose its range of motion and stability, resulting in recurrent sprains and more downtime in the future.
        Anatomy of an ankle sprain
        The most common type of ankle sprain is an inversion injury, or lateral ankle sprain. The foot rolls inward, damaging the ligaments of the outer ankle — the anterior talofibular ligament, the calcaneofibular ligament, and the posterior talofibular ligament. (Ligaments are bands of fibrous tissue that connect one bone to another; see illustration.)

        Less common are sprains affecting the ligaments of the inner ankle (medial ankle sprains) and syndesmotic sprains, which injure the tibiofibular ligaments — the ligaments that join the two leg bones (the tibia and the fibula) just above the ankle. Syndesmotic sprains, which occur most often in contact sports, are especially likely to cause chronic ankle instability and subsequent sprains.
        The severity of an ankle sprain depends on how much damage it does and how unstable the joint becomes as a result. The more severe the sprain, the longer the recovery (see ""Grades of ankle sprain severity"").

        How to treat a sprained ankle
        The first goal is to decrease pain and swelling and protect the ligaments from further injury. This usually means adopting the classic RICE regimen — rest, ice, compression, and elevation. If you have severe pain and swelling, rest your ankle as much as possible for the first 24 to 48 hours. During that time, immerse your foot and ankle in cold water, or apply an ice pack (be sure to cover the ankle with a towel to protect the skin) for 15 to 20 minutes three times a day, or until the swelling starts to subside.
        To reduce swelling, compress the ankle with an elasticized wrap, such as an ACE bandage or elastic ankle sleeve. When seated, elevate your ankle as high as you comfortably can — to the height of your hip, if possible. In the first 24 hours, avoid anything that might increase swelling, such as hot showers, hot packs, or heat rubs.
        When to see your doctor
        Unless your symptoms are mild or improving soon after the injury, contact your clinician. He or she may want to see you immediately if your pain and swelling are severe, or if the ankle feels numb or if you can't bear weight. He or she will examine the ankle and foot and may manipulate them in various ways to determine the type of sprain and the extent of injury. This examination may be delayed for a few days until swelling and pain improve; in the meantime, continue with the RICE regimen.
        X-rays aren't routinely used to evaluate ankle injuries. Ligament problems are the source of most ankle pain, and ligaments don't show up on regular x-rays. To screen for fracture, clinicians often use a set of rules — called the Ottawa ankle rules, after the Canadian team that developed them — to identify areas of the foot where pain, tenderness, and inability to bear weight suggest a fracture. A review of studies involving more than 15,000 patients concluded that the Ottawa rules identified patients with ankle fractures more than 95% of the time.
        How to strengthen your ankle after a sprain
        To recover from an ankle sprain fully, you'll need to restore the normal range of motion to your ankle joint and strengthen its ligaments and supporting muscles. Studies have shown that people return to their normal activities sooner when their treatment emphasizes restoring ankle function — often with the aid of splints, braces, taping, or elastic bandages — rather than immobilization (such as use of a plaster cast). Called functional treatment, this strategy usually involves three phases: the RICE regimen in the first 24 to 48 hours to reduce pain, swelling, and risk of further injury; range-of-motion and ankle strengthening exercises within 48 to 72 hours; and training to improve endurance and balance once recovery is well under way.
        Generally, you can begin range-of-motion and stretching exercises within the first 48 hours and should continue until you're as free of pain as you were before your sprain. Start to exercise seated on a chair or on the floor. As your sprained ankle improves, you can progress to standing exercises. If your symptoms aren't better in two to four weeks, you may need to see a physical therapist or other specialist.

                Standing stretch. Stand one arm's length from the wall. Place the injured foot behind the other foot, toes facing forward. Keep your heels down and the back knee straight. Slowly bend the front knee until you feel the calf stretch in the back leg. Hold for 15–20 seconds. Repeat 3–5 times.
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
                Seated stretch. Loop an elasticized band or tubing around the ball of the foot. Keeping the knee straight, slowly pull back on the band until you feel the upper calf stretch. Hold for 15 seconds. Repeat 15–20 times.
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
                Rises. Stand facing a wall with your hands on the wall for balance. Rise up on your toes. Hold for 1 second, then lower yourself slowly to the starting position. Repeat 20–30 times. As you become stronger, do this exercise keeping your weight on just the injured side as you lower yourself down.
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
                Stretches. Stand with your toes and the ball of the affected foot on a book or the edge of a stair. Your heel should be off the ground. Use a wall, chair, or rail for balance. Hold your other foot off the ground behind you, with knee slightly bent. Slowly lower the heel. Hold the position for 1 second. Return to the starting position. Repeat up to 15 times, several times a day. This exercise can place a lot of stress on the ankle, so get your clinician's go-ahead before trying it.",Unknown,"March 28, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/managing-intrusive-thoughts,Managing intrusive thoughts,"It seems to come out of nowhere — a strange, disturbing thought or a troubling image that pops into your mind. It might be violent or sexual, or a recurring fear that you'll do something inappropriate or embarrassing. Whatever the content, it's often unsettling and may bring on feelings of worry or shame. The more you try to push the thought from your mind, the more it persists.
        Intrusive thoughts, as these are called, are thought to affect some six million Americans, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.
        Sometimes intrusive thoughts are associated with a mental health disorder, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, where thoughts become so bothersome that they prompt repetitive behaviors or compulsions to try to prevent them from occurring. They are also common in post-traumatic stress disorder, which can be triggered by a life-threatening or extremely stressful event, such as an accident or violent attack. But many people who experience these thoughts don't have a mental health disorder.
        Intrusive thoughts are often triggered by stress or anxiety. They may also be a short-term problem brought on by biological factors, such as hormone shifts. For example, a woman might experience an uptick in intrusive thoughts after the birth of a child.
        Any life stressor, if big enough, can increase your risk of having intrusive thoughts.
        While intrusive thoughts may be disturbing, they aren't harmful or mean that you have a secret desire to do the things that popped into your mind.
        Identifying intrusive thoughts
        So, how can you tell if you are experiencing intrusive thoughts? There are some signs to look for.
        The thought is unusual for you. An intrusive thought is usually very different from your typical thoughts. For example, it might be uncharacteristically violent.
        The thought is bothersome. If a thought is disturbing and it's something you want to push out of your mind, it might be an intrusive thought.
        The thought feels hard to control. Intrusive thoughts are often repetitive and won't go away.
        The more you think about an intrusive thoughts, it might make you more anxious and dwell on them even more. Instead of fighting intrusive thoughts, it's better to learn to live with them. When these thoughts emerge, try taking the following steps:
        1. Identify the thought as intrusive. Think to yourself, 'that's just an intrusive thought; it's not how I think, it's not what I believe, and it's not what I want to do.
        2. Don't fight with it. When you have an intrusive thought, just accept it. Don't try to make it go away.
        3. Don't judge yourself. Know that having a strange or disturbing thought doesn't indicate that something is wrong with you.
        When to seek help
        See a mental health professional if unwanted thoughts are starting to disrupt your daily life, particularly if they're impairing your ability to work or to do things you enjoy. However, even if intrusive thoughts aren't affecting your life in a significant way, you can still see someone to get help.
        Cognitive behavioral therapy is one strategy that is often successful in helping people manage intrusive thoughts. The process may help you to shift some of your general thought patterns, which can enable you to better manage these thoughts when they do occur and might lessen their frequency.
        Intrusive thoughts can also be managed by addressing the underlying problem, such as anxiety, stress, or a personal history of trauma. While it may be helpful to share the particular thoughts you are having, keep in mind that even if you aren't comfortable talking about them in detail, a therapist can still help. People should also know that intrusive thoughts typically respond well to therapy.
        Keep in mind that you might not need help forever. It may be a very short-term thing.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/headache-when-to-worry-what-to-do,"Headache: When to worry, what to do","Nearly everyone has had headache pain, and most of us have had it many times. A minor headache is little more than a nuisance that's relieved by an over-the-counter pain reliever, some food or coffee, or a short rest. But if your headache is severe or unusual, you might worry about stroke, a tumor, or a blood clot. Fortunately, such problems are rare. Still, you should know when a headache needs urgent care and how to control the vast majority of headaches that are not threatening to your health.
        What causes headaches?
        Doctors don't fully understand what causes most headaches. They do know that the brain tissue and the skull are never responsible since they don't have nerves that register pain. But the blood vessels in the head and neck can signal pain, as can the tissues that surround the brain and some major nerves that originate in the brain. The scalp, sinuses, teeth, and muscles and joints of the neck can also cause head pain.
        When to worry about a headache
        You can take care of many types of headaches by yourself, and your doctor can give you medication to control most of the tougher headaches. But some headaches call for prompt medical care. Here are some warning signs for when you should worry about headaches:
        
          headaches that first develop after age 50
          a major change in the pattern of your headaches
          an unusually severe headache
          head pain that increases with coughing or movement
          headaches that get steadily worse
          changes in personality or mental function
          headaches that are accompanied by fever, stiff neck, confusion, decreased alertness or memory, or neurological symptoms such as visual disturbances, slurred speech, weakness, numbness, or seizures
          headaches that are accompanied by a painful red eye
          headaches that are accompanied by pain and tenderness near the temples
          headaches after a blow to the head
          headaches that prevent normal daily activities
          headaches that come on abruptly, especially if they wake you up
          headaches in patients with cancer or impaired immune systems.
        
        Types of headaches
        There are more than 300 types of headaches, but only about 10% of headaches have a known cause. The others are called primary headaches. Here is a rundown on some major primary headaches.
        Tension headaches
        Occurring in about three of every four adults, tension headaches are the most common of all headaches. In most cases, they are mild to moderate in severity and occur infrequently. But a few people get severe tension headaches, and some are troubled by them for three or four times a week.
        The typical tension headache produces a dull, squeezing pain on both sides of the head. People with strong tension headaches may feel like their head is in a vise. The shoulders and neck can also ache. Some tension headaches are triggered by fatigue, emotional stress, or problems involving the muscles or joints of the neck or jaw. Most last for 20 minutes to two hours.
        If you get occasional tension-type headaches, you can take care of them yourself. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, other brands) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, naproxen (Aleve, other brands), or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, other brands) often do the trick, but follow the directions on the label, and never take more than you should. A heating pad or warm shower may help; some people feel better with a short nap or light snack.
        If you get frequent tension-type headaches, try to identify triggers so you can avoid them. Don't get overtired or skip meals. Learn relaxation techniques; yoga is particularly helpful because it can relax both your mind and your neck muscles. If you clench your jaw or grind your teeth at night, a bite plate may help.
        If you need more help, your doctor may prescribe a stronger pain medication or a muscle relaxant to control headache pain. Many people with recurrent tension-type headaches can prevent attacks by taking a tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline (Elavil, generic). Fortunately, most people with tension-type headaches will do very well with simpler programs.
        Migraine
        Migraines occur less often than tension headaches, but they are usually much more severe. They are two to three times more common in women than men, but that's small consolation if you are among the minority of men who have migraines. And since a Harvard study of 20,084 men age 40 to 84 reported that having migraines boosts the risk of heart attacks by 42%, men with migraines should take their headaches to heart.
        Neurologists believe that migraines are caused by changes in the brain's blood flow and nerve cell activity. Genetics play a role since 70% of migraine victims have at least one close relative with the problem.
        Migraine triggers. Although a migraine can come on without warning, it is often set off by a trigger. The things that set off a migraine vary from person to person, but a migraine sufferer usually remains sensitive to the same triggers. The table lists some of the most common ones.
        
          
            
              
                Major migraine triggers
                
                  Changing weather: rising humidity, heat
                  Lack of sleep or oversleeping
                  Fatigue
                  Emotional stress
                  Sensory triggers: bright or flickering lights, loud noises, strong smells
                  Dietary triggers:
				missing a mealalcohol, especially red winechocolatenitrates in cured meats and fishaged cheesean increase or decrease in caffeineMSG (often present in Asian and prepared foods)
                
              
            
          
        
        Migraine symptoms. About 20% of migraines begin with one or more neurological symptoms called an aura. Visual complaints are most common. They may include halos, sparkles or flashing lights, wavy lines, and even temporary loss of vision. The aura may also produce numbness or tingling on one side of the body, especially the face or hand. Some patients develop aura symptoms without getting headaches; they often think they are having a stroke, not a migraine.
        The majority of migraines develop without an aura. In typical cases, the pain is on one side of the head, often beginning around the eye and temple before spreading to the back of the head. The pain is frequently severe and is described as throbbing or pulsating. Nausea is common, and many migraine patients have a watering eye, a running nose, or congestion. If these symptoms are prominent, they may lead to a misdiagnosis of sinus headaches. One way to remember the features of migraine is to use the word POUND
        P is for pulsating pain
O for one-day duration of severe untreated attacks
U for unilateral (one-sided) pain
N for nausea and vomiting
D for disabling intensity.
        Without effective treatment, migraine attacks usually last for four to 24 hours. When you're suffering a migraine, even four hours is far too long — and that's why early treatment for a migraine is so important.
        Migraine treatment. If you spot a migraine in its very earliest stages, you may be able to control it with nonprescription pain relievers. Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and a combination of pain medications and caffeine are all effective — if you take a full dose very early in the attack.
        When prescription drugs are needed, most doctors turn to the triptans, which are available as tablets, nasal sprays, or as injections that patients can learn to give to themselves. Examples include sumatriptan (Imitrex), zolmitriptan (Zomig), and rizatriptan (Maxalt). Triptans provide complete relief within two hours for up to 70% of patients; the response is best if treatment is started early. Some patients require a second dose within 12 to 24 hours. Patients with cardiovascular disease and those who take a high dose of certain antidepressants need to discuss the risks of using them with their doctor.
        Work with your doctor to find the migraine treatment that works best for you. Remember, though, that overuse can lead to rebound headaches and a vicious cycle of drugs and headaches. So, if you need treatment more than two or three times a week, consider preventive medications.
        Migraine prevention. Some people can prevent migraines simply by avoiding triggers. Others do well with prompt therapy for occasional attacks. But patients who suffer frequent migraine attacks often benefit from preventive medications. Effective prescription drugs include beta blockers (such as propranolol, nadolol and atenolol), certain antidepressants (such as amitriptyline), and certain antiseizure medications (such topiramate). Difficult cases may benefit from referral to a headache specialist.
        Cluster headaches
        Cluster headaches are uncommon but very severe headaches, and they occur five times more often in men than women. Although anyone can get cluster headaches, the typical patient is a middle-aged man with a history of smoking.
        The problem gets its name because the headaches tend to come in clusters, with one to eight headaches a day during a one- to three-month period every year or two, often at the same time of year. The pain always strikes one side of the head and is very severe. The eye on the painful side is red and watery, the eyelid may droop, and the nose runs or is blocked. The attack starts abruptly and lasts for 30 to 60 minutes. Most sufferers become restless and agitated during the attack; unable to sit still, they pace, jog in place, or beat their head against a wall. Nausea and sensitivity to light and sound may accompany the pain.
        Inhaling high flow oxygen soon after the onset of the headache can often stop the attack. Sumatriptan is often effective for cluster headaches, particularly when given by injection. Other triptans may also help. Some patients favor lidocaine nose drops, dihydroergotamine injections, or other treatments. The most effective medication for preventing cluster headache attacks is verapamil, a calcium-channel blocker.
        Other types of headaches
        Doctors have diagnosed hundreds of conditions associated with headaches. Here are just a few:
        Medication headaches. Many drugs number headaches among their side effects. And although it seems paradoxical, many medications used to treat headaches can also cause medication overuse headaches or rebound headaches. Migraine sufferers are particularly vulnerable to a vicious cycle of pain leading to more medication, which triggers more pain. If you have frequent headaches and use medication, OTC or prescription, or both, for more than 10 to 15 days a month, you may have medication overuse headaches. The way to find out is to discontinue or taper your medication — but always consult your doctor first. A corticosteroid such as prednisone may help control pain during the withdrawal period.
        Sinus headaches. Acute sinusitis causes pain over the forehead, around the nose and eyes, over the cheeks, or in the upper teeth. Stooping forward increases the pain. Thick nasal discharge, congestion, and fever pinpoint the problem to the sinuses. When the acute infection resolves, the pain disappears. Sinusitis is not a common cause of chronic or recurrent headaches.
        Ice cream headaches. Some people develop sharp, sudden headache pain when they eat anything cold. The pain is over in less than a minute, even if you keep eating. If you are bothered by ice cream headaches, try eating slowly and warming the cold food at the front of your mouth before you swallow it.
        Headache from high blood pressure. Except in cases of very high blood pressure, hypertension does not cause headaches. In fact, most people with high blood pressure don't have any symptoms.
        Headache from exercise and sex. Sudden, strenuous exercise can bring on a headache. Gradual warm-ups or treatment with an anti-inflammatory medication before exercise can help. Sexual intercourse may also trigger headaches; some men note only dull pain, but others suffer from severe attacks called orgasmic headaches. Some people can prevent orgasmic headaches by taking an NSAID 30 to 60 minutes before intercourse.
        Headache testing
        Modern medicine depends on tests to diagnose many problems. For most headaches, though, a good old-fashioned history and physical will do the job. In fact, CT scans, MRIs, and EEGs (brain wave tests) look normal in tension-type headaches, migraines, and cluster headaches. Still, these tests can be vital in patients with warning signs or other worrisome headaches.
        Living with constant headaches
        For most of us, an occasional headache is nothing more than a temporary speed bump in the course of a busy day. Even so, most people can ease the problem with simple lifestyle measures and nonprescription medications. Relaxation techniques, biofeedback, yoga, and acupuncture may also help. But for some of us, headaches are a big problem. Learn to recognize warning signs that call for prompt medical care. Work with your doctor to develop a program to prevent and treat migraines and other serious headaches. And don't fall into the trap of overusing medications; for some gents, rebound headaches are the biggest pain of all.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/occipital-neuralgia-symptoms-and-treatments,Occipital neuralgia: Symptoms and treatments,"Occipital neuralgia is a painful condition that is often confused with migraines. But the causes of occipital neuralgia — and the treatments — are quite different.
        What is occipital neuralgia?
        Occipital neuralgia is a rare but painful condition that causes severe, piercing headaches. The pain is felt in the back of the head, behind the ears, or in the upper neck.
        For some people, just combing their hair or lying on a pillow can cause excruciating pain. For others, occipital neuralgia is felt as numbness.
        There are three occipital nerves that run through each side of your scalp and transmit feeling to your brain: the greater occipital nerve, lesser occipital nerve, and third occipital nerve. Irritation of any of these nerves can cause symptoms of occipital neuralgia.
        Causes of occipital neuralgia
        Occipital neuralgia may be caused by a pinched nerve in your neck, an injury to your scalp or skull, or tight muscles that press on nerves.
        Occipital neuralgia can also be caused by certain health conditions such as arthritis, gout, diabetes, degeneration in the spine, infection, or inflammation.
        There is limited information on how many people are affected by occipital neuralgia. However, a 2021 study of 800 people in a hospital-based headache clinic found that about 25% of patients there had occipital neuralgia.
        Occipital neuralgia symptoms
        The symptoms of occipital neuralgia can come on suddenly and without warning. Symptoms include a shooting, throbbing, burning, or aching pain that can last from seconds to minutes.
        The pain often starts at the back of the head and spreads to one or both sides of the head. It can be felt in your scalp, upper neck, and behind your eyes and ears. Your scalp may become extremely sensitive and tender.
        Occipital neuralgia symptoms can be triggered by certain movements, like turning your head or pressing on your scalp.
        The symptoms of occipital neuralgia are similar to migraine symptoms. There can be overlap between the two conditions; some people with migraines also have occipital neuralgia.
        The difference between occipital neuralgia and migraines is that migraines often are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light. If you have sudden or sharp pain in your scalp or the back of your head but don't feel nauseous or light sensitive, occipital neuralgia may be the cause.
        Diagnosing occipital neuralgia
        Diagnosing occipital neuralgia begins with a physical and neurological exam. Occasionally, diagnostic imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, can help with diagnosis.
        Your doctor may refer you to a specialist who may inject a local painkiller and steroid into the area around one of the occipital nerves. If you feel relief, that can confirm a diagnosis of occipital neuralgia.
        The doctor may also use a handheld ultrasound device to look for the occipital neuralgia trigger points — the areas where the occipital nerve is being irritated — that are causing your pain. Pinpointing the trigger points can help guide treatment.
        You may have a sense of where your occipital neuralgia trigger points are based on where your pain begins or where you feel pain the most.
        Occipital neuralgia treatment
        Treatment for occipital neuralgia involves addressing the root cause of the pain as well as the pain itself.
        Nonsurgical treatments
        Nonsurgical treatments aim to ease the pain of occipital neuralgia and relax tight muscles that may be contributing to symptoms. They include:
        
          regular exercise such as stretching and yoga
          applying heat from heating pads to the scalp or where the pain is felt most
          physical therapy or massage therapy to help relax muscles and ease pressure in the tender area
          oral medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or aspirin, muscle relaxers, and anticonvulsants to relieve pain caused by occipital neuralgia
          injections of steroids, Botox, and/or nerve blocks to calm and numb overactive nerves.
        
        Surgical treatments
        If nonsurgical treatments are not effective in relieving pain, there are several surgical treatment options for occipital neuralgia. They include:
        
          occipital nerve stimulation, in which electrodes placed under the skin near the occipital nerve send small electrical currents to block the sensation of pain
          spinal cord stimulation, in which electrodes placed between the spinal cord and vertebrae block pain messages to the brain
          ganglionectomy, which involves removing certain nerve cells near the top of the spine
          occipital release surgery, a procedure to relieve pressure on the greater occipital nerve, which is the most common trigger point for occipital neuralgia. This surgery is often considered a last resort when other treatments have failed.
        
        Occipital neuralgia clinical trials
        People with occipital neuralgia can consider participating in a clinical trial, to help doctors learn more about the condition and ways to treat it. You can search for occipital neuralgia clinical trials through ClinicalTrials.gov database, a service of the National Library of Medicine.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","March 25, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-well-do-you-worry-about-your-health-202403203027,How well do you worry about your health?,"Don't worry. It's good advice if you can take it. Of course that's not always easy, especially for health concerns.
        The truth is: it's impossible (and ill-advised) to never worry about your health. But are you worrying about the right things? Let's compare a sampling of common worries to the most common conditions that actually shorten lives. Then we can think about preventing the biggest health threats.
        Dangerous but rare health threats
        The comedian John Mulaney says the cartoons he watched as a child gave him the impression that quicksand, anvils falling from the sky, and lit sticks of dynamite represented major health risks. For him (as is true for most of us), none of these turned out to be worth worrying about.
        While harm can befall us in many ways, some of our worries are not very likely to occur:
        
          Harm by lightning: In the US, lightning strikes kill about 25 people each year. Annually, the risk for the average person less than one in a million. There are also several hundred injuries due to nonfatal lightning strikes. Even though lightning strikes the earth millions of times each year, the chances you'll be struck are quite low.
          Dying in a plane crash: The yearly risk of being killed in a plane crash for the average American is about one in 11 million. Of course, the risk is even lower if you never fly, and higher if you regularly fly on small planes in bad weather with inexperienced pilots. By comparison, the average yearly risk of dying in a car accident is approximately 1 in 5,000.
          Snakebite injuries and deaths: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 people are bit by poisonous snakes each year in the US. Lasting injuries are uncommon, and deaths are quite rare (about five per year). In parts of the country where no poisonous snakes live, the risk is essentially zero.
          Shark attacks: As long as people aren't initiating contact with sharks, attacks are fairly uncommon. Worldwide, about 70 unprovoked shark attacks occur in an average year, six of which are fatal. In 2022, 41 attacks occurred in the US, two of which were fatal.
          Public toilet seats: They may appear unclean (or even filthy), but they pose little or no health risk to the average person. While it's reasonable to clean off the seat and line it with paper before touching down, health fears should not discourage you from using a public toilet.
        
        I'm not suggesting that these pose no danger, especially if you're in situations of increased risk. If you're on a beach where sharks have been sighted and seals are nearby, it's best not to swim there. When in doubt, it's a good idea to apply common sense and err on the side of safety.
        What do Google and TikTok tell us about health concerns?
        Analyzing online search topics can tell us a lot about our health worries.
        The top Google health searches in 2023 were:
        
          How long is strep throat contagious?
          How contagious is strep throat?
          How to lower cholesterol?
          What helps with bloating?
          What causes low blood pressure?
        
        Really? Cancer, heart disease and stroke, or COVID didn't reach the top five? High blood pressure didn't make the list, but low blood pressure did?
        Meanwhile, on TikTok the most common topics searched were exercise, diet, and sexual health, according to one study. Again, no top-of-the-list searches on the most common and deadly diseases.
        How do our worries compare with the top causes of death?
        In the US, these five conditions took the greatest number of lives in 2022:
        
          heart disease
          cancer
          unintentional injury (including motor vehicle accidents, drug overdoses, and falls)
          COVID-19
          stroke.
        
        This list varies by age. For example, guns are the leading cause of death among children and teenagers (ages 1 to 19). For older teens (ages 15 to 19), the top three causes of death were accidents, homicide, and suicide.
        Perhaps the lack of overlap between leading causes of death and most common online health-related searches isn't surprising. Younger folks drive more searches and may not have heart disease, cancer, or stroke at top of mind. In addition, online searches might reflect day-to-day concerns (how soon can my child return to school after having strep throat?) rather than long-term conditions, such as heart disease or cancer. And death may not be the most immediate health outcome of interest.
        But the disconnect suggests to me that we may be worrying about the wrong things — and focusing too little on the biggest health threats.
        Transforming worry into action
        Most of us can safely worry less about catching something from a toilet seat or shark attacks. Instead, take steps to reduce the risks you face from our biggest health threats. Chipping away at these five goals could help you live longer and better while easing unnecessary worry:
        
          Choose a heart-healthy diet.
          Get routinely recommended health care, including blood pressure checks and cancer screens, such as screening for colorectal cancer.
          Drive more safely. Obey the speed limit, drive defensively, always wear a seatbelt, and don't drive if you've been drinking.
          Don't smoke. If you need to quit, find help.
          Get regular exercise.
        
        The bottom line
        Try not to focus too much on health risks that are unlikely to affect you. Instead, think about common causes of poor health. Then take measures to reduce your risk. Moving more and adding healthy foods to your meals is a great start.
        And in case you're curious, the average number of annual deaths due to quicksand is zero in the US. Still a bit worried? Fine, here's a video that shows you how to save yourself from quicksand even though you'll almost certainly never need it.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","March 20, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-complications-can-occur-after-prostate-cancer-surgery-202403133023,What complications can occur after prostate cancer surgery?,"Earlier this year, US defense secretary Lloyd Austin was hospitalized for complications resulting from prostate cancer surgery. Details of his procedure, which was performed on December 22, were not fully disclosed. Press statements from the Pentagon indicated that Austin had undergone a minimally invasive prostatectomy, which is an operation to remove the prostate gland. Minimally invasive procedures are performed using robotic instruments passed through small ""keyhole"" incisions in the patient's abdomen.
        
        
          Just over a week later, Austin developed severe abdominal, hip, and leg pain. He was admitted to the intensive care unit at Walter Reed Hospital on January 2 for monitoring and further treatment. Doctors discovered that Austin had a urinary tract infection and fluid pooling in his abdomen that were impairing bowel functioning. The defense secretary was successfully treated, but then readmitted to the ICU on February 11 for what the Pentagon described as ""an emergent bladder issue."" Two days after undergoing what was only described as a ""non-surgical procedure performed under general anesthesia,"" Austin was back at work. His cancer prognosis is said to be excellent.
        
        Austin's ordeal was covered extensively in the media. Although we cannot speculate about his specific case, to help our readers better understand the complications that might occur after a prostatectomy, I spoke with Dr. Boris Gershman, a urologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Dr. Gershman is also a member of the advisory and editorial board for the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases.
        How common are urinary tract infections after a prostatectomy?
        Minimally invasive prostatectomy is generally well tolerated. In one study that examined complications among over 29,000 men who had the operation, the rate of urinary tract infections was only 2.1%. The risk of sepsis — a more serious condition that occurs if the body's response to an infection damages other organs — is much lower than that.
        How would a urinary tract infection occur?
        Although urinary tract infections are rare after prostatectomy, bacteria can travel into the urinary system through a catheter. An important part of a prostatectomy involves connecting the urethra — which is a tube that carries urine out of the body — directly to the bladder after the prostate has been taken out. As a last step in that process, we pass a catheter [a soft silicone tube] through the urethra and into the bladder to promote healing. Infection risks are minimized by giving antibiotics both during surgery and then again just prior to removing the catheter one to two weeks after the operation.
        How do you treat urinary infectious complications when they do happen?
        It's not unusual to find small amounts of bacteria in the urine whenever you use a catheter. Normally they don't cause any symptoms, but if infectious complications do occur, then we'll admit the patient to the hospital and treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics that treat many different kinds of bacteria at once. We'll also obtain a urine culture to identify the bacterial species causing the infection. Based on culture results, we can switch to different antibiotics that attack those microbes specifically. The course of treatment generally lasts 10 to 14 days.
        Lloyd Austin also had gastrointestinal complications. Why might that have occurred?
        Although I cannot speculate about Austin's specific case, in general gastrointestinal complications are very rare — affecting fewer than 2% of patients treated using robotic methods. However, a few different things can happen. For instance, the small intestine can ""fall asleep"" after surgery, meaning it temporarily stops moving food and wastes through the bowel.
        This is called an ileus. It can be due to multiple reasons, including as a result of anesthetics or pain medications. An ileus generally resolves on its own if patients avoid food or water by mouth for several days. If it causes too much pressure in the bowel, then we ""decompress"" the stomach by removing accumulated fluids through a nasogastric tube, which is threaded into the stomach through the nose and throat.
        Some patients develop a different sort of surgical complication called a small bowel obstruction. We treat these the same way: by withholding food and water by mouth and removing fluids with a nasogastric tube if necessary. If the blockages are caused by scar tissues, in rare cases this may require a second surgery to fix the obstructing scar tissue.
        Fluids might also collect in the pelvis after lymph nodes are removed during surgery. What's happening in these cases?
        Pelvic lymph nodes that drain the prostate are commonly removed during prostatectomy to determine if there is any cancer spread to the lymph nodes. A possible risk from lymph node removal is that lymph fluid might leak out after the procedure and pool up in the pelvis. This is called a lymphocele. Most lymphoceles are asymptomatic, but infrequently they may become infected. When that happens, we treat with antibiotics, and we might drain the lymphocele using a percutaneous catheter [which is placed through the skin]. Fortunately, newer surgical techniques are helping to ensure that lymphoceles occur very rarely.
        Are there individual factors that increase the risk of prostatectomy complications?
        Certainly, patients can have risk factors for infection. Diabetes, for instance, can inhibit the immune system, especially when patients have poor glycemic or glucose control [a limited ability to maintain normal blood sugar levels]. If patients have autoimmune diseases, or if they're taking immunosuppressive medications, they may also be at increased risk of infectious or wound healing complications with surgery, and in some cases, may instead be treated with radiation to avoid these risks.
        Thanks for walking me through this complex topic! Any parting thoughts for our readers?
        It's important to discuss the potential risks of surgery with your doctor so you can be fully informed. That said, prostatectomy these days using the minimally invasive approach has a very favorable risk profile. The majority of patients do really well, and fortunately severe complications requiring hospital readmission are very rare.",Charlie Schmidt,"March 13, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/10-questions-to-ask-when-choosing-a-therapist,10 questions to ask when choosing a therapist,"Having good rapport with a therapist is the most important factor in determining the outcome of therapy. But before you can establish rapport, you need to find a therapist who is likely to be a good match for your needs.
        
          Here are some questions to ask as you consider working with a therapist:
        
        
          What's your training (what certifications or degrees do you hold)?
          How long have you worked in this field?
          What kinds of treatment or therapy do you think might help me?
          What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches, including medication?
          How does the treatment work?
          What are the chances that treatment will succeed?
          How soon should I start feeling better?
          How will we assess my progress?
          What should I do if I don't feel better?
          How much will treatment cost?
        
        These are not always easy questions to answer, and the therapist may not be able to answer every one definitively.
        By taking note of the therapist's responses, you should get some sense of what the therapist is like and whether you will be able to establish a good working relationship.
        In addition, the therapist should have formal training and certification and be licensed in your state. In general, the therapist should be able to describe the merits and drawbacks of different types of treatment, including ones he or she doesn't offer. The therapist should also let you know how he or she will monitor your progress.

But it's especially important not to skip the test if you have diabetes, a new analysis suggests. The study indicated that people with diabetes have a 47% greater risk of developing colorectal cancer compared with people without diabetes. Published in the November 2023 issue of JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data for about 55,000 people from 12 southeastern states who contributed at least two years of health information between 2002 and 2009. Participants (average age 51, the majority Black) indicated whether they had diabetes. Using three follow-up surveys, researchers tracked participants until 2018. People with diabetes were also twice as likely as those without the condition to develop colorectal cancer if they hadn't undergone colonoscopy screening, and were at even greater risk if they had ever smoked. Additionally, those diagnosed with diabetes within the previous five years had the greatest colorectal cancer risk. While current guidelines recommend that people at average risk of colorectal cancer start screenings at age 45, the study's findings suggest that routine screening might begin at an earlier age in some people with diabetes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/what-should-you-do-when-sciatica-flares,What should you do when sciatica flares?,"People with diagnosed sciatica have no trouble recognizing a flare-up. It strikes as numbness, tingling, or pain in the buttock and down the leg, caused by irritation to the sciatic nerve, which begins in the spine and travels downward into the leg.
        While it's easy to identify a flare-up, it's trickier to tamp it down. It may take a combination of approaches to ease discomfort.
        
          
            
              
                What is sciatica?
                Sciatica is the term for discomfort caused by irritation of the sciatic nerve. This nerve starts at each side of the low back and extends down through the buttocks, back of the thigh, and lower leg.
                Irritation usually occurs in the spine, with one of the nerve roots that eventually form the sciatic nerve. Anything pressing against a nerve root — such as a bony growth from arthritis in the spine or a bulging disc in between the spinal bones — can inflame the nerve root and send pain, numbness, or tingling all the way down one of the sciatic nerves.
                ""If you've never had it before, it's common to worry that you may have damaged your sciatic nerve. It's usually more of an irritation, however, as opposed to an outright injury,"" says Dr. Max Epstein, a physiatrist at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. ""But if you also experience muscle weakness or significant changes to your bowel or bladder habits, that could be a sign of nerve damage. In either case, you should speak to a health care provider as soon as possible.""
              
            
          
        
        Pill-free approaches
        Coping with sciatica discomfort starts with pill-free strategies that you can try immediately.
        Stay active. One of the most important things you can do when sciatica flares is to avoid bed rest. ""Part of low back pain is muscle-related, possibly because muscles surrounding the irritated nerve roots tighten and try to protect the area. Movement keeps the muscles loose and working correctly. If you don't move, they can get tight and increase pain,"" says Dr. Max Epstein, a physiatrist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        Modify activities. If activity is painful, do only what you can tolerate. ""Think of a green, yellow, or red zone of pain. The green zone is a mild amount of pain while doing an activity. That's okay. But if you get into the yellow zone, it's time to pull back and modify an activity,"" Dr. Epstein says. ""For example, if it hurts to carry a full laundry basket, take out a few things. Or if it's painful to stand at the sink and do dishes, open the cabinet below the sink and rest your foot on the bottom of the cabinet. That will take tension off the nerve.""
        Stretch. Keep the muscles loose and limber with gentle stretching, but only within the green zone of pain. For example, you might stand and try to touch your toes to stretch your back and leg muscles. Or try some yoga poses. Dr. Epstein recommends the cat-cow: Get down on all fours, with your hands directly beneath your shoulders and your knees beneath your hips. Inhale and lift your head and tailbone toward the ceiling, while curving your lower spine toward the floor. As you exhale, round your back, bringing your chin toward your chest and tucking your tailbone under. Repeat the exercise 10 times.
        Use hot or cold therapy. Hot or cold therapy for sciatica can take many forms. For example, you might soak in a warm bath or apply a hot pack or a cold pack to your leg or back. ""What works for one person might not work for another, so you may have to experiment to see what's best for you,"" Dr. Epstein says. How does it help sciatica? ""Heat may loosen muscles, and cold may tamp down inflammation, but we don't know for sure,"" Dr. Epstein explains.
        Relaxation. Staying relaxed is an important part of controlling both acute pain (the kind that's sudden and temporary) or chronic (ongoing) pain.
        ""All pain is processed in the mind. If you're able to calm the processing centers, the perception of pain may decrease,"" Dr. Epstein says. He recommends trying breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, or tai chi. Practicing mindfulness — focusing attention on the present moment — might also help ease discomfort by helping you to accept it.
        Drugstore remedies
        Several over-the-counter remedies can also play a part in relieving sciatica.
        Oral painkillers. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce inflammation, which reduces pain. But they may cause stomach ulcers and bleeding, liver or kidney damage, or an increased risk of heart attacks. So get your doctor's okay before using them, and find out the dose and frequency that's safe for you.
        Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is often less effective at relieving sciatica pain than NSAIDs, but it's also less risky — unless you take it in very high doses, which can cause liver damage. The usual limit is no more than 3,000 milligrams (mg) per day, but your doctor might set a lower limit depending on your health.
        Topical painkillers. Applying painkillers to your skin as creams, gels, or patches can also bring sciatica relief. Topical NSAIDs such as diclofenac gel (Voltaren) may have fewer risks than NSAID pills, since topicals stay close to the site of application and aren't well absorbed by the rest of the body. But it's still wise to check with your doctor before using them. Other types of topicals with fewer risks than NSAIDs include creams, sprays, and patches that contain anesthetics such as lidocaine; pain signal interrupters such as menthol or capsaicin; or arnica gel, an herbal remedy thought to have anti-inflammatory properties.
        Turmeric supplements. Turmeric (a golden-yellow spice) contains curcumin, which appears to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. ""Although there have not yet been studies that prove its benefit, it's the one supplement that I would support for pain relief. There's no clear recommendation for dosage, but 1,000 mg per day might help. You can take it all at once or break it up into morning and evening doses,"" Dr. Epstein says.
        Call your doctor
        A typical flare-up lasts for a few days to a week or two. If it's not improving or responding to home remedies, it's time to make an appointment with your doctor.
        Your doctor might order imaging tests and prescribe a prescription anti-inflammatory drug, such as oral or injected prednisone. ""That will buy you a window of time to strengthen muscles without pain, and keep them flexible,"" Dr. Epstein says. ""That will help keep your body strong and protected, so you'll be in a better place than where you started.""
        What if you don't reach out for help? ""At times the nerve stays irritated for years,"" Dr. Epstein says. ""So try not to delay treatment. Usually our interventions are able to put out the fire or at least calm the severity of the symptoms in a meaningful way.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/new-thinking-about-tinnitus,New thinking about tinnitus,"Experts have long debated the most common cause of tinnitus — a ringing, whooshing, roaring, or hissing in the ears without an external sound source. Some have maintained that tinnitus is triggered by hearing loss: with less sound coming in, the brain compensates by becoming hyperactive and generating a phantom noise.

But that theory hasn't explained the problem for people with normal hearing tests who still have tinnitus. What causes tinnitus in those cases?

Mounting evidence

Increasingly, Harvard Medical School scientists are finding evidence that some people have ""hidden"" hearing loss: damage to the auditory nerve — which carries sound signals from the ear to the brain — that isn't picked up by conventional tests.

Researchers first discovered the phenomenon in lab mice in 2009. ""From there, it wasn't difficult to add two and two by suggesting that the loss of these nerve fibers in people with normal hearing tests could be associated with tinnitus,"" says Stéphane Maison, a tinnitus researcher and associate professor of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery at Harvard Medical School.

Subsequent studies began making the connection. The latest — believed to be the largest and most nuanced to date — was published Nov. 30, 2023, in Scientific Reports. Maison and his colleagues at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear recruited almost 300 people (ages 18 to 72) with normal hearing tests who had chronic tinnitus, no tinnitus, or intermittent tinnitus.

Scientists measured participants' auditory nerve responses and brainstem activity. Compared with not having tinnitus, having chronic tinnitus was associated with a loss of auditory nerve fibers as well as increased brain activity. ""That fits with the idea that as a result of hearing loss, the brain increases its activity, which is possibly why you perceive a tone or a sound that isn't there,"" Maison says.

What this means for treatment

For people with measurable hearing loss, getting hearing aids sometimes reduces the perception of tinnitus. But hearing aids aren't recommended for people with normal hearing test results — even if your doctor suspects hidden hearing loss — since we don't have tests outside of research labs to measure it.

Still, the new evidence linking hidden hearing loss and tinnitus offers hope for people with tinnitus. ""When you have hidden hearing loss, only a portion of the auditory nerve has degenerated. Another portion remains alive for years or decades. And a number of experiments by others have found that it's possible to regenerate nerve fibers in animal models,"" Maison says. ""If we can one day regenerate those fibers in humans, perhaps it might bring back missing information to the brain, reducing its hyperactivity and the perception of tinnitus.""

Until that day comes — and it's unclear when or if it will — we have only limited ways to cope with the problem.

What you can do

If you have tinnitus despite a normal hearing test, report it to your primary care doctor or ear, nose, and throat specialist. In rare cases, the noise can be caused by a tumor or cyst pinching the auditory nerve, a buildup of earwax, or blood vessel damage. Sometimes treating underlying conditions like these can reduce or even eliminate the noise.

More often, we can only learn to how to live with or reduce tinnitus. The following strategies may help.

Distract your brain. Listening to white noise or nature sounds might make tinnitus seem quieter. Use a white noise machine, sleep headphones, earbuds, or a wearable sound-masking device.

Use mind-body therapies. Cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based tinnitus treatment, and biofeedback can help you redirect negative thoughts and emotions linked to tinnitus.

Join an online support group. Look for tinnitus groups on Facebook or through the American Tinnitus Association (www.ata.org; click on ""Support""). You may pick up tips that work for other people, or at least feel empowered by camaraderie.

Reduce stress. Stress may increase both your perception of tinnitus and your reaction to it. Try yoga or tai chi to help manage stress; since you'll be concentrating on movement and breathing, you might not focus on the tinnitus as much.

Live a healthier lifestyle. Practice good sleep hygiene, exercise daily, and limit alcohol intake. Each one of those healthy habits can help reduce the frequency and intensity of tinnitus, and also reduce stress.

Consider trying bimodal stimulation. These new devices for home use provide two types of stimulation — for instance, sound along with gentle taps to the wrist delivered by a bracelet. ""They aren't yet widely recommended as there's not enough evidence that they work, but preliminary results are encouraging,"" Maison says. ""Ask your physician about your options.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/treating-persistent-angina,Treating persistent angina,"Q.
          I'm a 75-year-old Black man who's had coronary artery disease, including two heart attacks and two bypass surgeries in my 40s and 50s. Although I take a number of heart medications (including a statin and a PCSK9 inhibitor), I still have frequent chest pain when I'm walking, especially when I'm climbing stairs. My LDL cholesterol is 61 and my triglycerides are 43. Are there any other treatments that can shrink atherosclerotic plaque? My doctor says I'm not a candidate for a stent.
        
        A. You may be reassured to know that angina (chest pain with exertion or emotional stress) is quite common among people with coronary artery disease.  Your symptoms sound quite severe, although that's not surprising, given your history of heart disease. The good news? There are definitely some other options you can pursue to alleviate your angina.
        Even though your doctor says that a stent is not an option, you might want to get a second opinion about whether this procedure may be feasible for you. For complicated situations such as yours, a second opinion is often helpful.
        In addition, there are a number of other drug treatments you can try, which fall under two broad strategies. One, as you noted, is to shrink the plaque in your arteries. Your current LDL level is excellent, but lowering that number even further may help. Another cholesterol-lowering drug — either ezetimibe (Zetia) or bempedoic acid (Nexletol) — could be added to your current medications. Another drug, icosapent ethyl (Vascepa) has also been shown to reduce plaque, but only in people who have elevated triglycerides (higher than 150 milligrams per deciliter). Since your triglycerides are normal, it's not clear that this would help.
        There are other medications to help decrease the frequency and severity of your symptoms. For example, the calcium-channel blocker diltiazem (Cardizem) can slow down your heart rate (ideally to around 60 beats per minute), and a long-acting nitrate such as isosorbide (Isordil) helps dilate your coronary arteries. Another drug called ranolazine (Ranexa) that works on the metabolism of heart cells can be added if your heart rate and blood pressure are already well controlled.
        Finally, you might want to ask your doctor about colchicine (Lodoco). This anti-inflammatory drug has long been used to treat a form of arthritis called gout. But a lower dose has been shown to prevent heart attacks in people with coronary artery disease.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/an-inside-look-at-aortic-stenosis,An inside look at aortic stenosis,"A leading heart-related issue for older men is something most are unaware of — aortic stenosis.
        ""Aortic stenosis occurs when the heart's aortic valve opening narrows, and blood cannot flow normally,"" says Dr. Patrick O'Gara, Harvard Medical School Professor of Medicine and senior physician in the cardiovascular division at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Know the symptoms
        The aortic valve sits between the left ventricle (the heart's main pumping chamber) and the aorta (the body's major artery). The valve keeps blood from flowing back into the left ventricle after a heart contraction pushes blood into the aorta.
        When aortic stenosis occurs, the aortic valve becomes calcified, stiff, and narrow, which impedes the usual smooth blood flow out of the heart and into the aorta. This impairment can cause symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest tightness, fatigue, lightheadedness, and fainting.
        ""The symptoms tend to come on gradually, so people don't always recognize them,"" says Dr. O'Gara. ""Also, some people unconsciously adapt their behavior to avoid exertion. It's also possible to have aortic stenosis and not experience any symptoms.""
        Your doctor may first suspect aortic stenosis when he hears a heart murmur, a rumbling or whooshing sound with each contraction of the left ventricle as blood flows across the thickened aortic valve and creates turbulence. The diagnosis can be easily confirmed with a heart ultrasound known as an echocardiogram.
        Over time, the symptoms can occur more often and become more severe. Without treatment, aortic stenosis can lead to heart failure, in which the heart cannot pump efficiently enough to meet the body's need for blood, and even death. ""If you experience any of these symptoms seek immediate medical care,"" says Dr. O'Gara.
        What are the causes?
        A normal aortic valve is made up of three sections, called leaflets. But some people are born with a valve that has only two leaflets, known as a bicuspid aortic valve. The slightly abnormal flow through bicuspid aortic valves puts extra stress on the leaflets. This usually doesn't pose a problem in childhood. However, over time this causes changes in the two leaflets that result in a hard calcified valve.
        The specific reason why some people with normal appearing tricuspid valves become stiff and calcified leading to aortic stenosis is not known. Age is the most significant risk factor. The prevalence of the condition rises from about 1.3% from ages 60 to 69 to about 10% by age 80.  Hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol also are common in people with aortic stenosis. Specific health problems are also associated with a higher risk, such as chronic kidney disease, smoking, an overactive parathyroid gland, and some inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.
        The calcium buildup on the aortic valve is not connected to the amount of calcium you consume. Rather, the calcium is a late stage manifestation of disordered metabolism and inflammation within the valve leaflets.
        Treatment options
        Once aortic stenosis is confirmed, there's no way to prevent its progression. ""The goal is to monitor it until it becomes severe enough to require surgical valve replacement,"" says Dr. O'Gara.
        Doctors often recommend a repeat echocardiogram for mild aortic stenosis every three to five years. Moderate cases should be checked every one to two years, and patients with severe aortic stenosis should have an echocardiogram every six to 12 months. ""It's possible to live many years with no changes in your condition,"" says Dr. O'Gara.
        Most people, including those with bicuspid valves and those younger than age 65, have open heart surgery to replace the valve with a mechanical or tissue valve. Mechanical valves are more durable but require life-long treatment with warfarin (Coumadin). Tissue (biological) valves have a finite shelf life and wear out quicker in patients younger than age 65 compared with older ones. About 10% to 20% of people will experience valve failure and require a second procedure.
        A less invasive approach called transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an option for people over age 65, especially when there are other health reasons not to consider surgery.
        With TAVI, a thin tube called a catheter carries the replacement valve to the heart. The catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin and gently maneuvered through the blood vessels into the opening between the heart and the aorta. Once in place, the device expands and anchors the new valve inside the old one.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/gene-therapy-for-cardiovascular-disease,Gene therapy for cardiovascular disease,"Over the past decade, the Nobel prize-winning technology known as CRISPR has transformed biomedical research, enabling scientists to edit DNA far more easily and precisely than ever before. In late 2023, the first medical use of the gene editing tool was approved to treat sickle cell disease, an inherited blood disorder that causes excruciating pain, organ damage, and strokes.
        Investigators are also using gene editing to develop novel therapies for several types of heart disease. Clinical trials are currently under way among people with three genetic conditions: abnormally high cholesterol; a type of heart muscle disease; and a form of heart failure that results from amyloid deposits. Preliminary results in small numbers of people appear promising.
        However, there are still some considerable challenges related to developing and delivering gene therapy for heart disease, says Dr. Calum MacRae, vice chair for scientific innovation in the Department of Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Sickle cell disease results from a single, specific genetic defect. Most cardiovascular genetic disorders are caused by different genetic defects in each family, and the factors leading to clinical disease are less well known,"" he says. Gene variants can also have complex effects throughout the entire body, and editing the defect in single tissues may have unpredictable effects, he adds. Delivering the ideal ""dose"" of gene editing technology to the right types of cells may be an issue. There are also concerns about off-target effects elsewhere in the genome, as well as possible inflammatory reactions to the viruses or lipid particles used deliver the therapies.
        Here's a brief summary of current gene therapies for heart disease.
        Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). About one in 250 people has a variant in the PCSK9 gene that causes extremely high levels of harmful LDL cholesterol. FH is one of the leading causes of premature heart attacks (those that occur before age 45 in men and 55 in women). A new gene editing therapy essentially turns off the PCSK9 gene in the liver. Early data found that a single infusion led to drops of 39% to 55% in LDL cholesterol. The nine adults who received the therapy (all of whom had one FH variant) had cardiovascular disease and high LDL, despite taking maximum doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs. The company continues to enroll people for the study, all of whom will be followed for another 14 years, which the FDA requires for all participants in any human genome editing trials.
        Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). An estimated one in 500 people have HCM, which results from variants in genes that affect the structure of the heart's muscle. More than a dozen genes have been linked to HCM, but the disorder is most often connected to variants in the myosin binding protein 3 (MYBPC3) gene. In people with these variants, the heart's walls may become abnormally thick, restricting blood flow and leaving the heart prone to dangerous, potentially fatal heart rhythms. A gene therapy trial that uses a virus to deliver a working copy of the MYBPC3 gene to the heart muscle began in the fall of 2023. Researchers plan to enroll at least six people with this particular gene defect who have symptoms of HCM (which include chest pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath) and who have implanted cardiac defibrillators.
        Transthyretin amyloid cardiomy­opathy (ATTR-CM). The exact prevalence of this rare disorder is unclear because it is difficult to diagnose, but an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 new cases are identified in the United States each year. It occurs when a gene variant causes the liver to make an abnormal form of transthyretin (TTR) protein. Clumps of TTR build up, causing the heart's left ventricle to stiffen and weaken, potentially leading to heart failure. A trial using gene editing to stop the production of the abnormal TTR protein showed dramatic drops in the protein among the 60 people who received the therapy.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
                Ongoing clinical trials of gene editing for inherited forms of heart disease are monitoring the efficacy and safety of these novel therapies.

        The big picture
        The above conditions can all be treated with existing medications or procedures. The overarching problem is that they're usually discovered only at very advanced stages, after a person has developed severe symptoms. ""The biggest unmet need in cardiovascular genetic disorders is identifying people when early, preventive interventions are feasible. Currently, most of these cases go undetected,"" says Dr. MacRae.
        Still, gene therapy trials should radically improve recognition of these inherited heart diseases. ""As we expand our detection of disease and the underlying gene defects, we will begin to better understand how these conditions affect patients, and how therapies of differing risk and benefit can best be implemented,"" says Dr. MacRae.",Julie Corliss,"March 1, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/does-a-coronary-stent-make-sense-for-stable-angina,Does a coronary stent make sense for stable angina?,"The chest discomfort known as angina (which comes from the Latin word angere, meaning to choke or strangle) occurs in many people with coronary artery disease. Fatty plaque narrows the heart's arteries, slowing blood flow to the heart. During exercise or periods of emotional stress, the increased demand for blood may outpace the heart's supply. The resulting drop in oxygen delivery to the heart muscle triggers angina.
        Severe, unrelenting angina is a medical emergency (see ""What is acute coronary syndrome?""). But angina that subsides within a few minutes with rest is known as stable angina. Treating this common problem has long been a matter of debate.
        Since the late 1970s, cardiologists have known that inserting a tiny mesh tube called a stent to open a narrowed heart artery can relieve stable angina and may help people exercise more easily. ""This led to a widespread assumption of cause and effect: that blockages caused symptoms, and stents relieved them,"" says cardiologist Dr. William Boden, scientific director of the Clinical Trials Network of the VA New England Healthcare System and lecturer in medicine at Harvard Medical School. However, that belief ignores the well-known placebo effect, which can influence many treatments and conditions, he adds.

                What is acute coronary syndrome?
                Acute coronary syndrome refers to conditions related to sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart, including unstable angina or a heart attack. In contrast to stable angina, unstable angina is more frequent, more severe, and longer-lasting — and it doesn't subside with rest. It can occur without warning, even when you're relaxing or sleeping. If symptoms don't get better within 10 minutes, call 911.
              
            
          
        
        Stents on trial
        In 2017, the ORBITA study compared angioplasty and stenting with a placebo (a sham procedure) in 200 people with stable angina. Neither the patients nor the staff knew who received which treatment. What happened? ""There was no difference in angina relief or exercise performance between the two groups, which shows the potentially powerful placebo effect associated with receiving a stent,"" says Dr. Boden. Of note: all the study participants were taking two to three medications to help reduce their angina symptoms. Critics contended that this treatment — which is routinely recommended for angina — minimized the possible differences between the two groups.
        The response to that criticism was ORBITA-2: a larger, longer study that required participants to stop taking anti-anginal drugs two weeks before the procedure. Compared with people who got the sham treatment, those who received stents had lower scores on an angina symptom scale (that is, they had fewer symptoms) and were able to exercise about a minute longer — benefits that lasted at least 12 weeks.
        What should people take away from this new finding? Medications contribute to angina relief above and beyond getting a stent or having a sham procedure, says Dr. Boden. ""Both stents and medications are effective. But stents have far more downsides,"" he says.
        Complications and cost
        Doctors can sometimes overlook the risks of the procedure. Complication rates are very low, but they're not zero, says Dr. Boden. They include bleeding at the leg or wrist insertion site and about a 1% risk of having a heart attack or stroke during or soon after the procedure. People must also take drugs for at least six months to prevent clots from forming inside the stent, and those drugs carry a risk for bleeding.

In addition, the price of these procedures ranges from $20,000 to more than $80,000, which means that the out-of-pocket costs even for patients with insurance can be substantial.
        But despite that high cost, there is no evidence that a stent will prevent a future heart attack or increase survival compared with drug therapy, Dr. Boden says. That's because most heart attacks occur in arteries that are narrowed by only about 40% or less but harbor what's called vulnerable plaque, which can rupture without warning. The resulting blood clot blocks blood flow, triggering a heart attack.
        What's more, those partly blocked arteries do not cause angina, which usually occur only in arteries that are more than 70% blocked. In fact, most angina may occurs when the heart's tiniest arteries (called microvessels) are impaired — a problem that cannot be treated with stents, says Dr. Boden.
        The bottom line
        ""The ORBITA-2 trial reinforces current guidelines, which recommend medications as the first and preferred treatment for stable angina. People should get a stent only when medications don't relieve their symptoms,"" says Dr. Boden.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/switching-out-just-a-serving-of-processed-meats-may-boost-cardiovascular-health,Switching out just a serving of processed meats may boost cardiovascular health,"Replacing one serving each day of processed meats with a serving of whole grains, nuts, or beans is linked with up to 36% lower odds of cardiovascular conditions such as heart attack or stroke, a new study suggests.
        For the analysis, published online Nov. 16, 2023, by BMC Medicine, researchers evaluated results from 32 earlier studies involving tens of thousands of healthy adults on three continents. Participants answered detailed questions about the foods they typically ate, and researchers followed them for an average of 19 years to assess any links between their diets and health outcomes, adjusting for other factors such as calorie intake, physical activity, and smoking and alcohol use.
        Substituting a daily serving of processed meats — which include bacon, deli meats, hot dogs, and sausage — with nuts, beans, or whole grains was associated with 23% to 36% lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Replacing a serving of eggs each day with nuts was linked to 17% lower odds of cardiovascular problems. Meanwhile, participants were 10% less likely to develop diabetes if they substituted a serving of whole grains for red meat. The findings suggest that shifting from animal-based to plant-based foods can benefit cardiovascular health, the researchers said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/too-much-tv-might-be-bad-for-your-brain,Too much TV might be bad for your brain,"Excessive TV-watching — defined as four or more hours daily — is associated with a greater risk of developing brain-based disorders such as dementia, depression, and Parkinson's disease, a new analysis suggests.
        The study, published online Nov. 3, 2023, by the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, looked at data on more than 473,000 adults ages 39 to 72 enrolled in the UK Biobank. Researchers tracked participants until either they died; they were diagnosed with dementia, Parkinson's, or depression; or the study ended (2018 for some participants, 2021 for others). Participants reported how many hours they spent aside from work either exercising, using a computer, or watching TV.
        Compared with people who watched TV for less than an hour each day, participants who reported watching four or more hours of TV daily had a 28% higher risk of dementia, a 35% greater risk of depression, and a 16% higher risk of Parkinson's disease. But people who reported a moderate amount of computer use—30 to 60 minutes per day—appeared to have lower risks of those three conditions compared with participants who reported the lowest levels of computer use. The study was observational, meaning it couldn't prove that excessive TV watching in itself causes these problems, is an early sign of them, or results from other factors contributing to these disorders.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/why-does-my-back-ache,Why does my back ache?,"You repeatedly lifted your 30-pound grandchild over the weekend, and today you're paying for it — your lower back throbs. Welcome to a very large club: an estimated 84% of Americans cope with lower back pain at some point in their lifetime.
        While nearly every major movement we make involves our back, not all back pain is created equal. Symptoms can vary widely, ranging from a dull, ongoing ache to intense, shooting pain or spasms. Sometimes we can pinpoint exactly when back pain struck — like after falling or hoisting a heavy object — but more often, nothing specific happened to trigger the pain.
        ""It's a bit complicated, because in many cases of back pain, we don't really know exactly where the pain is coming from,"" says Dr. Joerg Ermann, a rheumatologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""But an important message is that it's very common, and in all likelihood it will ease over the course of days to weeks.""
        Acute vs. chronic back pain
        If your back pain started within the past month, it's considered acute (short-term). Doctors often categorize low back pain as nonspecific, meaning they haven't identified an underlying reason for why it's happening. Nonspecific back pain is often muscular in nature, however. It means you've pulled or strained muscles or other soft tissues, such as tendons and ligaments.
        Pulls and strains usually happen in a single moment, showing up as sudden, stabbing pain that worsens when you move or twist. You may also feel stiff and achy and have difficulty standing upright. If you've fallen or injured yourself in another way, bruising and swelling on a specific area of your back may be noticeable.
        When it's not muscular in nature, back pain can be caused by a lengthy list of conditions that often stem from what are called mechanical problems with spinal discs (the shock absorbers between spinal bones) or, less commonly, inflammation in the spine. These conditions often result in long-lasting or recurrent pain. When the pain continues for more than three months, it's labeled as chronic. ""It's an important distinction, because the types of problems that can cause acute or chronic back pain are different,"" Dr. Ermann says.
        These non-muscular causes include
        
          herniated discs, which may press on surrounding spinal nerves
          osteoarthritis of a facet joint, which can narrow the space around the spinal cord
          degenerative disc disease, in which discs shrink and the spine becomes less flexible
          fractures of spinal bones (vertebrae)
          axial spondyloarthritis, an inflammatory condition of the spine, where back pain is typically worse in the morning and eases with movement.
        
        ""There are some bad things that can cause lower back pain, but in most cases, a sudden onset is from muscular strain or injury,"" he says.
        Treatment approaches
        Time and home-based treatments usually do the trick for most cases of acute back pain. While you may not feel like moving if you're in serious distress, short walks and gentle stretching can help keep muscles loose and speed your recovery. Other measures include taking anti-inflammatory pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) and alternately applying heat and ice.
        Consider seeing a doctor when back pain that came on suddenly just won't quit. ""If after a couple of weeks it's still substantial, you need evaluation by a clinician, "" Dr. Ermann says.
        After symptoms ease, your doctor may also recommend physical therapy involving stretches and exercises. ""We don't often do the things that our spine deserves, which include strengthening the core muscles that support it,"" he says.
        If your lower back pain is accompanied by additional symptoms, the problem may be more serious. Alarming symptoms include fever and chills, unexplained weight loss, pain that spreads down the legs, bowel or bladder problems, and weakness, numbness, or tingling in one or both legs. These signs should prompt an immediate medical evaluation.
        ""It depends on how bad your symptoms are, but you definitely don't want to wait it out,"" Dr. Ermann says. ""If you can't pee, go to the ER. But if you have shooting pain down your leg, going to urgent care the next day may be appropriate.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-are-cold-symptoms-worse-at-night,Why are cold symptoms worse at night?,"Q.
          My cold symptoms seem to be improving during the day, but at night they get worse again. Why does that happen?
        
        A. Frustrating, isn't it? But you're not imagining that your cough and congestion ramp up just when it's time to hit the hay. The circadian rhythm — our 24-hour internal clock — signals immune cells to become more active at night. When these cells pinpoint germs, they fight them off by creating inflammation, which makes respiratory symptoms worse.
        The hormone cortisol, which regulates the body's stress responses, is also to blame. Cortisol levels rise the morning, helping suppress inflammation and reduce cold symptoms. But lower levels of cortisol at night enable symptoms to flare again. And lastly, the act of lying down — as welcome as it is — to get shut-eye also contributes to worsened cold symptoms by allowing mucus to pool at the back of the throat.
        Cold symptoms, including coughing, usually dissipate in five to seven days. If you have a cough that doesn't improve within three weeks, see your doctor to make sure something else isn't contributing.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/spring-cleaning-prioritize-your-fridge-and-pantry,Spring cleaning? Prioritize your fridge and pantry,"With spring's arrival, maybe you're planning to attack those dusty baseboards, smeared windows, and cluttered closets. But if you've been neglecting your refrigerator and pantry, these hard-working storage areas should take priority — and they need far more than annual cleaning to help you avoid food-borne illnesses, Harvard experts say.
        It's not a minor threat. Each year, an estimated one in six Americans — 48 million people — get sick from germs in food, according to the CDC. About 128,000 of them are hospitalized and 3,000 die as a result of food-borne illness.
        Spring cleaning offers an opportunity not only to thoroughly scour your home, but also to give your fridge and pantry — which can harbor harmful bacteria — more than just a cursory swipe of a sponge. In the process, you can purge dated and possibly contaminated products from overlooked corners.
        Think of it this way: these chambers don't just house your food; they also protect it—and you, by extension.
        ""It's tough to compare this to spring cleaning, because certainly I'd recommend cleaning out your refrigerator and pantry way more than once a year,"" says Cynthia Parenteau, associate director of public health in the Department of Environmental Health and Safety at Harvard University, who specializes in food safety. ""Personally, I do it once a week. Every time new groceries go in, I make sure anything that's expired goes out, and I move older food to the front.""
        Dangerous complications
        Food-borne illnesses result from microbes or toxins that contaminate foods or drinks. More than 30 pathogens (disease-causing agents), including Salmonella, norovirus, Listeria, Escherichia coli, and bacteria that cause botulism, are known to travel in food. Raw or undercooked poultry or meat, raw eggs, unpasteurized milk or dairy products, raw fruits and vegetables, and foods prepared in large batches kept at unsafe temperatures are vehicles for these pathogens.
        Some lucky folks manage to skirt the consequences of eating germ-laden foods, while others develop food poisoning and suffer through symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, intense stomach cramps, and fever.
        ""The majority of us eventually get a food-borne illness,"" says Parenteau's colleague Marykate Franks, a senior environmental public health officer. ""Most people associate it with the last thing they ate, though that may not be the case. If we're lucky, we feel crummy for a day or two, rebound, and write it off.""
        While food poisoning symptoms often resolve without problem, infections spread by food can have lasting, dangerous consequences. They sometimes lead to conditions such as arthritis, meningitis, kidney damage, or brain and nerve damage. (See ""When should you see a doctor for food poisoning?"") Parenteau notes that certain people — including pregnant women, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems — are susceptible to worse cases and more serious outcomes.
        Cleaning strategies
        How can you better protect yourself? Parenteau and Franks recommend these tips to tackle your refrigerator and pantry:
        Take everything out. Approach your food clean-out with the same commitment as you would a closet purge. Completely emptying your fridge and pantry allows you to appraise each item for safety as well as inspect the inside of each space. ""Even with something as simple as cleaning out your pantry, you'll find a wayward cheese puff at the back or a pile of cracker crumbs,"" Franks says. ""You also have to be alert for mice or flour weevils that might be really intrigued by what you have in your cabinets.""
        Wash everything thoroughly. Pull out all shelving and clean every surface with food-safe sanitizer spray. (For a homemade version, Harvard experts suggest blending one tablespoon of unscented liquid chlorine bleach with a gallon of water.) Pay particular attention to any spills or dried, sticky areas. Make sure surfaces are dry before putting anything back.
        Check expiration dates. Toss all expired food or drink items, as well as those whose containers are rusted or leaking. If you don't know the expiration date, a rule of thumb suggests keeping opened refrigerated items for seven days or less. ""This is a good opportunity to go through your refrigerator and pull out all the Tupperware and leftover restaurant containers and make way for new stuff,"" Parenteau says.
        Use your senses. Expiration dates differ from sell-by or best-used-by dates, which only suggest freshness. This is often applicable to items such as condiments and salad dressings. If those dates have only recently passed, check the product's appearance and smell for signs of decay. ""If something doesn't quite smell right or the color of the food is off, trust your instincts,"" Franks says. ""Better safe than sorry.""
        Pay attention to packaging. Generally, unopened or vacuum-packed foods will stay fresher longer. But once they're opened, the clock starts. ""The date to use a product by becomes pretty confusing when you see a freshness date a month or two down the road but you've already opened it,"" Parenteau says. She advises using a marker to note on the package the date you unsealed it. Then keep it for only another seven days — especially packaged deli meats or hot dogs.
        Avoid cross-contamination. Keep raw meat, seafood, and eggs separate from ready-made foods so germs don't spread. Store these items in sealed containers so juices don't leak onto other foods. And if your refrigerator features dedicated meat and produce drawers, use them only for those items. ""You don't want juices that leak from chicken or beef packages getting on produce or food items that are not going to be cooked,"" Parenteau says.
        
          
            
              
                When should you see a doctor for food poisoning?
                In most cases, food poisoning symptoms are mild enough to ride out without medical attention. But certain symptoms should prompt a doctor's evaluation, according to the CDC. These include
                
                  bloody diarrhea or diarrhea lasting longer than three days
                  fever over 102° F
                  vomiting so frequently you can't hold liquids down
                  signs of dehydration, such as dry mouth and throat, scant urination, and dizziness upon standing.
                
              
            
          
        
        Don't forget your freezer. Since the whole purpose of freezing food is to keep it from spoiling, the freezer doesn't need as much attention as the refrigerator. But take a look at its contents every few weeks and weed items out. ""Everyone is guilty of sticking something in the back of the freezer, saving it for a rainy day, and forgetting about it,"" Franks says. ""It's good to pull that stuff out to check if it expired and assess if it's worth keeping.""

        The scans showed that this group had larger brain volumes in several key areas, such as the hippocampus and the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes, compared with people who exercised less than this amount or not at all.
        These brain regions are responsible for cognitive skills such as memory and learning. Over all, the exercisers also had larger volumes of gray matter, which helps process information, and white matter, which connects brain regions.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/overcoming-shoulder-pain,Overcoming shoulder pain,"The shoulder joint is the body's most flexible and complex joint. Three bones, nearly a dozen different muscles, and many ligaments and tendons work together to move the arm in just about any direction. ""Most people will experience shoulder pain at some point in their lives,"" says Patrick Wilson, a certified orthopedic manual therapist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Rehabilitation Services. ""The pain can come on gradually or abruptly, ranging from mild to excruciating.""
        The most common causes of shoulder pain are bursitis, rotator cuff problems, frozen shoulder, and osteoarthritis. They can occur for various reasons, such as overuse, injury, and age-related wear and tear. You should seek medical care if shoulder pain lasts longer than a week, suddenly increases, or comes with swelling, redness, or warmth. Your doctor may be able to make a likely diagnosis based on your symptoms and a shoulder exam, or you may need imaging such as MRI.
        Here's a look at the common causes of shoulder pain and how they are treated.
        Bursitis
        Bursae are fluid-filled sacs in and around the shoulder that provide padding and reduce friction between the bones and tendons. Bursitis happens when one or more of the bursae become inflamed, often as a result of repetitive or intense joint movement, but it may occur without any predisposing factors. Symptoms include
        
          pain on the outside of your shoulder that may radiate down your arm
          increased pain when you move the shoulder or lie on it.
        
        Initial treatment begins with reducing inflammation and swelling by resting the shoulder, applying ice or heat to the joint, and taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen or naproxen. For severe or persistent pain, your doctor may recommend a corticosteroid shot. Physical therapy can help maintain joint mobility. On rare occasions, and only if all other measures fail, you might have surgery to remove the inflamed bursa and give the rotator cuff more room.
        Rotator cuff problems
        The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that stabilize the shoulder and help move your arm in a circular motion. Signs of a rotator cuff issue are shoulder pain or stiffness on the outside of the upper arm when you lift your arm above your head or reach behind your back. Most problems fall into two categories: impingement and tears.
        Rotator cuff impingement. This happens when there is irritation, inflammation (tendonitis), or compression of the tendons in the shoulder. An impingement can be caused by an injury or wear and tear from daily life.
        Rotator cuff tears. A tear causes pain and weakness. A tear can be partial, where only part of the tendon is separated from the bone it is attached to, or a full tear, where the tendon becomes completely separated. It often occurs from an injury — for instance, if you fall on your shoulder, lift a heavy object above your shoulders, overextend your arm, or have the arm aggressively pulled.
        Treatments for impingement and minor tears include corticosteroid injections into the shoulder, anti-inflammatory meds, and physical therapy to stretch and strengthen the shoulder muscles and tendons. Many times, these can ease the pain. Rotator cuff tears don't heal on their own, and it may take up to a year for the condition to improve. Severe tears may need surgery to repair the damage.
        Frozen shoulder
        Also known as adhesive capsulitis, frozen shoulder is caused by a thickening and stiffening of the tissues around the shoulder joint. It more commonly occurs in people ages 40 to 60.
        A frozen shoulder can develop after a rotator cuff impingement or tear, or even with a minor injury. But why some people go on to develop a frozen shoulder is unclear. One theory is that in many cases, people with shoulder pain instinctively hesitate to move their arm, increasing stiffness. Over time, this makes it difficult to move the shoulder, and thus the shoulder becomes ""frozen.""
        Physical therapy is almost always recommended. Other interventions include NSAIDs and corticosteroid injections. With treatment, the stiffness and pain usually improve. Still, it can take several months or even a year to fully resolve. If treatments don't help, you can have surgery to remove the excess tissue around the shoulder joint.
        Osteoarthritis
        Osteoarthritis develops when cartilage cushions between the bones in the shoulder erode, causing the bones to rub against one another. There are numerous treatments for osteoarthritis, including rest, modifications to activities, anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, and sometimes surgery to replace the joint.

While there are many hand-strengthening exercises, here are three you can do using therapy putty to help improve grip and pinch strength. These may be especially helpful if you have a weak grip or other hand weakness.
        Therapy putty, available at medical supply stores, is a malleable plastic material that provides varying degrees of resistance. Begin with the softest putty and advance to a denser version once you can do the exercises without difficulty. You initially may feel muscle discomfort after performing these exercises, but it should go away within 24 hours. Perform each exercise 10 times every other day.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/fighting-fatigue,Fighting fatigue,"Here are some tips to help you get your energy back.
        
        
          
        
        If you have felt like you are dragging lately, you may be wondering what is going on. Fatigue is a common symptom that can be caused by a whole host of factors, from medical conditions and stress to poor sleep.
        The good news is that in many cases you can make changes that will help bring your energy back, but you need to get to the root of the problem in order to treat it.
        Fatigue triggers
        Part of the challenge when it comes to a general symptom like fatigue is that it's so commonplace and can be triggered by so many different things. This makes it hard to pinpoint what's causing the problem. However, there are a few main culprits that often cause fatigue.
        Stress. Some people have reported feeling increasingly fatigued these days. This might be the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic — or more specifically, of the stress it has caused. Changing responsibilities, added work, struggles with child care, financial pressures, and reduced social opportunities are just some of the stressors people now face. And chronic stress can lead to fatigue. When you are under stress, it can cause levels of a hormone called cortisol to rise, which can trigger problems sleeping as well as feelings of anxiety and other symptoms.
        Hormonal changes. In women, hormonal changes can contribute to shifts in metabolism and sleep disturbances, which lead to fatigue. A decline in female hormones, such as estrogen, during the menopause transition may induce hot flashes, which can lead to broken sleep. Hot flashes are brief episodes during which your body feels like it's overheating. They can last for a few seconds or minutes. During a hot flash, your skin may flush, and you may start to sweat. If these occur at night, they can make it hard to sleep soundly and leave you dragging the next day.
        Problems associated with the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of your neck that regulates your metabolism, may also cause fatigue. When the thyroid gland is underactive and produces inadequate levels of thyroid hormone (a condition called hypothyroidism), it can make you feel tired, in addition to other symptoms. Women are more likely than men to have thyroid disease, and incidence rises with age.
        Your diet. If you are not eating a well-balanced diet, it may result in vitamin deficiencies that can sap your energy. Two of the more common ones are vitamin D and vitamin B12 deficiencies. Fatigue is also sometimes brought on by dehydration.
        Poor sleep habits or sleep disorders. Perhaps the most obvious reason you might be feeling tired is that you are not getting adequate sleep. Sometimes this results from bad sleep habits. Staying up late at night, too much screen time — those habits can definitely affect people's energy level. People who have work schedules that require staying up all night may also have difficulty getting a consistent block of time to achieve restful, deep sleep. But inadequate sleep can also be caused by insomnia or poor sleep quality triggered by stress, or sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea. If you have obstructive sleep apnea, tissues in your throat relax during sleep, periodically blocking your airway, causing breathing interruptions that disrupt sleep.
        Medical conditions and medications. Fatigue may be the predominant symptom in people with depression. Numerous medical conditions, including infections, anemia, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, neurological conditions, and autoimmune conditions also cause fatigue. Certain medications can also make people feel tired or drowsy.
        Overcoming fatigue
        If you are experiencing fatigue that lasts for more than a day or two, try to determine what is causing you to feel so tired and then test different solutions to see if they help.
        Make lifestyle changes. If you suspect that lifestyle factors, such as poor sleep or eating habits, are causing your fatigue, work on improving your diet and focusing on following good sleep practices at night. (See ""How to get a better night's sleep."")
        Fatigue may also be brought on by a sedentary lifestyle, so it is important to make sure you are getting enough physical activity. While it can be a challenge to get moving if you are tired all the time, exercise can help you feel better if you give it a chance. As with any type of behavioral change, recognize that it may feel too difficult. Try to break things down into small, achievable goals. For example, you might start by doing two minutes of exercise a day, and then after a few days increase it to five minutes, and then 10 minutes, she says. Getting more physical activity into your day can also help you sleep more soundly at night.
        Check your medications. Fatigue may be caused by certain medications. If you are taking a new medication and suddenly experience fatigue, reach out to your doctor.
        Promote calm. If anxiety or stress is triggering your symptoms, paying attention to your mental health should be a priority. Cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness meditation practice, and stress reduction strategies can help.
        
          
            
              
                How to get a better night's sleep
                If you are experiencing sleep disturbances, improving your sleep habits may help. Strategies to try include the following:
                
                  Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.
                
                Avoid electronic devices at least two hours before bed, because the light from these devices may disturb your body's natural sleep clock.
                
                  Sleep in a quiet, dark, cool space.
                
                
                  Avoid caffeine late in the day.
                
                Get regular exercise. 
                Avoid alcohol before bed. Alcohol may help you fall asleep faster, but it generally results in more fragmented sleep, and sleep quality in people who are alcohol users tends to be worse.
                However, if these strategies do not help, and the sleep problems you are experiencing are frequent and affect your daily life, it is time to visit your health care professional.
              
            
          
        
        Seeing your doctor
        However, not all causes of fatigue are treatable on your own. You may need to pay a visit to your primary care provider. Warning signs for fatigue include severe or persistent symptoms or when it interferes with your ability to function. If this is the case, it may be time to make an appointment to get checked out.
        Your clinician will want information about your diet, physical activity, sleep habits, stress level, and mood. He or she will do a physical exam and likely order blood tests to rule out anemia or a thyroid disorder. If your fatigue is being caused by an underlying medical condition, treating it can often help you get your energy back.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/drugs-that-relieve-nerve-pain,Drugs that relieve nerve pain,"For chronic muscle and joint pain, effective therapies include rest, ice and heat, anti-inflammatory medications, and time. Usually, the pain calms down and you feel better.
        However, muscle and joints may be only part of the picture. For instance, pain can be coming  primarily from irritated nerves, along with the injured and inflamed muscle or joint.
        Often the discomfort is only arising from nerve pain. Typical signs of this ""neuropathic"" pain include sharp, stinging pain or pain that radiates from one part of the body to adjacent areas. One of the most common causes is diabetes, although it can also be brought on by injury, infection, and some medications.
        People experiencing nerve pain say things like, ""My knee hurts and I feel like it's coming up to the middle of my thigh and down to my shin.""
        In neuropathic pain, the nerve that was the mere messenger of pain now becomes the actual source. Narcotic pain relievers don't often help and even when they do, they should not be used as a long term solution. Fortunately there are other options. Certain drugs that were originally developed to treat depression and seizure disorders also damp down inappropriate or excessive pain signaling in the nerves.
        
          
            
              
                Types of pain: Nociceptive vs. neuropathic
                
                  Nociceptive (body) pain comes from damaged tissues outside the nervous system, such as muscles and joints. People say the pain feels aching and throbbing.
                  Neuropathic (nerve) pain comes from the nerves that transmit pain signals from the body to the brain. People often describe the pain as burning, stinging, or shooting. It may radiate from one area of the body to another. It may be accompanied by numbness and tingling.

        Nerve pain medications
        A variety of drugs can be added to conventional pain relievers to reduce nerve pain. Adding one of these nerve pain medications  won't completely take the pain away, but it may help.
        Anticonvulsants: These medications were developed to control seizures, but they also help to blunt pain signals in the nerves. Several are in wide use for chronic pain (see ""Medications for nerve pain"").

                Dry mouth, sexual dysfunction, dizziness, constipation, blurred vision, and upset stomach.
              
              
                Nausea, dizziness, sweating. Tend to have fewer side effects than tricyclic antidepressants.
              
              
                Drowsiness, dizziness, and nausea. Avoid alcohol when taking these drugs.
              
            
          
        
        It takes about three to four weeks for the full effect to kick in. Your doctor will usually start you on a low dose and gradually increase it. That reduces side effects.
        Antidepressants: Certain types of antidepressants also help to control nerve pain. They may have a synergistic effect in people who experience depression along with chronic pain. Chronic pain often causes depression, and depression can intensify a person's sensitivity to pain; some antidepressants address both. There are three options:
        
          Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil), doxepin (Sinequan), and nortriptyline (Pamelor). These drugs are prescribed for pain at doses lower than are effective for depression.
          Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor). SNRIs have fewer side effects than tricyclics, although some research suggests they may be less effective.
          Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac), are the most commonly prescribed medications for depression. Some doctors may try these for treating nerve pain, too, but the evidence for effective pain relief is mixed.
        
        Doctors usually try one type or the other (antidepressants or anticonvulsants), although they can be combined. They can be taken daily in addition to conventional as-needed pain relievers.",Unknown,"February 26, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/is-bronchitis-contagious,Is bronchitis contagious?,"Bronchitis is most often caused by a respiratory infection that can make you cough and wheeze and make it harder to breathe. Bronchitis itself is not contagious, but the viruses and bacteria that cause bronchitis can be.
        What is bronchitis?
        Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchi and bronchioles, the airways that deliver oxygen to your lungs. The inflamed airways become narrow and produce thick mucus, which leads to the typical symptoms of coughing and wheezing.
        Bronchitis is classified into two main types, acute and chronic.
        Acute (or short-term) bronchitis is commonly called a chest cold. It usually goes away in one to three weeks and happens more often in the winter months, when people spend a lot of time indoors. In addition to coughing, acute bronchitis symptoms can include fever, sore throat, chest tightness, and body aches, which can be mild to severe. Germs that cause acute bronchitis can be spread to others.
        Chronic (or long-term) bronchitis, on the other hand, happens if your airways have been inflamed for a long period of time — for three months or more and for at least two years in a row. Most often, the underlying diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that can develop from smoking, frequent infections, or breathing irritating substances in the environment such as chemical fumes and dust. Chronic bronchitis is not contagious.
        What causes bronchitis?
        In most cases, acute bronchitis symptoms are caused by a virus, such as those that also cause the common cold, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19. Less often, it can be caused by bacteria that settle in your lungs. Acute bronchitis caused by a virus is more likely to be contagious than bronchitis caused by bacteria.
        Not everyone who gets a cold, the flu, or other respiratory infection will get bronchitis. You are more likely to develop acute bronchitis if you smoke, have asthma or allergies, or live in a polluted area or crowded conditions.
        Acute bronchitis usually gets better on its own, without treatment. Antibiotics are rarely needed for this type of lower respiratory infection. Usually, a person is contagious until their cold and flu symptoms, such as cough, sore throat, and fever, have gone away.
        There are no tests to diagnose acute bronchitis. However, your doctor may want to check for pneumonia or other lung problems, which can cause similar symptoms, by having you get a chest x-ray. If your chest x-ray shows you have pneumonia, it can be treated with antibiotics.
        How does bronchitis spread?
        Acute viral bronchitis can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, sending microscopic droplets containing virus or bacteria into the air. These droplets can land in someone's mouth or nose or be inhaled into their lungs.
        Bronchitis-causing infections can also spread when an infected person shakes hands with another person or touches a common surface, such as a doorknob or railing, that is later touched by someone else. The newly exposed person can then get infected when he or she touches their nose, mouth, or eyes.
        Preventing the spread of bronchitis
        If you have bronchitis, you can help prevent spreading it to others with these steps:
        
          Stay home from work or school until you feel better.
          Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your forearm when coughing or sneezing.
          Wear a face mask if you're around other people.
          Avoid sharing things like pillows, towels, glasses, or utensils with others.
          Wash your hands often, especially after you have been coughing or sneezing.
        
        Help yourself avoid a respiratory infection by
        
          trying to keep distant from people who have cold symptoms
          washing your hands often, and avoiding touching your nose, mouth, or eyes
          getting recommended vaccines
          not smoking and trying to avoid secondhand smoke.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","February 26, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-alkaline-water-better,Is alkaline water better?,"Question:
          Is alkaline water better for you than plain water?
        
        Answer: The simple answer is no. There is not any evidence to support choosing bottled or home-treated alkaline water over safe tap water or regular bottled water.
        To better understand what is meant by alkaline water, let's start with a review of pH. This is a measure of the acid-base balance of a fluid. The range of pH is zero to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral.
        A pH above 7 means the fluid is alkaline (basic) and a pH below 7 is acidic. The higher the pH number the more alkaline it is, and the lower the number the greater the acidity. For reference, the normal pH of our blood is slightly alkaline, with a range of 7.35 to 7.45. The fluid in the human stomach is very acidic, with a usual pH of 1.5 to 3.5.
        The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that town water pH should range between 6.5 and 8.5, with most town water averaging around 7.5. Common bottled waters are usually close to neutral at a pH of 7.0. Bottled alkaline water has a higher pH between 8 and 9.
        Because the fluid in the stomach is so acidic, once regular or alkaline water gets down to your stomach there will be little difference in the resulting stomach fluid pH. You could potentially raise the stomach fluid pH by drinking a lot of alkaline water, but it would only be temporary. Even if you drank enough alkaline water to slightly raise the pH of your blood, your kidneys would quickly go into action to rebalance your blood pH.
        One potential benefit of alkaline water is to provide symptom relief of heartburn from acid reflux. But again, this would only be temporary. There are much more effective options, such as antacids and drugs that block stomach acid production.
        There are possible disadvantages from drinking alkaline water with pH levels above 9. The water will likely have a bitter taste. And for people who regularly take stomach acid production blockers called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to maintain a higher stomach pH, drinking strong alkaline water could be dangerous. Adding alkaline water could raise that pH even more and might result in an increased blood pH, which can alter the normal blood levels of chemicals like potassium, especially if they have kidney disease.","Howard E.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-sleeping-with-an-eye-mask-improve-learning-and-alertness-202402213017,Does sleeping with an eye mask improve learning and alertness?,"All of us have an internal clock that regulates our circadian rhythms, including when we sleep and when we are awake. And light is the single most important factor that helps establish when we should feel wakeful (generally during the day) and when we should feel sleepy (typically at night).
        So, let me ask you a personal question: just how dark is your bedroom? To find out why that matters — and whether sleeping in an eye mask is worthwhile — read on.
        How is light related to sleep?
        Our circadian system evolved well before the advent of artificial light. As anyone who has been to Times Square can confirm, just a few watts of power can trick the brain into believing that it is daytime at any time of night. So, what's keeping your bedroom alight?
        
          A tablet used in bed at night to watch a movie is more than 100 times brighter than being outside when there is a full moon.
          Working on or watching a computer screen at night is about 10 times brighter than standing in a well-lit parking lot.
        
        Light exposure at night affects the natural processes that help prepare the body for sleep. Specifically, your pineal gland produces melatonin in response to darkness. This hormone is integral for the circadian regulation of sleep.
        What happens when we are exposed to light at night?
        Being exposed to light at night suppresses melatonin production, changing our sleep patterns. Compared to sleeping without a night light, adults who slept next to a night light had shallower sleep and more frequent arousals. Even outdoor artificial light at night, such as street lamps, has been linked with getting less sleep.
        But the impact of light at night is not limited to just sleep. It's also associated with increased risk of developing depressive symptoms, obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Light exposure misaligned with our circadian rhythms — that is, dark during the day and light at night — is one reason scientists believe that shift work puts people at higher risk for serious health problems.
        Could sleeping with an eye mask help?
        Researchers from Cardiff University in the United Kingdom conducted a series of experiments to see if wearing an eye mask while sleeping at night could improve certain measures of learning and alertness.
        Roughly 90 healthy young adults, 18 to 35 years of age, alternated between sleeping while wearing an eye mask or being exposed to light at night. They recorded their sleep patterns in a sleep diary.
        In the first part of the study, participants wore an intact eye mask for a week. Then during the next week, they wore an eye mask with a hole exposing each eye so that the mask didn't block the light.
        After sleeping with no light exposure (wearing the intact eye mask) and with minimal light exposure (the eye mask with the holes), participants completed three cognitive tasks on days six and seven of each week:
        
          First was a paired-associate learning task. This helps show how effectively a person can learn new associations. Here the task was learning related word pairs. Participants performed better after wearing an intact eye mask during sleep in the days leading up to the test than after being exposed to light at night.
          Second, the researchers administered a psychomotor vigilance test, which assesses alertness. Blocking light at night also improved reaction times on this task.
          Finally, a motor skill learning test was given, which involved tapping a five-digit sequence in the correct order. For this task, there was no difference in performance whether participants had worn an intact eye mask or been exposed to light at night.
        
        What else did the researchers learn?
        No research study is ever perfect, so it is important to take the conclusions above with a grain of salt.
        According to sleep diary data, there was no difference in the amount of sleep, nor in their perceptions of sleep quality, regardless of whether people wore an eye mask or not.
        Further, in a second experiment with about 30 participants, the researchers tracked sleep objectively using a monitoring device called the Dreem headband. They found no changes to the structure of sleep — for example, how much time participants spent in REM sleep — when wearing an eye mask.
        Should I rush out to buy an eye mask before an important meeting or exam?
        If you decide to try using an eye mask, you probably don't need to pay extra for overnight shipping. Instead, follow a chronobiologist's rule of thumb: ""bright days, dark nights.""
        
          During the daytime, get as much natural daylight as you possibly can: go out to pick up your morning bagel from a local bakery, take a short walk during your afternoon lull at work.
          In the evening, reduce your exposure to electronic devices such as your cell phone, and use the night-dimming modes on these devices. Make sure that you turn off all unnecessary lights. Finally, try to make your bedroom as dark as possible when you go to bed. This could mean turning the alarm clock next to your bed away from you or covering up the light on a humidifier.
        
        Of course, you might decide a well-fitted, comfortable eye mask is a useful addition to your light hygiene toolkit. Most cost $10 to $20, so you may find yourself snoozing better and improving cognitive performance for the price of a few cups of coffee.","Eric Zhou, PhD","February 21, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ketamine-for-treatment-resistant-depression-when-and-where-is-it-safe-202208092797,Ketamine for treatment-resistant depression: When and where is it safe?,"Ketamine is an unusual type of psychedelic drug — called a dissociative — that has surged in popularity. It reliably produces pain control, forgetfulness, intoxication, disassociation, and euphoria, effects that underlie its medical and recreational uses.
        Originally derived from PCP, or ""angel dust,"" ketamine has been used in hospitals and veterinary clinics as an anesthetic for decades. It's also been cited as a drug of misuse under the moniker ""special K.""
        More recently, it has been widely used for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) — that is, severe depression that has not improved with several other therapies, including people who are experiencing suicidal thoughts.
        What do we know about the benefits of ketamine?
        A prescription version of ketamine called esketamine (Spravato), given through a nasal spray, was approved in 2019 by the FDA for hard-to-treat depression. However, guidelines required its use ""under the supervision of a health care provider in a certified doctor's office or clinic."" That means medical professionals need to watch you use it, and then follow you after you've taken your dose, checking your vital signs and how you are doing clinically.
        The effectiveness of ketamine nasal spray for TRD was first demonstrated for short-term treatment in research that showed meaningful decreases in depression scores for the group given ketamine over the group that received a placebo. (It's worth noting that participants in both groups continued taking their regular antidepressants due to concerns around not treating TRD in the placebo group.)
        A longer-term study found that nasal ketamine (plus their regular antidepressant) helped people stay in stable remission 16 weeks into treatment.
        Relief from TRD with ketamine happens rapidly: instead of waiting for an antidepressant medicine to hopefully provide some relief over the course of weeks, people who are suffering under the crushing weight of depression can start to feel the benefits of ketamine within about 40 minutes.
        Is ketamine the right treatment for you?
        First, it's important to remember that ketamine isn't a first-option treatment for depression. It's generally used only when other, more longstanding treatments haven't been effective. Ketamine doesn't offer a cure; rather, it improves symptoms of depression for a certain amount of time.
        Talk to your primary care doctor, your mental health provider, and any other health care professionals who care for you to help make a decision. Based on your goals, your experiences with depression, and the possible side effects of the drug, it's often easier to say who isn't appropriate for ketamine treatment.
        Should you go to a ketamine clinic for treatment?
        Independent, outpatient ketamine clinics are popping up all over the place. It is estimated that there are currently hundreds to thousands of these clinics — almost all of which were established in 2019 when ketamine was approved for treatment-resistant depression.
        Typically, these clinics are for-profit enterprises. They are staffed by some combination of either a psychiatrist or an anesthesiologist (who can administer the infusion), a nurse, a social worker, and (of course) the businesspeople who make it all work.
        In writing this piece I called several ketamine clinics, posing as a patient, to investigate what would be involved in receiving ketamine therapy. Most of them seemed as if they would provide ketamine for me without any major hurdles, after an introductory medical interview by a nurse or a social worker. A few clinics required communication or a diagnosis from my psychiatrist — and this seemed quite sensible.
        The clinics operate on a fee-for-service arrangement, so you would pay out of pocket, as insurance rarely covers this treatment. In the Boston area where I live, the ketamine infusions cost about $600 each, and a course of six infusions and a clinical re-evaluation are typically recommended. (I should note that the ketamine clinics affiliated with medical academic institutions seem to have more safeguards in place, and they may also be enrolling people in clinical trials.)
        Are ketamine clinics safe?
        What should you look for in a reputable and safe ketamine clinic? We don't yet have definitive answers to that question. A ketamine infusion can cause a profound dissociation from reality. One wonders if ketamine would be better controlled in a hospital setting, where there are protocols for safety in case anything goes wrong.
        It was unclear (in part because I didn't actually go through with the therapy) how much communication, if any, there would be between the ketamine clinic staff and your health care providers. And, typically, the treatments you receive would not be included in your primary electronic medical record.
        A new wrinkle is mail-order ketamine clinics, offer compounded ketamine products, including formulations that dissolve in your mouth. With varying amounts of medical information collected and clinical input, these clinics will mail out these products. In 2023, the FDA warned patients and healthcare providers about potential risks of using compounded ketamine products to treat depression or other psychiatric disorders.
        What are the side effects?
        Ketamine is generally considered safe, including for those who are experiencing suicidal ideation (thoughts or plans for suicide). The main side effects are dissociation, intoxication, sedation, high blood pressure, dizziness, headache, blurred vision, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting. Ketamine is avoided or used with extreme caution in the following groups:
        
          people with a history of psychosis or schizophrenia, as there is concern that the dissociation ketamine produces can make psychotic disorders worse
          people with a history of substance use disorder, because ketamine can cause euphoria (likely by triggering the opioid receptors) and some people can become addicted to it (which is called ketamine use disorder)
          teenagers, as there are some concerns about the long-term effects of ketamine on the still-developing adolescent brain
          people who are pregnant or breastfeeding
          older adults who have symptoms of dementia.
        
        More detailed research needs to be done on the longer-term benefits and side effects of ketamine treatment, and on its safety and effectiveness for teens and older adults, as well as for the emerging indications of ketamine therapy for PTSD, OCD, alcohol use disorder, and other mental health conditions.
        Finally, there is some concern that, with repeated dosing, ketamine can start to lose its effectiveness and require larger doses to produce the same effect, which is not sustainable.
        Ketamine could provide hope for people with serious depression
        Serious, treatment-resistant depression can rob people of hope for the future and hope that they will ever feel better. Ketamine can provide help and hope to patients who have not found relief with any other treatments. Given its efficacy in people considering suicide, it is plausible that ketamine may be lifesaving.
        As we learn more from research on ketamine and from people's experiences in newer clinics, we will be better able to answer the questions of ketamine's longer-term effectiveness and what safeguards are needed for treatment. We may also learn who is most likely to safely benefit from ketamine therapies, and the best method of administration: intravenous infusion, a nasal spray, or a pill.","Peter Grinspoon, MD","February 15, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/new-research-shows-little-risk-of-infection-from-prostate-biopsies-202402123013,New research shows little risk of infection from prostate biopsies,"Infections after a prostate biopsy are rare, but they do occur. Now research shows that fewer than 2% of men develop confirmed infections after prostate biopsy, regardless of the technique used.
        In the United States, doctors usually thread a biopsy needle through the rectum and then into the prostate gland while watching their progress on an ultrasound machine. This is called a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS). Since the biopsy needle passes through the rectum, there's a chance that fecal bacteria will be introduced into the prostate or escape into the bloodstream. For that reason, doctors typically treat a patient with antibiotics before initiating the procedure.
        Alternatively, the biopsy needle can be passed through the peritoneum, which is a patch of skin between the anus and the base of the scrotum. These transperitoneal prostate (TP) biopsies, as they are called, are also performed with ultrasound guidance, and since they bypass the rectum, antibiotics typically aren't required. In that way, TP biopsies help to keep antibiotic resistance at bay, and European medical guidelines strongly favor this approach, citing a lower risk of infection.
        Study goals and methodology
        TP biopsies aren't widely adopted in the United States, in part because doctors lack familiarity with the method and need further training to perform it. The technology is steadily improving, and TP biopsies are increasingly being conducted in office settings around the country. But questions remain about how TRUS and TP biopsies compare in terms of their infectious complications.
        To investigate, researchers at Albany Medical Center in New York conducted the first-ever randomized clinical trial comparing infection risks associated with either method. The results were published in February in the Journal of Urology.
        The Albany team randomized 718 men to either a TRUS or TP biopsy. Nearly all the men who got a TRUS biopsy (and with few exceptions, none of the TP-treated men) first received a single-day course of antibiotics. All the biopsies were administered between 2019 and 2022 by three urologists working at the Medical Center's affiliated and nonaffiliated hospitals.
        The men were then monitored for fever, genitourinary infections, antibiotic prescriptions for suspected or confirmed infections, sepsis, and infection-related contacts with caregivers. Researchers collected data during a visit conducted two weeks after a biopsy procedure, and then by phone over an additional 30-day period following this initial meeting.
        What the researchers found
        According to the results, 1.1% of men in the TRUS group and 1.4% of men in the transperineal group wound up with confirmed infections. The difference was not statistically significant. If ""possible"" infections were counted (for example, antibiotic prescriptions for fever), then the rates increased to 2.6% and 2.7% of men in the TRUS and TP groups, respectively.
        Fever was the most frequent complication, reported by six participants in each group. One participant from each group also developed noninfectious urinary retention, requiring the temporary use of a catheter. None of the men developed sepsis or required post-biopsy treatments for bleeding.
        The study had some limitations: Nearly all the participants were white, and so the results may not be applicable to men from other racial and ethnic groups. Furthermore, since all the men were biopsied by a single institution, it's unclear if the findings are generalizable in other settings. Still, the study provides reassuring evidence that both types of biopsies ""appear safe and viable options for clinical practice,"" the authors concluded.
        Commentary from experts
        ""The paper provides needed evidence that TP biopsies without antibiotics are about as safe and efficacious as TRUS biopsies with antibiotics,"" said Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The findings also help to dispel a growing view that transperineal biopsies are superior, Dr. Garnick pointed out.
        ""Recent years have witnessed a marked interest and surge in the transperineal approach, primarily driven by early studies suggesting a lower risk of infectious complications compared with transrectal biopsy,"" said Dr. Boris Gershman, a urologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, and a member of Harvard Health Publishing's Annual Report on Prostate Diseases advisory board.
        ""Interestingly, the investigators find no difference in infectious complications, and it will be important to see if other ongoing studies report similar results,"" Dr. Gershman continued. ""In addition to safety, we also need to confirm whether there are any meaningful differences between the two approaches with respect to cancer detection rates.""",Charlie Schmidt,"February 12, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/fighting-inflammation-with-food,Fighting inflammation with food,"In the fight against chronic inflammation — a state of persistent activation of the immune system — your diet is a powerful weapon. Eating healthy foods helps quiet chronic inflammation, and it benefits your health in other ways (like lowering cholesterol levels). Chronic inflammation often is seen with, and may contribute to, chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline.
        Where do you find inflammation-fighting foods? They're all part of a Mediterranean-style diet, which consists of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, lean proteins, and small amounts of dairy foods and olive oil.
        ""Plant-based foods provide us with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals—plant chemicals that appear to fight free radicals [molecules that damage cells] and may protect our cells against inflammation, cancer growth, and viruses,"" says Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Fish, nuts, and plant oils contain healthy unsaturated fats, which are good for your blood vessels, heart, and brain.""
        Here are some foods that support the quest to keep inflammation in check.
        Berries
        Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries may just seem like sweet treats. But berries are also hardworking inflammation fighters. Berries contain phytochemicals called anthocyanins, which give the fruits their red and purple hues. Anthocyanins have an anti-inflammatory effect on cells and are associated with lower risks of heart disease, cognitive decline, and diabetes.
        Fatty fish
        Fatty fish — such as salmon, tuna, and sardines — are abundant sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. That benefit might be due to reduced inflammation in the body, especially in the blood vessels (protecting them against the buildup of plaque). Some evidence has found that eating fatty fish is associated with lower levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker in the blood.
        Leafy greens
        Green leafy vegetables — such as arugula, chard, kale, and spinach — are loaded with vitamins A, B, C, E, and K, as well as important minerals (iron, magnesium, and potassium) and phytochemicals. Spinach is associated with a reduction in inflammation levels over time, slowed cognitive decline, and reduced risks for coronary artery disease and stroke.
        Nuts and seeds
        Tiny but mighty, nuts and seeds (such as pistachios, almonds, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds) are rich in fiber and other nutrients that help keep your gut bacteria healthy and in turn may help tamp down brain inflammation (see ""Shield your memory from decline""). Certain nuts and seeds — such as walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and hemp seeds — are also good sources of omega-3 fatty acids.
        Tomatoes
        Tomatoes get their superpowers from a phytochemical called lycopene. It not only gives tomatoes their vibrant red color, but also appears to help reduce levels of interleukin-6, a protein that causes inflammation. Tomatoes are also associated with reduced risks for developing heart disease and prostate cancer.
        What to eat
        To get enough foods that fight inflammation, eat at least two servings of fatty fish per week and at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day (two fruits, three vegetables). It's okay to enjoy a handful of nuts or seeds each day. And you'll want to bulk up on fiber sources, such as legumes like beans and lentils (women older than 50 need 21 grams of fiber per day; men need 30 grams per day).
        ""For the most impact, get the widest variety of plant-based foods possible in each meal. For example, make a big green salad with several kinds of greens and colorful vegetables, seeds, berries, and a simple dressing of a little olive oil and vinegar,"" McManus suggests. ""Or cook whole grains such as quinoa or brown rice, and stir in the greens of your choice, beans, and colorful vegetables like carrots, squash, and tomatoes.""
        It's easiest to toss extra plant foods into a meal when you have them on hand. ""If produce seems to spoil faster than you can use it, keep it in your freezer, divided into small amounts. That way, you can reach for fruits and vegetables when you need them,"" says McManus.
        And as much as possible, avoid eating processed foods. They typically contain high amounts of calories, added sugars, unhealthy saturated fats, and salt, and are associated with chronic inflammation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-migraine-medications-are-most-helpful-202402053014,Which migraine medications are most helpful?,"If you suffer from the throbbing, intense pain set off by migraine headaches, you may well wonder which medicines are most likely to offer relief. A recent study suggests a class of drugs called triptans are the most helpful option, with one particular drug rising to the top.
        The study drew on real-world data gleaned from more than three million entries on My Migraine Buddy, a free smartphone app. The app lets users track their migraine attacks and rate the helpfulness of any medications they take.
        Dr. Elizabeth Loder, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the Division of Headache at Brigham and Women's Hospital, helped break down what the researchers looked at and learned that could benefit anyone with migraines.
        What did the migraine study look at?
        Published in the journal Neurology, the study included self-reported data from about 278,000 people (mostly women) over a six-year period that ended in July 2020. Using the app, participants rated migraine treatments they used as ""helpful,"" ""somewhat helpful,"" or ""unhelpful.""
        The researchers looked at 25 medications from seven drug classes to see which were most helpful for easing migraines. After triptans, the next most helpful drug classes were ergots such as dihydroergotamine (Migranal, Trudhesa) and anti-emetics such as promethazine (Phenergan). The latter help ease nausea, another common migraine symptom.
        ""I'm always happy to see studies conducted in a real-world setting, and this one is very clever,"" says Dr. Loder. The results validate current guideline recommendations for treating migraines, which rank triptans as a first-line choice. ""If you had asked me to sit down and make a list of the most helpful migraine medications, it would be very similar to what this study found,"" she says.
        What else did the study show about migraine pain relievers?
        Ibuprofen, an over-the-counter pain reliever sold as Advil and Motrin, was the most frequently used medication in the study. But participants rated it ""helpful"" only 42% of the time. Only acetaminophen (Tylenol) was less helpful, helping just 37% of the time. A common combination medication containing aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine (sold under the brand name Excedrin) worked only slightly better than ibuprofen, or about half the time.
        When researchers compared helpfulness of other drugs to ibuprofen, they found:
        
          Triptans scored five to six times more helpful than ibuprofen. The highest ranked drug, eletriptan, helped 78% of the time. Other triptans, including zolmitriptan (Zomig) and sumatriptan (Imitrex), were helpful 74% and 72% of the time, respectively. In practice, notes Dr. Loder, eletriptan seems to be just a tad better than the other triptans.
          Ergots were rated as three times more helpful than ibuprofen.
          Anti-emetics were 2.5 times as helpful as ibuprofen.
        
        Do people take more than one medicine to ease migraine symptoms?
        In this study, two-thirds of migraine attacks were treated with just one drug. About a quarter of the study participants used two drugs, and a smaller number used three or more drugs.
        However, researchers weren't able to tease out the sequence of when people took the drugs. And with anti-nausea drugs, it's not clear if people were rating their helpfulness on nausea rather than headache, Dr. Loder points out. But it's a good reminder that for many people who have migraines, nausea and vomiting are a big problem. When that's the case, different drug formulations can help.
        Are pills the only option for migraine relief?
        No. For the headache, people can use a nasal spray or injectable version of a triptan rather than pills. Pre-filled syringes, which are injected into the thigh, stomach, or upper arm, are underused among people who have very rapid-onset migraines, says Dr. Loder. ""For these people, injectable triptans are a game changer because pills don't work as fast and might not stay down,"" she says.
        For nausea, the anti-emetic ondansetron (Zofran) is very effective, but one of the side effects is headache. You're better off using promethazine or prochlorperazine (Compazine), both of which treat nausea but also help ease headache pain, says Dr. Loder.
        Additionally, many anti-nausea drugs are available as rectal suppositories. This is especially helpful for people who have ""crash"" migraines, which often cause people to wake up vomiting with a migraine, she adds.
        What are the limitations of this migraine study?
        The data didn't include information about the timing, sequence, formulation, or dosage of the medications. It also omitted two classes of newer migraine medications — known as gepants and ditans — because there was only limited data on them at the time of the study. These options include
        
          atogepant (Qulipta) and rimegepant (Nurtec)
          lasmiditan (Reyvow).
        
        ""But based on my clinical experience, I don't think that any of these drugs would do a lot better than the triptans,"" says Dr. Loder.
        Another shortcoming is the study population: a selected group of people who are able and motivated to use a migraine smartphone app. That suggests their headaches are probably worse than the average person, but that's exactly the population for whom this information is needed, says Dr. Loder.
        ""Migraines are most common in young, healthy people who are trying to work and raise children,"" she says. It's good to know that people using this app rate triptans highly, because from a medical point of view, these drugs are well tolerated and have few side effects, she adds.
        Are there other helpful takeaways?
        Yes. In the study, nearly half the participants said their pain wasn't adequately treated. A third reported using more than one medicine to manage their migraines.
        If you experience these problems, consult a health care provider who can help you find a more effective therapy. ""If you're using over-the-counter drugs, consider trying a prescription triptan,"" Dr. Loder says. If nausea and vomiting are a problem for you, be sure to have an anti-nausea drug on hand.
        She also recommends using the Migraine Buddy app or the Canadian Migraine Tracker app (both are free), which many of her patients find helpful for tracking their headaches and triggers.",Julie Corliss,"February 5, 2024"

""On one hand, no one's done something quite like this before. On the other, however, it's really wrapping together health factors everyone has known for a number of years in new packaging.""

What's included on the scorecard?

Called the McCance Brain Care Score, the card tallies points from 12 physical, lifestyle, and social-emotional domains.

Physical components relate to


	blood pressure
	blood sugar
	cholesterol
	body mass index (BMI).


Lifestyle components include

Each response is given a score of 0, 1, or 2, with the highest possible score totaling 21. Higher scores suggest better brain care.

""All these physical and lifestyle factors can contribute to the risk of dementia to some extent through strokes,"" Dr. Budson says. ""Those that aren't a risk through strokes are usually related to the fact that a healthy brain is a brain that's using all of its parts. Engaging in healthy relationships and meaningful activities helps us maintain good brain structure and function.""

What did the analysis involve?

The study was published online in Frontiers of Neurology in December 2023. It involved nearly 399,000 adults ages 40 through 69 (average age 57; 54% women) who contributed personal health information to the UK Biobank.

    Workout Workbook


                
                    The numbers are shocking. Just three out of 10 American adults are active enough to stay healthy and fit, and nearly four out of 10 admit they aren’t active at all, despite reams of research proving that exercise is a powerful preventive, and sometimes an antidote, for disability and illness. Which side of this divide are you standing on — and why? Maybe you’re not sure what blend of exercise is best. Or perhaps you know exactly what you need to do, but your workouts have become so humdrum that it’s harder than ever to dig up the energy to do them. Do you want to jump-start your sputtering exercise program? Or are you stuck on a plateau and wishing you could kick it up to the next level?

During an average follow-up period of 12.5 years, participants recorded 5,354 new cases of dementia and 7,259 strokes. Researchers found that participants with higher Brain Care Scores at the study's start had lower risks of developing dementia or strokes over time.

These threats to health and independence take a stunning — and growing — toll on people in the US. Dementia affects one in seven Americans, a rate expected to triple by 2050. Meanwhile, more than 795,000 people in the United States suffer a stroke each year, according to the CDC.

What did the study find?

Each five-point step higher in the BCS rating assigned when the study began was linked to significantly lower risks of dementia and stroke, with those odds varying by age group:


	Participants younger than 50 at the study's start were 59% less likely to develop dementia and 48% less likely to have a stroke with each five-point higher score on BCS.
	Participants 50 through 59 at the study's start were 32% less likely to develop dementia and 52% less likely to have a stroke with each five-point higher score on BCS.


But those brain disease benefits appeared to diminish for those older than 59 at the study's start. This group experienced only 8% lower odds of dementia and a 33% lower risk of stroke with each five-point higher score on BCS. Study authors theorized that some of these participants may have already been experiencing early dementia, which is difficult to detect until it progresses.

""I feel very comfortable that the study's conclusions are entirely correct, because all the factors that go into its BCS are well-known things people can do to reduce their risk of stroke and dementia,"" Dr. Budson says.

What are the study's limitations?

However, Dr. Budson notes that the study did have a couple of limitations,. The UK Biobank fell just short of collecting all the components of the BCS in its dataset, lacking meaning-of-life questions. So its scores ranged from 0 to 19, not up to 21. ""It's a practical limitation, but it should be acknowledged that so far, there have been no studies to validate the actual 21-point scale they're recommending we use,"" he says.

The analysis also evaluated participants' scores at just one point in time instead of several, Dr. Budson says. Future research should determine whether people can lower their stroke and dementia risk by improving their BCS over time with behavior and lifestyle changes.

How can you play this game at home?

While better brain health may be the clear prize of a higher score, it's far from the only benefit. That's because improving any health component of the BCS also benefits our overall well-being.

""By improving these factors, not only will people help their brain, but they'll also help their heart and reduce their risk of cancer,"" Dr. Budson adds. ""These factors will absolutely also improve your psychological health, which is certainly an important part of brain health.""

The scale's simple breakdown of health factors also makes it easy to focus on tweaking one or two without getting overwhelmed.

""Let's say someone's nutrition isn't perfect — and they know it — but they're not willing to change their diet. Fine. They can then decide to do more aerobic exercise, for example, or to stop drinking, or to get the sleep their body needs,"" he says.

What one change could put you on a path to better brain health?

If he had to choose just one factor to improve brain health, Dr. Budson would focus on meaning of life, ""which means you generally feel your life has meaning or purpose,"" he says. To do that, he suggests giving deep, quiet thought to what you wish your life's purpose to be, whether you expect to live a long time or just a few years.

""Once you have a purpose, then you have a reason to follow through with assessing all the other items on the BCS scale and seeing what you can do so you'll be around longer, and be competent and capable longer, to help fulfill the meaning and purpose of your life,"" he says.",Maureen Salamon,"February 2, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/alert-this-hidden-condition-increases-heart-attack-and-stroke-risks,Alert: This hidden condition increases heart attack and stroke risks,"It has an unfamiliar name, produces few symptoms, and involves a cluster of health problems. But metabolic syndrome is a common and dangerous condition that's steadily increasing in adults of all ages in the United States, largely a result of the obesity epidemic. The syndrome significantly increases the risks for heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and more.
        What is it?
        Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interrelated conditions. A diagnosis requires at least three of the following cardiovascular risk factors.
        Obesity. You have this risk factor if your waistline is greater than 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women, no matter your height, or if your body mass index is 30 or more.
        High blood sugar. After you eat, your body converts carbohydrates into blood glucose, a type of sugar that the body uses for energy. Sugar in the blood then enters your cells, where it's needed to produce energy. In people with diabetes or prone to it, this process is impaired, raising sugar levels in the blood and damaging the cells and blood vessels. A fasting blood sugar level of 100 milligrams per deciliter of blood (mg/dL) or more is considered high. Having diabetes (a fasting blood sugar of 126 mg/dL or higher) also counts as a metabolic syndrome risk factor.
        High triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood. Having a high level — 150 mg/dL or higher — increases your risk for heart disease and stroke. You can find your triglyceride levels in your cholesterol test results.
        Low HDL (good) cholesterol. HDL is another type of fat in the blood. It helps remove LDL (bad) cholesterol. If your HDL is below 40 mg/dL in men or 50 mg/dL in women, it's considered low.
        High blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if your systolic pressure (the top number in a measurement) is 130 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher, or your diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is 80 mm Hg or higher. If you're already taking medication for high blood pressure, you should still count this condition as a metabolic risk factor.
        What does it mean?
        When three or more of these risk factors occur together, metabolic syndrome is present, and numerous studies have shown that means you have higher risks for heart disease and stroke.
        ""Having just one of the risk factors is bad enough. But having more makes the likelihood of bad health outcomes greater. That's why clinicians developed the term metabolic syndrome many years ago: it helped identify people at risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Today we have even better risk calculators, which take other risk factors into account, such as age and activity levels. But you can still pay attention to metabolic syndrome as a way to recognize that trouble is brewing,"" says Dr. David M. Nathan, a Harvard Medical School professor and the director of the Diabetes Center and Clinical Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Metabolic syndrome also increases the risk for developing liver disease, kidney disease, or sleep apnea (a condition marked by pauses in breathing during sleep).
        
          
            
              
                What to eat when you have metabolic syndrome
                Having metabolic syndrome means you're likely overweight or that you have another condition, such as high blood sugar, cholesterol, or blood pressure, that may be stoked by an unhealthy diet. One of the best antidotes is eating a healthy plant-based diet. Swap junk food for lots of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and whole grains; moderate amounts of fish and poultry; and limited portions of red or processed meats. And do one thing more: ""Eat less. If you expend more calories than you're taking in, you'll lose weight,"" says Harvard Medical School diabetes expert Dr. David M. Nathan. His go-to tricks: eat smaller portions and focus on foods high in fiber (such as vegetables and legumes), which will keep you fuller longer.
              
            
          
        
        Diagnosis and treatment
        You can measure your waist to see if you have at least one metabolic syndrome risk factor. But you can't see the others. So perhaps discuss it at your next doctor appointment, and double-check your annual blood work results.
        The good news is that you can reverse metabolic syndrome. Losing weight is central to reducing many of its features. Lowering elevated blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels also plays a major role in reducing your risk for heart disease and stroke.
        If you can do that and live a healthy lifestyle — exercising daily, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, not smoking, and limiting alcohol intake — you'll not only decrease your risks for heart disease and diabetes, but also increase your odds of living longer.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/electricity-as-chronic-pain-medicine,Electricity as chronic pain medicine,"You might be willing to try anything to relieve chronic pain, even getting zapped with tiny shocks of electricity. The concept began evolving long before Ben Franklin conducted his famous experiments with a kite and a key; for example, the ancient Greeks used the natural electrical discharges of torpedo fish to relieve headache and gout. Eventually, as scientists figured out what electricity was and how to use it safely, they applied it to medicine. Today, there are several types of ""electroceutical"" therapies available to treat pain. Three have our attention.
        TENS therapy
        In transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy, a machine sends pulses of non-painful, low-intensity electricity to electrodes placed on the skin. The strength of the current and the frequency of the pulses (the number per second) remain consistent throughout a 20-minute session.
        How does TENS work to quiet pain? ""The electrical stimulation closes the 'gate' that allows pain signals to get to the brain. It's just like when you were a kid and got an 'ouch.' Your mom might have told you to rub it to make it feel better. That was enough to close the gate,"" explains Vitaly Napadow, director of the Scott Schoen and Nancy Adams Discovery Center for Recovery from Chronic Pain at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        You can go to a practitioner (such as a physical therapist) for TENS therapy or purchase a home TENS unit (about $25 and up). Medicare sometimes covers the costs.
        Electroacupuncture
        Like TENS therapy, electroacupuncture interrupts pain signals by delivering a consistent frequency of jolts at a certain strength. Instead of being delivered via electrode patches on the skin, it's delivered with acupuncture — hair-thin needles inserted at specific locations in the body. Electrodes are clipped onto the needles and then charged with electricity. ""The needles allow the current to penetrate deep underneath the skin, to muscles, tendons, and deeper nerves,"" Napadow says. ""The treatment has the added benefit of acupuncture, which — in traditional Chinese medicine — is believed to affect energy channels. Modern medicine has found that acupuncture can adjust signaling molecules in the nervous system.""
        Electroacupuncture is available only from a private practitioner or clinic. Sessions cost about $100 per hour, which is often covered in part by Medicare or private insurance.
        Scrambler therapy
        Scrambler therapy is a newer treatment that sends low-intensity electrical currents to electrodes on the skin. But the frequency of the pulses isn't steady; it changes constantly, with a goal of scrambling — not inhibiting — pain signals and replacing them with non-pain messages. The information is then perceived as a pleasant sensation, tingling, or itching.
        Scrambler therapy is found in hospitals or clinics, but it's not widely available. Most insurance companies don't cover the costs, which can be hundreds of dollars per session.
        Are they effective?
        Experts debate whether electroceutical therapies can zap away chronic pain. TENS therapy and electroacupuncture are well established, and some people swear by them for relief. But they don't work for everyone, and research has produced mixed findings.
        ""TENS therapy has lost some favor because it's thought that the effect isn't long-lasting. But I think a lot of that has to do with the parameters used in stimulation. At lower frequencies, you might be able to get longer-lasting results,"" Napadow says. ""And some evidence has shown that electroacupuncture can last for months after therapy. But you can't do it by yourself at home, like you can with TENS.""
        What about scrambler therapy? A review of small preliminary studies published July 13, 2023, in The New England Journal of Medicine found that scrambler therapy reduced chronic pain in 80% to 90% of study participants, that it might have long-lasting effects (months or years), and that it might be more effective than TENS therapy. But we'll need more research to confirm the findings.
        Is it right for you?
        Stay away from electroceuticals if you have any kind of implanted stimulation device, such as a pacemaker or bladder stimulator.
        Good candidates for electroceutical therapies are people who have chronic pain, such as arthritis, neuropathy (chronic tingling or pain in the limbs), neck or back pain, or pain from cancer treatment. Potential side effects include skin irritation from electrode patches, burns (which are rare) from electrodes, bleeding from acupuncture needles, dizziness, headaches, nausea, or worsened pain. ""Yes, there are risks, but in general they are lower than the potential for side effects from many pain medications,"" Napadow says.
        Get your doctor's okay before seeking treatment, especially if you have a heart condition such as an abnormal heartbeat. And make sure your electroceutical therapy clinician is a licensed health professional who's trained to provide treatment.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/do-i-still-need-to-keep-taking-a-statin,Do I still need to keep taking a statin?,"Q. 
          I'm 81 years old, and I've been on a statin drug for 30 years because I'm at increased risk for heart disease. At my age, do I need to still keep taking it?
        
        A. Statin drugs were introduced into medical practice in the 1980s. They are very effective at lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and in reducing inflammation inside cholesterol-filled plaques of atherosclerosis. In people older than 75, are they still effective in lowering cholesterol and in reducing the risk of heart disease? In the last few years, we have started to get solid information that addresses your question.
        A recent study from Denmark, published in the August 2023 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, included about 84,000 people — about 10,000 of whom were older than 75. Participants began taking one of two different statin drugs, simvastatin (Zocor) or atorvastatin (Lipitor), between 2008 and 2018. The study found that the people most likely to have their LDL cholesterol lowered by statin drugs were those older than 75.
        So, statins remain effective at lowering cholesterol in people older than 75. But do they also reduce the risk of developing heart disease? Another observational study from Denmark, published in The Lancet in 2020, identified more than 90,000 people not on statins who were free of heart disease or diabetes (a risk factor for heart disease) — and then started taking a statin drug. Over an average follow-up period of 7.7 years, the people who were most likely to benefit from statin drugs were those older than 75.
        Randomized trials provide stronger evidence than observational studies. However, relatively few randomized trials of the ability of statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs to reduce heart disease risk have included people older than 75. To overcome that problem, an international team based here at Harvard pooled the results for more than 21,000 people older than 75 (and even more who were younger than 75) from multiple different cholesterol-lowering drug trials. The study, published in 2020 in The Lancet, found that the older group benefited at least as much as the younger group.
        In short, for people older than 75 who have heart disease already, or who, like you, are at increased risk of developing heart disease, I think there now is solid evidence that statins remain effective at lowering cholesterol and, more important, in reducing the risk of new or recurrent heart disease. For people older than 75 who have not been diagnosed with heart disease and are not at increased risk for developing it, I think the value of statins still is uncertain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/will-walking-faster-reduce-your-diabetes-risk,Will walking faster reduce your diabetes risk?,"A study published online Nov. 28, 2023, by the British Journal of Sports Medicine suggests that picking up the pace of your daily walk — the faster, the better — is linked to a lower risk of developing diabetes. Researchers pooled the data of 10 studies from the past two decades, representing more than 508,000 adults (most of them middle-aged) from around the world. Participants were followed for three to 11 years. Compared with ""casual"" walking (at less than 2 mph), walking 2 mph to 3 mph (brisk walking) was associated with a 15% lower risk of diabetes, no matter how long people walked each day. Walking 3 mph to 4 mph was associated with a 24% lower diabetes risk. And going faster than 4 mph was tied to a 39% lower diabetes risk. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that lively stepping keeps you from getting diabetes. But we already know that brisk walking, like any aerobic activity that works your heart and lungs, helps you control blood sugar levels, weight, and cardiovascular health, which are all important for avoiding diabetes and many other chronic diseases.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/harvard-study-hot-yoga-may-help-ease-depression,Harvard study: Hot yoga may help ease depression,"You're in a yoga class and it's 105° Fahrenheit — on purpose. It's the setting for ""hot,"" or Bikram, yoga, a specific set of poses and breathing postures done in a heated, humid room. And it might help reduce moderate-to-severe depression, according to a randomized controlled trial published online Oct. 23, 2023, by the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. Harvard Medical School researchers randomly assigned 65 adults with depression (ages 18 to 60, some on antidepressants) to one of two groups. People in the first group were told to attend at least two 90-minute hot yoga sessions (in local hot yoga studios) per week, for eight weeks. People in the other group were placed on a waiting list for eight weeks. Compared with people on the waiting list, people in the yoga group had significantly reduced depression symptoms by the end of the study, even if they averaged only one yoga class per week. For example, symptoms eased by 50% or more for about 60% of the yoga participants, compared with 6% of the wait-listed people. The study did not investigate whether hot yoga was better than other types of yoga for treating depression. But it suggests that hot yoga can be used alone or in addition to medications to treat depression. Talk to your doctor before trying hot yoga, as it might pose risks if you have certain conditions, such as heart problems.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/anti-obesity-drug-lowers-heart-related-problems,Anti-obesity drug lowers heart-related problems,"Semaglutide — the highly in-demand drug that leads to dramatic weight loss — may also prevent heart attacks, strokes, and deaths in people with heart disease. This finding, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in the fall of 2023, marks the first time an treatment for obesity has been shown to help people live longer and have fewer cardiovascular problems (see ""Diet drugs: A disheartening history"").
        Developed as a drug for treating type 2 diabetes, semaglutide was first marketed as Ozempic. In addition to improving blood sugar control, the drug also helped people lose substantial amounts of weight. After studies confirmed this benefit, the FDA approved a higher-dose version of semaglutide (sold as Wegovy) for people who are overweight or obese.
        
          
            
              
                Diet drugs: A disheartening history
                For decades, drug companies have struggled to develop an effective, safe drug to help people lose weight. ""But many initially promising drugs never made it through the development phase, and others had to be pulled from the market,"" says Dr. Benjamin Scirica, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The most infamous example dates from 1997. A combination of two drugs, fenfluramine and phentermine (commonly known as phen-fen) was removed from pharmacy shelves after people taking the drug developed severe heart valve disease and pulmonary hypertension. In 2010, sibutramine (Meridia) was also withdrawn from the market after studies linked its use to a heightened risk for heart attack and stroke.
              
            
          
        
        Evidence for heart benefits
        The NEJM study compared a 2.4-milli­gram dose of semaglutide (the highest dose of Wegovy) to a placebo in more than 17,000 people with cardiovascular disease. All were overweight or obese, but none had diabetes. Over a follow-up period averaging 3.3 years, those who took semaglutide were 20% less likely to have a heart attack or stroke or to die from heart-related causes compared with those who took a placebo.
        ""The findings highlight the fact that obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease,"" says Dr. Benjamin Scirica, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. People taking semaglutide lost an average of nearly 19 pounds, which probably explains why their blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and inflammation levels all improved. However, other factors could also be involved, he says.
        A hormone mimic
        Semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) that mimic hormones made naturally by the gut and brain. These drugs prod the pancreas to release insulin, which helps control blood sugar. They also slow stomach emptying and suppress appetite, so people eat less. But there are also GLP-1 receptors in the heart, kidneys, and blood vessels, which means some of the heart-related benefits may be unrelated to weight loss, says Dr. Scirica.
        A related drug, terzepatide, combines GLP-1 with GIP, a hormone believed to promote the effects of GLP-1. Sold as Mounjaro for treating diabetes and as Zepbound for weight loss, terzepatide appears to foster even greater weight loss than semaglutide. A clinical trial testing terzepatide in people with obesity and a high risk of heart disease is currently under way.
        Who's a candidate?
        Anyone with type 2 diabetes is a candidate for either Ozempic or Mounjaro. ""I have many patients doing well on these drugs, and they are usually covered by insurance,"" says Dr. Scirica. Still, only about 30% of people with cardiovascular disease have diabetes. A far greater percentage — well over 50% — of people with cardiovascular disease are overweight or obese.
        Wegovy and Zepbound are FDA-approved for weight loss in people who meet the definition of obesity (a body mass index, or BMI, of 30 of greater) and for those who fall into the upper end of the overweight category (a BMI of 27 to 29.9) and also have a medical problem related to excess weight, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. But the overwhelming demand for these drugs means they're in short supply, Dr. Scirica says. They're also quite expensive, ranging from $900 to $1,600 per month. Medicare does not cover any medications for weight loss, although some private insurance companies do.
        However, given the intense interest and enthusiasm about these drugs, experts believe that recommendations as to who should use them will change in the coming years. What can you do in the meantime? ""Call your insurance company to see what your options are based on your current medical conditions, then speak with your physician,"" advises Dr. Scirica.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-best-anti-clotting-drug-for-afib,The best anti-clotting drug for afib?,"Q. 
          I have atrial fibrillation and take Xarelto. But I heard about a study that suggests Eliquis is more effective for preventing strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. I'm wondering if I should switch. Your thoughts?
        
        A. Both of these anti-clotting medications, rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis), are FDA-approved for preventing strokes in people with atrial fibrillation (afib). They both belong to a class of drugs known as direct oral anticoagulants, or DOACs. They work by inhibiting a substance called factor Xa, which plays a key role in blood clot formation. And both drugs have a half-life of about eight hours, which means that the blood level of the drug drops by half over an eight-hour period. But there are some differences between the two.
        The standard dose of rivaroxaban for preventing strokes due to afib is a 20-­milligram (mg) pill once a day. After you take the pill, blood levels are high over the following hours, but the level drops by half within eight hours. As a result, there's a large difference in the peak level versus the lowest level. In contrast, most people take apixaban as a 5-mg pill twice a day. Compared to rivaroxaban, the peak blood levels are not as high, and the lower level is not as low.
        High levels of an anti-clotting drug can lead to bleeding, while lower levels may increase the risk of blood clot formation. As such, it makes sense that the twice-a-day dosing would have a lower risk of bleeding and potentially better clot prevention.
        The study you're referring to, which looked at health records of more than 580,000 people who were prescribed either drug, supported that assumption: people taking apixaban experienced lower rates of both bleeding and clotting events. However, this was an observational trial, which means there may have been many differences between the people who were given one drug versus the other, and those differences could explain the results. Only a blinded, randomized clinical trial that controls for those possible differences can provide a more definitive answer.
        There is no clinical trial comparing rivaroxaban to apixaban. But both drugs have been pitted against warfarin (Coumadin), an older medication that was the mainstay for clot prevention before DOACs were approved. The findings seem to support the trend shown by the large observational trial; that is, apixaban compared to warfarin had lower rates of bleeding, stroke, and death, whereas rivaroxaban had no significant difference on these events compared to warfarin. With only these indirect comparisons, however, we can't say for sure that apixaban is better than rivaroxaban.
        The downside to apixaban is that you have to take it twice a day. People who are likely to forget their second dose may be better off taking rivaroxaban. Talk to your doctor about whether it makes sense for you to switch.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-portfolio-diet-a-smart-investment-for-your-heart,The portfolio diet: A smart investment for your heart,"The portfolio diet, which emphasizes plant foods rich in fiber and healthy fats, was conceived some 20 years ago. Since then, many studies have documented the diet's ability to lower harmful LDL cholesterol. But because none of those trials lasted any longer than six months, the portfolio diet's long-term returns were unknown. Now, new research suggests that the more closely you follow a portfolio-style eating pattern, the greater your protection against heart disease and stroke.
        Published Nov. 28, 2023, in Circulation, the study included more than 210,000 people who enrolled in three Harvard-led health studies in the 1980s and 1990s. Using data from diet questionnaires the participants filled out every four years, researchers scored each person's diet based on how well it complied with the portfolio eating pattern. After 30 years of follow-up, researchers compared the scores with the participants' health outcomes. People with higher scores (that is, those who followed the diet most closely) had a 14% lower risk of heart disease compared to those with lower scores.
        ""A lot of different foods can lower LDL cholesterol, but only by a little bit — about 5% to 10%. The idea behind the portfolio diet was to combine many of these foods together to get a larger reduction,"" says registered dietitian Andrea Glenn, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a co-author of the study.
        Earlier studies found that the portfolio diet may lower LDL cholesterol by as much as 30%. In the new study, people with higher portfolio diet scores not only had better cholesterol profiles, they also had lower blood levels of C-reactive protein and other inflammatory substances compared to people with lower scores, says Glenn. Inflammation is a key player in the buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries — the root cause of most heart attacks.
        What's in the portfolio diet?
        The diet discourages foods from animal sources, particularly red and processed meat, high-fat dairy, and eggs, which means it's naturally low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol, both of which raise LDL cholesterol in the body. The featured foods fall into five main categories. Here's a rundown, including ways to incorporate them into your meals.
        Plant protein. This includes beans, lentils, and peas (collectively known as legumes), with a specific focus on foods made from soybeans, says Glenn. In 1999, the FDA authorized a health claim for soy protein, noting that consuming at least 25 grams daily as part of a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fat may lower the risk of heart disease. Soy protein comes in many different forms: edamame (whole, green soybeans often sold frozen in pods), soy milk, soy yogurt, tofu, or tempeh (fermented soybeans). But there are many other legumes to choose from, including black beans, pinto beans, chickpeas (garbanzo beans), lentils, and split dried green peas.
        
          
            
              
                Try this plant protein
                Swap out some of the meat in homemade soups, stews, or casseroles with beans or tofu.
                Replace some dairy products (like milk and yogurt) with soy-based versions.
                Snack on edamame or hummus.
              
            
          
        
        Nuts and seeds. All nuts — including almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios, walnuts — are included. So are all sorts of seeds: chia, flax, hemp, pumpkin, sunflower, sesame.
        
          
            
              
                Try these nuts and seeds
                Add nuts or seeds to hot cereal, muffins or other baked goods, yogurt, and salads.
                Spread peanut butter or other nut butters on whole-grain crackers or sliced apples.
                Snack on mixed nuts.
              
            
          
        
        Viscous fiber. Viscous fiber is a type of soluble fiber that has a somewhat sticky quality, says Glenn. ""It's found in grains like oats and barley, certain vegetables such as eggplant and okra, and fruits like apples, oranges, berries, and persimmons,"" she says. One of the best sources is psyllium seed husks, which transform into a viscous gel when dissolved in water. People may be familiar with psyllium because the powdered husks are the key ingredient in Metamucil, which helps treat constipation, says Glenn. But you can buy plain psyllium seed husk in stores.
        In the intestines, viscous fiber binds to bile acids, which carry fats from your small intestine into the large intestine for excretion. This triggers your liver to create more bile acids—a process that requires cholesterol. If the liver doesn't have enough cholesterol, it draws more from the bloodstream, in turn lowering your circulating LDL. In addition, viscous fiber is fermented in the gut into short-chain fatty acids, which may also inhibit cholesterol production.
        
          
            
              
                Try this viscous fiber
                Build what Glenn calls a ""super portfolio breakfast"": oatmeal topped with soy milk, fruit, nuts, and seeds. Try combos such as raspberries, chopped walnuts, and chia seeds or diced apples, almonds, and sesame seeds.
                Swap regular bread for oat bran bread.
                Try different ways to prepare eggplant, such as a Chinese-style stir-fry or ratatouille, a French vegetable stew.
              
            
          
        
        Plant sterols. Also known as phytosterols, these exist naturally in nuts, soybeans, peas, and canola oil. Plant sterols have a structure similar to cholesterol; eating them helps limit the amount of cholesterol your body can absorb. Margarine enriched with plant sterols, such as Benecol, provides a concentrated dose. But you have to eat quite a bit (about four tablespoons daily) to make a difference, says Glenn. It tastes similar to other types of margarine and can be used as a spread for toast and in sandwiches.
        Monounsaturated fats. Used in place of saturated fats, these fats help lower cholesterol. Extra-virgin olive oil is the top recommendation; other good options include canola, soybean, or ""high-oleic"" sunflower or safflower oils. Stock a variety of these oils for use on salads and in cooking and baking. Avocados are also rich in monounsaturated fat.
        You don't need to embrace every aspect of the diet to reap benefits, says Glenn. ""But we saw a dose-related response in the study, which means that the more of these foods were added to the diet, the lower the risk of cardiovascular disease we observed,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-is-the-ringing-in-my-ears-getting-worse,Why is the ringing in my ears getting worse?,"Q. 
          I'm in my 50s, and the occasional ringing in my ears I've had over the years has turned into a constant nuisance. Does tinnitus get worse with age?
        
        A. It can, unfortunately. Indeed, the creeping hearing loss many of us experience with age is the most common cause of tinnitus, which can also generate a roaring, hissing, or buzzing sound in the ears. But an array of other factors can trigger or worsen the condition as well. These include exposure to loud noises; medications, especially certain antibiotics; ear infections; injuries such as whiplash or concussion; and high blood pressure.
        Menopause-related estrogen decline is increasingly being linked to tinnitus as well. This may happen because estrogen helps maintain auditory pathways in the brain. It's also believed that sleep disturbances and mood changes common during menopause can worsen tinnitus. Most tinnitus doesn't need medical treatment, but see your doctor if it's in only one ear or doesn't get better. She can suggest strategies to ease your tinnitus as well as make sure a more serious problem isn't responsible for your symptoms.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/antidepressant-may-help-manage-irritable-bowel-syndrome-symptoms,Antidepressant may help manage irritable bowel syndrome symptoms,"Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant also used to treat nerve pain, may be one of the best pharmacologic choices to help improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
        IBS causes abdominal pain and changes to bowel movements, with symptoms fluctuating in severity over time. IBS has no cure, and standard treatments like dietary and lifestyle changes and taking antispasmodic or antidiarrheal medications yield varying benefits.
        In a study published Nov. 11, 2023, in The Lancet, 463 people with IBS took either amitriptyline (10 to 30 milligrams based on the severity of each person's symptoms) or a placebo every day for six months. Afterward, people who took amitriptyline were almost twice as likely as those taking a placebo to report an overall improvement in their symptoms and had significantly lower IBS severity. It's believed amitriptyline helps by increasing people's threshold for IBS pain and discomfort.
        The researchers suggested that doctors should consider low-dose amitriptyline for managing IBS when dietary and other lifestyle changes are not sufficient.

        Researchers recruited 2,607 people (average age 64, 44% men) without arthritis and asked them if they did strength training and when they first began. Then for eight years, participants submitted periodic questionnaires about how often they engaged in strength training. Every four years, they underwent knee pain assessments and knee x-rays to look for osteoarthritis. Over all, rates of knee osteoarthritis and pain were 20% lower among those who did strength training versus those who never tried it.
        The researchers also found that engaging in strength training later in life, even if you begin after age 50, can help provide joint damage protection similar to those who began earlier.
        While the findings of this observational study don't prove that strength training itself reduces your risk of developing knee osteoarthritis and having less knee pain, the results suggest another potential health benefit beyond the known improvements in muscle mass and strength as people age.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-big-problem-of-ministrokes,The big problem of ministrokes,"Many people who suffer a first-time stroke had a prior warning from a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a ministroke.
        ""TIAs usually produce typical stroke symptoms, but because they are mild and brief they tend to be missed or ignored,"" says Dr. Erica Camargo Faye, a stroke neurologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""But a TIA is your body warning that you're at high risk for a full stroke, and you need to listen.""
        Why TIAs happen
        A TIA occurs when too little oxygen-rich blood reaches part of the brain. Often, the underlying cause is fatty plaque buildup inside an artery in the neck, such as the carotid artery, or an artery in the brain. The plaque narrows the artery and invites blood clots to form on top of the plaque, impeding healthy blood flow.
        Another cause is when a blood clot in the heart or carotid artery breaks away and travels to the brain, temporarily blocking a blood vessel there. Similarly, a sudden drop in blood pressure can decrease blood flow through a narrowed artery and trigger a TIA.
        TIAs can last anywhere from 30 seconds to 20 minutes, although most usually last at least five minutes.
        ""Because TIAs don't last long and don't always have an immediate, lasting effect, it's easy for people to shrug them off,"" says Dr. Camargo Faye.
        A TIA does not guarantee you will have a future stroke, but it does suggest you are at high risk. Nearly one in five people who have a suspected TIA will experience a full-blown stroke within three months, according to a scientific statement from the American Heart Association in the March 2023 issue of the journal Stroke. The risk of a stroke is highest during the 48 hours following the initial TIA.
        Early recognition of the likely cause of a TIA is the best way to prevent a stroke. Because most TIAs are related to a temporary clot forming in a narrowed brain artery, the usual treatment begins with two antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix), or an anticoagulant medication to prevent additional blood clots from forming.
        Less often, a major blockage in one of the two carotid arteries is the culprit and needs to be opened by surgery or a procedure called endarterectomy.
        
          
            
              
                Can you prevent a TIA?
                TIAs and regular strokes share many risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure, alcohol misuse, diabetes, high cholesterol levels, and excess body weight. ""Many of these are more common in men than women, especially smoking and excessive drinking,"" says stroke neurologist Dr. Erica Camargo Faye with Massachusetts General Hospital. Another condition linked to TIA is atrial fibrillation, a quivering or irregular heartbeat. Some research suggests that excessive amounts of testosterone therapy could increase a man's risk of TIA and stroke. ""But making smarter health choices, such as moderation in drinking, a diet high in fruits and vegetables, and daily exercise, is one of the best ways to prevent TIAs,"" says Dr. Camargo Faye.
              
            
          
        
        Know the warning signs
        TIAs can recur with the same symptoms or different ones. The acronym BE-FAST can help people recognize signs and symptoms. Most people experience one or more of these during a TIA:
        B: Balance. Balance problems caused by a TIA often make it difficult to stand up, or you may fall to one side.
        E: Eyes. The most common vision problem is being unable to see from one or both eyes. Often, people see a dark gray shade that blocks half or all of their vision. Blurred or double vision can also occur.
        F: Face. The face may droop on one or both sides. Usually, the corner of the mouth appears pulled down, and the person can't smile normally.
        A: Arm weakness. This is the most common symptom and usually occurs on only one side and may also include numbness or tingling.
        S: Speech difficulty. Slurred or garbled speech is the most common type of speech problem, but some people struggle to find words or understand what others say. This deficit also extends to writing and texting.
        T: Time. This is not a symptom, but a command: it's time to call 911 or go straight to an emergency room, even if the symptoms lasted only one or two minutes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-it-possible-to-prevent-arthritis,Is it possible to prevent arthritis?,"Q. 
          So many of my relatives and friends have arthritis. I have been fortunate so far. Is there any proven way to prevent it?
        
        A. You may be able to lower your risk for three of the most common types of arthritis: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout. Here's a brief description of each and how to possibly prevent them.
        Osteoarthritis, the most common type, occurs when the cartilage of a joint erodes (breaks down). Bones begin to rub against each other, causing pain and difficulty moving the joint. It's also the most common reason for knee and hip replacements. Take these steps to lower your risk:
        
          Maintain a healthy weight. Osteoarthritis becomes more common with age and tends to run in families. But millions of cases might be prevented by avoiding excessive weight gain.
          Avoid trauma. Injury also increases the risk of osteoarthritis. Some ways to avoid injury include exercising regularly, doing resistance training, and not taking unnecessary risks at work or at play.
          Prevent and treat conditions that might contribute to joint damage like gout (see below) or an infection.
        
        Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes pain, stiffness, warmth, redness, and swelling in joints. Over time, the affected joints may become misshapen, misaligned, and damaged. Rheumatoid arthritis usually occurs in a symmetrical pattern, meaning that if one knee or hand has it, the other usually does, too. Ways to reduce your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include avoiding tobacco and improving your oral health. Gum inflammation (gingivitis) caused by certain bacteria has been linked to many health conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis. Good oral hygiene and regular dental care may lower the risk.
        Gout occurs when crystals of uric acid get deposited in one or more joints and trigger inflammation that causes pain, swelling, and redness. You can reduce your risk by doing the following:
        
          Eat a healthy diet. Avoid any foods that seem to trigger gout attacks, such as liver and sweetbreads. A heart-healthy diet such as the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of gout in some people.
          Limit alcohol. Stick to no more than one drink per day, and avoid binge drinking.
          Stay well hydrated.
          Lose weight if you are overweight or obese.
          Avoid diuretics (water pills) if possible (but discuss all medication changes with your doctor).
        
        If you notice joint pain, joint swelling, or difficulty doing activities, see your doctor. Early diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in your future joint health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/ovary-removal-before-menopause-may-pose-health-risks,Ovary removal before menopause may pose health risks,"Women who have both ovaries removed before menopause face far higher odds of several chronic health conditions decades later, according to a study published online Sept. 12, 2023, by Menopause.
        The study involved 274 women (average age 67) whose ovaries had been removed before menopause for a noncancerous condition — either with or without a hysterectomy. An average of 22 years after their surgery, the women underwent comprehensive physical exams to assess the presence of any chronic conditions and measure their strength and mobility. Compared with women of the same age who still had their ovaries, women who were under age 46 when their ovaries were removed were 64% more likely to have arthritis, twice as likely to have obstructive sleep apnea, and nearly three times as likely to have had a bone fracture. They also performed worse on a six-minute walk test. Women who'd undergone ovary removal between ages 46 and 49 also had higher odds of arthritis and sleep apnea than same-age women who didn't have the surgery. However, researchers didn't find a link between ovary removal before menopause and an array of other conditions, including cancer, diabetes, dementia, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, irregular heart rhythm, osteoporosis, or kidney, liver, or thyroid disease.
        Women who have their ovaries removed before menopause should consider going on estrogen therapy until about age 50, the study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/red-meat-may-raise-diabetes-risk,Red meat may raise diabetes risk,"Eating more red meat is linked to higher risk of developing diabetes, a new analysis suggests.
        The Harvard-led study, published online Oct. 19, 2023, by The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, tracked the eating habits of nearly 217,000 people (81% women) for up to 36 years. Participants were split into five groups according to the amount of red meat they ate. Those who regularly ate the highest amounts — averaging about a serving each day — were 53% more likely to develop diabetes than those who ate the least red meat. But participants who substituted one serving per day of nuts or legumes for red meat were 30% less likely to develop diabetes.
        The study was observational, meaning it didn't prove that eating more red meat causes diabetes — only that an association exists. But study authors said the findings reinforce recommendations to limit red meat consumption and eat plant-based proteins instead to help prevent diabetes and heart disease.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/bad-bedfellows,Bad bedfellows,"You woke up with a pep in your step, feeling energetic and well rested. But wait: your sleep tracker says otherwise. Does the data change your plans for the day and how you'll approach bedtime that night? Are you now anxious when you'd been feeling calm?
        The rise of sleep tracking devices — which monitor physiological factors related to sleep — has made this conundrum increasingly relevant. A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine shows that more than one-third of Americans have used electronic sleep tracking devices.
        Seven hours of sleep each night are generally adequate for an average adult, Harvard experts say. But many folks are fixated on getting a ""perfect"" eight hours after learning that sleep deprivation can raise the risks of an array of potentially serious health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The quest for better sleep may backfire, however, leading to anxiety and stress that can thwart restful slumber.
        ""We do need to lower the emotional temperature a bit and be rational about this,"" says Dr. John Winkelman, chief of the Sleep Disorders Clinical Research Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        ""Many people still don't respect the importance of sleep, but using sleep trackers feeds into some people's anxieties,"" he says. ""Anxiety and psychological arousal are the opposite of what we need when we sleep.""
        Influential data
        Many types of devices are marketed to track sleep, ranging from watches and rings to smartphone apps and mattress monitors. Some measure whether you're asleep or not by recording aspects such as movement, heart rate, body temperature, and breathing patterns—all of which change at different sleep stages.
        The data these devices generate can also hold a lot of sway over how people feel each day. A small 2018 study in the Journal of Sleep Research demonstrated this phenomenon. It involved 63 adults with insomnia who were given wrist-worn sleep trackers. In the morning, half of them received information telling them they'd slept poorly, while the others were told they'd slept well — regardless of their actual sleep quality. All reported on their mood and alertness several times over the course of the day.
        The 32 participants who were told their sleep was poor reported lower alertness during the day and greater sleepiness in the evening compared to those given positive feedback. And people told they had restful sleep reported a significantly higher level of positive mood and alertness.
        ""In fact, there was no meaningful difference in sleep quality between the two groups,"" Dr. Winkelman says. ""I'm a little bit addicted to my Fitbit, but I don't use it to inform how I feel during the day. I just like knowing the data and thinking about the relationship of the data to how I think I slept. But understand: those two things are far from synonymous.""
        Pluses and pitfalls
        Using sleep trackers can present distinct pros and cons, Harvard experts say. Among the pros:
        
          They can make you more aware of your sleep patterns.
          They can offer affirmation if you're trying to form better sleep habits. ""Trackers allow people to see if their bedtimes and wake times aren't stable, which they should be,"" Dr. Winkelman says. ""Our sleep is really best when we're on a regular schedule.""
          They can identify a potential sleep disorder by spotlighting signs such as awakening many times during the night. ""Some trackers offer information about your oxygen variability,"" Dr. Winkelman says. ""They can be very helpful in identifying sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea.""
        
        But the devices can also lead to an unhealthy preoccupation with sleep, which can fuel insomnia, Dr. Winkelman says. Here are some other downsides:
        
          Interpreting and using the data can be confusing. For example, your tracker may tell you that you're apparently not sleeping very deeply, but you might not know how to change that.
          Focusing on sleep data may lead some people to ignore how they actually feel after sleeping. ""Can you wake up without an alarm clock? Make it through the day without feeling exhausted or drinking five cups of coffee?"" asks Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""To me, those are probably much more useful metrics.""
        
        A lack of accuracy
        Sleep trackers are only as useful as the data they produce — which aren't always accurate. A small 2019 study in the journal Sensors compared several types of sleep trackers to the gold standard of sleep measurement, a sleep study called polysomnography. After comparing 27 nights of sleep study recordings in 19 participants ages 19 to 64 (66% women) with sleep tracker data from the same nights, researchers found the trackers lacking.
        Specifically, the devices had difficulty detecting participants' wake periods, which hindered their ability to estimate total sleep time and sleep quality. However, the sleep trackers accurately detected the most basic sleep parameter — the actual amount of time participants spent in bed.
        ""They're not accurately reflecting how much sleep people are getting, or the depth of sleep or type,"" Dr. Klerman says. ""I think they're more accurate now than they used to be. On the other hand, they haven't been tested on every type of person who wears them.""
        
          
            
              
                What color is your sleep noise?
                It may seem paradoxical that a noisy environment could promote sleep. But some people prefer not to slumber in total silence — instead, they add background sound to the bedroom to sleep more soundly.
                Recent years have seen a proliferation of sleep machines and apps that emit various audio frequencies that sound similar to static from an untuned radio or TV. Some people profess that listening to these monotonous sounds before or during sleep can help them drop off more easily and stay asleep longer, calming them and drowning out background noise like traffic or creaky pipes.
                These sounds have colors assigned to them based on each noise's strength and frequency:
                White noise is perhaps the best‑known of all noise colors and contains all audio frequencies. It can be intense and high-pitched, resembling a fan, air conditioner, or vacuum.
                Pink noise is lower-pitched than white noise. It sounds like steady rain, wind blowing through trees, or waves on a beach.
                Brown noise sounds more bass, like a rushing river, pounding surf, or strong winds.
              
            
          
        
        Sleep-boosting measures
        If you've found that anxiety surrounding sleep is keeping you from restful slumber, Harvard experts suggest seeking a special type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called CBTi, that's designed to improve insomnia.
        ""The cognitive part works on anxious thoughts, while the behavioral part actually decreases the amount of time you spend in bed so you're really sleepy when you get there,"" Dr. Winkelman says.
        Here are some other tactics to improve your sleep:
        Set consistent bed and wake times. You can use a tracker to help you do this or merely rely on the clock. But either way, the practice should prod you to wind down calmly before bed.
        Don't check sleep data first thing in the morning. Start your day, decide how you feel, and then look at your sleep tracker.
        Monitor substance use surrounding sleep. Pay attention to when you last used caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco, which can all affect sleep quality.
        Consider your medication use. Ask your doctor if any prescriptions or supplements you take might make it harder to fall or stay asleep. Tweak the use of those medications if possible.
        Stay alert for breathing issues. If your bed partner says you snore or gasp frequently while sleeping, tell your doctor. Ditto if you can't sleep lying down and need to sit up, which usually indicates breathing problems. ""A tracker may not catch that,"" Dr. Klerman says. ""That's really good evidence you should see a health professional.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/do-i-have-a-pinched-nerve,Do I have a pinched nerve?,"Q. 
          I've been having pain in my buttocks that feels a bit like a pulled muscle, but I don't remember hurting myself. Could it be a pinched nerve?
        
        A. Yes, it might be. There's some overlap in symptoms between pulled muscles and pinched nerves, which originate at nerve roots branching from the spinal cord. Both problems hurt, but muscle pain is typically dull and doesn't radiate outward (in this case, beyond the buttocks). With a pinched nerve, however, you'll notice sharp, burning pain that travels from one part of the body to another. Does it extend from the buttocks down your leg? Include numbness or a pins-and-needles sensation? These signs indicate a pinched nerve, which can arise from a range of causes that include pregnancy, injuries, and arthritis.
        Pinched nerve pain can happen suddenly or gradually and often goes away on its own. Try resting the affected area, applying ice or heat, or taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve). If the pain doesn't improve after a couple of weeks, see your doctor. She may suggest physical therapy or other treatments.

        The study included 419 people with paroxysmal afib, which is characterized by intermittent episodes of a rapid, irregular heart rate. For 10 weeks, they used a smartphone app to rate their nightly sleep as amazing, good, average, bad, or horrible, and then used mobile electrocardiograms to measure afib episodes the following day.
        Researchers found that worse sleep quality on any given night was linked to a 15% greater risk of an afib episode the next day. Continued poor sleep was associated with longer episodes of afib, with each progressively worse category of sleep linked with an average of 16 additional minutes of afib per day. Strategies to improve sleep might help prevent and treat afib, say the authors, whose findings were published online Oct. 12, 2023, by JACC Clinical Electrophysiology.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/exercising-with-knee-or-hip-pain,Exercising with knee or hip pain,"If you deal with knee and hip pain, it may be time to up your exercise game. More than just a good health habit, exercise is also an effective treatment for many knee and hip problems. And exercises that can strengthen muscles supporting knees and hips can be especially helpful.
        Strong muscles around a damaged knee or hip can help support a joint by taking over some of its responsibilities. For example, your hips will have an easier time supporting your body weight if your quadriceps, gluteals, hamstrings, and abdominal muscles are strong. And strong quadriceps and hamstrings can take over some of the shock-absorbing role played by the meniscus and cartilage in the knee.
        Balance is important to keep in mind. The proper balance of strength in the muscles can hold the joint in the most functional and least painful position. Muscles work in pairs: one contracts while the opposing one relaxes. For example, when you straighten your knee, your quadriceps on the front of your thigh contracts, and the hamstrings on the back relax. Imbalances in the function of paired muscles can cause joint problems and invite injury.
        If your hamstrings are tight, your quadriceps can't contract fully and may weaken, so exercise the quadriceps and hamstrings (the opposing muscles) equally. Flexibility exercises (to stretch and relax specific muscles) are an important part of an exercise plan to improve joint function.
        How to go easier on the joints
        If you have knee or hip problems, choose your exercise carefully. Running or fast walking on hard sidewalks or pavement is tough on joints. If you love these activities, try doing them on a track or treadmill and wear well-cushioned shoes to lessen the impact. Better still, consider swimming or cycling, which are easier on your joints.
        Exercise in the water has special benefits:
        
          The water supports your weight, reducing stress on your joints.
          You can try out exercises in a supported environment before doing them on solid ground.
          An 85° F pool is comfortable for exercise and soothes joints.
          You can increase range of motion and endurance without strenuous effort or joint pain.
        
        Be sure to do leg resistance exercises two to three times per week to strengthen supportive muscles around the knees. Strengthening muscles through these activities will dampen stresses that travel through the knee.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/mindfulness-can-help-you-tame-fears-and-worries,Mindfulness can help you tame fears and worries,"When your day is derailed by fear and worry, you want to try to center your mind and become more anchored in the present moment. Mindfulness techniques can help you do just that. Here are a few techniques to try:
        Deep breathing
        Breathing is something so natural that we barely think about it. In fact, you breathe about 20,000 times a day without conscious thought. But when you're anxious, your breathing quickens. Purposefully slowing your breaths helps you gain more control over your mental state. The breath, which yogis call ""prana,"" has powerfully calming effects on your brain and the rest of your nervous system. There are several breathing techniques you might try.
        Diaphragmatic, or belly breathing
        
          Start by sitting comfortably or lying on your back.
          Place one hand on the upper part of your chest and the other hand on your belly.
          Relax your belly muscles.
          Breathe in slowly through your nose until you feel your belly start to rise.
          Breathe out slowly through slightly pursed lips and feel your belly fall.
          Repeat.
        
        Box breathing
        
          Breathe out while counting to four.
          Hold your breath while counting to four.
          Breathe in while counting to four.
          Hold your breath while counting to four.
          Repeat.
        
        Start with just a minute or two of deep breathing and expand the time from there. Try for at least 10 minutes of deep breathing each day. During each session, focus on becoming aware of the feeling of your breath moving in and out. Observe what happens in your body when you concentrate on your breathing.
        Meditation
        Meditation takes deep breathing one step further, by combining it with mental focus. Research finds mindfulness meditation helpful for not only relieving anxiety symptoms, but also for improving our ability to cope with the stressors that life throws our way.
        Set aside a few minutes each day to meditate. Sit somewhere quiet and close your eyes. Breathe deeply in and out while calming your mind. You might repeat a sound, word, or phrase, like ""life is good"" or ""om."" If your mind wanders, as it inevitably will, gently steer it back to the present. Think of your intrusive thoughts as clouds. Acknowledge them, but then let them drift away.
        Mindfulness seems easy, but that sense of simplicity can be deceptive. It takes effort to still a racing mind. And it might take you some time and multiple tries to accomplish it.
        To get started, set a time to practice mindfulness each day. Put it in your calendar. Aim for only two to five minutes your first day. As you get more comfortable with the practice, build up to longer sessions. A good goal is to work up to practicing for 10 to 20 minutes each day.

However, if your neck pain is so severe you can't sit still, or if it is accompanied by any of the following symptoms, contact a medical professional right away:
        Fever, headache, and neck stiffness. This triad of symptoms might indicate bacterial meningitis, an infection of the spinal cord and brain covering that requires prompt treatment with antibiotics.
        Pain traveling down one arm, especially if the arm or hand is weak, numb, or tingling. This might indicate that a herniated cervical disc is pressing on a nerve.
        Loss of bowel or bladder control. This might indicate pressure on the spinal cord, needing immediate attention.
        Extreme instability. If you can suddenly tilt your head forward or back much farther than usual, it might indicate a fracture or torn ligaments. This usually occurs only after significant impact or injury, and is more likely to be detected by your doctor or on an x-ray than by your own perception.
        Persistent swollen glands in the neck. Infection or a tumor can cause swollen glands and neck pain.
        Chest pain or pressure. A heart attack or inflamed heart muscle can cause neck pain along with more classic heart symptoms.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/tips-for-taming-caregiver-stress,Tips for taming caregiver stress,"Caring for others fulfills a basic social contract in ways that can draw generations and individuals closer. Certainly, caring for an elderly parent or ailing spouse or partner is a worthy, often satisfying pursuit. But it isn't easy. If you're among the many millions of Americans acting as caregivers for friends, family, or neighbors, you may often wrestle with stress as well as exhaustion, anger, guilt, grief, and other emotions.
        Two-thirds of these caregivers are women. The task is especially hard on women in the so-called sandwich generation, who are simultaneously caring for children and older parents, quite possibly while working outside the home, too.
        While you attend to the needs of others, your own sense of well-being may head south. Studies of men and women responsible for the long-term care of relatives show higher rates of illness, suppressed immune response, slower healing, and even earlier death among caregivers. Additionally, research reveals that ongoing stress endured by older adults caring for spouses with Alzheimer's disease has a negative impact on the caregiver's own mental functioning.
        In order to give care to others, you need stress relief, support, and time for yourself and your family. Theses ""Tips for taming caregiver stress"" may help.
        • Relaxation response techniques and nurturing techniques are vital. Practicing them often will enable you to feel calmer, happier, and better able to help others. If it's too hard to find the time, consider getting extra help with some household tasks. The Eldercare Locator at www.eldercare.gov can help you find varied services for older adults and their families; it's run by the Administration on Aging. The Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving, at www.rosalynncarter.org, also provides recommendations for evidence-based caregiver support programs.
        • Protect your own health. Research suggests that a caregiver's immune function is often suppressed by the stress of caring for others. Boost your resistance by eating well, getting enough rest and exercise, and pursuing activities that bring you pleasure. Take advantage of regular respite care from professionals, family, and friends to give you much needed breaks.
        • Join a support group to talk out frustrations with other people in your situation and to get helpful ideas. Some caregiver support groups are available online (such as a nationwide chat group run by AARP; for a quick link to it, go to /cgteam). Others are run by local hospitals, senior centers, and community groups.
        • A blend of assertiveness and cognitive restructuring skills can help you share the work, instead of taking on everything yourself. Spell out to other family members what needs to be done and what sort of help would be best. If no one offers help, ask for it. Linking those who can lend a hand has gotten much easier with new websites and apps that help friends, family, and communities coordinate care. Another example of a helpful site is CaringBridge (www.caringbridge.org).
        • When someone offers help, accept. Keep handy a list of small tasks people can do, such as calling regularly, cooking an occasional dinner, shopping, and running errands. You can dole out tasks or ask people to check off what they can do.
        • Accept that circumstances change quickly. Periodically reassess what you can offer and what assistance you need. If it's getting too hard to fulfill certain needs, ask family members for help or consider other options, such as hiring paid caregivers to take on these tasks. Consult a geriatric care manager (www.aginglifecare.org) or social worker for help; your local council on aging or visiting nurse association should be able to help you find one. If necessary, consider another living arrangement that would help you meet your needs and those of your loved one.
        • Accentuate your spiritual connectedness to something greater than yourself, be it to God, community, or the natural world.
        • Remember that you're doing this not solely out of obligation. Focusing on the love you hold for your loved one can help dial back stress when things become frustrating and overwhelming.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/when-to-worry-about-worrying,When to worry about worrying,"We all worry. Today, there seems to be no shortage of things to worry about. It's normal to feel anxious on occasion. In fact, temporary anxiety can be a healthy response to uncertainty and danger. But constant worry may be a sign of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
        
          Do I have generalized anxiety disorder?
        
        According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 5.7% of adults in the U.S. experience GAD .  While other types of anxiety disorders arise from particular situations, generalized anxiety disorder is persistent and characterized by debilitating worry and agitation about everyday matters.
        People with generalized anxiety disorder can't shake the feeling that something bad will happen and they will not be prepared. They may worry to excess about missing an appointment, losing a job, or having an accident. Some people even worry about worrying too much.
        
          Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
        
        
          Persistent, excessive worry about several different things for at least six months
          Fatigue, difficulty sleeping, or restlessness
          Trouble concentrating
          Irritability
          Muscle tension
          Feeling tense or ""on edge""
        
        Only your doctor can determine whether you meet the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. If you think you might have this condition, don't hesitate to talk to your primary care doctor. There are many different treatments that can ease the very real discomfort of this condition.
        Physical symptoms are common too and can include a racing heart, dry mouth, upset stomach, muscle tension, sweating, trembling, and irritability. These bodily expressions of anxiety can have a negative effect on physical health. For example, people with generalized anxiety disorder are at greater risk for heart attack and other cardiovascular problems.
        
          Treating anxiety
        
        If you have generalized anxiety disorder, your doctor may discuss the following treatment options.
        
          Therapy. For some people, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help. CBT helps people recognize when they are misinterpreting events, exaggerating difficulties, or making unnecessarily pessimistic assumptions, and offers new ways to respond to anxiety-provoking situations.
          Medications. Commonly prescribed drugs include antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (like Prozac or Zoloft), or dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (like Effexor or Cymbalta). These drugs take longer to work than the traditional anti-anxiety drugs, but also may provide greater symptom relief over time.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/hip-replacement-is-the-timing-right,Hip Replacement: Is the timing right?,"The pain and physical limitations of advanced hip arthritis can wear you down physically and emotionally. The decision to have a hip replacement is based on the amount of damage to the joint, your symptoms, and your overall level of disability. Here are some signs that it may be time to consider hip replacement:
        
          Joint health
        
        
          x-rays show advanced arthritis or other damage
          the joint is visibly deformed, bowing inward or outward
        
        
          Symptoms
        
        
          significant pain daily
          pain keeps you awake at night despite the use of medications
          pain and swelling don't decrease with rest and medication
          pain medications are causing severe side effects
        
        
          Loss of function
        
        
          pain and stiffness limit your ability to do normal, everyday activities
          difficulty bending or rotating your hips.
        
        
          Are you healthy enough for surgery?
        
        Before making your decision, you'll need to undergo a comprehensive medical evaluation by your primary care doctor or orthopedic specialist. Hip replacement might be too risky if you have any of the following conditions:
        
          an active infection in the hip or elsewhere in the body
           a significant medical condition, including recent heart attack, ongoing chest pain from heart disease, or heart failure
          poor circulation that could interfere with healing
          severely damaged or nonworking hip muscles or ligaments
          damaged nerves in the hip
          neuromuscular disease such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or stroke
          an allergy to materials used to make artificial joints.
        
        
          Best age for a hip replacement
        
        If you are considering a hip replacement, age is an important factor to consider. That's because artificial hip implants have limited life spans. You can only put a certain number of miles on your new hip before it wears out. And if you are overweight or very physically active, your new joint may wear out faster.
        This is why most people are encouraged to delay total hip replacement until at least their 60s, if possible. Given the average life span for Americans, many of the older adults who get a new hip in their 60s or 70s may never need to have it replaced.
        If you are in your 40s or 50s, a new hip is likely to wear out during your lifetime. Then you'll need to have revision surgery to take out the old one and replace it.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/could-men-with-advanced-prostate-cancer-avoid-chemotherapy-202401083005,Could men with advanced prostate cancer avoid chemotherapy?,"When we think about radiation therapy, we typically picture treatments directed at tumors by a machine located outside the body. Now imagine a different scenario — one in which radioactive particles injected into the bloodstream find and destroy individual cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells unscathed.
        The drug
        One such ""radioligand"" is already available for certain patients with prostate cancer. Called Lu-PSMA-617 (trade name Pluvicto), it carries a lethal payload of radioactive atoms. The drug binds with a cell protein known as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is abundant on most prostate cancer cells but absent on most normal cells. After sticking to that protein, Lu-PSMA-617 delivers its radioactive cargo, and then the targeted cell dies.
        As it currently stands, Lu-PSMA-617 is approved only for very a specific circumstance: eligible patients must have been treated already with chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). During this advanced stage of the disease, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels rise despite treatments that block testosterone, a hormone that fuels prostate cancer growth (rising PSA indicates the cancer is progressing).
        Doctors will often respond by switching to second-line hormonal treatments that block testosterone in other ways. If those drugs don't work or become ineffective, then chemotherapy is typically the next option.
        But could men with mCRPC bypass chemotherapy — along with its challenging side effects — and start on Lu-PSMA-617 right away? Investigators evaluated that potential strategy during a newly-completed clinical trial.
        The study
        The PSMAfore phase 3 trial enrolled 468 men with mCRPC. All the men had PSMA-positive tumors, and each of them had been treated already with a second-line testosterone blocker. For most men, that drug was abiraterone; the rest had been treated with a drug called enzalutamide. None of the men had yet been given chemotherapy.
        The investigators randomized all the enrolled men into two groups. Men in the treatment group were given infusions of Lu-PSMA-617, while men in the control group were switched to a second testosterone-blocker that they hadn't yet received.
        The findings
        After nearly a year and a half of follow-up, Lu-PSMA-617 treatment generated promising results. Crucially, the treated men avoided further cancer progression for a year on average, which was six months longer than progression was avoided in the control group.
        Lu-PSMA-617 also produced significant drops in PSA: in 58% of the Lu-PSMA-617-treated men, PSA levels declined by half or more. Just 20% of men in the control group experienced comparable PSA declines. Lu-PSMA-617 was also well tolerated. The most common side effects were dry mouth and minor gastrointestinal symptoms, and treated men also reported less pain and better quality of life.
        Commentary
        Researchers still need to show that using Lu-PSMA-617 before chemotherapy actually lengthens survival before the FDA will approve this new indication. The enrolled subjects are still being followed, and ""hopefully with further follow up, this sequence of treatments may become more widely available,"" says Dr. Marc B. Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Added Dr. Garnick, ""This study marks another advance in our emerging treatment options for men with advanced prostate cancer, and underscores the methodical progression of pharmaceutical development. When new therapies are introduced, they are studied in patients in whom the treatment options are limited. Fortunately, Lu-PSMA-617 showed excellent results in this population, and the study outlined here suggests that it may be able to move this therapy to even earlier forms of advanced prostate cancer. We anxiously await longer-term follow-up of this important research.""",Charlie Schmidt,"January 8, 2024"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/uncontrolled-high-blood-pressure-or-diabetes-tied-to-severe-covid-19-outcomes,Uncontrolled high blood pressure or diabetes tied to severe COVID-19 outcomes,"Here's another incentive for people with high blood pressure or diabetes to lower their numbers: a study of almost 1.5 million people in the United States suggests that having uncontrolled high blood pressure or diabetes prior to getting COVID-19 sharply increases the risk for COVID complications. Researchers evaluated participants' health both before and during the time they developed COVID (from March 2020 to February 2022). Compared with people whose blood pressure was the best controlled before getting infected, those with the worst-controlled blood pressure had about 30% greater odds of needing hospitalization or critical care and 32% greater odds of being on a ventilator. Among participants with diabetes, those whose blood sugar was most poorly controlled before getting COVID had about 61% greater odds of being hospitalized, 42% greater odds of needing critical care, 12% greater odds of being on a ventilator, and 18% greater odds of dying, compared with those whose blood sugar was the best controlled. The study, published online Oct. 18, 2023, by the Journal of the American Heart Association, was observational and doesn't prove that controlling diabetes and high blood pressure protects against COVID complications. But we know for sure that controlling these conditions also reduces the risks of heart or kidney disease and premature death—and that's reason enough.

And now a Harvard study published online Oct. 19, 2023, by The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests that eating red meat each week — even just a little — is tied to increased diabetes risks. Researchers analyzed information from more than 216,000 men and women (average age 46 when the study began) who answered questions about their health and diet every few years, for up to 36 years. Compared with people who reported eating the least red meat each week, people who reported eating the most had a 62% higher risk of developing diabetes. For each additional daily serving of processed red meat (such as bacon or a hot dog), participants had a 46% greater risk of diabetes. The risk was 24% higher for each additional daily serving of unprocessed red meat (like pork, beef, or lamb). The good news: swapping one daily serving of red meat for another protein (such as nuts or beans) was tied to a much lower risk of getting diabetes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/does-your-gut-affect-your-risk-for-alzheimers-disease,Does your gut affect your risk for Alzheimer's disease?,"Q. 
          I know that your genes and lifestyle can influence your risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. Now I read that microbes in our guts also may be involved. Really?
        
        A. Genes and lifestyle both influence our risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. And, as strange as it may seem, so may the microbes in our gut.
        We've known for nearly 200 years that microbes live on and in us. We thought they were just living off the warmth and nutrients that our bodies provided to them — invisible freeloaders that had no effect on our health. Beginning about 20 years ago, we began to learn that was wrong. Like humans, microbes have genes. All of the different genes of the microbes that live on us or in us, collectively, are called our ""microbiome."" To our surprise, we've learned that these microbe genes can make chemicals that can affect human health.
        We now know that our microbiome can affect our risk for obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other important diseases. A study reported in October 2023 in the prestigious scientific journal Brain finds that our microbiome may even influence our risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
        Previous studies had reported that in people with Alzheimer's disease, some particular species of gut bacteria are more prevalent, while other species are less so, compared to people without the disease. But that did not answer the cart-and-horse question: does the disease affect the difference in the gut bacteria, or does the difference in the gut bacteria affect the disease?
        The new study provides provocative evidence that the gut bacteria may actually influence the risk of getting the disease. The research team took a group of healthy young rats and eliminated all bacteria from their guts. Then the team collected bowel movement samples from people with Alzheimer's disease and from people with normal cognition and no signs of the disease. Such samples are full of gut bacteria. Then the samples from humans were squirted into the rats' guts.
        The microbiome from people with Alzheimer's disease — but not the microbiome from people without the disease — caused some Alzheimer's-like changes in the rats' brains. Those rats also developed memory impairments. Moreover, the rats that received the microbiomes from the most severely affected Alzheimer's patients developed the greatest brain abnormalities and memory problems.
        It will require much more research to confirm that our gut microbiome influences our risk of Alzheimer's disease—and, if so, how it does so. The answer to that last question could someday point to treatments that can treat or even prevent Alzheimer's disease.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tips-to-navigate-a-sleep-divorce,"Tips to navigate a ""sleep divorce""","When your bed partner regularly shatters your good night's rest — by snoring, kicking, tossing and turning, or stealing the covers, for example — you might wonder if you'd be better off sleeping apart. And you're not alone if you give it a try.
        A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that a third of respondents reported occasionally or regularly sleeping in separate rooms to accommodate a bed partner. Just keep in mind that the arrangement comes with a risk. ""Your relationship might suffer, especially if one person doesn't want to sleep apart or doesn't like the new sleeping environment,"" says Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        Here's what you can do if you're considering a ""sleep divorce.""
        
          
            
              
                Why consider a sleep divorce?
                Sleeping apart seems counterintuitive for couples. But a good night's sleep is very important for health.
                ""Sleep deprivation promotes depression, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating, which can keep you from engaging well with your partner. A lack of sleep also increases the risk for chronic health problems such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cognitive decline,"" notes Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
                The goal is to sleep seven to nine hours per night. Work with your partner to make sleep a priority for both of you. And make that sleep top quality.
              
            
          
        
        Have a heart-to-heart first
        Discuss your partner's disruptive sleep behaviors with compassion, and talk about the problems that result for both of you. ""The conversation can be embarrassing. It requires you to be vulnerable, and a lot of sensitive topics might come up beyond sleep behavior,"" Dr. Collier says. ""If it's hard to communicate about it, consider a couples counseling session with an objective third party to guide you.""
        Seek a compromise
        Before seeking a complete sleep divorce, consider compromises that are acceptable to both of you. ""For example, if your partner's snoring wakes you up, try wearing earplugs, use a bedside sound machine, or wear earbuds and listen to a podcast as you fall asleep,"" Dr. Collier suggests. If snoring is a problem, your partner could try sleeping on his or her side and seeing a doctor to find out what's causing the snoring. Dr. Collier recommends you go together to the doctor's appointment so you both learn about any possible underlying conditions and treatments, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for sleep apnea.
        ""Another solution could be sleeping separately in the same room. Perhaps you each get a bed. That's helpful when one person awakens frequently to urinate or has involuntary twitching movements in the legs during sleep. Another idea is napping in the same place during the day but sleeping apart at night.""
        Sleeping apart successfully
        If you decide to try sleeping apart, consider following these guidelines.
        Make both sleeping spaces cozy. ""Neither of you should have to sleep on the couch,"" Dr. Collier says. ""You both need a good mattress and a comfortable sleeping environment that's cool, dark, and inviting. Make sure both parties are happy.""
        Schedule intimacy. Sharing a bed promotes personal connection, sexual activity, and feelings of comfort and security. To get the same intimacy when you sleep apart, Dr. Collier says, you must make a concerted effort. For example, if nighttime is when you have sex, cuddle, or share meaningful details of your day, schedule that before bedtime, and then move to separate rooms after your time together. Or set aside time for closeness during the day and make it a priority.
        Create a nighttime routine. It can be tough sleeping alone after years of being together, especially if you have anxiety or stress. ""You'll have to develop your own bedtime routine, one that makes you feel relaxed and sleepy, such as reading for a little while and then turning out the light and listening to a bedside sound machine. If you miss the comfort and security of your partner, sleeping with a body pillow or a weighted blanket might help,"" Dr. Collier says. ""Or, talk to your partner on the phone or in a video call as you're going to sleep. That way you can still be together.""
        Assess the arrangement regularly. Check in with each other daily to see what's working and what isn't. ""It's not good enough if it's helpful only for one person,"" Dr. Collier says. ""Go back to the drawing board and come up with something better. Your relationship is at stake, and so is your health and well-being. Sleeping apart can be beneficial if both parties are happy with the setup, both parties sleep well, and you continue to nurture your relationship.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-trends-in-cardiology-to-watch,5 trends in cardiology to watch,"Longtime readers of the Heart Letter know that most of our stories focus on steps you can take right now to improve your heart health. But once in a while, we look ahead at what's on the horizon in this dynamic field. We consulted Dr. Eugene Braunwald, Distinguished Hersey Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, where he has worked since 1972. At age 94, he continues to work and publish, adding to the more than 1,100 articles he has authored since the early 1950s. His pioneering research helped elucidate how heart attacks happen, which ushered in new ways to treat and prevent them.
        Dr. Braunwald's discoveries also advanced the understanding of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, and heart failure. (His life and research are described in Eugene Braunwald and the Rise of Modern Medicine, written by former Harvard Heart Letter editor in chief Dr. Thomas H. Lee.) The trends Dr. Braunwald is most excited about, summarized below, may one day affect heart health at every stage of life — from birth to old age.
        1. Primordial prevention
        Dr. Braunwald: The future of cardiology will focus on preventing heart disease very early in life, a concept known as primordial prevention. Instead of waiting until people develop risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes and treating them, we will be able to identify and prevent the development of those conditions in the first place. Many of these conditions are caused not by a single gene but by many genes. We now have specialized genetic tests to create polygenic risk scores that help predict cardiovascular risk [see ""Genetic profiling for heart disease: An update"" in the October 2023 Heart Letter]. In the future, these tests will become more accurate and less expensive, so I foresee doing these tests in newborns.
        For example, if a baby has genes linked to the development of high blood pressure by age 30, you could modify that child's diet to prevent the problem. Focusing on prevention very early in life could make a huge difference in reducing cardiovascular disease, which remains the most common cause of death in adults worldwide.
        2. Targeting inflammation
        Dr. Braunwald: For people who already have heart disease, medications that lower blood pressure and cholesterol are an important part of avoiding future heart problems. Until recently, however, there haven't been any drugs to address inflammation, which ignites the artery-damaging process that leads to a heart attack. But in June 2023, the FDA approved the anti-inflammatory drug colchicine [Lodoco] for people who have or are at high risk for heart disease. The drug, which has been used for many years to treat gout, can lower the risk of heart attack and related problems by about 30%. Investigators and the pharmaceutical industry are now looking very closely at this category of medications. Going forward, I predict there will be a whole battery of new anti-inflammatory drugs. It will be similar to the current situation with high blood pressure, where we have many different drugs that doctors can use to treat this common problem.
        3. Cardiac cell therapy
        Dr. Braunwald: A heart attack cuts off blood flow to part of the heart's muscle, creating damage that scars the heart. Over time, especially in people with repeat heart attacks, this can impair the heart's ability to function normally, leading to heart failure. For more than two decades, scientists have tried to repair damaged hearts using cardiac cell therapy, also known as stem cell therapy. The original concept was to infuse large numbers of stem cells derived from bone marrow into the heart to regenerate heart muscle cells. While the initial results appeared promising, these cells aren't incorporated into the heart muscle, and they quickly disappear. Now, several other techniques are being explored, including isolating the substances released from transplanted cells that appear to be responsible for their benefits. By making these substances — which include factors that encourage blood vessel growth — in the lab, we might be able to provide ""cell therapy without cells."" I'm also excited about the promise of pluripotent stem cells, a discovery based on technology that was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology. These are cells that have been reprogrammed into their embryonic state and can therefore be directed to generate any type of adult cells, including heart muscle cells.
        4. Transplanting pig hearts
        Dr. Braunwald: Despite steady progress in heart transplantation, many hundreds of people die each year waiting for a heart transplant [see ""An advance in heart transplantation"" in the July 2020 Heart Letter]. Over the years, there have been a number of successful interspecies transplants — known as xenotransplantation — including in non-human primates. In the past two years, two men with end-stage heart failure received transplants using genetically modified pig hearts. [One survived for six weeks, the other for two months]. Pigs are a logical choice because their hearts are similar in size to a human's. In both cases, several genes in the donor pig were inactivated and human genes were inserted into the pig's genome to stop the recipient from rejecting the new organ. These early studies have paved the way for further advances in xenotransplantation.
        5. Improved left ventricular assist devices
        Dr. Braunwald: A left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, is a small pump implanted in the chest to help a greatly weakened, failing heart deliver blood to the body. In addition to becoming smaller, more powerful, and less expensive, LVADs will undergo other improvements in the coming years. Current devices use a driveline, a cable that passes through the skin to connect the pump to a battery and control system worn outside the body. In the future, devices will be charged through the skin without requiring a driveline, which is a common place for infections. Another potential advance is the use of biocompatible materials in the pump, which means patients might not need to take anti-clotting drugs. People with advanced heart failure may receive an LVAD temporarily while waiting for a heart transplant, or even instead of a transplant, in what we call ""destination therapy.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/coated-aspirin-and-regular-aspirin-similar-benefits-and-risks,Coated aspirin and regular aspirin: Similar benefits and risks,"Most of the aspirin sold in the United States is what's called enteric-coated or safety-coated aspirin: it has a smooth coating that protects it from stomach acid, allowing the drug to be released in the intestine instead of the stomach. For patients taking daily aspirin to help their hearts, doctors often recommend coated aspirin based on an unproven belief that it's less likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding. But doing so raises a different concern: does the coating make aspirin less effective for preventing heart attacks? A study published Nov. 1, 2023, in JAMA Cardiology looked at both issues.
        Researchers analyzed more than two years' worth of data from nearly 10,700 people taking aspirin for cardiovascular disease. Most (69%) took coated aspirin daily, while the rest took uncoated aspirin. Both forms of aspirin proved equally effective for preventing death or hospitalization from a heart attack or stroke. However, when it came to avoiding major bleeding episodes, the coated aspirin offered no advantage over the uncoated pills.
        Aspirin (either type) is usually recommended for heart attack survivors. But for everyone else, the decision depends on their age, sex, and risk of heart attack and bleeding.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/marijuana-use-disorder-may-raise-the-risk-of-heart-problems,Marijuana use disorder may raise the risk of heart problems,"Up to three in 10 people who use marijuana (also called cannabis) may be unable to stop using the drug, even when it has harmful effects on their lives. A new study suggests that this problem — known as cannabis use disorder (CUD) — is linked to a substantially higher risk of cardiovascular problems.
        The study included nearly 60,000 people registered in Canadian health databases. About half of them had CUD. Researchers found that compared to people without CUD, those with CUD were about 60% more likely to experience a heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular problems.
        Published online Sept. 27, 2023, in the journal Addiction, the results do not provide evidence of cause and effect. However, earlier research has implicated marijuana use in raising blood pressure and causing a range of heart-related problems (see ""Cannabis: A cardiovascular concern?"" in the July 2023 Heart Letter).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/poor-sleep-linked-to-high-blood-pressure,Poor sleep linked to high blood pressure,"Sleep problems — including trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, and too little sleep — are associated with a greater risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) in women, according to a new study.
        Published in the Nov. 2023 issue of Hypertension, the study tracked the health of 66,122 women for 16 years. When the study began in 2001, the women ranged in age from 25 to 42 and didn't have hypertension.
        After researchers accounted for various demographic and lifestyle factors, they found that compared to women who slept seven to eight hours daily, those who slept six or five hours were 7% and 10%, respectively, more likely to develop hypertension. Women who said they sometimes or usually had trouble falling or staying asleep were 14% and 28% more likely to have hypertension, respectively, compared to those who rarely had trouble sleeping.
        The findings don't prove that sleep problems cause elevated blood pressure. However, as the authors suggest, one possible explanation for the link may be increased stress, which is associated both with poor sleep and high blood pressure.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/fixing-a-faulty-aortic-valve,Fixing a faulty aortic valve,"The one-way valve inside your aorta opens and shuts with every heartbeat, controlling the flow of blood to your body. But with age, the leaflets of this hard-working valve may stiffen and become clogged with calcium deposits, a condition known as aortic stenosis. It affects about one in 20 people by age 65 and becomes more common with advancing age.
        Unfortunately, no medications can prevent or treat this problem. The good news: people with serious cases (see ""Aortic stenosis symptoms"") can get a new valve to replace the damaged one. A nonsurgical approach for placing a new valve has become very popular in recent years, but it doesn't make sense for everyone.
        ""Historically, surgery was the only option for replacing an aortic valve. But many older people weren't good candidates for this major open-heart surgery because they had too many other medical problems,"" says Dr. Pinak B. Shah, director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. About 20 years ago, doctors first tested a procedure to replace a damaged aortic valve through a catheter threaded through a leg artery up to the heart.
        Called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), the procedure was first used only in high-risk older people. But since its approval in 2011, the use of TAVR has expanded dramatically, including in people younger than 65 and those at low risk for surgery, says Dr. Shah. Understandably, people prefer TAVR because it doesn't require general anesthesia and has an easier, shorter recovery compared to surgery. But for people in their 60s, the situation is a little more complicated.
        
          
            
              
                Aortic stenosis symptoms
                Most heart valve problems are discovered when a physician hears an abnormal sound while listening to the heart through a stethoscope. A stiff aortic valve doesn't open as easily, so as the heart's main pumping chamber (the left ventricle) contracts, pressure builds up behind the valve. The blood flow through the narrowed opening is turbulent, causing a ""murmur"" that's initially loud and then quieter as less blood remains in the ventricle. An ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) can reveal the narrowed valve and confirm the diagnosis.
                If you have a mild heart valve problem without any symptoms, you may simply need to monitor the condition with your doctor and stay alert for symptoms, which include
                
                  shortness of breath
                  chest pain or tightness with activity
                  dizziness, lightheadedness.
                
              
            
          
        
        Different valves and techniques
        There are two types of replacement valves: mechanical valves (made from sturdy metals such as titanium and carbon) and tissue valves (taken from pig or cow hearts). Expert guidelines recommend that people younger than 50 get a mechanical valve because these durable valves — which must be surgically placed — usually last for the rest of the person's life. Because blood clots can form on mechanical valves, however, recipients must take the clot-preventing drug warfarin for the rest of their lives.
        With a tissue valve, anti-clotting drugs aren't necessary, and it can be placed through either surgery or TAVR. But the leaflets of a tissue valve don't last forever, says Dr. Shah. ""We hope the new valve will last 10 years. And while some last as long as 15 years, others may fail within seven to eight years,"" he says. That means some people may need a second valve replacement later in life.
        
          
            
              
                Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
                
                  
                
                In a TAVR procedure, a valve made of cow or pig tissue is crimped onto the tip of a thin, flexible tube (catheter). The doctor threads the catheter (A) from the top of the thigh up to the opening between the heart and the aorta (B). Once it reaches the diseased aortic valve, the new valve is deployed (using either a balloon or a self-expanding device), which then anchors to the old valve (C).

        Why age matters
        Currently, the average life expectancy in the United States is about 78 years, which means the typical person in their 70s or 80s who gets a TAVR is unlikely to need a second valve replacement. But people in their 60s are likely to need another new valve — and a TAVR may not be the best choice the first time around. For one thing, diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease — the most common form of heart disease — may be more challenging in people who've had TAVR. For another, the surgery to replace a failed TAVR valve is more complicated and riskier than regular valve replacement surgery, explains Dr. Shah. If you're going to need at least one traditional valve surgery, you're better off having it in your 60s rather than your 70s, he says. Then, you can get a TAVR the second time around.
        If you're facing aortic valve replacement, it's important to be evaluated by a team of experts that includes an interventional cardiologist who does TAVR as well as a cardiac surgeon, says Dr. Shah. They should review your situation carefully to help you select the best option.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-you-worry-about-your-waistline,Should you worry about your waistline?,"Extra padding around your midsection goes by many different names — a spare tire, muffin top, or love handles. Too much of any type of fat isn't healthy, but some forms are worse than others. The flab you can pinch between your fingers is known as subcutaneous fat, which lies just beneath the skin. A more worrisome type of fat lies deep within the abdominal cavity, padding the space between your organs (see illustration).
        Known as visceral fat, it does more than add inches around your waistline; it also raises your risk of cardiovascular problems. ""Growing evidence suggests that your waist circumference is a better predictor of heart disease than your body mass index,"" says Dr. Osama Hamdy, medical director of the Obesity Clinical Program at Harvard-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center. Body mass index (BMI), an indirect estimate of body fat based on height and weight, doesn't distinguish between the different types of fat. ""People can have what's considered a healthy BMI but still have a large belly and visceral fat,"" says Dr. Hamdy.
        Another measurement, the waist-to-hip ratio, correlates with visceral fat. But there's no need to do that extra hip measurement or math because waist circumference alone is strongly linked to visceral fat, says Dr. Hamdy. Just make sure you measure correctly (see ""Gut check: How to measure your midsection"").
        Why is visceral fat dangerous?
        Visceral fat is also a marker for ectopic fat, which refers to fat that accumulates inside organs (such as the liver, heart, and pancreas) and muscles. Both type of fat are closely tied to metabolic problems, especially type 2 diabetes — which, in turn, is a potent risk factor for heart disease. In addition, visceral fat secretes hormones and other inflammatory factors, collectively called adipokines or cytokines, which trigger a buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries (atherosclerosis).
        Who's at risk?
        Your genes, ethnic background, and sex all influence how likely you are to accumulate visceral fat. Native Americans (notably the Pima tribe), Hispanics, and people living in India and South Asia have a higher likelihood of abdominal obesity (as well as diabetes). In addition, white men and black women tend to accumulate relatively more visceral fat compared with black men and white women.
        
          
            
              
                Gut check: How to measure your midsection
                To measure your waist accurately, wrap a measuring tape around your bare abdomen just above the upper border of your hipbone, which you can easily feel on both sides. Usually, the tape measure will cross your bellybutton, but not for everyone. Make sure the tape measure isn't twisted and that it stays taut, but not tight enough to compress the area. Don't suck in your gut or hold your breath. Check the number right after you exhale.
                For women, a waist circumference of 35 inches or higher signals a high risk. For men, it's 40 inches or higher. Ideally, your waist circumference should be no greater than one-half your height.
              
            
          
        
        What helps to banish a big belly?
        Although some people are predisposed to larger midsections, there's a lot you can do to remedy the problem, says Dr. Hamdy.
        Get regular exercise. Sit-ups or other abdominal exercises won't shrink your belly. Instead, you need to burn calories to lose fat and build muscle through a combination of aerobic and strength training. Aim for at least 30 minutes daily of moderate-intensity exercise (like brisk walking), and do strength-based exercise at least two days per week.
        Follow a healthy, reduced-carbohydrate diet. Avoid foods and drinks with added sugars and other simple carbohydrates that spike blood sugar and encourage your body to store fat. These include foods made with white flour (common culprits include what Dr. Hamdy calls the ""P's and B's"": pasta, pizza, pretzels, bread, and bagels) and starchy foods, such as white potatoes, white rice, and corn.
        Try time-restricted eating. Some research suggests this strategy may lower blood sugar levels and reduce visceral fat. There are many ways to structure your eating; for example, you might eat only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and fast during the other 16 hours. This not only limits calorie intake but also kick-starts the body's fat-burning process.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-you-should-walk-with-a-doc,"Why you should ""Walk with a Doc""","You know that walking helps your heart. So does spending time with other people, being outside in nature, and learning about ways to improve your health and well-being from a professional. Want to get all four at once? Show up at a Walk with a Doc event.
        Launched in 2005, this nonprofit organization sponsors free, doctor-led walks in mostly outdoor venues (usually public parks) across America. Today, Walk with a Doc is in 34 countries worldwide, including 560 communities around the United States. In surveys and focus groups, participants give the program high marks. Nearly all of the responders — 96% — say they strongly agree that Walk with a Doc has helped them lead a healthier lifestyle, according to a 2020 article in Current Cardiology Reports co-authored by Walk with a Doc founder Dr. David Sabgir.
        The program's initial inspiration was to encourage people to be less sedentary. But the informal teaching that happens before and during the walks is a boon for patients and doctors alike, says cardiologist Dr. Simin Lee, associate physician at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""In our current health care system, most of the care is compressed into a short office visit,"" she says. Walk with a Doc gives physicians time to discuss important health topics — such as exercise, diet, and stress management — in greater depth. Dr. Lee started the Walk with a Doc chapter in Jamacia Plain, the Boston neighborhood bordering the Longwood Medical Area, which is home to Harvard Medical School and many of its affiliated medical institutions.
        Walking and talking
        ""Most of the chapters do monthly walks, but I wanted to encourage continuity and habit formation, so I did my walks every week,"" says Dr. Lee. The walks, which are currently led by her Brigham and Women's colleague Dr. Catherine Hwang, feature a 1.5-mile loop around Jamaica Pond every Wednesday evening at 5:30 pm. In general, weekday walks are usually about 30 minutes long; weekend walks may last 60 to 90 minutes.
        About five minutes before starting the walk, the doctor speaks on various topics of interest, including those requested by the participants. For her initial talks, Dr. Lee focused on the recommended ""dose"" of exercise. During the walk, she demonstrated what moderate-intensity exercise looks like. ""I'd tell people to notice how I could still talk in full sentences but that my breathing was a little heavier than when we were just standing around,"" she says.
        During later walks, she taught interval training by cueing the group to pick up their walking pace for a few minutes, and to then pull back and return to their normal walking speed. Interval training is a good way to add variety to your workout and is especially helpful for improving cardiovascular fitness, she notes.
        ""Sometimes, it can feel futile to just rattle off some basic counseling about exercise during an office visit. It's so much more powerful when you can demonstrate it in person,"" she says. As much as we appreciate all the medications we have at our fingertips to manage cardiovascular disease, people really are interested in doing things for their health that doesn't involve taking pills, Dr. Lee says. She also did a series of talks about how exercise benefits so many chronic health conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, dementia, and cancer.
        Camaraderie and pleasant scenery
        As Dr. Sabgir wrote in his article, most Americans are living lives that are sedentary, lonely, and not connected with nature. Many Walk with a Doc programs, including Dr. Lee's, have helped foster social connections and forged friendships among the participants. The walks she led often included 10 or more people, who would sometimes bring friends or family members along. ""Creating a shared sense of community is a really important aspect of the program,"" she says.
        So is the stress-relieving power of spending time in nature, which has become less and less common. Research suggests that over half of all Americans spend fewer than five hours outdoors each week. ""In our increasingly digital world, where people spend a lot of time inside in front of screens, it's just lovely to be outside to get fresh air and witness a beautiful sunset and the changing seasons,"" says Dr. Lee.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/biotin-supplements,Biotin supplements,"Q. 
          Your Q&A about elevated troponin levels in the October 2023 issue reminded me about a related issue I've been wondering about. I'm a 76-year-old woman with heart disease, which has necessitated several visits to the emergency room in recent years. I've heard that biotin supplements, which are supposed to promote hair and nail growth, can affect the accuracy of a troponin test. If this is a valid concern, is there a threshold for the amount of biotin a person can take? It's found in nearly all multivitamins.
        
        A. Yes, taking supplements that contain high levels of biotin (vitamin B7) can lead to falsely low or falsely high results on a troponin test. Troponin, a protein found in heart muscle, is released into the bloodstream during a heart attack. Measuring blood troponin levels is the standard way to diagnose a heart attack.
        The biotin issue is a valid concern. Inaccurate results on a troponin test can lead to a missed diagnosis with potentially serious consequences, according to a 2017 warning letter from the FDA. In at least one case, a person who was taking high doses of biotin died following a falsely low troponin test result.
        The problem occurs because laboratory tests use technology that incorporates biotin because it binds to specific proteins, including troponins. Excess biotin in the blood can interfere with the biotin used in the test. However, since the FDA's warning, many — but not all — troponin test manufacturers have taken steps to address this risk.
        How much biotin is too much? The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for biotin is 0.03 milligrams (mg), which you can easily get just by eating a healthy, varied diet. The best dietary sources include eggs, fish, nuts, seeds, and vegetables, especially sweet potatoes. Many multivitamins and prenatal vitamins contain far more biotin than the RDA. And some supplements — particularly those marketed to improve hair, nails, and skin — contain 20 mg, or nearly 650 times the RDA.
        A biotin deficiency can cause hair loss and brittle nails. But that doesn't mean healthy people will reap any benefit from biotin supplements. According to the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, the claims supporting better hair and nail health from biotin supplements are based on a few case reports and small studies.
        Doctors sometimes suggest taking a multivitamin if there's concern that you aren't getting sufficient amounts of one of more vitamins or minerals. If you do take a multivitamin, avoid brands that contain more than the RDA for biotin.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-does-coffee-help-with-digestion,Why does coffee help with digestion?,"Q. 
          I love my morning cup of joe, but I've noticed it also sends me straight to the bathroom for a bowel movement. Why can coffee have a laxative effect?
        
        A. Since about half of American adults profess to drink coffee every day, this perennially popular drink must boast some pretty compelling benefits. Beyond waking up our brains, coffee also helps jolt some people's digestive tracts.
        This happens for several reasons. A 2021 study suggests that two hormones coffee boosts — gastrin and cholecystokinin — trigger the so‑called gastrocolic reflex, prompting the colon to contract and move waste through the rectum. Since colon contractions tend to be strongest in the morning anyway, drinking coffee plays into this natural digestive process. This hormonal action is specific to coffee, not tea or other drinks, but coffee's caffeine content heightens this effect by increasing colon contractions and stool movement. For some people, this can happen within minutes; for others, it might take hours — or not happen at all.
        On the other hand, people who tend to be constipated often find that their morning cup of coffee helps keep them regular. But don't drink excessive amounts of coffee just for this reason. It can make us jittery or worsen the symptoms of certain conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, glaucoma, or overactive bladder.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-am-i-prone-to-skin-tags,Why am I prone to skin tags?,"Q. 
          I've had a couple of skin tags over the years, but lately several have popped up. Why?
        
        A. These fleshy, soft growths — which are more common among women — are unquestionably annoying. They can sprout almost anywhere on the skin, but skin tags tend to develop on the neck, under the arms, or around the groin.
        While skin tags can be unattractive, the good news is that they're benign and won't develop into cancer. But they're linked with several health conditions that aren't harmless, which is why you should be concerned if you're developing more of them. These include diabetes or metabolic syndrome (a constellation of high blood pressure, unhealthy blood sugar levels, extra fat around your waist, and unhealthy cholesterol levels). Skin tags are also more common if you're pregnant or obese, or if you have family members who also develop them.
        Your doctor may want to run blood tests if you're getting a lot of skin tags with no explanation. If you'd like, she can also remove them using various in-office techniques.

        Waist-to-hip ratio is the circumference of your waist divided by the circumference at your hips. For the study, waist circumference was measured at the smallest natural waistline (usually near the belly button) and hip circumference at the widest part of the hips. BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared.
        Researchers collected measurements from 387,672 participants (59% men). Everyone's health then was tracked until their death.
        Afterward, the researchers identified people who developed weight-related health problems like high blood pressure, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes and then cross-referenced with their measurements. They found that waist-to-hip ratio was a better predictor of a person's future health issues than BMI. The reason, they said, was most likely that waist-to-hip ratio better reflects levels of abdominal fat, including dangerous visceral fat. According to the researchers, a healthy waist-to-hip ratio for most men is below 0.95.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/prebiotics-in-plant-based-foods-may-help-control-unhealthy-eating,Prebiotics in plant-based foods may help control unhealthy eating,"Science has shown that a healthy gut can make beneficial changes in the brain and vice versa, via a connection known as the gut-brain axis. A healthy gut requires good amounts of probiotics (beneficial bacteria), which grow by feeding off prebiotics, compounds found in plant fiber. A new study suggests prebiotics have a role in the gut-brain axis beyond being a food source and eating them might help people choose healthier foods.
        Researchers recruited 59 overweight adults who regularly followed a Western diet (higher in red meat, saturated fat, and processed foods) and assigned them randomly to take either 30 grams of inulin (a prebiotic found in onions, leeks, artichokes, and bananas) or a placebo supplement, every day for two weeks. Next, the participants had brain MRIs while they viewed pictures of various low-, medium-, and high-calorie foods and indicated how much they wanted them on a one to 10 scale. The MRIs measured how much of the brain's reward network was activated when the participants made their choices. Over a second two-week period, the process was repeated: everyone took the supplement they had not taken earlier, and then underwent the MRI session. The researchers found that after taking the prebiotic supplement, people were more likely to select medium- or low-calorie foods than high-calorie ones, and their MRIs showed less activation in their brain's reward network when shown high-calorie foods.
        The results were published online Oct. 4, 2023, by the journal Gut.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-to-lower-your-dementia-risk,How to lower your dementia risk,"An estimated 3% of adults ages 65 and older currently have dementia, and that proportion rises substantially as people age. By age 85, about one-third will be diagnosed with some form.
        The diagnosis of dementia is based on a set of symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, changes in personality, a decline in cognitive skills, and inability to perform everyday activities.
        But can you do anything to lower your risk?
        ""The most convincing evidence continues to be for the boring stuff — aerobic exercise, a brain-healthy diet, and quality sleep,"" says neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Daneshvar, chief of the division of brain injury rehabilitation with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Even people with a family history of dementia could lower the risk by investing more in these basic healthy lifestyle habits."" Here's how they help with dementia prevention.
        Aerobic exercise. The buildup of beta-amyloid protein in the brain is a key hallmark of many diseases that cause dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia. Another common form, vascular dementia, stems from damage to brain cells that occurs when narrowed or hardened blood vessels fail to supply enough blood to the brain.
        Aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain, supporting blood vessels and decreasing the risk of blood vessel damage. It also helps reduce inflammation, thought to be one of the main causes of abnormal protein buildup.
        Aerobic exercise is any activity that increases your heart rate. Although most aerobic exercise requires you to move your entire body, the main focus should be on your heart and lungs. ""Activities like walking, running, swimming, cycling, even dancing, if done at sufficient intensity, get you breathing faster and your heart working harder,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Guidelines recommend adults do at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week.
        It's never too late to begin, either. ""Even older people who have rarely done aerobic exercise before can still reap the benefits once they start,"" says Dr. Daneshvar.
        Brain-healthy diet. There are several extensively studied diets that promote brain health, like the Mediterranean, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), and MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diets. ""These diets are linked to lower levels of brain-damaging chronic inflammation by reducing or eliminating red meat and processed foods and increasing the intake of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables and fatty fish high in omega-3 fatty acids,"" says Dr. Daneshvar.
        Quality sleep. During sleep, the brain clears out harmful beta-amyloid proteins. But the cleaning process can't do a complete job if sleep is regularly disrupted — by insomnia, sleep apnea, or other issues that cause you to wake during the night. ""Eventually, this can cause or exacerbate abnormal protein buildup,"" says Dr. Daneshvar.
        If you regularly don't feel rested upon waking or have trouble falling and staying asleep, speak with your doctor. It's important to address any sleep disorder or other health issues that interfere with sleep, like acid reflux. Taking multiple medicines, depression, and changes in the bedroom environment (for instance, in temperature, noise level, smartphone usage, or light exposure) also can disrupt sleep.
        
          
            
              
                Engage your brain by socializing
                Another way to protect your brain from dementia is to socialize more. A study published online Oct. 24, 2023, by JAMA Neurology found that socially isolated older adults have a 27% higher chance of developing dementia than older adults who aren't isolated. ""Regular interactions activate mental processes, including attention and memory, which can bolster cognition,"" says neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Daneshvar with Massachusetts General Hospital. Here are some ways to increase your social engagement:
                Get into group dynamics.Join a group activity, such as a walking club, a golf or bowling league, a book or chess club, or a continuing education class at an adult education center.
                Schedule friend time.If you have a circle of friends but you don't see them regularly, take the initiative and schedule routine get-togethers. Designate a day, time, and place for coffee, lunch, or any type of gathering designed for easy conversation. Group video chats also are an option.
                Engage in ""weak ties."" Casual interactions, known as ""weak ties,"" also can provide stimulating engagement. For example, strike up a brief conversation with a stranger or employee at the grocery store or coffee shop. Even social media conversations and texting qualify.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-lowdown-on-blood-thinners,The lowdown on blood thinners,"Blood thinners are among the most misunderstood drugs. Despite their name, they don't ""thin"" blood, Rather, they discourage blood from clotting.
        ""Anti-clotting drugs prevent potentially dangerous blood clots from developing in people at high risk,"" says Dr. Gregory Piazza, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Candidates for anti-clotting medications include people who have atrial fibrillation, or afib (a rapid, irregular heart rhythm that causes blood to pool in the heart's upper chambers), or who recently received a stent (a tiny metal mesh tube that is inserted into a clogged blood vessel to increase blood flow).
        Others who can benefit from anti-clotting drugs are people who are immobile after surgery and people who have suffered from deep-vein thrombosis, or DVT (clots in the veins of the legs or arms), or pulmonary embolism (clots in the lungs).
        How anti-clotting drugs work
        Why are blood clots so dangerous? And how do anti-clotting drugs help?
        A clot has two main components: fibrin and platelets. Fibrin is a protein that forms a mesh to trap red blood cells, while platelets are tiny cells that clump together. They work together to keep the clot intact and stop or slow blood flow.
        Blood clots are usually a good thing. When you get a cut, a clot forms to stop excessive bleeding. However, when clots form in the wrong places, they can cause harm and even death.
        Where a dangerous clot develops is often linked to how much of each type of material they contain. For instance, clots causing DVTs and those inside the heart are made mostly of fibrin. Clots in the arteries that feed blood to the heart and brain are more often triggered by platelet action.
        Typically, a clot on a cut dissolves after the injury has healed. But a blood clot that forms inside an artery or vein might not spontaneously dissolve, and it can even grow larger. As a result, it can block blood flow, which may lead to a heart attack or stroke.
        Many factors contribute to these types of clots, such as inflammation, infection, immobility, cancer, and surgery. ""In these cases, you need anti-clotting drugs to help the body dissolve the existing unwanted clots and stop new ones from forming, while still allowing the blood to clot when needed, like after an injury,"" says Dr. Piazza.
        Two categories
        Anti-clotting drugs fall into two categories: anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs. Which one you need depends on your clot risk.
        Anticoagulants interfere with fibrin. Besides treating and preventing DVT and other vein clots, they are commonly prescribed for people with afib.
        Antiplatelet drugs prevent platelets from sticking together. They are used to prevent heart attacks and strokes in people who have cardiovascular disease or are otherwise at high risk.
        The main side effect of anti-­clotting medications is excessive bleeding. Contact your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms:
        
          recurrent bleeding in your gums after you brush or floss
          nosebleeds or minor cuts that take longer than usual to stop bleeding
          frequent bruising, especially around the torso.
        
        In some cases, the fear of bleeding can prevent people who need anti-­clotting drugs from taking them. This is especially true for those with afib who already take regular aspirin (which also can affect clotting) and are concerned about a higher bleeding risk from adding an anticoagulant.
        ""But many times, these individuals don't need to take aspirin and can just take the anticoagulant,"" says Dr. Piazza. (Check with your doctor if you are on aspirin therapy.)
        People ages 75 and older also have a higher risk of bleeding from anti-clotting drugs than younger folks. Still, Dr. Piazza adds that most people can tolerate the medication, and if they are concerned about bleeding, they should discuss it with their doctor. ""You and your doctor will weigh the risk of heart attack or stroke versus the chance of major bleeding,"" he says.
        Dosage and needs
        How long you need an anti-clotting drug and how much you should take depend on your situation. For example, people typically take two antiplatelet drugs for six months to a year after getting a stent. Then they stay on just one antiplatelet drug, usually low-dose aspirin, indefinitely.
        ""People with afib may take anti­coagulants for the rest of their life,"" says Dr. Piazza. ""But they should review this with their doctor every year to see if they need to make changes to their dose or even whether they need to continue taking it.""
        Other situations require short-term drug therapy, such as for 14 days to six weeks after a knee or hip replacement to prevent DVT. ""Sometimes people need to take both an anticoagulant and an antiplatelet at the same time if they are being treated for separate issues, like afib and a stent,"" says Dr. Piazza.
        Also, certain underlying medical conditions influence the choice and dose of an anti-clotting drug. For instance, people with impaired kidney function may not be able to take newer anticoagulants. Those who have had intestinal bleeding need to balance the risk of a clot versus the risk of severe blood loss.
        Some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) also can interact with anti-clotting drugs, so check with your doctor before taking them.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/ultraprocessed-foods-may-raise-depression-risks,Ultraprocessed foods may raise depression risks,"Eating lots of ultraprocessed foods — which are high in sugar, salt, fat and additives — may raise the risk of depression, a new study suggests.
        The Harvard-led analysis, published in the September 2023 issue of JAMA Network Open, assessed the eating habits and mental health status of more than 21,000 women, ages 42 to 62, taking part in the long-running Nurses' Health Study II. None of the participants reported any depression symptoms at the study's start. Those who ate the most ultraprocessed food, defined as at least nine servings per day, were 50% more likely to develop depression than participants who ate the least, which was defined as no more than four servings daily. Consuming many foods and drinks containing artificial sweeteners was linked to a particularly large increase in depression risk.
        The study was observational, meaning it couldn't prove ultraprocessed foods — which include items such as soda, chips, cookies, white bread, and ready-to-eat meals — cause depression, just that an association exists. But ultraprocessed foods may disturb the proper balance of gut bacteria, which has been shown to affect the way the brain works, the study authors said. Meanwhile, artificial sweeteners may disrupt feel-good brain chemicals that help nerve cells communicate normally.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/chest-pain-causes-other-than-the-heart,Chest pain: Causes other than the heart,"It's so clich' it's called the Holly­wood heart attack: people dramatically clutching their chests and crumbling to the ground. Unlike in the movies, however, many instances of chest pain — especially when it's fleeting — don't involve the heart at all.
        More than 6.5 million emergency department visits in the United States each year are due to chest pain, as are nearly four million outpatient clinic visits, according to the American Heart Association. Notably, however, most of these cases are not found to be heart-related.
        To be clear, chest discomfort of any kind — whether pain itself or tightness, pressure, squeezing, or burning — should never be ignored. And new chest pain should prompt a call to your doctor. But understanding its many possible causes can calm worst-case-scenario fears and help you find solutions, says Dr. Daniel Sands, a primary care doctor at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        ""It's been drummed into us that chest pain is a danger sign that should make you see a doctor,"" Dr. Sands says. This remains solid and safe advice. But chest discomfort more often arises for reasons other than the heart.
        Lengthy list of causes
        For women, cardiac causes account for ""only a very small proportion"" of chest pain, Dr. Sands notes. This depends, of course, on each woman's specific risk factors for heart disease. And, particularly in women, heart attacks don't always show up with chest pain at all.
        ""If a 25-year-old woman comes in with chest pain, and she's generally healthy with no prior heart disease, the likelihood she has cardiac disease is infinitesimal,"" he says. ""But if it's a 60-year-old woman who smokes and has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and a family history of heart disease, that person is so likely to have heart disease that I'd send her to the ER right away.""
        A long list of other conditions — some minor and others deadly serious — can trigger chest pain or discomfort. These include
        
          gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
          gallstones
          asthma
          anxiety or panic attacks

        How can you tell if chest pain is most likely not heart-related? Dr. Sands offers these clues:
        
          It's brief, lasting only a few moments.
          You can climb stairs or exercise without the pain worsening.
          It's triggered by eating, occurring just afterward or only when you eat certain foods.
          It happens only when you move in a certain way, such as bending or stretching.
          It occurs only when you're coughing or breathing deeply.
          It's localized to a small spot, or feels better or worse when you rub the area.
        
        Regardless of how it shows up, any chest pain should prompt you to follow up with your doctor, Dr. Sands says. You may need treatment for another issue.
        ""Don't panic,"" he says. ""Your doctor can evaluate you to see if something serious is going on and work with you to find a solution to feel better.""
        Conversely, a heart attack or other catastrophic problem ""usually shows up with chest pain that goes on for a long period, not something that just goes away,"" Dr. Sands says. Watch for chest pain lingering for more than a few minutes; shortness of breath; pain in the jaw, neck, or back; pain in one or both arms; and feeling nauseous, weak, faint, or dizzy. Call 911 or have someone drive you to an emergency room if you experience any of these signs.
        But anytime you're not certain why you're having chest pain or where it stems from, ""call your doctor immediately,"" Dr. Sands says. ""Sometimes answering a few questions, even over the phone, can determine whether you need to be evaluated or not.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/break-the-cycle,Break the cycle,"If you've ever gone through your day with a song running through your head, you know those ""earworms"" can be either amusing or annoying. But when a single intrusive thought is circling round and round, that's called rumination — and it's seldom pleasant.
        An endless repetition of a negative thought or theme that spirals downward, tanking your mood, rumination often involves replaying a past scenario or conversation in your head or trying to solve a maddening problem. ""I think it's quite common, and some people do it all the time — like picking a scab,"" says Dr. Jacqueline Olds, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        But rumination isn't harmless. It can disrupt your ability to get things done and can even damage your psychological or physical health. ""Rumination is like getting stuck in a conversation with yourself,"" Dr. Olds says.
        Triggers and consequences
        Almost no issue, large or small, is off-limits for rumination. We might go in a mental circle if we believe we've made a mistake, looked foolish, said something wrong, or been responsible for a bad outcome.
        ""Maybe you have a conversation where everything seems to be going well, but when you go home, you think, 'Why did I say that?' You go over and over some minute incident that no one else probably even noticed, and blow it all out of proportion,"" Dr. Olds says.
        Those feelings then dig in deeper. ""You start thinking, 'I have no social sense. I'm always putting my foot in my mouth, and now I've probably alienated people for life.' Basically, you feel horrible about yourself,"" she adds.
        By far, however, people who ruminate continue to do so because they feel they'll gain hoped-for insight into a vexing problem. In essence, your brain is tricking you into believing you're figuring out something useful. But it's usually a trap: thinking endlessly about a problem often doesn't solve anything — it just proves exhausting, stealing your focus from things you'd rather be doing.
        ""It's just harder to navigate your way through life,"" Dr. Olds says. ""Every day we have about a hundred decisions thrown at us. If someone is ruminating too much about every single thing, it slows them down and makes them have trouble with life's ordinary problems.""
        Mental and physical ramifications
        Rumination isn't a psychological disorder in itself, but it can pose or be linked with mental and physical threats. An April 2020 study in Behavior Research and Therapy highlighted how rumination heightens our vulnerability to anxiety, depression, insomnia, and impulsive behaviors; interferes with psychotherapy and limits its effectiveness; and worsens and sustains the body's stress responses, such as inflammation.
        ""It can definitely get in the way of sleep,"" Dr. Olds says. ""If you're in bed for seven-and-a-half hours and spend two-and-a-half of it ruminating and only five hours sleeping, that's a problem.""
        Often a major symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), rumination becomes an unseen compulsion that may feel productive in the moment but sustains OCD over the long term.
        ""People have the faulty assumption that there's a right way and a wrong way to do things, and they have to get it right,"" she says. ""It leads people with OCD to think there's also a right way to think.""
        Rumination can also create an insidious loop that ropes in both depression and anxiety, Dr. Olds says. A January 2020 study of nearly 6,000 adults published in the Journal of Affective Disorders enhances that perspective, suggesting rumination both increases the risk of developing depressive symptoms and results from those same symptoms.
        ""The isolation depressed people experience often leads to more rumination, and then ruminating makes people feel anxious,"" she says. ""It's a loop of its own.""
        Seeking help
        Unlike some mental challenges that are evident to others, rumination largely happens in the shadows. No one can watch you do it, and they may never know you're prone to it if you don't tell anyone what you're going through. This ""invisibility cloak"" can pose barriers to seeking help, since you may be the only person who knows the true toll rumination is taking on your well-being.
        When is it time to seek professional advice? If you feel your looping thoughts are blocking out everything else and you can't function normally, Dr. Olds recommends psychodynamic therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Psychodynamic therapy focuses on developing insights into the roots of your behavior, while CBT emphasizes behavioral change.
        ""How much does rumination slow your forward progress?"" she asks. ""How carried away are you getting? How much sleep are you losing, and how weary and depressed have you become?""
        A therapist can help you identify why you ruminate, as well as address the underlying issues and help break the cycle. With therapy, Dr. Olds says, ""you'll gradually start correcting your self-destructive assumptions.""
        Disrupt the cycle
        But even before therapy — or alongside it — you have the power to disrupt your thought cycle and thwart rumination. Dr. Olds suggests these tactics:
        Find a distraction. You're less apt to ruminate if you're busy doing something else. Try exercising, calling a friend or family member, cleaning out a drawer or closet, listening to music, watching a movie, or reading a book.
        Change locations. Do you have a ""happy place,"" such as a park, the beach, a book store, or a favorite coffee shop? If you can, head there to occupy a new headspace.
        Rely on relaxation techniques. Mindfulness meditation and deep breathing can help clear your mind, which may derail rumination. Find a quiet space, breathe deeply, and notice your surroundings.
        Confide in a friend. A pal can offer a sanity check on runaway thoughts, helping put your worries in perspective. But choose wisely, veering away from dramatic personalities. ""You want to choose a person who can talk you down,"" Dr. Olds says.
        Take action. Do one small thing that might push you past your circular thoughts. If you really think you offended someone at last weekend's cocktail party, send your regrets in an email — but temper yourself. ""Take some reasonable action, but don't prostrate yourself on someone's doorstep,"" Dr. Olds says.
        Be patient. Expect to revisit some looping thoughts before you're able to break the cycle completely.
        
          
            
              
                Self-talk your way to less anxiety
                Rumination is essentially negative self-talk—a drag on your self-esteem shaped by constantly feeding yourself negative messages about your life and your ability to cope.
                Want to flip the script? Try positive self-talk. It's a way of speaking to yourself like your best friend would—with optimism and encouragement. You affirm that you're capable and ready for any task at hand.
                As basic as it sounds, positive self-talk can indeed prove motivational and reassuring, and keeping at it can crowd out the negative filter in your head, easing your anxiety. It can also help you reframe your fears as opportunities, says Dr. Jacqueline Olds, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Self-talk can help you coach yourself into a calmer space,"" she says.
                Getting there requires asking yourself if an anxiety-provoking situation truly warrants an anxious response. ""You have to figure out the probability of something being a catastrophe—to put your own anxiety system at arm's length,"" Dr. Olds says.
                Therapy can help, since you'll gradually internalize your therapist's perspective that lays out problems in calmer, more logical ways. In the meantime, it may help to press the reset button on anxious thoughts by replacing them with affirmations or mantras that can change your mindset.
                Try mentally repeating these messages to yourself instead:
                
                  I can overcome this challenge.
                  I'm safe and in control.
                  This feeling is only temporary.
                  My best is good enough.
                  I can move past this difficult moment.
                  I can handle whatever happens.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/after-prostate-cancer-treatment-a-new-standard-of-care-for-rising-psa-202312203001,"After prostate cancer treatment, a new standard of care for rising PSA","It isn't often that a study leads to fundamental changes in how cancer patients are treated. But new research is doing just that for some men with prostate cancer that recurs after initial treatment.
        Post-treatment recurrence
        The first sign of recurrence is typically a rise in blood levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). PSA should drop to zero after surgical removal of the prostate, and to near zero after radiation therapy. Prostate cancer cells release PSA, so if the levels rise again after this initial treatment, then new tumors are likely forming in the body. This is called a biochemical recurrence, because the newly developing tumors are still too small to see on traditional imaging scans.
        Doctors ordinarily treat biochemical recurrence with hormonal therapies, drugs that prevent the body from making testosterone (a hormone that fuels prostate cancer growth). But results from a large clinical trial show there's a better approach.
        Study methodology and results
        During the study, called the EMBARK phase 3 clinical trial, investigators enrolled 1,068 men whose PSA levels had doubled within nine months of initial treatment. When PSA rises that quickly, men are at high risk of rapid cancer progression.
        The men were randomly divided into three groups: One was treated with a hormonal therapy called leuprolide, given by injection every 12 weeks. A second group was treated with leuprolide as well as a daily oral dose of enzalutamide, a drug that deflects testosterone from its cell receptor. The third group was treated with daily enzalutamide by itself.
        The investigators already knew from earlier studies that enzalutamide delays further progression and lengthens survival for men with metastatic prostate cancer. With this new study, they hypothesized that earlier uses of that drug might have similar benefits for men with biochemical recurrence.
        That hypothesis proved correct. The men were followed for just over five years after their treatments were completed. And according to the results, more of the enzalutamide-treated men remained free of worsening cancer. Specifically, 87.5% of men who got the combined treatment — and 80% of men treated with enzalutamide by itself — avoided metastatic cancer, compared to 71.4% of the men who only got leuprolide.
        Enzalutamide treatment was also more effective at preventing further PSA increases. In all, 97.4% of men who got the combined therapy and 88.9% of men who got enzalutamide alone avoided PSA progression, compared to 70% of the leuprolide-treated men. If the PSA was less than 0.2 ng per milliliter at 36 weeks, then the men could go off treatment altogether. Far more of the enzalutamide-treated men (up to 90%) went off treatment for durations ranging up to 20 months.
        Enzalutamide treatment was well tolerated. The most common side effect was mild to moderate nipple pain and breast enlargement. Most of the men in all three groups are still alive, and EMBARK investigators are following them see if treatment-related differences in survival show up over time.
        Observations and comments
        Based on EMBARK's results, Dr. Neal Shore, director of the Carolina Urologic Research Center in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and the study's co-lead author, concluded that enzalutamide treatment ""should now be the standard of care for high-risk biochemical recurrence."" Whether enzalutamide treatment should also be combined with leuprolide is a decision that men can make in consultation with a doctor.
        An important point is that doctors now have a better way to detect metastatic prostate cancer that wasn't available when EMBARK was launched. The cancer cells contain high levels of a protein called prostate-membrane specific antigen (PSMA) that shows up on specialized imaging scans. PSMA-based imaging methods can reveal tiny metastatic tumors in the body that weren't previously visible. In such cases, patients who might once have been diagnosed with biochemical recurrence are now known to have metastatic cancer. And since doctors can now see those tumors, they can treat them directly with surgery or radiation — and potentially achieve a cure.
        Still, Dr. Stephen Freedland, an EMBARK lead investigator and urologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and the Durham VA Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, says the study's findings still apply. If PSMA findings are negative even as PSA continues to rise, ""then EMBARK shows that systemic treatment [using enzalutamide with or without hormonal therapy] is still the best option,"" he says.
        If PSMA findings show just a few metastatic tumors (this is called oligometastatic prostate cancer), then those tumors can be treated surgically or with radiation, and possibly with hormonal therapy. And if PSMA reveals widespread metastatic cancer throughout the body, then ""metastasis-directed therapy is no longer an option, and hormonal therapy with enzalutamide is the best option to delay progression as shown in EMBARK,"" Dr. Freedland says.
        This study addresses a very large segment of the treated prostate cancer population — those in whom residual cancer following surgery or radiation therapy persists — and the results are ""welcome and surprising,"" says Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""Also welcome is the ability of men to go off of therapy if their PSA values were low at the end of 36 weeks of therapy. As pointed out by both Drs. Shore and Freedland, their study adds a significant contribution to this large patient population. The authors should be congratulated on this important contribution.""",Charlie Schmidt,"December 20, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-healthy-is-sugar-alcohol-202312183002,How healthy is sugar alcohol?,"If you are trying to cut back on added sugar — and you should, because excess sugar increases risks for obesity, diabetes, and heart disease — you might be tempted by products advertised as low sugar, no sugar, or sugar-free.
        Many contain familiar low-calorie sugar substitutes like aspartame or sucralose instead of sugar. And as you're reading labels, you also may run across another ingredient: sugar alcohol, which is used in products like sugar-free cookies, candies, ice cream, beverages, and chewing gums. Are any of these sweeteners a better choice nutritionally? Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, weighs in below.
        Are low-calorie or no-calorie sweeteners any healthier than natural sugar?
        Also known as artificial sweeteners or sugar substitutes, the list of low-calorie and no-calorie sweeteners you may see on product nutrition labels includes acesulfame-K, saccharin, sucralose, neotame, and advantame. These have a higher sweetness intensity per gram than natural sugar.
        So far research on them is mixed, although some observational studies have found that beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners are associated with a higher risk for diabetes and weight gain.
        What exactly are sugar alcohols and how can you spot them?
        Sugar alcohols may have the most misleading name, as they are neither sugar nor alcohol, according to Dr. Hu. ""They are a type of carbohydrate derived from fruits and vegetables, although most commercial sugar alcohols are synthetically produced.""
        You can usually spot many sugar alcohols on ingredient lists by ""-ol"" at the ends of their names. Examples include sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, mannitol, erythritol, and maltitol.
        Are sugar alcohols any healthier than other sugar substitutes or natural sugar?
        Here is a look at the pros and cons.
        The upside of sugar alcohols
        Sugar alcohols reside in the sweet spot between natural sugar and low-calorie sweeteners. They are not as overly sweet as sweeteners and don't add too many extra calories like sugar.
        ""Sugar alcohols are about 40% to 80% as sweet as natural sugar, whereas artificial sweeteners like aspartame are about 200 times sweeter,"" says Dr. Hu. ""And they have about 25% to 75% fewer calories per gram than sugar.""
        Another upside of sugar alcohols is that they break down slowly in the gut. Hence, your body only absorbs part of their overall carbohydrates. ""This keeps your blood sugar and insulin levels from spiking as they do with sugar,"" says Dr. Hu. ""That makes them a useful sugar substitute for people with diabetes.""
        The downside of sugar alcohols
        The main downside to sugar alcohols is this: when taken in high amounts they can cause gastrointestinal (GI) problems, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or loose stools.
        Because sugar alcohols are slowly digested, they have more time to feed bacteria in the gut, which can lead to fermentation and produce excess gas. Their slow digestion also can pull extra water into the colon and cause a laxative effect.
        People's tolerance for sugar alcohols depends on many factors, including body weight, health conditions, and the amount and types of sugar alcohols. ""Individual differences in digestion and metabolism, gut microbiome composition, and dietary habits can also make a difference,"" says Dr. Hu. ""For these reasons, we recommend introducing sugar alcohols into your diet gradually and observing how your body responds.""
        For people who experience GI symptoms caused by sugar alcohols, Dr. Hu says cutting back on the amount of foods and drinks made with them often can correct the problem. ""Sugar alcohols are commonly found in sugar-free or low-carb products, so pay attention to food labels"" he says. ""Because different sugar alcohols can have different effects, it might be useful to identify specific types of sugar alcohols that cause GI side effects.""
        Do sugar alcohols have health risks?
        Possible long-term health risks of sugar alcohol are still being explored. A 2023 observational study found a link between using erythritol as an added sweetener and cardiovascular disease events, such as stroke and heart attack, in people with heart disease or who had risk factors like diabetes and high blood pressure. However, these findings have not been confirmed in subsequent studies.
        ""Sugar alcohols offer a healthier alternative to sugar because of their lower calorie content and reduced glycemic response, which is the effect food has on blood sugar levels,"" says Dr. Hu. ""But they also have potential drawbacks, especially for those with sensitive digestive systems, so it's best to consume them in moderation as part of an overall healthy eating pattern.""",Matthew Solan,"December 18, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-are-the-stages-of-heart-failure,What are the stages of heart failure?,"Heart failure is a progressive condition, meaning that it can worsen over time. But it also can improve after treatment. Understanding what stage of heart failure you are in can help your doctor better select effective treatment.
        What is congestive heart failure?
        Heart failure (HF), which used to be termed congestive heart failure, is a chronic medical condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood effectively to meet the body's needs. As a result, the body may not get the oxygen it needs for optimal functioning.
        Contrary to its name, heart failure does not mean that the heart has completely stopped working.
        Heart failure is often the end stage of another form of heart disease. Its many causes include:
        
          coronary artery disease
          high blood pressure (hypertension)
          heart valve disorders (including rheumatic heart disease)
          congenital heart disorders
          cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle)
          heart attack
          cardiac arrhythmias (problems with heart rate and/or heart rhythm)
          exposure to toxins, including excessive alcohol.
        
        What are the four stages of heart failure?
        Heart failure is often classified into stages that measure a person's overall heart function and severity of symptoms. These symptoms include:
        
          shortness of breath, with exertion or when lying flat in bed
          swelling in the ankles (edema)
          fatigue.

        Classification based on ejection fraction
        A third way to classify heart failure is based on the ejection fraction, which measures the strength and functioning of the heart muscle.
        Ejection fraction is the fraction (expressed as a percentage) of the blood that your heart ""ejects"" out to the rest of your body each time it contracts. For example, an ejection fraction of 60% means that each time your heart beats, 60% of the blood in the main pumping chamber (the left ventricle) is squeezed out by the heart muscle contracting.
        A normal ejection fraction is about 50% to 70%. An ejection fraction between around 40% and 50% is considered borderline low. Sometimes, this reflects heart muscle that was weaker but is now recovering. Other times, a slow decline in heart muscle function is to blame. Anything below 40% means the heart is struggling to provide sufficient blood to the body.
        If someone has symptoms of HF but a normal ejection fraction, this is called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). If the ejection fraction is less than 40%, this is called heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). And if the ejection fraction is in the middle (40% to 49%), this is called heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF).

        Why is it important for patients to know what stage of heart failure they have?
        The staging systems help your doctor determine the appropriate treatment and management strategy, based on how your heart is functioning and the severity of your symptoms at any given time. This, in turn, can help you understand why your doctor is prescribing a particular treatment, which symptoms are important to share with your doctor, and how your condition might progress.
        Heart failure treatment focuses on
        
          reducing symptoms
          decreasing hospitalizations
          improving life expectancy.
        
        Based on your stage of heart failure, your doctor will work with you to develop an ongoing treatment plan that may include lifestyle changes, medications, devices, or surgical procedures.
        Many recent advances in heart failure treatment can improve ejection fraction and functional limitations caused by the condition. Speak to your doctor about what class and type of heart failure you have to help ensure you are getting the most effective treatment.",Jenette Restivo,"December 14, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/5-stages-of-grief-coping-with-the-loss-of-a-loved-one,5 stages of grief: Coping with the loss of a loved one,"Grief is an unfortunate but inevitable part of life. Whether due to the death of a loved one (this type of grief is referred to as bereavement), losing a job, or any other significant life change, grief is the universal response to dealing with loss.

What are the five stages of grief? We describe each, and how to find support through the grieving process.

What are the 5 stages of grief?

Although everyone copes with loss in different ways, there are five commonly defined stages of grief. The stages were first described by Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in her book On Death and Dying. They help provide a framework for the complex thoughts, behaviors, and emotions that are often experienced with the loss of a loved one.

While these stages should not be thought of as resolute — not everyone experiences these stages in the same way or in the same order, if at all — understanding them can help you make sense of the emotions you may be feeling.

Denial

Denial refers to the period of grieving during which a person refuses to accept the reality of a situation. Denial is different than not understanding. It is a defense mechanism that helps us protect ourselves from the shock of the upsetting hardship. A period of denial can be normal and even helpful during the grieving process, as we work to process a difficult situation. Examples of denial include:


	refusing to accept or acknowledge the death
	refusing or avoiding the topic in conversation
	stating the loss is not true, or that the source of the news is unreliable.


Anger

Once a person comes to understand the information they received, and accepts the reality of a death, they often experience anger. Anger can be a natural response directed toward oneself, family members, doctors, God, or even the deceased. Anger is a normal part of the grieving process, though it may seem hurtful or offensive to loved ones. Often, anger is just a manifestation of grief, and can present itself in various ways. For example:


	blaming a medical doctor for not preventing an illness
	blaming family members for a lack of care or support
	feeling anger toward God or a higher spiritual power
	feeling angry with oneself or blaming oneself for the death
	experiencing a short temper or loss of patience.


Bargaining

When we experience grief, we often feel hopeless and overwhelmed. It is common to be overcome by statements of ""what if"" and ""if only,"" as we experience a loss of control over what is happening. During the bargaining stage of grief, a person attempts to negotiate or make compromises. We try to make agreements with ourselves, or a deal with a higher power, in exchange for feeling less sad or having a different outcome. Bargaining is often irrational. Examples of bargaining include:


	""If only I had brought her to the doctor sooner, this would have been cured.""
	""If only I had been around more, I would have noticed something was wrong.""
	""God, if you bring him back, I promise I will never lie again.""


Depression

Depression is a feeling of sadness and hopelessness that often results with the loss of a loved one. While the earlier stages of grief help to protect us from the emotional pain experienced with loss, often these feelings are inevitable. Symptoms of depression include:


	feelings of sadness
	loss of interest in activities you normally enjoy
	changes in sleep
	significant changes in weight
	lack of energy
	feeling agitated or restless
	feeling worthless or guilty
	decreased concentration.


Feelings of depression are a natural reaction to grief. Following the loss of a loved one, acute grief can impact your functioning for a limited time. Bereavement can lead to prolonged grief disorder if these feelings persist and continue to cause significant impairment and distress in your life for more than a year. Prolonged grief disorder is a diagnosable medical condition and can become disabling if not managed appropriately.

Acceptance

Considered the fifth and last of Kübler-Ross's stages, acceptance refers to the period of grief when we finally come to terms with accepting the reality of our loss. When we have reached this stage of acceptance, we no longer deny or struggle against our grief. During this time, we work to focus our energy on celebrating the life of our loved one, cherish the memories that were shared, and make plans for moving forward.

Finding support

It is important to remember that the grieving process is different for everyone. Grief is not ""one size fits all."" Learning how to deal with grief is crucial for your physical and mental health. Grief can cause changes in many aspects of your daily life, including:


	appetite
	sleep habits
	mood
	energy levels
	health problems, such as increased blood pressure.


Although grief does not generally require treatment, finding a support system can help you better manage your grief. For some people, confiding in others can help lessen the burden of emotions you are experiencing. The goal is to prevent the unhealthy consequences of grief from causing serious damage to your health and well-being. You may find support in people or groups such as:


	family and close friends
	grief counselors or therapists
	grief support groups
	religious or spiritual leaders
	your doctor.


Information on bereavement support services including support groups can often be found on your local community or state government websites.

Other examples of things you can do to help cope after the loss of a loved one include:


	Develop a daily routine. Adhering to a healthy diet, exercise routine, and sleep schedule can help you focus on the things you can control.
	Celebrate the life of your loved one. Consider taking steps to honor the memory of your loved one who has passed in a way that is meaningful to you. This could be anything from collecting photos, to sharing stories, to establishing a memorial.
	Work on finding joy. Allowing yourself to experience joy during difficult times can help improve your mental state and provide long-lasting health benefits.
	Learn about different ways to process grief. Books such as On Grief & Grieving or I Wasn't Ready to Say Goodbye can help.


If you are feeling overwhelmed by your grief or are in immediate crisis, there are grief crisis hotlines you can contact 24/7 to receive help and resources:

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/foods-you-should-eat-to-help-fight-inflammation,Foods you should eat to help fight inflammation,"We typically think of inflammation as a result of an injury or disease. But diet also plays an important role in chronic inflammation.  
        This is in part because the foods we eat influence the types of bacteria that populate our gut and their chemical byproducts. While some foods encourage the growth of bacteria that stimulate inflammation, others promote the growth of bacteria that help suppress it. That's why it's important to know which foods have anti-inflammatory properties and which can cause inflammation
        
          Foods that fight inflammation
        
        
          Fruits and vegetables. Most fruits and brightly colored vegetables naturally contain high levels of antioxidants and polyphenols. Polyphenols are potentially protective compounds found in plants. Studies have shown that polyphenols have multiple anti-inflammatory properties and may improve the function of cells that line blood vessels. Foods high in polyphenols include onions, turmeric, red grapes, cherries, and plums, as well as dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, and collard greens.
        
        
          Nuts and seeds. Studies have found that consuming nuts and seeds is associated with reduced markers of inflammation and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
          Some oils and fatty fish.  Olive oil, flaxseed oil, and fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel offer healthy doses of omega-3 fatty acids, which have long been shown to reduce inflammation.
          Coffee, cocoa and green tea. The polyphenols in coffee and the flavanols in cocoa are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea is also rich in both polyphenols and antioxidants.
        
        
          Foods that can fuel inflammation
        
        The foods that contribute to inflammation are the same ones generally considered bad for other aspects of health. These include:
        
          
            Sugary sodas 
          
          
            Refined carbohydrates (like white bread and pasta)
          
          
            Red meat and processed meats
          
          Processed foods. Certain components or ingredients used in processed foods such as the emulsifiers added to ice cream, may have effects on inflammation.
        
        Such foods are also likely to contribute to weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for inflammation..
        
          The key to reducing inflammation with diet
        
        To practice anti-inflammatory eating, it's best to focus on an overall healthy diet rather than singling out individual ""good"" and ""bad"" foods. In general, a healthy diet means one that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils, and limits food loaded with simple sugars (like soda and candy), beverages that contain high-fructose corn syrup (like juice drinks and sports drinks), and refined carbohydrates.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-more-fiber-in-your-diet,How to get more fiber in your diet,"Diverticulosis is a very common colon condition in which small pouches form on the colon wall. Most people who have diverticulosis have no symptoms, However, sometimes one of the pouches gets inflamed, usually due to a bacterial infection. 
        To reduce your risk of getting diverticulosis and diverticulitis, add high-fiber foods to each meal. Aim for up to half your plate to contain some fiber-rich food.
        Here are some tips that can help you make the transition to a higher-fiber diet.
        
          Eat a minimum of three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit every day. This makes up the five-a-day recommended by the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In general, one serving is a single piece of fruit or a half-cup of raw fruits or vegetables, or a cup of leafy greens.
          Include fruits, vegetables, or both with every meal. For instance, include fruit with breakfast and as a snack, and vegetables with lunch and dinner.
          Eat pulses (the seeds of plants in the legume family), such as beans, lentils, and peas, at least three times a week. You can include them either as a plant-based protein in meatless dishes, or as the starch side in place of grains. For example, you could have fish on a bed of lentils rather than rice.
          Rely on nuts, seeds, and fruit for snacks. Or add them to other items like yogurt, oatmeal, salads, and stir-fries.
          Replace refined grains like white rice with whole grains like brown rice, wild rice, or bulgur. For pasta, look for versions made from quinoa or pulses like chickpeas and lentils.
          Check nutrition fact labels for the amount of dietary fiber. Aim for at least 5 grams of fiber per serving.
        
        Be careful about eating a lot of fiber at once. Overdoing it can cause gas, bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps as your gut bacteria try to process all the new fiber. These problems go away after a while as your digestive system gets used to the higher fiber levels, but you can avoid them by adding extra fiber gradually to your diet. 
        For example, try to add just one more serving of a high-fiber food to your daily diet for a week, then see how your body feels. Give yourself another week, if needed. If everything is okay, add another daily serving for a week. Continue this pattern until you reach your daily quota of fiber.
        Also, make sure to drink plenty of fluids each day—about 16 ounces of water, four times a day. Increasing the water you drink can help fiber pass through your digestive system and avoid stomach distress.
        To learn how to halt the distress of  diverticulitis, read Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis, an online guide from Harvard Medical School.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/create-a-plan-to-relieve-your-back-pain,Create a plan to relieve your back pain,"Back pain is one of the most common painful conditions, affecting four in five Americans at some point in their lives. While the cause is rarely life-threatening, the pain and stiffness can be debilitating. 
The good news is that a wide variety of options exist for managing persistent or recurrent back pain. The scientific evidence for different treatments is not always cut-and-dried, but there are things you can do to get the best results. Here are four things to keep in mind:
        
          Get the most accurate diagnosis possible of the type of back disorder you suffer from. An accurate diagnosis allows you to choose the treatment options appropriate for your specific back problem.
          Seek the advice of an experienced, certified, and well-recommended health professional who understands your type of back problem.
          Be an active participant in your care. Shared decision making in health care means fully understanding the risks and benefits of the various treatments you are considering for your particular problem and any alternative treatments available.
          Don't be afraid to ask for a second opinion if your clinician recommends an invasive, experimental, or very expensive treatment. Doctors generally welcome your full participation in health care decisions and should support your request for a second opinion if you feel hesitant about a particular option.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/try-this-progressive-muscle-relaxation-for-sleep,Try this: Progressive muscle relaxation for sleep,"For some people with insomnia, a racing or worried mind is the enemy of sleep. In others, physical tension is to blame. One way to quiet a racing mind or relax a tense body is a technique called progressive muscle relaxation. It involves gradually tensing and relaxing your muscles, beginning with your feet and working your way up your body. Try this when you have trouble falling asleep:
        
          Lie on your back in bed in a comfortable position. Put a pillow under your head or your knees to relax your back. Rest your arms with palms up, slightly apart from your body.
          Take several slow, deep breaths through your nose. Exhale with a long sigh to release tension.
          Focus on your toes and feet. Curl your toes and arch your feet. Hold this movement briefly to feel the sensation. Relax your muscles and let your feet sink into the bed. Feel them getting heavy and becoming totally relaxed.
          While breathing softly, move your attention slowly up your body, tensing then relaxing each area: calves, thighs, buttocks, lower back, abdomen, upper back, shoulders, arms, hands, neck, jaw, and forehead. Relax any remaining tense spots.
          If thoughts distract you, ignore them and gently return your attention to your breathing.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/eating-for-heart-health,Eating for heart health,"As the saying goes, you are what you eat, and that's especially true when it comes to heart health. Dietary choices can influence your weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar levels — all factors that can determine your risk for heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.
        So when it comes to diet and heart health, what foods should you eat more of, less of, or not at all? Here's what a Harvard nutritionist and cardiologist suggest.
        Eat less: Saturated fat
        Saturated fat is found primarily in meats, such as beef, pork, and deli meat; dairy foods like milk, butter, cream, and cheese; and tropical oils like coconut oil and palm oil. High amounts of saturated fat also are found in many fast, processed, and baked foods like frozen pizza, desserts, hamburgers, and packaged sweets.
        The main health issue with saturated fat is its impact on cholesterol levels. ""Consuming high amounts of saturated fat produces more 'bad' LDL cholesterol, which can form plaque in the arteries that blocks blood flow and increases your risk for heart attack and stroke,"" says registered dietitian Marc O'Meara, an outpatient senior nutrition counselor at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Eat more: Healthy fats
        ""Besides avoiding saturated fat, you should increase your intake of healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat,"" says O'Meara. These ""good"" fats help lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.
        Sources of monounsaturated fats are olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, and most nuts. There are two main types of polyunsaturated fats: omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. Sources of omega-3s include fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines; flaxseeds; walnuts; and soybean oil. Many vegetable oils — such as soybean, sunflower, walnut, and corn oils — are rich in omega-6s.
        ""For heart health, it's important to focus on eating omega-3 fats several times a week, since they are in limited foods,"" says O'Meara. ""Omega-6 fats are easier to get as they are in a wider array of foods.""
        
          
            
              
                Follow the 80/20 rule
                It's not realistic to refrain from all problem foods. It's fine to occasionally eat chips while watching the game, treat yourself to dessert, and dine out with friends. To ensure you consistently follow an overall heart-healthy diet, while allowing yourself to live a little, adopt the 80/20 rule: eat healthy 80% of the time, and save 20% of your meals and snack for fun foods. ""This eliminates the stress of having to eat perfectly every day,"" says registered dietitian Marc O'Meara with Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Weekends count, so don't pile all your fun foods into a couple days. Instead, sprinkle them throughout the week for the best chance at weight control.""
              
            
          
        
        Eat less: Refined sugar
        Refined sugar is what's added to food products to improve taste (which is why it's also known as ""added"" sugar). Refined sugar comes from cane, sugar beets, and corn, which are processed to isolate the sugar.
        Refined sugar has several indirect connections with heart health. Consuming too much refined sugar contributes to weight gain, the leading cause of fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes, both of which are closely linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Excess added sugar may also play a role in elevating blood pressure and stimulating chronic inflammation, two other factors related to heart disease.
        The top food sources of refined sugar include soft drinks, energy drinks, fruit-flavored drinks, flavored yogurts, cereals, cookies, and cakes. But refined sugar is also found in many other processed foods, such as canned soups, cured meats, and ketchup.
        Guidelines recommend men consume no more than 36 grams (about 9 teaspoons' worth) of refined sugar per day, about equal to what's in a 12-ounce can of soda. ""The best way to control your intake of added sugar is to read food labels,"" says O'Meara. ""To get an accurate amount, multiple the grams of sugar on the label by the total number of servings.""
        Eat more: Plant-based foods
        Science has provided strong evidence of the heart-healthy benefits of plant-based diets like the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets.
        ""These diets have consistently shown they help manage the main markers of heart disease: cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar,"" says Dr. Ron Blankstein, a cardiologist with Brigham and Women's Hospital's Heart and Vascular Center.
        Both diets emphasize high amounts of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fatty fish, legumes, and nuts; olive oil as the principal source of fat; and minimal amounts of red meat, dairy, and alcohol. (While whole fruits and vegetables are ideal, low-sodium canned vegetables and frozen fruits and vegetables without added sauces and cream are just as nutritious.)
        ""These diets offer nutrients your heart requires, like healthy mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and antioxidants that help fight inflammation,"" says Dr. Blankstein.
        Perhaps best of all, following a plant-based diet also can steer you away from unhealthy eating habits.
        ""If you're eating more of these plant-based foods, that means you're eating less of processed and high-sugar foods,"" says Dr. Blankstein. ""And always remember that it's never too late to begin paying more attention to your diet. Don't wait for some heart-related event to change how you eat.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/can-weight-loss-slow-prostate-cancer,Can weight loss slow prostate cancer?,"You've had a biopsy and have been diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer, defined as a tumor that is confined to the prostate gland and unlikely to grow or spread. You decide to follow active surveillance, a protocol in which you regularly follow up with your doctor for routine PSA tests, prostate biopsies, and possibly MRI scans. If at some point it looks like the cancer has progressed, then you can consider treatment (radiation or surgery).
        For some men, this wait-and-see period lasts for years. But can you do anything to help slow your cancer's growth and delay treatment for as long as possible? Your bathroom scale might give you the answer.
        How monitoring works
        The reality is that most low-grade prostate cancer does not transform over time and become more aggressive, according to Dr. Mark Pomerantz, a medical oncologist with Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
        ""Being on active surveillance is more about looking out for cancer that the original biopsy missed,"" he says. ""It's not necessarily that the original low-grade cancer becomes more aggressive — although that is possible in some cases — but rather, high- or medium-grade cancer is hiding and we're looking for changes in PSA levels that might suggest it's there and become aggressive.""
        About 45% to 60% of men on active surveillance will not need cancer treatment over the 10 to 15 years following their initial diagnosis, according to Dr. Pomerantz. While those are encouraging figures, they still leave the chance you may need treatment sooner.
        Controlling factors
        You can't control two factors that can increase the risk of undetected high- or medium-grade cancer from becoming aggressive: genetics and family history. But one aspect you may be able to change is your weight.
        ""While excess weight doesn't appear to increase the likelihood of low-grade prostate cancer, there appears to be a strong association between being overweight or obese and the risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. People with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are considered overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 or higher are classified as obese.
        Scientists reported in the Aug. 15, 2019, issue of Cancer that over a 10-year period, men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose waist size and BMI increased the most had greater risks of advanced and fatal prostate cancer compared with men who maintained a healthy weight.
        Specifically, a five-point increase in BMI was associated with a 50% higher risk for advanced or fatal prostate cancer, and a 4.1-inch increase in waist size was associated with a 40% higher risk. Where that extra fat lies also is a driving a factor. The same study discovered that extra visceral fat (the hidden kind that lies deep in the abdomen and surrounds the major organs) was linked with a 31% higher risk of developing advanced prostate cancer.
        Your past weight gain also may play a role in future cancer growth, suggests research presented at the European Congress on Obesity in May 2023. Researchers found that men who gained an average of 2.2 pounds each year from ages 17 to 29 increased their risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer later in life by 13%.
        ""So losing excess weight may be one way to possibly keep prostate cancer from growing more rapidly,"" says Dr. Pomerantz.
        The weight connection
        Experts don't fully understand the relationship between excess fat and prostate cancer growth. Some theories suggest that extra weight leads to higher levels of inflammation, which in turn acts like fuel to prostate cancer cells. Overweight and obese men also are more likely to have higher levels of blood sugar, which stimulates the pancreas to release more insulin. Some studies have shown a link between higher insulin levels and an increased risk of prostate cancer. ""This could be another factor raising the chance of more aggressive cancer,"" says Dr. Pomerantz.
        While weight loss and weight management are never easy, Dr. Pomerantz says many men on active surveillance often embrace the situation as an opportunity to make overall health changes.
        ""Increasing exercise and adopting a healthy, plant-based diet, both of which can help men lose extra pounds, not only can help with their prostate cancer, but can reduce their risk of heart disease and other cancers,"" he says. ""Most men on active surveillance will die of something other than prostate cancer, so this can be a wake-up call for men to get serious about their health.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/managing-back-pain,Managing back pain,"At some point, almost everyone tweaks their back. It could be from lifting groceries, picking something up off the floor, or even sneezing too hard. Such an injury produces what doctors call acute back pain, meaning it's a temporary setback and will go away in time as the injury heals. For a while, though, the pain can range from annoying to debilitating.
        ""Most often, acute back pain happens because of weak muscles related to aging and inactivity,"" says Dr. Christopher Bono, professor of orthopedic surgery at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""This makes muscles more susceptible to stress overload and strains.""
        Red flags
        Most episodes of acute back pain will resolve on their own with home remedies. However, sometimes symptoms are related to a more serious problem, such as a spinal fracture, infection, nerve damage, or a tumor. Situations that require immediate medical evaluation of back pain include
        
          severe or incapacitating pain
          fever with back pain
          recent significant trauma (such as a fall or car accident)
          numbness or weakness in your feet or legs
          a history of cancer.
        
        Road to recovery
        In more typical cases related to just muscle strain and spasm, symptoms usually last a few days, but pain and stiffness sometimes linger for a couple of weeks or longer.
        Frequent episodes, however, can discourage people from staying active. ""They are fearful about straining their back, so they may avoid exercise or participating in daily life activities,"" says Dr. Bono.
        Managing acute back pain is a two-step approach. First, treat the pain to speed up recovery. Then strengthen the back muscles and improve flexibility to prevent future episodes.
        Common treatments for acute back pain include oral or topical over-the-counter pain medications, cold or heat applications, and limited rest.
        Medications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often the go-to remedies for back pain. They include ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve). NSAIDs help reduce pain and — in higher doses — calm inflammation. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is also a pain reliever, but it is not an NSAID and does not help with inflammation. Some people find topical agents applied to the skin over the most painful area helpful. Examples include those that contain lidocaine or capsaicin.
        Cold and heat therapies. It's best to use cold compresses or an ice pack — not heat — immediately following a back strain. This can alleviate pain by numbing the area and preventing or reducing swelling. About 24 hours after the onset of back pain, though, consider switching to a heating pad or a hot water bottle. The warmth soothes and relaxes aching muscles and increases blood flow, which helps the healing process.
        Rest. Bed rest can be helpful relief from back pain, mainly if your pain is so severe that it hurts to sit or stand. But try to limit it to a few hours at a time and for no more than one or two days.
        
          
            
              
                Give your back a lift
                Lifting exercises strengthen leg and back muscles and teach the proper way to lift — with your legs instead of your back. Here's a movement you can try to practice safe lifting.
                
                  Place a lightweight dumbbell on the floor in front of you.
                  Stand so your feet are wider apart than your shoulders and are pointed outward at a 45° angle, similar to a sumo wrestler pose.
                  With your eyes forward, chest up, and heels planted, push your hips and buttocks back and lower into a squat.
                  Keeping your back straight, lower your torso as far as is comfortable or until your thighs are parallel to the floor.
                  At the bottom of the squat, pick up the dumbbell, press down with your heels, and return to standing.
                  Place the dumbbell on the floor again and repeat the sequence five to 10 times.
                
              
            
          
        
        A healthier back
        Once back pain subsides, Dr. Bono recommends strengthening key muscles that support the back and improving spinal flexibility. ""This can help you lift and twist more confidently and lower the risk of straining a muscle.""
        He suggests core-strengthening exercises like planks and side planks, forward bends (where you sit or stand and reach toward your toes), and back stretches (like the ""cat-cow"" yoga pose).
        ""Also, don't forget to keep moving during the day, as prolonged sitting contributes to weak core and back muscles,"" says Dr. Bono. ""Set a timer on your phone to get up and move around every hour. Go for a walk, do some stretches, or get a drink of water.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/stress-at-work-takes-a-toll-on-the-heart,Stress at work takes a toll on the heart,"Men who report specific types of job-related stress face a higher risk of heart disease than those without such stress, according to a new study.
        Researchers followed more than 6,500 white-collar workers for 18 years and identified two job-related conditions linked to higher cardiovascular risks. One was job strain, defined as high demands (such as having a heavy workload and tight deadlines) coupled with low control (for example, having little say in decision making). The other, called effort-reward imbalance, occurs when a person's effort is high but their salary, recognition, or job security are low.
        Compared with people who didn't experience work stress, men who reported either of those stressors had a 49% higher risk of heart disease. But their risk doubled if they reported both types. Among women, the results were inconclusive, which the authors say might reflect the fact that women tend to develop heart disease later in life than men. The men were also more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure, and other factors that raise heart disease risk. The study was published online Sept. 19, 2023, by Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.

        The fast-acting drug, zuranolone (Zurzuvae), received approval on Aug. 4, 2023, and is taken for just two weeks. The only other medication approved specifically for postpartum depression is brexanolone (Zulresso), which requires a hospital-based intravenous infusion. Like other forms of depression, postpartum depression includes symptoms such as intense sadness, lethargy, loss of interest in everyday activities, and thinking and memory problems. In severe cases, women may have thoughts of harming themselves or their child.
        The pill's introduction should reduce the stigma of postpartum depression, encouraging more women to seek help, according to the FDA.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/weekend-warriors-can-lower-cardiovascular-risks-too,"""Weekend warriors"" can lower cardiovascular risks, too","Even ""weekend warriors"" can lower their cardiovascular risks with concentrated workouts only one or two days a week, a new analysis suggests.
        The Harvard-led study, published online July 18, 2023, by JAMA, analyzed data from nearly 90,000 adults (average age 62, 56% women) who wore accelerometers on their wrists for one week to track physical activity. Researchers compared three patterns of moderate-to-vigorous exercise among the participants: 42% exercised in a ""weekend warrior"" pattern, concentrating at least 2.5 hours of activity into one or two days; about one-quarter spread their exercise over all seven days; and one-third were considered inactive, exercising less than 2.5 hours during the week. Compared with the inactive participants, both of the other groups had similar, and significantly lower, rates of cardiovascular problems such as atrial fibrillation, heart attack, stroke, and heart failure over the following six years.
        Current guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity weekly to promote health. In light of the findings, study authors said, the amount of movement people get matters more than the pattern in which they exercise.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-does-the-flu-cause-body-aches,Why does the flu cause body aches?,"Q.
           I recently had the flu and was struck by how achy I felt. Why does the flu act that way?
        
        A. It's all about the inflammation that influenza triggers in the body. Flu symptoms run the gamut from fever, sore throat, and headache to fatigue and weakness, but muscle and joint aches are at the heart of the misery — and they're caused by inflammation.
        How? Like any infection, the flu jolts the immune system to fight off invading germs. While that happens, white blood cells travel throughout the body, producing antibodies to attack the virus. This combat generates inflammation, leading you to feel sick and — ironically — serving as proof your body is fighting off the infection.
        Time and rest will help you as you recover. But you can also ease aches from the flu by staying hydrated with plenty of water, broth, and other liquids; taking warm showers; and using over-the-counter NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve). Getting the flu vaccine is another way to reduce flu aches, because people who get the virus despite immunization typically have milder cases than unvaccinated people.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/blasting-through-mental-health-misperceptions,Blasting through mental health misperceptions,"For all its downsides, the pandemic helped us to do a better job of openly discussing mental health. But that doesn't mean everyone is up to speed on how strikingly common mental illness is — or immune to stubborn stereotypes that label people struggling with mental health challenges as somehow defective.
        An estimated 58 million American adults — more than one in five — live with a mental illness such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, among others. And more women than men receive treatment such as medication or counseling for such an issue, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
        But despite its pervasiveness, mental illness remains largely stigmatized, says Dr. Arthur Barsky, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        ""It still has that implication, I think, that it's somehow a failure of one's inner resources — a weakness,"" Dr. Barsky says. ""Those with mental illness aren't viewed as winners on top of their game.""
        Damaging effects
        Perhaps predictably, such stigma can prove quite damaging to people who cope with mental health problems, affecting their morale and even their recovery. Feeling labeled and marginalized by their condition can worsen people's depression or anxiety — for instance, by pushing them toward substance abuse or promoting secrecy or social withdrawal.
        ""It's got to worsen the underlying disorder, because you're feeling blamed for it,"" Dr. Barsky says. ""Unfortunately, you may buy in to this thinking to some degree, thinking if you were stronger, you could beat this. I think the stigma changes your view of yourself and also creates more isolation.""
        Changing minds
        Fortunately, scientific advances are helping to dismantle long-held attitudes about mental illness. ""One thing turning the tide is brain imaging that clearly shows structural changes to the brain in people with certain mental disorders,"" Dr. Barsky says. ""That's probably eroded some of the stigma.""
        For example, more people now understand that someone with depression can't ""snap out of it"" any more than someone with liver disease, heart failure, or another physical ailment can simply decide not to have that condition.
        ""More recently, there's also some acknowledgment of anxiety disorders as being valid illnesses rather than part of the imagination,"" he says. ""The pandemic accelerated that, but the trend has been to legitimize the fact that psychiatric illnesses are not a personal failing.""
        Turning the tide
        If you deal with mental health challenges, Dr. Barsky suggests these strategies to help blast through any lingering stigma.
        Embrace treatment. Don't let labels stop you from getting the treatment you need, whether it's therapy, medication, or both. (See ""Tips to get the most out of therapy."") ""While they're not miracle cures, we've got a repertoire of effective treatments,"" Dr. Barsky says. ""Don't suffer needlessly.""
        Don't believe you are your illness. Remember that your condition is a separate entity. For example, say ""I have bipolar disorder,"" instead of ""I'm bipolar.""
        Don't take offhand comments personally.Even well-meaning people say the wrong things occasionally, while others are careless or cutting with words. ""Think about why someone would say that and what it says about them rather than about you,"" Dr. Barsky says.
        Share your story, if inclined.When you hear false or misleading information, you can help set the record straight by choosing to reveal details about your situation. ""It can be terribly hard to do, but it's very beneficial,"" Dr. Barsky says. ""It can take a tremendous load off your mind.""
        
          
            
              
                Tips to get the most out of therapy
                Embarking on therapy to tackle mental health troubles can feel like a leap of faith. But if you do it reluctantly, you're probably not poised to get the most out of the process, says Dr. Arthur Barsky, a psychiatrist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
                ""People often resist getting help initially,"" Dr. Barsky says. ""Some also have an inherent impulse to try to solve their problems themselves— to not ask for help or concede they're up against a problem they can't solve on their own.""
                Once you commit to therapy, however, you can maximize the results—and promote your own healing—by taking several key steps.
                Choose your therapist carefully. Don't settle for someone who's merely convenient to your home or office; rather, look for a counselor who specializes in your particular problem. Once you meet her, get a sense of your mutual comfort and rapport. ""Think about whether this person is someone you can spend time with and trust,"" Dr. Barsky says.
                Treat therapy as teamwork. ""Initially, you'll have to lead the show,"" he says. ""But over time, as the therapist understands you and your situation, she's going to provide more insight and guidance and offer suggestions about how to tackle the problem. It's a collaboration, and it's not a cookie-cutter approach.""
                Be vulnerable. You can't benefit from therapy unless you're willing to fully open up about your experiences and feelings. And while it may be uncomfortable, you have to be willing to talk about things you'd often rather not discuss. ""You need to share stuff that may be embarrassing, painful, or depressing,"" Dr. Barsky says. ""Your therapist can't help you until she knows exactly what you're struggling with.""
                Take any prescribed medications. ""It's pretty obvious, but if your therapist thinks you need medicine and you agree, then you need to take your pills,"" he says. ""But don't agree and then go home and not take them."" Many times, there are choices among medications. Ask about side effects, risks, and benefits, and work with your clinician to make the best choice.
                Define success. Setting goals with your therapist will suggest a framework to move forward. But keep in mind that therapy often isn't a linear process, where you explain a problem and promptly discover a solution. Instead, you'll construct thought patterns and behaviors that lead to healthier ways of living. ""It's important to be able to think through where you'd like to be at the end of the therapeutic process and ask if the therapist thinks that's feasible or likely,"" Dr. Barsky says.
                Be patient. Depending on your issue, effective therapy can take months or even years. ""You can't expect you're going to walk out after a few sessions and the problem will disappear,"" Dr. Barsky says. ""It may be a long process, but that doesn't mean it's not helpful.""

Turmeric contains the naturally occurring chemical curcumin, which might have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. And now a small randomized trial has found that taking curcumin supplements (derived from turmeric) helps reduce symptoms of functional dyspepsia — recurring, unexplained stomach pain, bloating, or early feelings of fullness. Scientists randomly assigned 206 people (ages 18 to 70) with functional dyspepsia to one of three treatments: taking 500 milligrams (mg) of curcumin (two 250-mg capsules) four times a day, taking 20 mg of the medication omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid) once a day, or taking both treatments each day. After about a month of treatment, people in all three groups said their dyspepsia symptoms had improved. The results were even better after two months. The findings suggest that curcumin supplements are as effective at relieving dyspepsia symptoms as omeprazole (which curbs stomach acid), and that curcumin is safe and well tolerated. The study was published online Sept. 11, 2023, by BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/holiday-joy-can-bring-painful-joint-inflammation,Holiday joy can bring painful joint inflammation,"Holidays and indulgence often go together, and there's probably not much harm if you partake conservatively in rich meals or an occasional cocktail to toast the season.
        Too much indulgence is another story, however, especially if you're at risk for gout — a condition that can cause recurrent attacks of inflammation in the joints of the big toe, feet, ankles, knees, wrists, or hands. And the holidays set the perfect table for a gout attack.
        ""The holiday connection isn't well studied, but since the days of ancient Rome, it's been observed that drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and feasting on foods high in natural compounds called purines trigger gout in some people,"" says Dr. Robert Shmerling, a rheumatologist and medical editor of the Harvard Special Health Report Fighting Inflammation (/ui).

                A new gout risk factor?
                A Harvard study published in September 2023 in Arthritis and Rheumatology suggests that measuring a particular molecule might help predict whether people are at risk for gout or recurrent gout attacks.
                High levels of uric acid in the body have long been considered a primary cause of gout. However, researchers found that high levels of glycoprotein acetyls — a known marker of inflammation — were present in the blood samples of people in the months or years before their first gout attacks. People with lower glycoprotein acetyl levels developed gout less frequently. The glycoprotein acetyl levels also predicted which study participants would have recurrent gout flares.
                New treatments that target glycoprotein acetyls may one day prevent attacks of gout.
              
            
          
        
        The gout-purine connection
        Purines are essential building blocks of DNA. They're found in all of your cells and in many foods and drinks. As the body processes purines, it creates a byproduct called uric acid, which winds up in the blood. If you make a little extra uric acid, the kidneys remove it and send it out of the body (in urine). If you make a lot of extra uric acid, or if your kidneys don't remove it sufficiently, it builds up in the blood and can form needle-shaped crystals.
        The crystals sometimes settle in the joints, causing swelling, stiffness, and severe pain — and that's gout. An attack comes on suddenly, and having one attack increases the risk for having more.
        Purine-rich foods
        Just like in Roman times, eating a purine-rich diet today contributes to gout. Examples of purine-rich foods include red meats, (particularly game meats), organ meats, legumes, seafood, and some poultry.
        On a holiday buffet, that might be roast beef, brisket, lamb or pork chops, veal, chicken liver, or turkey. It could be codfish, trout, haddock, or a dish with anchovies, scallops, oysters, mussels, lobster, shrimp, or crab. Or it might be something simple, such as bean dip, lentil soup, or peanuts.

Some alcoholic drinks (especially beer) contain purines, and all alcoholic drinks can reduce the ability of the kidneys to remove uric acid from the blood. High-fructose corn syrup — the sweetener in soda, fruit punch, some fruit juices, ice cream, and many packaged baked goods (like cookies and cakes) — also contains purines.
        Beyond purine risks
        A purine-rich diet isn't the only gout risk factor. Whether it's the holidays or any day of the year, these factors raise the odds of developing gout:
        
          being a middle-aged or older man (although women can also develop gout, typically after menopause)
          having a family history of gout
          having heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, or kidney problems
          taking diuretics
          being dehydrated.
        
        New thinking on diet
        You could shun every food and drink high in purines, but Dr. Shmerling says that's an outdated approach. ""Just stick to a plant-based diet, and limit purine-rich foods and drinks, even during the holidays. Don't deprive yourself — enjoy holiday foods. Just don't overdo it, and don't have them often,"" he says. ""And drink alcohol only in moderation.""
        Dr. Shmerling also advises that you work to reduce other gout risk factors by losing excess weight, controlling blood pressure, addressing heart and kidney problems, and staying hydrated (to help the kidneys filter uric acid from your blood).

    Living Well with Osteoarthritis: A guide to relieving the pain and caring for your joints


                
                    This report focuses primarily on osteoarthritis — the most common type of arthritis — which affects 27 million Americans. Many people believe it’s a crippling and inevitable part of growing old. But things are changing. Treatments are better, and plenty of people age well without much arthritis. If you have osteoarthritis, you can take steps to protect your joints, reduce discomfort, and improve mobility — all of which are detailed in this Special Health Report, Living Well with Osteoarthritis: A guide to keeping your joints healthy. If you don't have osteoarthritis, the report offers strategies for preventing it.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cpap-machines-and-masks-which-ones-are-right-for-you,CPAP machines and masks: Which ones are right for you?,"Your doctor says you need continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to treat your sleep apnea, and you're eager to begin treatment. You're also a little worried, since you've heard that using a CPAP system can be uncomfortable and challenging. How do you choose a system that will give you the best odds of success? Here are some tips to help.
        Understand the treatment
        CPAP is the first-line treatment for people with obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder marked by repeated pauses in breathing caused by a blocked airway.
        The CPAP system's job is to keep your airway open. It does that by pushing a forceful stream of air through a tube and into a mask you wear while you sleep. The air comes from a small bedside pump (an air compressor).
        Other forms of positive airway pressure (PAP) may be helpful for people with central sleep apnea, although pauses in breathing in this type of sleep apnea are related to garbled messages from the brain, not blockages (see ""What is sleep apnea?"").
        
          
            
              
                What is sleep apnea?
                Sleep apnea is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. The pauses last at least 10 seconds, lead to poor-quality sleep, and put a strain on your body. Untreated sleep apnea may increase your risk for high blood pressure or stroke.
                In obstructive sleep apnea, pauses in breathing occur when the airway briefly becomes blocked. This can be caused by too much tissue in the airway (often due to excess weight), large tonsils, or a large tongue.
                In central sleep apnea, pauses in breathing occur when the brain fails to deliver electrical impulses to the muscles that help you breathe.
              
            
          
        
        Trust your doctor
        Your physician will determine what kind of CPAP device you need. ""The device and its settings are by prescription, just like a medication,"" says Dr. Noah Siegel, director of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Surgery at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        With CPAP, a single fixed air pressure is used throughout the night. Other types of PAP therapies include
        
          auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP), which provides a range of preset pressures throughout the night
          bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), which provides two different preset pressures — a more powerful one when you inhale and a less powerful one when you exhale
          adaptive servo ventilation (ASV), an advanced device that provides pressure based on breathing patterns throughout the night.
        
        ""Generally speaking, people with obstructive sleep apnea respond better to CPAP or APAP. People with central sleep apnea may respond better to BiPAP or ASV,"" Dr. Siegel says.
        Investigate face mask options
        You get to choose the face mask for your PAP system, and it's an important decision.
        Face masks often feel bulky, making people reluctant to wear them. Dr. Siegel recommends looking at mask options online and trying on a few before making a selection. That might happen at a medical supply store or during a home visit from your medical equipment supplier.
        The masks fall into two categories.
        Full-face masks. These cover the nose and mouth and deliver air to them both. They are ideal for someone who breathes through the mouth or has nasal or sinus problems.
        Nasal masks. These masks deliver air through the nose only. They are less bulky than full-face masks and come in styles that fit over, under, or in the nose.
        An important consideration for both mask types, Dr. Siegel says, is the site where the tube from the pump enters the mask. ""Traditional-style masks connect the tubing in the front of the mask, near the nose. That's not great for people who roll over a lot in bed or people who are claustrophobic,"" he says. ""Newer styles attach at the top of the mask. It's much less intrusive.""
        Give it time
        Adjusting to any PAP system takes time. You may need to try a few masks to find the right fit and comfort. ""And if allergies or frequent sinus congestion keep you from using a nasal mask, we have interventions — such as nasal sprays or surgery — that might make a nasal mask more tolerable,"" Dr. Siegel says. Also, your doctor may need to make adjustments to your machine, such as changes to settings for pressure and humidification.
        Just stick with it, and remember that using a PAP system, like taking a medication, is an ongoing therapy that needs regular evaluation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/when-will-we-see-a-one-and-done-flu-shot,"When will we see a ""one-and-done"" flu shot?","Q.
          Why can't we get just one flu shot that protects us for a lifetime?
        
        A. Many scientists are working to develop improved influenza (flu) vaccines. Our current vaccines are imperfect, but they still protect us.
        The flu is much more serious than the common cold: globally, 300,000 to 500,000 people die from the flu each year — most of them unvaccinated. In the worst flu pandemic, 50 million to 100 million people died. Our current, imperfect flu vaccines saved 40,000 lives in the United States alone between 2004 and 2014. Imperfect protection is much better than no protection.
        The perfect flu vaccine would protect against all different strains of the flu virus. A virus has a shape, with different parts. The parts of the virus that traditional vaccines attack are constantly changing, generating new strains. That's why a new flu shot is needed each year. Fortunately, scientists are finally having some success building vaccines that attack the parts of the virus that don't change — the ""conserved"" parts. A vaccine that targeted the conserved parts could theoretically protect against all strains of the flu virus, past and future.
        A perfect vaccine also would prevent any symptoms. Our current flu vaccines don't guarantee you won't get the flu, but they do lessen symptom severity and are quite good at preventing hospitalization and death. One reason they are only partially effective is that with current technologies it takes at least six months to manufacture the vaccine. That means scientists must decide each winter which strains of the virus will be circulating eight to 10 months later when the next flu season begins. Unfortunately, sometimes the virus fools us: the strains that are circulating in the winter are replaced by other strains before the next flu season arrives. Scientists are working on new types of vaccines that can be produced much more quickly, such as the extremely successful mRNA vaccines developed for COVID-19.
        Finally, a perfect flu shot also would offer protection for a lifetime. A special kind of mRNA vaccine is in development that would cause the body to keep attacking the virus for a long time, if not a lifetime.
        Although the COVID pandemic led to a greater investment in vaccines against the flu and other viruses, in my opinion the investment still is not great enough, given the potential return from investing in vaccines. For example, in the United States alone, by early 2023 COVID vaccines had prevented 19 million hospitalizations and over three million deaths, saving the economy $1.2 trillion. It cost only a small fraction of that to develop the vaccines.
        Will we ever see a perfect flu vaccine? Probably not in my lifetime or yours. But we almost surely will see improved, less imperfect, vaccines. And, to repeat myself, imperfect protection is very much better than no protection.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/climbing-stairs-linked-to-lower-risk-of-heart-disease,Climbing stairs linked to lower risk of heart disease,"People who climb more than five flights of stairs daily may have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, new research finds.
        The study, which included nearly 460,000 adults, relied on data about their stair climbing habits and other lifestyle behaviors, which researchers collected at the start of the study and five years later. Researchers later tallied up the number of heart attacks, strokes, and related cardiovascular problems participants had during the follow-up period, which lasted a median of 12.5 years.
        Compared with people who said they didn't climb any stairs, those who reported climbing five flights of stairs daily — about 50 steps — were about 20% less likely to experience a heart-related problem or stroke. According to the study authors, stair climbing is a minimal-equipment, low-cost way to lower cardiovascular risk that's easy to add to a person's daily routine. The study was published online Sept. 16, 2023, by the journal Atherosclerosis.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/living-with-heart-disease-avoid-unnecessary-testing,Living with heart disease? Avoid unnecessary testing,"Medical tests are an important part of managing chronic health problems such as cardiovascular disease. Some, like checking blood pressure or cholesterol levels, are fairly simple and straightforward. But others (especially those that use special equipment to visualize the heart) are time-consuming, stressful, and costly — and in some cases, unnecessary.
        It's not uncommon for people with known chronic coronary disease (see ""What is chronic coronary disease?"") to undergo such imaging tests on a routine basis, even when they don't have any symptoms to suggest that their condition is progressing or worsening. Now, new guidelines recommend against this practice.
        
          
            
              
                What is chronic coronary disease?
                People are said to have chronic coronary disease if they
                
                  have had a heart attack or stable angina (chest pain that occurs with activity or emotional stress)
                  have had a procedure to restore blood flow to the heart (angioplasty with a stent or coronary artery bypass surgery)
                  have a low ejection fraction from coronary blockages
                  show evidence of coronary artery disease on an imaging test.
                
              
            
          
        
        ""People with established coronary disease who don't have symptoms shouldn't be undergoing tests on a periodic basis,"" says Dr. Dhruv Kazi, who directs the Cardiac Critical Care Unit at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital. The guidelines, published Aug. 29, 2023, in the journal Circulation, say that for those people, there is no benefit for the following three tests:
        Cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) uses a CT scanner to take multiple, high-speed x-rays to create three-dimensional views of the blood vessels and other heart structures. It requires an injection of special dye into a vein in the arm or hand that ""lights up"" the blood vessels.
        Echocardiography uses ultrasound to show how well the heart's muscles and valves are working and to measure the ejection fraction, an assessment of the heart's pumping ability.
        Stress testing monitors your blood pressure, your heart rate, and your heart's electrical activity to check for evidence of decreased blood flow to the heart, either during exercise or after an injection of a drug that mimics the effects of exercise. It may also involve getting an echocardiogram (a variation called stress echocardiography) or an injection of a small amount of a radioactive substance and a PET scan (a variation known as a nuclear stress test).
        No help, possible harm
        When people without symptoms get testing ""just to be sure,"" the results are unhelpful — and in some cases harmful, says Dr. Kazi, who was on the writing committee for the new guidelines. For example, if test results aren't clear, that often generates additional testing or unnecessary procedures, including some that expose people to radiation for no reason. These tests add expense without any corresponding benefit, and the costs are increasingly being passed back to patients, in the form of copayments or higher premiums, he adds.
        For people with chronic coronary disease, the real bang for the buck lies elsewhere, says Dr. Kazi. ""As the guidelines emphasize, people should focus on getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and taking medications to control their blood pressure and cholesterol — all strategies that we know help people live longer, healthier lives,"" he says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-is-palliative-care-for-heart-failure,What is palliative care for heart failure?,"Thanks to medical advances in recent decades, people with heart disease now live much longer than in the past. As more people survive heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems, the number of people living with heart failure — when the heart struggles to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs — continues to rise. By 2030, nearly one in 12 people ages 65 to 70 will have heart failure, according to one estimate.
        In 2022, leading cardiology organizations published guidelines for managing heart failure. The guidelines include an expanded range of medications that help reduce the need for hospitalization and may also prolong life. They also recommend palliative care for all people with heart failure. Yet only a small percentage receive this type of care.
        To explain what palliative care entails and its role in heart failure, we asked two specialists from the Palliative Care & Geriatric Medicine Division at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital: physician Dr. Julia Gallagher and nurse practitioner Christine McCarthy.
        Understanding palliative care
        Contrary to what many people believe, palliative care is not the same as hospice care. Palliative care can begin as early as the diagnosis of any serious illness. It's provided by a team of physicians, nurses, and other specialists who work collaboratively with the patient's other doctors to provide additional clinical assessments and support. Hospice is reserved for the smaller subset of patients whose illness has progressed to the point where their doctors would not be surprised if they passed away within six months.
        ""The goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life by addressing all the domains of suffering — not just physical symptoms, but also emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual issues,"" says Dr. Gallagher. Even with excellent medical management of heart failure, patients may feel worried, anxious, or depressed because the progression of heart failure is often unpredictable. Identifying and treating anxiety and depression improves quality of life in patients. Equally important is identifying caregiver stress and worry, which allows members of the palliative care team to support that individual along with the patient. Palliative care also includes talking with patients about their personal goals and what matters most to them, which can help guide their care as the illness progresses.
        Preparing for what's next
        Often, people with heart failure feel much better after a brief hospitalization early in the disease, and may recover to their prior level of function, says McCarthy. ""But there is no cure for most cases of heart failure. Instead, there's usually a progressive decline, with repeated hospitalizations, which is rarely talked about,"" she says. Being more transparent about the unpredictable trajectory of heart failure can help people understand what lies ahead and how to plan for the uncertainty.
        When symptoms suddenly worsen again, going to the emergency room and being admitted back into the hospital may seem like the easiest thing to do. However, it may be possible to manage the situation at home. For some people, receiving hospital-level care at home may be an option (see ""Hospital at home: A movement whose time has come"" in the May 2023 Heart Letter). There are many advantages to home-based care, including avoiding infections and spending more time with family.
        Clarity about possible complications
        A palliative care approach helps people understand the benefits and risks of different tests and therapies, including receiving implanted cardiac devices. ""As an example, what does it really mean to be at risk for bleeding or a blood clot? We explain what might happen, ranging from needing frequent blood draws to possible serious complications, such as a stroke that could leave them unable to communicate,"" says McCarthy.
        ""We focus on you as an individual and how you're feeling, treating your symptoms, helping to maximize your medical management, and working toward making every day as good as possible,"" says Dr. Gallagher.
        You can request palliative care, which is covered by Medicare and most health insurance, at any point along the trajectory of a serious illness. For people with heart failure, a palliative care consultation is available during a hospitalization. It's also provided through some outpatient clinics as well as home-based palliative care programs, says Dr. Gallagher.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-i-improve-my-ejection-fraction,Can I improve my ejection fraction?,"Q.
           I'm a 69-year-old man. Seven years ago, I had a heart attack and received a stent. After some recent chest discomfort, I underwent a nuclear stress test, which fortunately showed no evidence of blockages. However, the report said that my ejection fraction was 49%, which I understand is just below what's considered normal. Is there anything I can do to increase my ejection fraction?
        
        A. Ejection fraction is the fraction (expressed as a percentage) of the blood that your heart ""ejects"" out to the rest of your body each time it contracts. A healthy heart pumps out about half to two-thirds of the blood from its lower left chamber, the left ventricle. So a normal ejection fraction ranges from 50% to 70%.
        An ejection fraction below 40% means the heart is struggling to provide sufficient blood to the body, which is known as heart failure. Values between 40% and 50% are considered borderline low and may be a sign of future heart failure risk. Because your ejection fraction falls just below what's considered normal, it might be a sign of a mild problem. However, a nuclear stress test has limited views, and there can be some variability in the results. Another option is to consider an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound), which is the standard test used to measure ejection fraction.
        If the echo confirms that your ejection fraction is slightly lower than normal, your doctor will want to investigate the cause. The findings from your nuclear stress test rule out a blood flow problem, but there are several other possibilities. Causes of low ejection fraction include cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle with varied causes, such as a viral infection or a genetic disorder. Chronic high blood pressure can also decrease ejection fraction. So can the strain caused by a leaky or narrowed heart valve. An abnormally fast heart rate for a long period of time — such as from uncontrolled atrial fibrillation — can also weaken the heart.
        If you're diagnosed with early heart failure, the good news is that exercise can help, including both aerobic exercise and strength training. Larger, more efficient muscles in the legs and arms can better extract oxygen from circulating blood, which appears to help compensate for the heart's decreased pumping power. If you're not already exercising regularly, however, be sure to check with your doctor first.
        In addition, many medications, including beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor blockers, can improve or stabilize the ejection fraction. Increasingly, doctors strive to get all people who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (a common type of heart failure) on what's known as the ""four pillars"" of therapy, which consist of drugs in four different classes that help in different ways.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/several-factors-may-cause-testosterone-levels-to-drop,Several factors may cause testosterone levels to drop,"Testosterone levels tend to slowly decline in middle-aged men, and often fall faster after age 70.
        In an analysis of 11 studies involving about 25,000 men in total, researchers looked at the possible factors for this more rapid decline in testosterone levels later in life.
        They found that having a body mass index higher than 27 and engaging in less than 75 minutes of weekly vigorous activity were each linked to lower testosterone levels. Other contributing factors were having ever smoked and health issues like high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Low testosterone levels can contribute to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and reduced sex drive.
        While the findings only showed an association, the researchers stressed the need for older men to continue engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors and managing chronic health issues, which could help maintain their body's testosterone production. Men also should address these areas before considering hormone therapy for low testosterone. The results appeared in the September 2023 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/statins-types-uses-side-effects-and-alternatives,"Statins: Types, uses, side effects, and alternatives","If your doctor wants you to take a statin for high cholesterol, you're not alone. More than 40 million Americans take them, too. In fact, statins are the most prescribed drugs in the U.S.
        But you may have questions. You may be wondering about side effects of statins, types of statins, how statins work, and what your doctor may prescribe instead of statins to help lower your cholesterol.
        What are statins?
        Statins are prescription drugs you take as pills to lower cholesterol. Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes. However, when you have too much, it can build up inside the walls of your arteries. This is called plaque. Cholesterol-laden plaque contributes to heart disease in different ways.
        A buildup of cholesterol can make your arteries narrow and even block them. If a cholesterol plaque ruptures, a blood clot forms there and this can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Cholesterol also provokes inflammation in the arteries, which can contribute to the formation of artery-blocking clots.
        Sometimes, just changing what you eat and being more active can lower cholesterol. But if your cholesterol stays high, you may need a statin or other cholesterol-lowering medication.
        How do statins work?
        Statins interfere with how your liver makes cholesterol; most importantly, LDL, the ""bad"" kind. Triglycerides are a second kind of cholesterol that can contribute to plaque buildup. HDL has traditionally been referred to as the ""good"" cholesterol because it helps your body get rid of LDL. However, changing HDL has not been seen to reduce the risk of heart disease, so this is no longer a focus of cholesterol management.
        Statins work to lower LDL levels. This slows the buildup of cholesterol in your arteries.
        Statins also reduce inflammation in artery walls. If you do have plaque buildup inside your arteries, statins can help prevent them from breaking open and leading to blood clots.
        Once you start taking a statin (or any cholesterol lowering drug), you probably will stay on it for life. If you stop, your protection from the statin will wear off.
        Who might benefit from statins?
        You may benefit from statins if you
        
          have high LDL cholesterol levels
          have had a heart attack or stroke, or are at risk for having one
          have diabetes (a risk factor for heart disease) and are over age 40.
        
        Statins may help you live a longer and healthier life. But the degree to which you may benefit can vary. Your doctor can tell you about your personal risk and how much benefit to expect.
        People who are pregnant or who have liver disease should not take statins.
        What types of statins are available?
        Eight statins are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA):
        
          atorvastatin (Lipitor)
          fluvastatin (Lescol)
          lovastatin (Mevacor)
          lovatstatin extended release (Altoprev)
          pitavastatin (Livalo)
          pravastatin (Pravachol)
          rosuvastatin (Crestor)
          simvastatin (Zocor).
        
        Your doctor picks which statin may work best for you by considering a few things. They include how much you need to lower your LDL by, and other medicines you are taking. Sometimes people will have a side effect with one statin but are able to tolerate another one.
        What are possible side effects of statins?
        More than three decades of research have shown that statins are safe and effective. But like all drugs, statins can have side effects.
        The most common side effects of statins are muscle aches and feeling tired. Other side effects that aren't as common are headaches, constipation, diarrhea, and sleep problems.
        A 2022 study published in The Lancet reviewed the records of over 150,000 people in randomized trials of statins, and analyzed those who had muscle aches after taking statins or placebo. The study found that more than 90% of those symptoms were not related to the statins. The researchers concluded that the risks of muscle problems are low compared to the health benefits of statins.
        How can I manage side effects of statins?
        Muscle soreness is the main reason why people want to stop using statins. Studies have evaluated many therapies for resolving statin muscle aches, including vitamin D, and coenzyme Q10, but have not found compelling evidence that any of them are effective.
        In many cases, side effects will go away as your body gets used to the statin. If they don't, your doctor may suggest switching to a different statin or taking a lower dose, and sometimes taking the low dose every other day, for example.
        What alternatives to statins might my doctor prescribe?
        Some people just can't tolerate the side effects of statins. Others still have high cholesterol even after taking statins for a while.
        Fortunately, there are different drugs to try and other ways to lower cholesterol.
        Non-statin drugs
        There are many classes of drugs to help lower cholesterol. These include ezetimibe (Zetia), bempedoic acid (Nexletol), and bile acid sequestrants, which have been seen to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke.
        Ezetimibe reduces the amount of cholesterol your body absorbs from food (or reabsorbs from what the liver releases). Large, randomized studies did not find any difference in side effects of ezetimibe compared with placebo.
        Bempedoic acid blocks the production of cholesterol in your liver, but the medication does not get into muscle cells, so it can be an effective option for people who have had problems with statins. It can be taken alone but is usually taken with other cholesterol-lowering medications. Side effects include gout (especially in those with a history of gout), mild worsening of creatinine (a measure of kidney function), and gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis).
        Bile acid sequestrants stop bile acid in your stomach from getting absorbed in your blood. Your liver then takes the cholesterol from your blood to make the bile acid it needs. Side effects include constipation, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, and muscle pain.
        PCSK9 inhibitors
        PCSK9 inhibitors are a newer type of cholesterol drug. These medicines are for people who have an inherited condition that causes very high levels of LDL. They also are for people with heart disease whose cholesterol has not been sufficiently lowered with a maximum dose of statins.
        PCSK9 inhibitors work by helping the liver remove cholesterol from the blood. PCSK9 is a naturally occurring protein that breaks down certain receptors in the liver that remove LDL from the blood as it passes through the liver. By reducing the number of these receptors, PCSK9 increases the level of LDL in the blood. By hampering PCSK9's ability to work, PCSK9 inhibitors allow more LDL receptors to remain active in the liver. With more receptors to sweep away LDL, a person's blood levels of LDL drop. These drugs are given by injection and are more expensive than statin pills. Side effects include flulike symptoms and pain from the injection.
        Nondrug ways to lower cholesterol
        Some people can lower their cholesterol without medicine by making lifestyle changes. Those changes include having a healthy diet. The DASH diet from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is one example.
        The DASH diet emphasizes fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish and poultry, beans, nuts, and low-fat dairy products. It limits sugary drinks, sweets, and foods high in saturated fat, like fatty meats and full-fat dairy products.
        If you are overweight, losing weight may lower your LDL. Having a healthy diet can help with that, too.
        Another way to lower cholesterol is through regular physical activity. Aim for 30 minutes each day. Other things to try include managing stress and quitting smoking. Both of those have an effect on cholesterol.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","November 29, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/8-secrets-to-a-good-nights-sleep,8 secrets to a good night's sleep,"After a night spent tossing and turning, you wake up feeling like a couple of the Seven Dwarves: sleepy… and grumpy. Restless nights and weary mornings can become more frequent as we get older and our sleep patterns change.
        Later in life there tends to be a decrease in the number of hours slept. There are also some changes in the way the body regulates circadian rhythms. This internal clock helps your body respond to changes in light and dark. When it undergoes a shift with age, it can be harder to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night.
        We all have trouble sleeping from time to time, but when insomnia persists day after day, it can become a real problem. Beyond making us tired and moody, a lack of sleep can have serious effects on our health, increasing our propensity for obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.
        If you've been having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, you may have turned to sleep medications in search of more restful slumber. However, these drugs can have side effects, including appetite changes, dizziness, drowsiness, abdominal discomfort, dry mouth, headaches, and strange dreams.
        You don't need to avoid sleep aids if you absolutely need them, but before you turn to pills, try these eight tips to help you get a better night's sleep.
        1. Exercise
        Going for a brisk daily walk won't just trim you down, it will also keep you up less often at night. Exercise boosts the effect of natural sleep hormones such as melatonin. Just watch the timing of your workouts. Exercising too close to bedtime can be stimulating. Morning workouts that expose you to bright daylight will help the natural circadian rhythm.
        2. Reserve bed for sleep and sex
        Don't use your bed as an office for answering phone calls, texting, and responding to emails. Also, avoid watching late-night TV there. The bed needs to be a stimulus for sleeping, not for wakefulness. Reserve your bed for sleep and sex.
        3. Keep it comfortable
        Television and your smartphone aren't the only possible distractions in your bedroom. Ambience can affect your sleep quality too. Make sure your bedroom is as comfortable as possible. Ideally you want a quiet, dark, cool environment. All of these things promote sleep onset.
        4. Start a sleep ritual
        When you were a child and your mother read you a story and tucked you into bed every night, this comforting ritual helped lull you to sleep. Even in adulthood, a set of bedtime rituals can have a similar effect. Rituals help signal the body and mind that it's coming to be time for sleep. Drink a glass of warm milk. Take a bath. Or listen to calming music to unwind before bed.
        5. Eat — but not too much
        A grumbling stomach can be distracting enough to keep you awake, but so can an overly full belly. Avoid eating a big meal within two to three hours of bedtime. If you're hungry right before bed, eat a small, healthy snack (such as an apple with a slice of cheese or a few whole-wheat crackers) to satisfy you until breakfast.
        6. Avoid alcohol and caffeine
        If you do have a snack before bed, wine and chocolate shouldn't be part of it. Chocolate contains caffeine, which is a stimulant. Surprisingly, alcohol has a similar effect. It makes you a little sleepy, but it's actually a stimulant and it disrupts sleep during the night. Also, stay away from anything acidic (such as citrus fruits and juices) or spicy, which can give you heartburn.
        7. De-stress
        The bills are piling up and your to-do list is a mile long. Daytime worries can bubble to the surface at night. Stress is a stimulus. It activates the fight-or-flight hormones that work against sleep. Give yourself time to wind down before bed. Learning some form of the relaxation response can promote good sleep and can also reduce daytime anxiety. To relax, try deep breathing exercises. Inhale slowly and deeply, and then exhale.
        8. Get checked
        An urge to move your legs, snoring, and a burning pain in your stomach, chest, or throat are symptoms of three common sleep disrupters — restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, and gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD. If these symptoms are keeping you up at night or making you sleepy during the day, see your doctor for an evaluation.
        
          
            
              
                Taking sleep medicines safely
                If you've tried lifestyle changes and they aren't working, your doctor may prescribe hypnotic sleep medications. These drugs can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer, but they also can have side effects. Here are some tips for ensuring that you're taking these medicines as safely as possible:
                
                  Tell your doctor about all other medicines you're taking. Some drugs can interact with sleep medications.
                  Take only the lowest possible effective dose, for the shortest possible period of time.
                  Carefully follow your doctor's instructions. Make sure you take the right dose at the right time of day (which is typically just before bed).
                  Call your doctor right away if you experience any side effects, such as excess sleepiness during the day or dizziness.
                  While you're taking the sleep medicine, also practice the good sleep habits outlined in this article.
                  Avoid drinking alcohol and driving while taking sleep aids.
                  Sleep medications may make you walk unsteadily if you get out of bed in a drowsy state. If you routinely have to get out of bed during the night to urinate, be sure the path to your bathroom is clear of obstacles or loose rugs so you don't fall.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/stomach-troubles-with-no-clear-cause-heres-what-you-can-do,Stomach troubles with no clear cause: Here's what you can do,"Your stomach doesn't feel well. It's not heartburn, but you feel bloated, full, and nauseous.
        The discomfort started during a meal, or maybe a half an hour later. When this happens commonly, you should seek medical evaluation. Your doctor will make sure there are no worrisome symptoms or signs, and then likely diagnose you with functional dyspepsia. This is a type of chronic indigestion, or a stomachache and full feeling during and after meals.
        While most often there is no single medical solution to functional dyspepsia, different approaches might work. Here are some to try out: 
        Eat Right
        
          Avoid foods that trigger symptoms. Common culprits are caffeine, chocolate, alcohol, and spicy, acidic, or fatty foods.
          Eat smaller, more frequent meals so your stomach does not distend and can empty quickly.
          Chew your food slowly and completely.
          Avoid activities that result in swallowing excess air, such eating quickly, chewing gum, drinking carbonated beverages, and smoking.
          Avoid lying down within two hours of eating.
          Keep your weight under control.
        
        Reduce Stress
        
          Use stress reduction techniques, including relaxation therapies.
          Exercise. In addition to being good for your overall health, it's a proven stress reducer.
          Try cognitive behavioral therapy.
        
        Reduce Fatigue
        
          Get enough rest.
          Try to go to bed and get up at the same times each day.
          Avoid caffeine after noon.
        
        Exercise
        
          Perform aerobic exercise three to five times a week for 20 to 40 minutes per session.
          Don't exercise immediately after eating.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/do-children-get-migraine-headaches-what-parents-need-to-know-202311062988,Do children get migraine headaches? What parents need to know,"Headaches are very common in children and teens. In fact, more than half will suffer from headaches at some point, and by 18 years the majority of adolescents have had them. And while most headaches are part of a viral illness, some are migraines. In fact, recurring migraines affect as many as one in 10 children and teens overall.  
        What should you know — and do — if you think your child or teen may be having migraines?
        How early do migraines start to occur?
        We don't tend to think about migraines in children, but by age 10, one in 20 children has had a migraine. And migraines sometimes occur even earlier.
        Before puberty, boys and girls are equally likely to have them. After puberty, migraines are more common in girls.
        Which migraine symptoms are most common in children?
        Migraines are often one-sided in adults. In children they are more likely to be felt on both sides of the head, either in both temples or both sides of the forehead.
        While it's not always easy to tell a migraine from another kind of headache, children
        
          often report throbbing pain
          may experience nausea and sensitivity to light and noise.
        
        The flashing lights and other vision changes people often see as a migraine begins are less common in children. However, parents may notice that their child is more tired, irritable, or pale before a migraine begins — and takes a while to get back to normal after it ends.
        What causes migraines in children?
        We don't know exactly what causes migraines. We used to think it had to do with blood flow to the brain, but that does not seem to be the case. It appears that migraines are caused by the nerves being more sensitive, and more reactive to stimulation. That stimulation could be stress, fatigue, hunger, almost anything.
        Migraines run in families. In fact, most migraine sufferers have someone in the family who gets migraines too.
        Can migraines be prevented?
        The best way to prevent migraines is to identify and avoid triggers. The triggers are different in each person, which is why it's a good idea to keep a headache diary.
        When your child gets a headache, write down what was happening before the headache, how badly it hurt and where, what helped, and anything else about it you can think of. This helps you and your doctor see patterns that can help you understand your child's particular triggers.
        It's a good idea to make sure your child gets enough sleep, eats regularly and healthfully, drinks water regularly, gets exercise, and manages stress. Doing this not only helps prevent migraines, but is also good for overall health!
        How can you help your child ease a migraine?
        When a migraine strikes, sometimes just lying down in a dark, quiet room with a cool cloth on the forehead is enough. If it's not, ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be helpful; your doctor can tell you the best dose for your child.
        It's important not to give your child these medications more than about 14 days a month, as giving them more often can lead to rebound headaches and make everything worse!
        Are there prescription medicines that can help children with migraines?
        If those approaches aren't enough, a class of medications called triptans can be helpful in stopping migraines in children ages 6 and up.
        If a child experiences frequent or severe migraines, leading to missed days of school or otherwise interfering with life, doctors often use medications to prevent migraines. There are a number of different kinds, and your doctor can advise you on what would be best for your child.
        Some girls get migraines around the time of their period. If that happens frequently, sometimes taking a prevention medicine around the time of menses each month can be helpful.
        When to contact your doctor
        If you think your child might be having migraines, you should call and make an appointment. Bring the headache diary with you. Your doctor will ask a bunch of questions, do a physical examination, and make a diagnosis. Together you can come up with the best plan for your child.
        You should always call your doctor, or go to an emergency room, if your child has a severe headache, a stiff neck, trouble with coordination or movement, is abnormally sleepy, or isn't talking or behaving normally.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/plantar-fasciitis-symptoms-causes-and-treatments,"Plantar fasciitis: Symptoms, causes, and treatments","What is plantar fasciitis?
        Plantar fasciitis is a common and often painful foot condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The vast majority of people who experience plantar fasciitis are active adults between the ages of 25 and 65 years old.
        Plantar fasciitis occurs when the plantar fascia, a fibrous band of tissue on the bottom of the foot that helps to support the arch, is overloaded or overstretched. With overuse or over time, the fascia loses some of its elasticity or resilience and can become inflamed, resulting in pain.
        What are the symptoms of plantar fasciitis?
        Plantar fasciitis symptoms can develop gradually over time or, in some cases, develop suddenly after engaging in intense physical activity. Recognizing symptoms is essential for early intervention and proper management.
        It's important to keep in mind that the severity and duration of symptoms can vary from person to person. The most common symptoms of plantar fasciitis include:
        
          Pain on the bottom of the foot, near the heel. This is the most prevalent and telltale sign of plantar fasciitis. This pain can be a dull ache or a sharp, stabbing sensation. The arch along the bottom of the foot may also ache or burn.
          Severe heel or foot discomfort after getting out of bed in the morning, or after extended periods of rest. This pain tends to subside after a few minutes of walking.
          Heel or foot pain that tends to worsen after physical activity but is not typically experienced during exercise. Climbing stairs can be particularly painful.
          Tenderness when touching the affected area, especially near the heel.
          Stiffness in the foot is common, particularly upon waking up or after prolonged periods of sitting. This stiffness can make it difficult to walk comfortably.
        
        What causes plantar fasciitis?
        Plantar fasciitis occurs when the thick band of tissue on the bottom of your foot (the fascia) becomes overstretched or experiences excessive strain caused by repetitive stress from activities like standing or running. It can also occur if there is a significant weight gain, including during pregnancy.
        This constant stretching and strain of the plantar fascia can lead to chronic degeneration, or the development of small tears in the fascia fibers, particularly where the fascia connects to the heel bone. In addition to tears, ultrasound evaluations often show calcifications, and thickening of the plantar fascia.
        Certain risk factors can make you more susceptible to plantar fasciitis:
        
          foot arch problems (both flat feet and high arches)
          long-distance or downhill running on uneven surfaces
          excess weight
          a tight Achilles tendon
          shoes with inadequate arch support or soft soles
          abrupt changes in activity levels.
        
        Plantar fasciitis diagnosis
        If you suspect you have plantar fasciitis or are experiencing persistent foot pain, you should see your doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Early intervention and appropriate management can help alleviate symptoms and improve your quality of life.
        Your doctor will examine your foot, looking for the following signs or risk factors of plantar fasciitis:
        
          an area of maximum tenderness on the bottom of your foot, just in front of your heel bone
          a high arch or flat foot (a risk factor)
          limited dorsiflexion, or ""up"" motion, in your ankle
          the absence of symptoms from other foot conditions that may share similar symptoms with plantar fasciitis, such as insertional Achilles tendinitis, calcaneal (heel) stress fracture, or plantar nerve entrapment.
        
        In addition to a physical exam of your foot, your doctor may consider obtaining x-rays or ultrasound evaluation if your history or physical exam indicates other injuries or conditions such as heel spurs, fractures, or arthritis. Additionally, ultrasound may show thickening and swelling of the plantar fascia, which is a typical feature of the condition.
        Your doctor may also consider ordering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound if your pain is not relieved by initial treatment methods, or if your doctor is concerned that a different problem is causing your pain.
        How to treat plantar fasciitis
        The vast majority of patients with plantar fasciitis improve within nine to 12 months of starting nonsurgical treatment methods.
        The common treatments for plantar fasciitis typically include:
        
          Rest. Taking a break from the activities that aggravate the pain is usually the first step in treatment. A rest period will give the plantar fascia time to heal. During this rest time, you may try low-impact exercise such as cycling or swimming, or activities that put less stress on your feet than walking or running.
          Ice. Applying ice to the affected area can help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. You may try rolling your foot over a cold water bottle or applying an ice pack to the sore area. Ice should be applied for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, especially after activities that trigger pain.
          Stretching. Plantar fasciitis is aggravated by tight muscles in your feet and calves. Specific stretching exercises can help lengthen these muscles, reducing tension on the plantar fascia.
          Night splints. Night splints are devices worn while sleeping that stretch the plantar fascia. This prevents the plantar fascia from tightening overnight, reducing morning pain and stiffness. Although it can be difficult to get used to, a night splint can be effective at reducing heel pain from plantar fasciitis.
          Supportive shoes. You should wear shoes with good support and cushioning to avoid plantar fasciitis pain. Avoid shoes that do not provide support or are worn out. If your pain persists, your doctor may recommend custom-made shoe inserts (orthotics).
          Physical therapy. Your doctor may recommend that you work with a physical therapist on an exercise program that focuses on stretching your calf muscles and plantar fascia. A physical therapy program may also involve specialized ice treatments, massage, and other therapies to decrease inflammation around the plantar fascia.
          Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, can reduce pain and inflammation. NSAIDS should be used under the guidance of a health care provider and for a limited duration to avoid potential side effects.
        
        If the pain does not respond to the above treatments, your doctor may recommend:
        
          A walking boot and crutches. Used for a short period of time, these will allow your foot to rest.
          Corticosteroid injections. In cases of severe pain and inflammation that do not respond to other conservative treatments, corticosteroid injections may be recommended. These injections can provide short-term relief. However, your doctor may limit this treatment or avoid it because steroid injections can weaken the plantar fascia and lead to a rupture (tear), which can lead to flattening of the foot and chronic pain.
          Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT). ESWT is a noninvasive procedure that uses high-energy shockwaves to promote healing in plantar fascia tissue. However, the therapy does not work for everyone. And some studies have shown no benefit of ESWT for plantar fasciitis.
          Botulinum toxin (as in Botox and other brands). This treatment uses a protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. In plantar fasciitis treatment, botulinum toxin injections help relax the tissues in and around the plantar fascia, relieving pain.
          Dry needling. In this technique, a sterile, thin needle is inserted into the skin to stimulate a myofascial trigger point. Though dry needling is a common treatment for plantar fasciitis, its effectiveness is controversial. One meta-analysis found ""low-quality evidence"" that dry needling reduces pain intensity in the short term.
          Laser therapy. Your doctor may use low-level laser therapy to reduce pain and inflammation associated with plantar fasciitis. One review of studies found that low-light laser therapy may relieve plantar fasciitis-associated heel pain for up to three months.
          Foot surgery. Though nonsurgical treatments almost always improve plantar fasciitis pain, surgery may be needed in some cases where improvement has not been seen.
        
        Surgery for plantar fasciitis
        As more than 90% of patients with plantar fasciitis recover with nonsurgical treatment, surgery is generally the last resort.
        Most patients experience good results with surgery. However, surgery carries risks and can result in chronic pain and dissatisfaction.
        Surgical procedures for plantar fasciitis include:
        
          Gastrocnemius recession. In this surgical procedure, a small incision is made on the inside of the calf (gastrocnemius), and the calf muscles are lengthened using a special instrument. The surgery increases ankle flexibility, releasing tension on the plantar fascia. Gastrocnemius recession can result in nerve damage and calf weakness, but the risk is low.
          Partial plantar fascia release. A partial plantar fascia release involves making an incision on the bottom or side of the heel to relieve tension in the tissue. The most common complications of release surgery include nerve damage.
        
        What are the best shoes for plantar fasciitis?
        Choosing the right shoes is crucial if you have plantar fasciitis. Proper footwear can significantly reduce the risk of developing or exacerbating the condition.
        These are some key features to look for in shoes if you have plantar fasciitis:
        
          Arch support. Proper arch support helps distribute pressure evenly across the foot, reducing strain on the plantar fascia.
          Cushioning. Shoes with ample cushioning in the heel and forefoot can help absorb shock and reduce impact on the plantar fascia.
          Heel support. Choose shoes with a firm heel counter (the back part of the shoe that surrounds the heel). As you step and your heel strikes the ground, a large amount of tension is placed on the fascia, which causes microtrauma (tiny tears in the tissue). Soft silicone heel pads are inexpensive and work by elevating and cushioning your heel.
          Shock absorption. Look for shoes with good shock absorption properties, especially in the heel area. Cushioned soles or gel inserts can help with shock absorption.
        
        You may want to consult with a podiatrist or orthopedic specialist who can recommend suitable footwear based on your foot structure and the severity of your plantar fasciitis. In addition, off-the-shelf or custom-fitted arch supports, called orthotics, can help distribute the pressure on your feet more evenly.
        Stretching exercises for plantar fasciitis
        Studies show that plantar fascia–specific stretching can be helpful as part of treatment. One study found that heel pain improved by 52% after eight weeks of stretching the plantar fascia. Keeping your calf muscles flexible is also important for preventing plantar fasciitis.
        You can do these stretches three times a day: morning, midday, and before bed.
        Calf stretch. Lean forward against a wall with one knee straight and your heel on the ground. Place your other leg in front, with the knee bent. Push your hips toward the wall. You should feel a pull in the calf during the stretch. Hold the position for 15 to 30 seconds. Be sure to stretch both legs.
        
          
        
        Plantar fascia stretch. Sit in a chair with one foot on the floor. Raise your other leg and rest the ankle on your knee in a figure 4 position. Grasp the toes of your raised foot with your hand. Gently pull your toes back until you feel a stretch in the sole of your foot. Gently massage the stretched plantar fascia with your other hand. Hold this for 10 seconds. Repeat 10 times on each foot.",Jenette Restivo,"November 3, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/long-lasting-c-diff-infections-a-threat-to-the-gut-202311012987,Long-lasting C. diff infections: A threat to the gut,"If you've ever dealt with diarrhea, you know how quickly it leaves you feeling depleted. Now imagine a case that rages on and on — or comes back again and again.
        This is the reality for nearly 500,000 Americans each year who have the bacterial infection known as Clostridioides difficile, or C. diff. Virulent diarrhea and inflammation of the colon can even turn life-threatening.
        This primer will help you understand how C. diff spreads and releases toxins, what the common symptoms are, and who is most vulnerable. Dr. Jessica Allegretti, director of the fecal microbiota program at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, also touches on promising preventive strategies and treatments.
        How does C. diff spread?
        Like many bacteria, C. diff is present in our stool. It's carried by virtually everyone — on our skin and even on the soles of our shoes. When C. diff bacteria are outside the body, they are inactive spores. They only have a chance to become active when they're swallowed and reach the intestines.
        Even then, many people who swallow C. diff spores never become ill. The spores only sicken people whose gut microbiome — the trillions of organisms living in their intestines — becomes imbalanced for one of the various reasons described below. When an imbalance occurs, the spores start to multiply and create toxins that lead to a C. diff infection.
        ""Many of us are colonized with C. diff bacteria without any consequences,"" says Dr. Allegretti. ""We're swallowing C. diff spores all the time. Only under the right circumstances will the spores germinate and release a toxin. It's the toxin that makes you sick.""
        What are the symptoms of a C. diff infection?
        The symptoms mimic those of many other types of gastrointestinal ailments. Initially, this may make it difficult to tell the infection apart from milder illnesses.
        Symptoms to watch for include
        
          persistent diarrhea lasting three or more days
          nausea
          fever
          stomach pain or tenderness
          appetite loss.
        
        ""C. diff isn't something that people in the general population should be walking around scared of,"" Dr. Allegretti says. ""But if you need to take an antibiotic, be on the lookout for diarrheal symptoms after finishing the course of antibiotics. Diarrhea that's associated with antibiotics alone should resolve once you finish taking the medication.""
        Who is most vulnerable?
        A few sobering facts from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC):
        
          C. diff is the top cause of health care-associated infections in the US.
          It disproportionately strikes people in hospitals and nursing homes.
          Among people over 65, one in 11 of those diagnosed with a health care-associated case of C. diff dies within a month.
        
        However, other groups are also susceptible to the infection. Health care-associated C. diff infections are plateauing, Dr. Allegretti notes, while so-called community-based infections that occur among the general population are increasing.
        People most likely to experience such infections:
        
          Are taking antibiotics or have just finished a course of antibiotic therapy. People are up to 10 times more likely to get C. diff while on antibiotics or during the month afterward, according to the CDC. ""Not everyone who takes an antibiotic gets C. diff, and not everyone who gets C. diff gets recurrent C. diff,"" says Dr. Allegretti. ""It has a lot to do with your host response, your gut microbiome, and your individual risk factors, such as immunosuppression or inflammatory bowel disease.""
          Have a weakened immune system due to cancer, organ transplant, or treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (such as people with inflammatory bowel disease or autoimmune conditions).
          Have close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with C. diff.
        
        What prevention strategies help block the spread of C. diff?
        Hospitals try to prevent C diff. among patients in several ways. They impose scrupulous hand-washing requirements among staff members. Patients who develop new diarrhea are tested for C. diff infection. Those who have it are isolated in their own rooms to help prevent further spread.
        Outside of a hospital, you can help prevent this gut infection through a few commonsense measures.
        
          Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water every time you use the bathroom and always before eating. Clean hands are especially important if you've had C. diff or know you've been exposed to someone with it. By the way, alcohol-based hand sanitizer isn't effective against C. diff because its organisms can form resistant spores.
          Take antibiotics only when strictly necessary and for the shortest period possible. ""The biggest thing we can do is advocate for ourselves,"" Dr. Allegretti says. ""During cold and flu season, we know a lot of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are written for infections that are most likely viral, not bacterial. Antibiotics do not kill viruses — and unnecessary antibiotics may upset the bacterial balance in your gut. Ask your doctor: Do I need this prescription? Is there an alternative?""
          When you do need antibiotics, ask if a narrow-spectrum antibiotic would be effective for your type of infection. Why? Broad-spectrum antibiotics kill a wider array of bacteria. This may be overkill, depleting your gut microbiome unnecessarily and enabling C. diff bacteria to germinate. ""The caveat is, we don't want patients to not take antibiotics they need for an actual infection,"" she says. ""But have a conversation with your health care team.""
        
        The type of antibiotic prescribed also matters, according to a 2023 study in the journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases. Researchers compared more than 159,000 people who had C. diff infection with 797,000 healthy controls. Study findings suggest that using clindamycin and later-generation cephalosporin antibiotics pose the greatest risk for C. diff infection. Meanwhile, the antibiotics minocycline and doxycycline were associated with the lowest risk.
        ""But there are very few safe antibiotics with regard to C. diff risk,"" Dr. Allegretti says.
        Can probiotics help prevent or treat C. diff infection?
        Probiotics are live microorganisms that can help keep the gut healthy and are found in supplements, yogurt, and other fermented foods. Two familiar examples are various strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
        However, probiotics haven't been found to prevent C. diff or its recurrence. Research performed in mice and humans suggests that giving probiotics after a course of antibiotics may slow the pace of microbiome recovery. ""You're potentially delaying the recovery of your microbiome with probiotics,"" she says.
        How is C. diff infection treated?
        Ironically, C. diff therapy typically starts with antibiotics, despite the infection's proliferation due to antibiotic use. The antibiotics of choice include fidaxomicin or oral vancomycin.
        However, about one in five people will suffer one or more recurrences –– and with each one, yet another recurrence becomes far likelier, Dr. Allegretti says. A repeat episode may happen because people haven't disinfected their homes effectively. That leaves them open to reinfection with the same strain of C. diff while still vulnerable.
        When C. diff recurs, fecal microbial transplants (FMT) are considered the gold standard treatment. FMT transplants fecal matter from a healthy donor into a patient's gut, placing it there using an endoscope, enema, or within an oral capsule. This year, the FDA approved two live fecal microbiota products aimed at preventing recurrent C. diff infections.
        ""We haven't gotten away from antibiotics yet to treat this disease,"" says Dr. Allegretti. ""But we have a lot of preventative strategies now. It's certainly very exciting for people struggling with C. diff infections.""",Maureen Salamon,"November 1, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/higher-step-counts-linked-to-lower-risk-of-heart-related-death,Higher step counts linked to lower risk of heart-related death,"The more steps you take, the lower your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, with the benefits starting with as few as 2,300 steps per day, a new analysis suggests.
        Published online Aug. 9, 2023, by the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, the study pooled data from 17 studies from around the world involving nearly 227,000 people in total. Their average age was 64, with nearly equal numbers of men and women.
        The minimum number of daily steps needed to lower the risk of dying from heart disease was just 2,337. But every additional 500 steps per day lowered the risk even more. And researchers noted no upper limit to the benefits, even among people who walked as many as 20,000 steps per day (although few people fell into that category). In addition, the findings were consistent across varied climate zones in countries that included the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/prediabetes-linked-to-higher-risk-of-cardiovascular-problems,Prediabetes linked to higher risk of cardiovascular problems,"Even slightly elevated blood sugar levels — a condition known as prediabetes — may raise the risk of cardiovascular problems, according to new research.
        For the study, researchers looked at the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of 427,435 people from the UK Biobank, a large database of health information in the United Kingdom. HbA1c values represent a person's average blood sugar levels for the previous three months.
        Over a median follow-up period of nearly 12 years, the researchers found that people with prediabetes at the start of the study faced a greater risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure, compared with people whose HbA1c was normal. (In the UK, an HbA1c of 5.9% or less is considered normal, while in the United States, less than 5.7% is normal.)
        As expected, people with diabetes, both undiagnosed and diagnosed, were at even greater risk — especially women. When the researchers accounted for factors such as obesity and use of medications to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, the excess risk from elevated blood sugar was reduced. That means attention to weight loss and greater use of those medications is important to counter overall risk, say the authors, whose findings were published September 2023 in The Lancet Regional Health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/advances-in-managing-hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy,Advances in managing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"About one in 500 people has a condition that affects muscle cells in the heart, causing the walls of the heart to thicken and enlarge (see illustration). Called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), it's often caused by genetic mutations and is the most common inherited form of heart disease, although many people have never heard of it. And among those who are familiar with HCM, misconceptions and unwarranted worry about the condition are common.
        ""Until recently, HCM was feared as the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes,"" says Dr. Carolyn Ho, medical director of the Cardiovascular Genetics Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. However, newer, more comprehensive research involving the general population, college athletes, and military recruits shows that while HCM remains an important underlying cause of sudden cardiac death in otherwise seemingly healthy individuals, it's not the most common one. The exact reasons for these rare but devastating events often remain a mystery, even after an autopsy.
        Additionally, a large observational study published in 2022 in JAMA Cardiology (co-authored by Dr. Ho) suggests that even vigorous exercise appears to be safe for most people with HCM. The study followed 1,660 people with HCM, ages 8 to 60, for three years. While 15% reported being sedentary, 43% said they did moderate exercise and 42% said they did vigorous exercise. During the study period, 1.5% of those who reported exercising vigorously died or had a severe cardiac event — the same percentage as among those who described themselves as sedentary or who reported doing moderate exercise. ""This study provides important evidence to encourage people with HCM to exercise, which provides the same health benefits as it does for everyone,"" says Dr. Ho.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
                In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart's septum and left ventricle are thicker than normal, which can restrict blood flow.
              
            
          
        
        A wide variation in symptoms
        Some people with HCM have no symptoms or very mild ones. But some people feel breathless, lightheaded, or have chest pain. These symptoms occur when the heart fails to relax and fill properly or when the thickened heart muscle obstructs the flow of blood leaving the heart. The resulting turbulence in the blood flow causes a murmur that a doctor can hear while listening to the heart. Changes in the structure of the heart cells, combined with the thickened muscle, can affect the heart's electrical system. This can lead to atrial fibrillation (a fast, irregular heartbeat that raises the risk of stroke) and in rare cases, ventricular fibrillation, which can cause sudden cardiac death.
        The vast majority of HCM cases involve genes responsible for making sarcomeres, the basic units of muscle. Alterations in the genetic code (called mutations or variants) of these genes pass from one generation to the next in a dominant pattern. That means that parents, siblings, and children of an affected person have a 50% chance of having inherited the same variant. But even if you have the same variant as your mother, for example, your symptoms may be very different from hers, Dr. Ho explains.
        Diagnosing HCM
        Sometimes HCM is discovered by chance on a routine electrocardiogram (a test of the heart's electrical system) or when a doctor hears a murmur. Other people undergo testing after experiencing symptoms or after a family member is diagnosed.
        ""We refer everyone newly diagnosed with HCM for genetic counseling to consider genetic testing and to understand the implications for their family,"" says Dr. Ho. Many people feel anxious or confused after their diagnosis, but they should understand that with good medical care, most people with HCM can enjoy a good quality of life and that treatments are rapidly improving.
        Living with HCM
        For those with symptoms, many treatments — including medications and procedures — are available. Several common drugs can help the heart pump more effectively. In 2022, the FDA approved mavacamten (Camzyos), a first-in-class medication that targets the underlying cause of HCM by inhibiting a protein that helps power heart muscle contractions. A similar drug, aficamten, is in the final stages of clinical testing.
        ""It's great to have effective new medical options for people with HCM,"" says Dr. Ho. These medications are a welcome alternative to surgery or catheter-based procedures to thin the heart muscle, which until now were the only options when existing drugs didn't improve symptoms.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/try-this-look-snap-and-connect-for-better-memory-recall,"Try this: Look, snap, and connect for better memory recall","Mnemonics, named for Mnemosyne, the Greek goddess of memory, are techniques for recalling information.
        Mnemonics use cues — such as images, acronyms, rhymes, and easy-to-recall phrases — to reinforce memories.
        One type of mnemonic is called ""look, snap, connect."" It uses visualization, word association, and storytelling to help you solidify a memory so you can recall it later. It's a great tool for retaining details of new information.
        Here's an example of how it works:
        Look. Look refers to slowing down and noticing what you want to remember — for example, the fact that you parked your car in section 3B of the parking garage.
        Snap. Snap means taking a mental snapshot of the item. That could be an image of the actual parking garage sign, or a more elaborate image, such as that of three bumblebees (representing the 3B section where you parked).
        Connect. Connect involves connecting the image and the information you want to remember — in this case, the three bees and the garage section where you parked. Imagine the bees in your car. Then when you return to the garage and pause to remember where you parked, the image of the three bees buzzing in your car will help jog your memory.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-new-weight-loss-drugs,Understanding new weight-loss drugs,"Some people who struggle with weight loss have been able to find assistance from several FDA-approved weight-loss medications, such as bupropion plus naltrexone (Contrave), phentermine (Adipex-P), phentermine plus topiramate (Qsymia), and orlistat (Xenical, Alli). On average, such drugs can help people lose 5% to 7% of their body weight when paired with a healthy diet and exercise.
        Now a newer class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes has gained attention because of their impressive weight-loss results — in many cases, 10% to 20% of a person's body weight. They're called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists.
        Tale of two drugs
        Two of these GLP-1 receptor agonists are FDA-approved in formulations specifically designed for weight loss in people without diabetes: liraglutide (Saxenda) and semaglutide (Wegovy).
        Lower-dose versions of these same active ingredients, known respectively as Victoza and Ozempic, have been used for years to help people with diabetes control their blood sugar levels.
        ""They can lead to substantial weight loss when used in conjunction with healthy lifestyle changes in people who are overweight or have obesity with or without type 2 diabetes,"" says Dr. A. Enrique Caballero, an endocrinologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""But whether they can be safely used for all people who simply want to lose an extra 10 to 20 pounds is questionable.""
        
          
            
              
                New drugs on the horizon
                Other GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight loss may soon be available. A recent trial, funded by Eli Lilly, the company that makes tirzepatide (Mounjaro), found that around half of participants with both obesity and type 2 diabetes lost around 15% of their body weight on the medication. Also, initial research suggests that retatrutide, a triple hormone receptor agonist (acting on receptors for GLP-1, GIP, and CGCR), may lead to weight loss of up to 25% in people with diabetes. The FDA approved tirzepatide for treating type 2 diabetes in May 2022 and is now reviewing whether to approve it to treat obesity.
              
            
          
        
        How the new drugs work
        GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic the GLP-1 hormone that is naturally released in the gastrointestinal tract in response to eating.
        ""The drugs prompt the body to produce more insulin after eating, limiting the elevation of blood sugar levels after meals, something particularly crucial for people with type 2 diabetes,"" says Dr. Caballero. The drugs also regulate appetite by sending signals to the brain to tell the body it is full, which inhibits overeating.
        It is important to remember that these medications are only approved for people who meet certain criteria. Wegovy and Saxenda are for adults diagnosed with obesity — a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher — or those with a BMI of 27 plus at least one weight-related condition, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or type 2 diabetes. The other versions of these drugs—Victoza and Ozempic — are for people with type 2 diabetes.
        Still, that has not stopped some doctors from prescribing these medications ""off-label"" for weight loss, which means they are used for a different purpose than explicitly intended. ""But there isn't enough evidence to know whether these drugs might be beneficial or dangerous for people who fall outside of the FDA criteria,"" says Dr. Caballero.
        However, the larger issue is that many people see the new drugs as a quick-fix solution. ""It is paramount to remember that all weight-loss medications are recommended as an aid in the overall strategy that centers around a healthy meal plan and regular physical activity,"" says Dr. Caballero. ""In fact, people who stop taking these drugs will often regain the weight unless they have truly established a consistent and effective change in their eating and physical activity habits.""
        Know the downsides
        When discussing with your doctor whether GLP-1 receptor agonists are worth exploring, it's important to understand their potential downsides. You might develop various gastrointestinal side effects, including gas, bloating, indigestion, nausea, or irregular bowel movements.
        But these issues usually resolve within a few weeks, according to Dr. Caballero. ""The lowest doses of these medications are usually given at first and then gradually increased so people have less chance of developing side effects,"" he says.
        Another downside is the cost. The drugs are expensive — about $1,000 to $1,500 per month. Even if you qualify for their use, the drugs are not covered by Medicare for obesity, although Victoza and Ozempic are covered by Medicare and most private insurers to treat type 2 diabetes. Finally, be aware that the drugs are given via injection into the arm, stomach, or thigh using a pen-like device with a tiny needle the width of two human hairs. (Semaglutide is given weekly, while liraglutide injections are done daily.) Semaglutide prescribed for diabetes is now also available as a daily pill called Rybelsus. You have to wait 30 minutes to an hour after taking it before you can eat or drink.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/check-out-your-skin,Check out your skin,"You probably look at your face in the bathroom mirror a couple times each day. But do you ever take a close-up look at your entire skin? Devoting time to regular full-body check-ups can help you identify abnormalities that may signal skin cancer.
        ""Many skin spots and growths are related to normal aging and are not cause for concern,"" says Dr. Abigail H. Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""But you should note and monitor anything new or unusual.""
        Do a self-check
        Dr. Waldman recommends doing a head-to-toe self-exam every three to six months. Use a full-length mirror, plus a handheld mirror for hard-to-see spots, and a magnifying glass to examine smaller areas. ""If possible, have someone assist you so you don't miss anything,"" says Dr. Waldman. Here's how to do it.
        
          Look at your face, neck, ears (especially behind them), and scalp. Use a comb or a blow dryer to move your hair so that you can see better.
          Look at the front and back of your body in the mirror. Then, raise your arms and look at your left and right sides.
          Bend your elbows. Look carefully at your fingernails, palm and back of each hand, forearms (including the undersides), and upper arms.
          Check the back, front, and sides of your legs. Also, check the skin all over your buttocks and genital area.
          Sit and examine your feet, including the soles of your feet, the spaces between your toes, and your toenails.
        
        Note any new or questionable moles, sores, painful or itchy spots, raised or firm bumps, dark flaky patches, and black or brown lines along fingernails and toenails. Make sure to feel any suspicious areas for firmness, too. ""We often feel something troubling before we see it,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        Write down the date of your self-exams and record what you find, including the exact locations. Take photos with your phone to share with your doctor or dermatologist. ""After six to eight weeks, look at the trouble spots again, and get them checked out if they have not improved, or have changed color or size, have become painful, or easily bleed,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        
          
            
              
                Cosmetic changes
                Father Time brings us wrinkles, lines, bags under the eyes, age spots, raised rough lesions, and sagging skin. Many cosmetic treatments can treat these issues, such as botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, chemical peels, freezing liquid nitrogen sprays, laser treatments, prescription creams, and plastic surgery. Speak with your dermatologist about available options.
              
            
          
        
        Looking for skin cancer
        Melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer, and the earlier you can catch it, the better the outcome. The first sign of melanoma is usually a change in an existing mole. However, it also may appear as a new mole. Melanoma often appears on sun exposed areas, however, it also can occur in areas protected by the sun like nails. To recognize possible melanoma, follow the ABCDE guide:
        Asymmetry: the shape of one half doesn't match the other half
        Border: ragged or blurred edges
        Color: red, brown, blue, black, or white, and the shades may be uneven
        Diameter: about a quarter of an inch or larger, although some can be smaller
        Evolution: any changes in size, shape, or color.
        Here are some other skin issues to look out for during your self-exam:
        Freckles. Monitor large, irregular ones. If they grow or change appearance, this can be a prelude to a specific form of melanoma called lentigo maligna melanoma. Problem freckles often appear on the face, upper shoulders, chest, and arms.
        Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). ""Both are types of skin cancer, but they are slow-growing, usually not life-threatening, and easy to treat if caught early,"" says Dr. Waldman. BCC may look like a bleeding pimple, an open sore, a red patch, a shiny pink growth, or a scar. SCC resembles a crusted, scaly red bump, patch, or wart. Both cancers appear in areas frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face, rim of the ear, lower lip, balding scalp, neck, hands, arms, shoulders, back, and legs.
        Actinic keratoses (AKs). These growths are rough, gritty, and sometimes painful. They can be flat or slightly raised and appear in different colors, such as red, tan, pink, skin-colored, brown, or silver. AKs often appear on the face, tips of the ears, bald spots, and backs of the arms and hands. ""While AKs are not initially dangerous, get them looked at, as they may lead to squamous cell carcinoma if left alone,"" says Dr. Waldman.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/hearing-aids-may-reduce-cognitive-decline,Hearing aids may reduce cognitive decline,"Hearing loss can contribute to cognitive decline and may increase the risk of dementia. But seeing an audiologist and regularly using hearing aids was linked to slower cognitive decline in people already at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, a new study suggests.
        The analysis, published online July 17, 2023, by The Lancet, involved about 1,000 people ages 70 to 84 (54% women). All had hearing loss, but some were also participating in a long-term study of cardiovascular health and were deemed at higher risk of developing memory and thinking problems. Participants were randomly split into two groups: half received counseling on preventing chronic disease, while the others got hearing aids and treatment for hearing loss from an audiologist. Researchers tracked the groups for three years, rating their cognitive abilities at the end of the study.
        Hearing aids didn't appear to affect cognitive decline in the total group, but they did appear to slow cognitive decline in study participants who were already at the highest risk of worsening cognitive impairment. The results drive home that remedying hearing loss might stem that risk, the researchers said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/staying-regular,Staying regular,"Maybe you notice your spouse visits the bathroom every morning after a cup of coffee and marvel at his regularity. Perhaps you don't share that level of frequency — and wonder if you should.
        But what does ""staying regular"" really mean? The answer is different for every person, reflecting such factors as age, diet, physical activity, daily routine, and hydration levels, says Dr. Lawrence Borges, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Mt. Auburn Hospital.
        For some people, being regular means having a bowel movement once or twice a day. But it could also mean once or twice a week — or anything in between. ""Normal"" is whatever's normal for you. But many people still fret if they don't have frequent bowel movements, he says.
        ""People have in their minds that one perfect poop a day is the goal, but the reality is everyone's pattern may be different from that,"" Dr. Borges says. ""I try to stress that there's no single right answer, no perfect or correct pattern.""
        When routines change
        Stress alone is one negative offshoot of irregular bowel habits. Another is disrupted sleep, since people may awaken in discomfort or need to use the bathroom at odd hours. ""But being irregular, on its own, is common and not necessarily a sign of something wrong,"" Dr. Borges says.
        While how often you have a bowel movement doesn't matter, what does matter is that the pattern remains relatively consistent and you feel comfortable. With healthy bowel movements, you'll also feel you're completely emptying the rectum, not bloated or in pain, and don't have to strain hard to get the job done.
        Spotting a problem starts with noticing a dramatic change in what's normal for you. If you typically have one bowel movement a day and suddenly you're having them only once a week, for example — and you can't explain this change — you should see your doctor. That visit is even more pressing if you're also having other symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, unintended weight loss, blood in your stool, or a change in stool consistency. ""These are alarming changes that should prompt an evaluation,"" Dr. Borges says.
        Digestion direction
        Many people who ask Dr. Borges about being regular really want to know how to avoid constipation. Again, there's no single answer, with a menu of options to help keep digestion humming.
        In addition to mainstay advice such eating whole grains and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, exercising regularly (which keeps your colon moving, too), and drinking plenty of water, Dr. Borges offers this guidance.
        Maintain a toileting schedule. Try visiting the bathroom at the same time every day, such as in the morning after breakfast. This can help train your body to go at the same time in a place you're comfortable. ""If you're racing out the door for work and not leaving time to take advantage of that readiness, that's not helpful — you may not be able to take advantage of it later in the day,"" he says.
        Heed your body's signals. Along those lines, when you feel the urge to have a bowel movement, don't put it off until later. ""The opposite is also true: just because you haven't gone doesn't mean you should try to force it,"" he says. ""If your body's not ready, you may not be able to go because no stool is ready to be expelled.""
        Try a toilet stool. Toilet footstools have emerged as a quietly popular bathroom accessory, with devotees saying it helps them have more comfortable, effective bowel movements. ""The purpose is to change the angle and orientation of the rectum to make it more of a straight path to expel stool,"" he says. ""Some people find when they raise their feet six inches, they do have an easier time.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-do-i-have-white-spots-on-my-nails,Why do I have white spots on my nails?,"Q.
          My fingernails are sprinkled with tiny white spots. Why do these form?
        
        A. These nail spots are a common occurrence — and usually don't signal a serious problem — but it may take some sleuthing to figure out why you've developed them. The most likely cause of white spots on the nails is minor trauma of some sort, whether from a rough manicure involving filing and cuticle cutting or excessive tapping of the hands and fingers on a hard surface.
        Sometimes, dry, white areas on the nails form when you leave nail polish on for too long — weeks or longer — which doesn't allow the nail to shed cells normally. A fungal infection could also be the culprit, depositing a white film that may cover a few areas or even all of the nail. Certain more serious conditions can also cause half or more of the nail to appear white. These include low iron levels, kidney disease, or scarring of the liver (cirrhosis).
        If hand trauma or wearing nail polish for prolonged periods don't seem likely causes of your nail spots, ask your doctor for her assessment. Letting the spots disappear on their own could be a lengthy process, since it can take six or more months for fingernails to grow out.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/uk-study-confirms-mediterranean-lifestyle-benefits,UK study confirms Mediterranean lifestyle benefits,"Living a Mediterranean lifestyle — eating a particular diet and getting enough sleep and physical and social activity — has been linked over and over to reduced risks for chronic disease and early death. But most studies have involved people in Mediterranean countries, such as Spain. Now an observational study published online Aug. 8, 2023, by Mayo Clinic Proceedings suggests what experts have long suspected: the lifestyle has benefits for people living in other parts of the world, too. Researchers, including some from Harvard, analyzed diet assessments and self-reported lifestyle habits of about 111,000 people (ages 40 to 75) in England, Wales, and Scotland. Participants were followed for up to nine years. People who adhered most closely to a Mediterranean lifestyle had a 28% lower risk of dying from cancer and a 29% lower risk of dying prematurely from any cause, compared with people whose lifestyles were most different from the Mediterranean pattern. The authors say the findings indicate that people outside Mediterranean countries can use their own locally available products to follow a Mediterranean-style eating pattern, which emphasizes olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains; moderate amounts of fish, poultry, cheese, and wine; and limited portions of red or processed meats.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/does-poor-sleep-diminish-the-cognitive-benefits-of-exercise,Does poor sleep diminish the cognitive benefits of exercise?,"Getting at least 150 minutes of exercise each week (such as brisk walking) is crucial to keeping your memory and thinking skills sharp. Exercise promotes the birth of new brain cells and increases the production of enzymes that break down amyloid proteins associated with dementia. Sleep also plays a role in cognitive health, flushing those amyloid proteins out of the brain. The right amount of sleep is so important that a lack of Z's may sabotage the cognitive perks of exercise, according to a study published July 2023 in The Lancet Healthy Longevity. Researchers evaluated the periodic memory test results and self-reported sleep and exercise habits of almost 9,000 dementia-free people (ages 50 and older) who were followed over 10 years. Among people who started the study at age 50 or 60 and reported the highest rates of exercise, those who said they got less than six hours of sleep per night had faster rates of cognitive decline than those who said they got six to eight hours of sleep per night. For people who started the study at age 70 and reported high rates of exercise, the amount of sleep they got didn't seem to affect their rate of cognitive decline. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that poor sleep quashes the brain benefits of exercise.

Many studies have suggested you don't need to hit that mark to maintain good health and live longer. And now the largest study to date backs up that theory. The research, published online Aug. 9, 2023, by the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, evaluated 17 high-quality studies from around the world, including a total of almost 227,000 people (ages 18 and older) who wore fitness trackers for a week and were then followed for about seven years. Taking at least 3,900 steps per day (not quite two miles) was linked to significantly lower risks of dying from any cause during the study period. A reduction in death specifically from cardiovascular disease appeared with an even smaller number of daily steps — about 2,300. The data also showed that each 1,000-step increment was associated with a 15% decreased risk of dying, and each 500-step increment was tied to a 7% decrease in death from cardiovascular disease. This study was observational and can't prove definitively that the number of steps people took lengthened their lives. But the findings underscore two common health messages: even a little movement makes a difference, and more is better.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/winter-activity-workarounds-for-hands-that-hurt,Winter activity workarounds for hands that hurt,"The pain and stiffness of hand arthritis make it hard to do anything that requires nimble fingers or a strong grip. And for some people, cold, damp winter weather seems to worsen arthritis symptoms. ""We don't know exactly why that happens. All we have are theories, such as bones expanding from changes in barometric pressure, changes in circulation, 'thickened' joint fluid, and the effects of less exercise due to cold weather,"" says Dr. Robert Shmerling, a rheumatologist and senior faculty editor at Harvard Health Publishing.
        So how can you get through a busy winter filled with activities that demand a lot from your hands, such as preparing holiday feasts or shoveling snow? The key is to plan, pace yourself, use the right tools, and enlist help if you need it. Here's how to apply that to some common winter activities.
        Holiday cooking
        Cooking is intense work for your hands, whether you're whisking a savory sauce, kneading or rolling out dough, chopping vegetables, or lifting heavy pots and pans.
        Plan. Think about the steps of each recipe and ways to reduce the amount of grasping or lifting that might be required. ""For example, if you need to fill a large stock pot with water, place the pot on the stove first and then add water using a pitcher, so you won't have to lift a heavy pot,"" says Kim Stuckart, an occupational therapist at Spaulding Rehabilitation Network.
        Pace yourself. Spread out cooking activities as much as possible so you don't overwork your hands. That could mean making one special dish per day (and freezing it) prior to a holiday meal, or baking holiday cookies well in advance and freezing them. And take breaks while you're cooking, to let your hands rest.
        Use tools. ""Adaptive kitchen tools are plentiful, such as tools with large handles that are easier to grip and put less stress on your hands, or bowls with suction cups on them, so you don't have to grip them to hold them steady,"" Stuckart says. ""And when possible, use kitchen appliances — such as a food processor or an electric can opener — to do prep work for you.""
        Enlist help. Consider asking family members to help with the cooking, or have part or all of the meal catered if it's in the budget. It doesn't have to come from a fancy restaurant. For example, many grocery stores prepare and sell cooked turkeys and holiday dinners.
        Shoveling snow
        Shoveling heavy, wet snow is taxing on your heart (it's strenuous exercise) and painful for arthritic hands. ""It hurts to grasp a shovel, and it can lead to muscle strain and increased joint inflammation if you hold your hands in one position for long periods,"" Stuckart says.
        Plan. Before you head outside, get your body ready for hard work with a warm-up (march in place and move your arms for a few minutes). ""This gets blood flowing to all of your muscles and tissues, including your hands, which will help keep them warm and flexible,"" Stuckart says. Before going out, suit up properly in cold weather gear, including a pair of compression gloves ($10 and up) beneath mittens. The gloves will promote warmth and blood flow.
        Pace yourself. Go slowly and steadily, take breaks, and stay hydrated (ideally with hot drinks). Even though it's cold outside, you'll lose fluids during exertion.
        Use tools. If it's in the budget, get a snow blower or an electric snow shovel, which you push like a lawn mower. They are pricey (in the hundreds of dollars) but help ease the work of shoveling.
        Enlist help. If possible, hire a company to remove the snow for you. It's expensive and may require a long-term contract. If that's not in the budget, talk to family members or a neighbor (or a neighbor's teenage kids) about helping with snow removal. Make the arrangements now, before you wake up to a blanket of new-fallen snow.
        Wrapping presents
        One of the joys of the winter holidays is giving gifts to friends and family. But gift wrapping requires hand strength to use scissors, and agility in fingers and thumbs to fold paper, tape it, and tie ribbons. The repetitive movements can quickly become painful.
        Plan. Buy presents as far in advance as possible, so you'll have plenty of time to get them ready.
        Pace yourself. Don't overdo it. Wrap just one or two presents per day.
        Use tools. Stuckart recommends using a large (accessible) tape dispenser (about $5) and adaptive scissors (about $15) that you operate by squeezing a large loop rather than opening and closing two handles. Or simply use gift bags.
        Enlist help. When you're shopping, take advantage of gift-wrapping services (which are sometimes included in the price of the gift). Or ask a friend to help you wrap presents.
        Using walking or ski poles
        Nordic walking and cross-country skiing are popular cold-weather activities, and both involve the use of poles you grasp to pull or propel yourself forward. When you have hand arthritis, however, holding onto the poles for extended periods can be challenging and painful.
        Plan. Make sure you're holding the poles correctly. They have a glove-like strap attached to the grip (handle). The straps need to be snug; if they're loose, your hands will work harder. If you're not sure about your technique, watch a free video on YouTube. Warm up before walking or skiing to get blood flowing to your muscles and hands.
        Pace yourself. Take rest breaks and drink some water (or hot tea).
        Use tools. ""Look for poles with large, thick grips, which are easier to hold than small ones,"" Stuckart says. ""And wear a pair of heated, rechargeable mittens. Keeping your fingers together will keep them warmer than they'd be in gloves. The warmth helps joints stay loose.""
        Enlist help. An occupational therapist can help you adapt existing poles so they're easier to hold with arthritic hands. ""We have materials we can add to the make the grip larger,"" Stuckart says. ""We can also evaluate your hand strength and prescribe a series of hand exercises to improve strength and flexibility.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/when-heart-related-pain-goes-unrecognized,When heart-related pain goes unrecognized,"Most people don't know that you can have a heart attack without realizing it. In fact, these so-called silent heart attacks account for an estimated 30% to 60% of all heart attacks. But recognizing and responding to a silent heart attack is important, as they can be harbingers for a more serious, potentially deadly heart attack.
        ""Heart attacks can be silent for a variety of reasons,"" says cardiologist Dr. Peter Stone, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Just like a regular heart attack, a silent one occurs when the heart muscle doesn't receive enough blood, usually when a clot blocks blood flow inside a narrowed heart artery.
        The quality, duration, and intensity of the resulting pain can vary quite a bit. Some people describe the sensation as a dull ache or crushing pressure, which may be mild or short-lived and therefore unnoticed or ignored. Typically, the reduced blood flow must last about 15 to 30 minutes to result in a detectable heart attack (that is, part of the heart muscle becomes damaged or dies). Sometimes symptoms come and go, which doctors refer to as stuttering symptoms. ""When a clot obstructs an artery, the body's natural clot-busting process is instantly set in motion,"" Dr. Stone explains. If the clot dissolves, symptoms may abate — but then return if the clot-forming forces win.
        Radiating and referred pain
        Various quirks related to pain perception may also play a role in a heart attack going unrecognized. ""People often think the discomfort has to be on the left side of the chest, because that's where the heart is located,"" says Dr. Stone. But nerves within the heart can send signals to the surrounding nerves, causing pain that may radiate to the stomach, back, neck, arm, or jaw.
        For example, if an artery blockage occurs near the bottom of the heart, it may affect nerves in the diaphragm, the muscular membrane that separates the chest from the abdominal cavity, Dr. Stone explains. This can be perceived as abdominal discomfort or nausea. Or people may experience shoulder pain, a classic example of referred pain. This phenomenon — when pain is felt in a location other than the actual source — happens because of overlaps in the network of nerves in the spinal cord.
        
          
            
              
                Heart attack symptoms
                During a heart attack, about threequarters of both men and women experience the classic symptom of chest discomfort that spreads through the upper body. But some people experience other symptoms. These less common symptoms might be slightly more frequent in women and in older people, but they can also happen in men and younger people.
                
                  Classic symptoms
                
                
                  Pressure, aching, or tightness in the center of the chest
                  Pain or discomfort that radiates to the upper body, especially shoulders or neck and arms
                  Sweating
                
                
                  Other symptoms
                
                
                  Shortness of breath
                  Weakness
                  Nausea or vomiting
                  Dizziness
                  Back or jaw pain
                  Unexplained fatigue
                
              
            
          
        
        Mistaken attributions
        Problems with the lungs and the esophagus (the tube connecting the throat to the stomach) are sometimes mistaken for a heart attack, but the opposite can also occur. Sometimes, people assume their chest pain is caused by a respiratory infection or other lung disease when they're actually having a heart attack. Another possible misattribution is heartburn, which happens when stomach acid rises up into the esophagus (see ""Heart disease and heartburn: What's the overlap?"" in the January 2023 Heart Letter).
        If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have a silent heart attack. Over time, high blood sugar can damage your nerves and the small blood vessels supplying those nerves — including those that transmit pain signals.
        While pain tolerance may be physiological, emotional and cultural factors can come into play as well, says Dr. Stone. For instance, people may dismiss or ignore pain because they don't want to appear weak.
        How are silent heart attacks detected?
        Heart muscle damage from a heart attack creates a distinct signature on an electrocardiogram (ECG), a recording of the heart's electrical activity. A heart ultrasound (echocardiogram) can also detect a prior heart attack. If either test suggests heart damage, it should be a wake-up call to prioritize efforts to avoid more damage. Follow healthy lifestyle habits (and take medications, if necessary) to make sure your weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar are within normal ranges.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-a-healthy-gut-helps-your-heart,How a healthy gut helps your heart,"Your gut microbiome — a collection of trillions of microorganisms inhabiting your intestinal tract — has wide-ranging effects on your health. Your unique mix of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses reflects your genes, your age, the medications you take — but most of all, what you eat.
        Over the past two decades, numerous studies have explored how gut microbes and their breakdown products (metabolites) affect factors linked with heart disease. For the most part, the findings support the same basic advice health experts recommend: Follow a mostly plant-based eating pattern, and cut back on highly processed foods. Doing so can help promote a more diverse, healthier microbiome.
        ""The standard American diet — appropriately called SAD — features a lot of processed foods that are high in sugar, artificial sweeteners, and unhealthy fats,"" says Dr. Uma Naidoo, director of nutritional and metabolic psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. This nutrient-poor diet can lead to dysbiosis, an overgrowth of harmful microbes. When bad microbes thrive in the gut, they form pro-inflammatory breakdown products and toxins, Dr. Naidoo explains. The resulting low-grade, bodywide inflammation contributes to obesity, poor mental health, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.
        Animal vs. plant-based foods
        One metabolite of interest is trimethylamine (TMA), which is created when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). While some research suggests a link between TMAO and artery-clogging plaque, the evidence isn't consistent. Still, the advice to limit red meat consumption — the main source of TMA in the diet — makes sense.
        But according to Dr. Naidoo, there's no need to avoid those animal-based foods, which most Americans aren't especially keen on doing. Instead, people should focus more on what they're not eating — namely, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
        
          
            
              
                Fermented foods
                Eating fermented foods may help dampen inflammation in the body. When shopping, look for the words ""contains live cultures"" when choosing yogurt or kefir, a yogurtlike drink with a tart flavor and a thinner consistency than yogurt. While both products are usually made with dairy milk, they also come in nondairy versions made from almond, coconut, or oat milk. Another beverage, kombucha, is a fizzy, tart, slightly sweet drink made from fermented tea that's often flavored with fruits and herbs. Look for brands without added sugar.
                For fermented products made from vegetables, look in the refrigerated section and check for the words ""naturally fermented"" on the label. When you open the jar, check for telltale bubbles in the liquid, which signal that live organisms are inside. Most supermarket pickles are preserved with vinegar and not made with a natural fermentation process using water and salt. For sauerkraut (pickled cabbage), choose raw or nonpasteurized products. If you're a fan of spicy food, try kimchi, a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish from Korea made with a mix of garlic, salt, vinegar, and chili peppers. From Japan, there's miso (a strong, salty paste made from soybeans fermented with brown rice) and tempeh (a firm, chewy product made from fermented soybeans).
              
            
          
        
        Diversify your diet
        A woefully small percentage of adults — only about 10% — eats the recommended daily amount of fruit (one-and-a-half to two cups) or vegetables (two to three cups). Don't limit yourself to only a few favorites like apples or broccoli, says Dr. Naidoo. ""Eat a wide variety of different fruits and vegetables on a regular basis to bring biodiversity to your microbiome,"" she says.
        Despite a recent uptick, whole grains make up less than 16% of the average American's total grain intake. Whole grains such as oats, quinoa, spelt, and barley are healthier choices than most ""whole-wheat"" bread, which isn't always made with 100% whole grains. Other foods that promote gut health include beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds.
        Fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains are good sources fermentable or prebiotic fiber, which gets broken down by bacteria in your colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds then circulate through the bloodstream and interact with receptors on cells that quell inflammation. These fatty acids also appear to play a role in keeping blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels in check.
        You can also increase good gut bacteria levels by consuming probiotics, which are found in fermented foods (see box). ""Try adding a little bit of these foods to your meals and then grow from there,"" Dr. Naidoo suggests.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-you-an-everyday-exerciser-or-a-weekend-warrior,Are you an everyday exerciser or a weekend warrior?,"The standard advice about exercise is to do about 30 minutes a day, most days of the week. But in terms of heart-related benefits, does it matter if you rack up most of your exercise minutes over just one or two days instead of spreading them out over an entire week?
        Earlier research has suggested that both patterns are equally beneficial. But those findings relied on people to self-report their exercise, which can be unreliable. Now, a study of nearly 90,000 adults who used wristband monitors to record their physical activity has reached a similar conclusion.
        ""The findings add to the body of literature showing that it doesn't matter when you get your exercise, as long as you get the recommended amount each week,"" says Dr. I-Min Lee, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert on the role of physical activity in preventing disease.
        
          
        
        Volume matters more than pattern
        The study, published July 18, 2023, in JAMA, doesn't define the term ""weekend warrior"" in quite the same way as most people do, says Dr. Lee. ""Usually, weekend warriors are seen as people who don't exercise on weekdays but then take a long hike or play two hours of tennis on Saturday or Sunday,"" she says.
        Instead, researchers used participants' physical activity data, which were recorded over seven consecutive days, to categorize them into different groups. About two-thirds of them met the federal physical activity guidelines (see ""How much exercise?""). About 42% were deemed ""weekend warriors,"" meaning they met the guidelines but got half or more of their total physical activity — not just exercise — on just one or two days. Another 24% were ""regularly active,"" meeting the guidelines with activity spread out over the week. The remaining 34% didn't meet the guidelines.
        After roughly six years, the researchers found that participants who followed either activity pattern had a similarly lower risk of heart attack, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure compared with people in the inactive group. Historically, experts have encouraged people to be regularly active, mainly because anecdotal reports suggest that weekend warriors may be more prone to injuries. But this study didn't find any difference in injury rates between the two active groups. That's likely because of the definition used in the study: the ""warrior"" group wasn't necessarily doing the types of high-intensity activities or sports often associated with muscle sprains and related injuries, Dr. Lee says.
        
          
            
              
                Best time of day to exercise? Whatever works for you
                Are there any pros or cons associated with exercising at certain times of the day? Research results are all over the map, says Harvard Medical School professor Dr. I-Min Lee. The best strategy is to exercise when it's most convenient and comfortable for you, whether that's the first thing in the morning, early evening, or anytime in between.
                If you exercise early in the day, you can check it off your to-do list and can take advantage of the ""feel-good"" brain chemicals, serotonin and dopamine, that are released during exercise. But afternoon workouts also have some benefits. Your joints and muscles may be more limber later in the day, which may make exercise feel less taxing. If you experience a midafternoon lull, exercise can be a good way to reinvigorate yourself. If you can, find a buddy who likes to exercise at the same time, so you can go together and hold each other accountable.
                Likewise, there's little evidence to suggest that coordinating your exercise with respect to mealtimes has any good or bad effects. Some people find that vigorous exercise right before a meal curbs their appetite, while others find the opposite is true. A pre-breakfast workout works well for certain people. But having a small, carbohydrate-rich snack (like a banana or a slice of whole-grain toast) at least half an hour before exercising may provide a helpful energy boost, says Dr. Lee.
              
            
          
        
        Short bouts of activity count
        Wristband devices enable researchers to capture all the short bouts of activity people do throughout the day that they may not remember. ""If you do jumping jacks occasionally while watching television, you won't necessarily recall that activity the way you remember that you play tennis three times a week,"" says Dr. Lee. Similarly, people whose daily commutes include a few 10-minute bouts of walking may not consider that as counting toward their moderate-intensity activity minutes. But these small spurts of activity — sometimes referred to as exercise ""snacks"" — seem to be beneficial. If you're sitting for a long stretch, stand up and move around for a few minutes every hour. Activating your muscles even just briefly can help improve your body's ability to keep your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol in check.
        It's also worth noting that if you don't meet the physical activity guidelines, you'll still benefit from doing even small amounts of exercise — and every minute counts.

          I was very interested in the May 2023 
          Heart Letter feature about Dr. Ludwig's research, which suggests that eating fewer carbohydrates and more protein and fat can help with weight loss and lead to better health outcomes. But his menus and recipes include foods that contain saturated fat, such as meat and full-fat dairy products. For many years, we heard from reputable sources that we should aways limit saturated fat. This is very confusing! Can you explain?
        
        A. You're right about advice to limit saturated fat in your diet, which stems from the fact that eating too much saturated fat tends to raise levels of harmful LDL cholesterol. But not everyone agrees on what the limit should be. The American Heart Association advises a limit of 5% to 6% of your daily calories, while the Dietary Guidelines for Americans says 10% is fine. Registered dietitian Kathy McManus, who directs the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, suggests a happy medium of 7%. That happens to be the typical amount of saturated fat in the heart-friendly Mediterranean-style diet.
        She analyzed the nutrient composition of the sample menu in the feature you referenced (""Cut calories or carbohydrates for better heart health?"" in the May 2023 Heart Letter). The three meals and snack include about 1,900 calories, which is just below the 2,000 daily calories recommended for the average woman. About 12% of the calories in Dr. Ludwig's sample menu are from saturated fat, which isn't too much higher than the Dietary Guidelines limit of 10%. Also, a 1.3-ounce piece of dark chocolate contains about eight grams of saturated fat, which is close to one-third of the 25 total grams of saturated fat in this menu. If you omitted the chocolate, the saturated fat in this sample menu would be around 8% of the total calories.
        But here's the thing: Most people don't want to spend time calculating their calories or saturated fat, which is why McManus and many other nutrition experts recommend focusing more on eating mostly whole or minimally processed foods, which is also one of Dr. Ludwig's main messages. As she notes, his menu doesn't include refined, processed carbohydrates like white rice, white bread, sugary drinks, or other sweets. Muffins, cookies, pie, and other baked goods often contain quite a bit of saturated fat because they're made with butter, lard, vegetable shortening, or tropical oils such as palm or palm kernel oil.
        Finally, although dark chocolate has saturated fat, it also contains heart-protecting plant compounds known as flavanols, which appear to outweigh the risk from saturated fat, according to nutrition experts at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-sleep-do-you-actually-need-202310302986,How much sleep do you actually need?,"On average, how many hours do you sleep each night? For most healthy adults, guidelines suggest at least seven hours of slumber.
        But these are general recommendations and not strict rules. ""Some people need less than seven hours, while others might need more,"" says Eric Zhou with the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        Do you need more or less sleep time?
        We get it: you know people who swear they only need five hours of sleep per night, yet you feel foggy unless you log in eight to nine hours. The major reason for individual differences is that we often look at sleep the wrong way.
        ""Instead of focusing exclusively on the number of hours we sleep per night, we should also consider our sleep quality,"" says Zhou.
        Sleep quality means how well you sleep during the night. Did you sleep straight through? Or did you have periods where you woke up? If so, did it take you a long time to fall asleep? How did you feel when you woke up?
        ""If you awaken refreshed and feel like you have the energy to get through your day, then I would worry less about the exact number of hours you're sleeping,"" says Zhou.
        How does sleep quality affect your health?
        Sleep quality is vital for our overall health. Research has shown that people with poor sleep quality are at a higher risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and mental health issues like anxiety and depression.
        And that's not all. ""Poor sleep also can increase daytime fatigue and make it more difficult to enjoy life,"" says Zhou.
        Yet it's normal for people's sleep patterns to change over time. ""Many people are not going to sleep in their 50s and 60s exactly like they did in their 20s,"" says Zhou.
        Many of these changes are age-related. For instance, your circadian rhythm — which regulates many bodily functions, including our sleep-wake cycle — can naturally get disrupted over time. This means people spend less time each night in restorative slow-wave sleep.
        Production of melatonin, the sleep hormone, also gradually declines with age. ""As a result of these changes, when we get older we may start to wake up earlier than we did when we were younger, or wake up more frequently during the night,"" says Zhou.
        How can you track sleep quality?
        How can you better understand the factors likely contributing to your sleep quality? One way is to keep a sleep diary where you track and record your sleep.
        Every day, record the time you went to bed, how long it took you to fall asleep, whether you had any nighttime awakenings (and if so, how long you were awake), and at what time you woke up. Also, keep track of how you feel upon awakening and at the end of the day.
        ""After a week or two, review the information to see if you can identify certain patterns that may be affecting your sleep quality, then make adjustments,"" says Zhou.
        For example, if you have trouble falling asleep, go to bed half an hour later than usual but maintain the same wake-up time. ""It is common for people struggling with their sleep to try to get more sleep by staying in bed longer, but this disrupts their sleep patterns and diminishes their sleep quality,"" says Zhou.
        Three key strategies to support the quality of your sleep
        Other strategies that can help support good sleep quality include:
        
          maintaining a consistent wake time, especially on weekends
          limiting daytime naps to 20 to 30 minutes, and at least six hours before the desired bedtime
          being physically active.
        
        When it comes to sleep quality, consistency is vital. ""People with good sleep quality often have a predictable sleep window where their sleep occurs,"" says Zhou. ""Good sleepers are likely to sleep around the same number of hours and stay asleep through the night.""
        The bottom line on getting restful sleep
        It's unrealistic to expect perfect sleep every night. ""If you have trouble sleeping one or two nights during the week, that can be related to the natural ebbs and flows of life,"" says Zhou. ""You may have eaten a big meal that day, drank too much alcohol while watching football, or had a stressful argument with someone. When tracking sleep quality, look at your overall sleep health week-to-week, not how you slept this Tuesday compared to last Tuesday.""
        If you are doing all the right things for your sleep but still do not feel rested upon waking, talk to your doctor. This can help you rule out a sleep disorder like sleep apnea, or another health issue that can interfere with sleep such as acid reflux or high blood pressure. Other factors that can affect the quality of your sleep include taking multiple medicines, depression, anxiety, loneliness, and environmental changes like temperature, noise, and light exposure.",Matthew Solan,"October 30, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fda-approves-new-surgical-treatment-for-enlarged-prostates-202310252985,FDA approves new surgical treatment for enlarged prostates,"Nearly a century ago, surgeons developed what is still considered the gold-standard treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an age-related affliction that occurs when an enlarged prostate obstructs the flow of urine.
        Offered to men who don't respond to BPH medication, this procedure, called a transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP, involves trimming excess prostate tissue with an electric loop. Roughly 90% of treated men achieve long-lasting relief, but they typically also have to spend a night recovering in the hospital, and many are left unable to ejaculate.
        Newer, minimally-invasive BPH procedures offer faster recovery times and fewer risks of complications. Where a TURP cuts directly into the prostate, these alternate procedures treat BPH in other ways — for instance, by using steam, microwaves, or lasers to treat the obstructing tissues.
        Minimally-invasive procedures are gaining in popularity, and earlier this year another won the FDA's approval. Called the Optilume BPH catheter system, it provided sustained relief from BPH symptoms that continued holding up after four years, according to study results presented at the 2023 Annual Meeting of the American Urological Association, in April.
        The procedure and the study
        During an Optilume procedure, doctors thread an inflatable catheter toward the prostate through the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine out of the bladder. The catheter splits the two halves of the prostate (which are called lobes), creating a V-shaped channel in the top of the gland that reduces pressure on the urethra, improving urinary flow rates. Importantly, the catheter is coated with a chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel, that helps to limit treatment-related inflammatory responses. After the catheter is removed, the channel in the prostate remains.
        Dr. Steven Kaplan, professor of urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, led the studies leading to the FDA's approval. He says symptom improvements with the new system rival those achieved with TURP. ""We're pretty excited about it,"" he says. ""This is a potential game changer.""
        During the research, Dr. Kaplan's team measured changes in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), which ranges from 0 to 35 and classifies BPH as either mild, moderate, or severe. According to results from the first clinical trial, called the PINNACLE study and limited to men with prostates ranging from 20 to 80 grams in size, Optilume treatment produced immediate benefits. At one year, IPSS scores among treated men were 11.5 points lower on average than those reported at baseline.
        Follow-up and commentary
        Follow-up evaluations for men enrolled in the second clinical trial, called the EVEREST study, are still ongoing. But results available so far — again for prostates no larger than 80 grams — show IPSS scores dropping from 22.5 at baseline to 11.5 four years after treatment, with no significant changes in ejaculatory functioning.
        ""Numerous innovative treatment alternatives for BPH have emerged over the years,"" says Dr. Heidi Rayala, a urologist affiliated with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, and a member of the editorial board of the Harvard Medical School Annual Report on Prostate Diseases. ""TURP still stands as the benchmark, given that many initially promising technologies have faltered due to loss of efficacy over time. Nonetheless, recent advancements like Optilume offer exciting prospects for enhanced durability with reduced side effects.
        ""It's essential to note that Optilume's efficacy varies based on prostate size and patient symptoms. Matching the appropriate surgical approach to the individual patient will remain crucial as patients and their urologists evaluate the optimal choice within the spectrum of minimally-invasive therapies.""",Charlie Schmidt,"October 25, 2023"

          Q.
          My friend insists that she can feel when she has high blood pressure, because her face flushes and she 
          gets
           a headache. Is this possible?
        
        A. In almost all instances people cannot feel high blood pressure and are unaware that they have it. This is why it is often referred to as a silent killer.
        It is usually only when a person is in the midst of what is known as a hypertensive crisis — a period of extremely high blood pressure with a reading of 180/120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher — that she or he will experience symptoms, such as a headache. This is considered a medical crisis, and if it occurs, you should call 911 and get emergency help.
        However, even in these instances, high blood pressure can't be diagnosed based on symptoms alone. The only way to truly tell if you have elevated blood pressure is to take a reading with a blood pressure cuff.
        If your friend is experiencing frequent headaches and other symptoms she's attributing to high blood pressure, it might be wise for her to visit her doctor to make sure another condition isn't causing the problem. If she does have uncontrolled high blood pressure, she should also be certain to work with her doctor to manage her condition. Unchecked, high blood pressure can lead to numerous complications, including damage to your arteries, brain, heart, and kidneys.",Unknown,"October 24, 2023"

        Almost everyone gets a headache from time to time. Some people, though, get them daily or almost every day. This problem is known as chronic daily headache. Women are twice as likely as men to have it.
        People with this condition get headaches every day or nearly every day for a prolonged period of time — for example, at least five days a week for a year or longer. Most often, chronic daily headache develops in people who used to get the occasional migraine, tension headache, or other type of headache. Sometimes chronic daily headache develops without any preamble or warning.
        No matter how it originates, chronic daily headache is notoriously difficult to treat and, understandably, often produces anxiety and depression.
        Getting control of chronic daily headaches often means weaning off regular use of pain relievers. Consider other methods to help ease headache pain, too. For example, try a cool compress on the forehead or a heating pad on tight muscles in the neck. You may want to ask your doctor to send you to a physical therapist. Techniques such as massage, ultrasound, and relaxation exercises may also help keep headaches at bay.
        Preventive medications are a good choice for some people. Examples include a tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline (Elavil) or nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl), a beta blocker such as propranolol (Inderal) or nadolol (Corgard), or gabapentin (Neurontin). For some people who suffer with chronic daily headaches, other medications may be necessary. As with many chronic conditions, it is important to work closely with your doctor to find the preventive and treatment strategies that work for you.",Unknown,"October 24, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-you-have-a-heart-attack-and-not-know-it,Can you have a heart attack and not know it?,"""Silent"" heart attacks that don't produce noteworthy symptoms put you at the same future risks as the classic ones.
        
        When you think of a heart attack, you probably picture a pretty dramatic event that includes someone experiencing intense chest pain, clutching their arm and dropping to the ground unconscious.
        But in real life today, heart attacks aren't usually that extreme. Some produce no symptoms, or only produce mild symptoms that are so unremarkable that people mistake them for something else — heartburn from a lunchtime burrito, fatigue, or a chest muscle strain.
        ""The true incidence of silent heart attacks is not known, since by definition they go unnoticed,"" says Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, a senior investigator with the TIMI Study Group, an academic research group studying cardiovascular disease at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""However, estimates have placed them anywhere from 20% to 60% of all heart attacks."" Both women and men are at risk, she says.
        Identifying a silent heart attack
        People often don't learn that they had a heart attack until they have an electrocardiogram (ECG) or a stress test and the doctor notices signs consistent with heart damage. As in traditional symptomatic heart attacks, a silent heart attack involves a blockage of blood flow to the heart. This injures and scars part of the heart muscle, leaving behind telltale signs.
        Unfortunately, while a heart attack may go unnoticed, the injury it causes is real and puts you at higher risk for heart failure or a future heart attack.
        Take action after a silent heart attack
        If you do find out that you've had a silent heart attack, you should take steps to prevent or control cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes, any of which can make another heart attack more likely.
        Doctors don't completely understand why some people experience no symptoms — or only mild or unusual ones — during a heart attack, Dr. O'Donoghue says. To better identify silent heart attacks, she says, there needs to be more education about less common symptoms, which are often very different from the ones most people picture.
        ""I think the greatest misconception about a heart attack is that the chest discomfort is 'painful' — in fact, most patients describe the chest discomfort as a heaviness or squeezing sensation that can be quite mild in nature,"" she says. ""Women may also experience more atypical symptoms, like shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, and tingling in the left arm or jaw.""
        If you do experience these symptoms, it's best to get them checked out immediately. Even if they don't turn out to be heart-related, it truly is better to be safe than sorry.
        
          
            
              
                Be heart smart!
                Take these steps to head off cardiovascular disease:
                Talk to your doctor about risk factors. Identify things in your health history that might put you at higher risk for a heart attack, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, a family history of heart disease, and diabetes. Don't forget to mention female-specific risk factors, such as a history of early menopause (before age 40) or a past episode of preeclampsia (a potentially life-threatening pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine).
                Review your risk factors with your doctor. Know that your risk for heart problems may rise after menopause or if your health changes.
                Get screened. Monitor your blood pressure, and consider getting tested for diabetes if you have risk factors, such as a family history of the disease, overweight or obesity, or gestational diabetes during pregnancy.
                Adopt a healthy lifestyle. Eat a heart-healthy diet, meaning one that is high in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, and low in processed foods, saturated fat, and sugar. It's also important to get regular exercise, as well as adequate high-quality sleep. You should also work to reduce your stress levels.
              
            
          
        
        Managing risk factors
        ""Since heart attack symptoms can be missed, it is important to continue regular follow-up with your primary care provider,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. She or he might want to order periodic ECGs, she says. ""If a silent heart attack is identified, this may lead to more testing and appropriate treatments to help ensure another one doesn't occur and that the heart muscle is protected,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue.
        Being proactive can also help ensure that your heart is healthy and that any risk factors you have for cardiovascular disease are managed appropriately.
        Lifestyle changes, including diet improvements, smoking cessation, and exercise, can help protect you from additional heart problems, says Dr. O'Donoghue, even if you've already had a silent heart attack.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-your-gums-are-so-important-to-your-health,Why your gums are so important to your health,"Periodontal disease (periodontitis) has long been known as the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. But the damage isn't confined to the mouth. Gum disease has also been associated with an increased risk of serious degenerative diseases.
        
          How gum disease starts
          Like our intestines, our mouths house complex ecosystems of bacteria, known as the oral microbiome. And as in the gut, different types of bacteria compete for space. When all the species are in balance, the gums are protected from disease-causing bacteria. Disturbing this balance provides an opening for pathogens to invade, causing periodontal disease, which further disrupts the bacterial balance.
          Pathogenic bacteria initiate periodontal disease; however, they aren't the only — or even the major — culprits. Yesterday we used to think that bacteria destroyed tissue; today scientists understand that it's inflammation caused by the bacteria that destroys tissue. That is, the disease-causing bacteria trigger a response from the body's immune system, and the white blood cells summoned to eradicate them produce substances that not only destroy bacteria but also damage gum tissue.
        
        
          Gum disease's effects throughout the body
          The effects of periodontal disease range from mild redness and swelling of the gums (gingivitis) to complete destruction of the tooth's bony support structure (advanced periodontitis), which is responsible for tooth loss.
          Over the years, people with periodontal disease have been found to be at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, pregnancy complications, and dementia. We don't yet know if periodontal disease actually causes other health problems, or if people with chronic health issues have more difficulty taking care of their teeth and gums. It's an association, not a proven cause-and-effect relationship. But inflammation, which plays a role in all these conditions, seems to be the link.
          Moreover, the association probably works both ways. For example, diabetes research has determined that successfully treating periodontitis reduces the severity of diabetes and vice versa.
        
        
          Preventing periodontal disease
          The following, which either help to prevent bacterial infection or reduce inflammation, are still the best ways to reduce your risk of gum disease.
          Brush and floss. Brush your teeth at least twice a day, and floss before bedtime. If you have bridges, implants, or wide spaces between your teeth, you may want to use interdental brushes — toothpick-like implements with tiny bristles at one end—to clear trapped food.
          Don't smoke. People who smoke up to a half a pack of cigarettes per day are almost three times as likely as nonsmokers to have periodontitis; those who smoke more than a pack and a half of cigarettes per day have almost six times the risk.
          Eat a healthy diet. A diet rich in vegetables and vegetable oils, fruits, legumes, nuts, and fatty fish not only provides all the essential nutrients, but it helps suppress inflammation. There is some evidence that people whose diets are high in omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fatty fish, have a reduced risk of periodontal disease.
          Have regular dental check-ups and cleanings. Your dentist or dental hygienist can remove bacteria-harboring plaque and spot the first signs of periodontal disease.
          Get treatment at the first signs of gum disease. Swollen, bleeding gums; pockets of pus; or gums that have pulled away from your teeth are the most dramatic signs of periodontal disease. Subtler changes, such as widening spaces between your teeth, and bridges or partial dentures that don't fit as well as they once did, may also signal periodontitis.

          Q.
          My fitness club recently measured my body fat at 14%. What are the normal ranges for older men, and is body fat percentage a good way to determine a healthy weight?
        
        A. A 14% body fat is considered excellent for a healthy male, but it may not indicate a ""healthy"" weight. Body fat percentage, just like weight, depends on multiple factors that can vary per person, such as overall health, metabolism (how your body burns excess calories for energy or stores them as fat), amount of activity, and musculature.
        Also, where you store body fat has a significant impact on health risks. Even if your weight is close to the normal range, a large waist size may mean you have an unhealthy amount of belly fat (visceral fat). Larger amounts of belly fat increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Therefore, it's possible that you could have a good overall body fat percentage yet still be at higher risk if the fat is concentrated at your waistline.
        Rather than just relying on one measurement like body fat percentage or body mass index (a calculation based on both weight and height) to determine if you are overweight, I suggest using two measurements: waist size and ratio of waist size to hip size.
        
          
            Waist size. Wrap a measuring tape just above your navel to find your waist size. Ideally men should strive for 35 inches or less.
          
          
            Ratio of waist size to hip size. Measure your hips around the widest part of your buttocks. Then divide your waist size by your hip size. The ideal waist-to-hip ratio for men is 0.9. If your number is higher, you may have too much belly fat.

Just think how good it feels to have a nice chat with a friend. Those feelings can be hard to come by if your loved ones are far away or you've lost touch with friends.
        But the benefits of an active social life are significant, going beyond warm, fuzzy feelings. Connection brings a treasure trove of important health benefits and cognitive perks. And if you've been more isolated or out of touch with friends lately, it's time to take back your social life and reap the rewards.
        Connection and cognition
        Many studies suggest that having strong social networks (friends who support or help you) or taking part in social activities is associated with a reduced risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia.
        For example, a study of more 66,000 people in Europe and Israel (average age 70), published online Oct. 25, 2021, by Ageing & Society, found that people with the highest levels of social connectedness (good friends) and engagement (activities) had the highest scores on cognition tests, compared with people who had the lowest levels of social connectedness and engagement.
        And an earlier study of 1,100 adults (average age about 80) followed for five years found that the people who were the most socially active had 70% less cognitive decline compared with those who had the lowest rates of social activities.
        These studies were observational and don't prove conclusively that socializing protects cognition, but we know that it engages the brain in ways that promote better cognition. ""Social activities cause us to use our brains more than almost any other activity,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a neurologist and chief of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology at VA Boston Healthcare System. ""All of our senses — vision, hearing, smell — are engaged during social activities. We process people's facial expression, body language, tone of voice, and speech content, and analyze what's being said and the emotions behind the words. In turn, that influences how we react: our facial expression, body language, tone of voice, speech, and actions. Putting the brain to work like that strengthens the connections between brain cells and creates new ones, too.""
        Other health benefits
        Beyond cognition, socialization also appears to help with the following aspects of health.
        Longevity. Being social protects us against loneliness and isolation, which are associated with chronic disease and premature death.
        Stress reduction. ""People are emotion regulators. When someone you trust listens to you, you can feel your body calm down. Your blood pressure returns to baseline, your levels of stress hormones decrease. It takes us out of 'fight or flight' mode, which can gradually break down the body if we're stressed all the time,"" says Dr. Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Mood. ""The way people react to you reminds you of aspects of yourself, aspects that you may forget. It gets you out of your own head and your worries, and reinforces your sense of being competent. That boosts your mood,"" Dr. Waldinger notes. ""And connecting with people you haven't spoken to in a long time can remind you that you have this history with these people, you belong to this group, and you matter. That also boosts mood.""
        Reach out to friends
        All of us tend to lose touch with old friends. People move; circumstances change. But it's worth the effort to have some social interaction in your life, even if it's not in person.
        How do you get the ball rolling? Dr. Waldinger suggests something low-key. ""Send a card, an email, a text, or a message on Facebook,"" he says. ""You just want to see if someone might reply.""
        What should you say in the initial contact, especially if it's been a long time? ""Just say you're thinking of the person and want to see how they're doing,"" Dr. Waldinger advises.
        Other icebreakers include saying you were thinking about how you used to do a particular activity together, or sharing a nice memory of something you both experienced, such as a graduation or a successful project. You might even include a one- or two-sentence update on how you're doing and what you've been up to lately.
        What happens next? ""See if the person reciprocates,"" Dr. Waldinger says. ""If so, build from there. Ask if the person would like to have coffee or take a walk with you sometime soon. If the person is far away, ask they're available for a catch-up phone call or video chat.""
        Keep up the connection
        It may take time to rebuild the closeness or the frequency of contact you once had with a friend, if that's what you both want. So be patient, and keep reaching out to the person.
        How much contact will it take to boost your cognition and health? ""We don't have an amount of social connection that is 'enough' or a lower amount that is 'not enough.' Studies suggest that more is better, and some is better than none for improving your thinking and memory,"" Dr. Budson says.
        So why not rekindle several friendships? If they bring you joy, and if they offer important, healthy side effects, then you have nothing to lose and much to gain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-bitter-truth-about-added-sugar,The bitter truth about added sugar,"Extra sugar can cause big health problems. Here's how you can reduce your intake.
        
        
          
        
        There's a good chance you eat way too much sugar every day — and don't even know it.
        American adults consume an average of 77 grams (almost 20 teaspoons) of sugar per day, which adds up to around 60 pounds of added sugar per year, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).
        Added sugar refers to sugars and syrups that are included in food products and beverages to increase sweetness and texture and extend shelf life. (This is different from natural sugar found in fruit, vegetables, and dairy.)
        A little extra sugar may seem harmless, but ingested often, it can contribute to a variety of health issues, like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. ""There's consistent evidence that all that excessive added sugar intake is a significant threat to one's health,"" says Dr. Qi Sun, an associate professor of nutrition at Harvard-affiliated T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        
          Where the sugar is
        
        Sugar-sweetened drinks are the largest source of added sugar in the American diet. They include any of the following:
        
          regular soda
          juice drinks, like fruit punch and juice cocktails
          energy drinks
          sports drinks
          sweet tea
          sweetened coffee drinks
        
        Whole (100%) juices, which contain only the sugars from the extracted fruit or vegetable are healthier, but you don't get the benefits of fiber and other natural ingredients as you do in whole fruit. Many food products also contain high amounts of added sugar, even if they are not always sweet-tasting. The most common are fruit-flavored yogurt, breakfast cereals, processed instant meals, soups, tomato sauces, snacks, and cured meats. Another source of added sugar is condiments, such as ketchup, relish, barbecue sauce, and salad dressings.
        
          
            
              
                
                  Look closer at food labels
                
                Added sugars are identified on a product's ingredient label. They often are called by names other than ""sugar."" Here are the ones you should look for, according to the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2015–2020:
              
            
            
              
                agave nectar
                brown sugar
                cane crystals
                cane sugar
                corn sweetener
                corn syrup
              
              
                crystalline fructose
                dextrose
                evaporated cane juice
                fructose
                fruit juice concentrates
                glucose
              
              
                honey
                invert sugar
                lactose
                malt sugar
                malt syrup
              
              
                maltose
                maple syrup
                molasses
                raw sugar
                sucrose
              
            
          
        
        
          Too much is too much
        
        Research has found that too much added sugar can affect your health in many ways.
        For instance, a study published online Sept. 3, 2019, by JAMA Internal Medicine looked at more than 450,000 people over a 16-year period and found that those who drank two or more 8-ounce glasses of sugar-sweetened soda a day had a higher risk of dying for any reason than people who drank less than a glass each month. Drinking large amounts of artificially sweetened sodas was also associated with earlier death.
        Consuming too much sugar also can increase chronic inflammation. And higher sugar consumption has also been linked to a higher risk of frailty as we age. A study in the May 2018 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that older adults who consumed more than 36 grams per day of added sugar were more likely to become frail compared with those who consumed less than 15 grams daily.
        One of the biggest threats from added sugar is weight gain. Your body doesn't know the difference between natural sugar and added sugar. They both get processed the same way. The important difference is how fast the body digests them. ""Foods with natural sugar — fruits and vegetables — also contain soluble fiber, which means your body digests the accompanying sugars more slowly,"" says Dr. Sun. In comparison, added sugar lacks fiber, so it's absorbed much faster. ""This can cause blood sugar levels to spike, leading to an insulin surge, which can increase hunger,"" says Dr. Sun.
        
          
            
              
                
                  Substitutes for sugar
                
                Another way to avoid added sugar is to switch it out for other sweeteners. Add whole or frozen fruit to cereal or oatmeal, tea, and yogurt. Also, try antioxidant-rich spices like ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
              
            
          
        
        
          Manage your intake
        
        The AHA suggests men consume no more than 36 grams (about 9 teaspoons) of added sugar per day. This is approximately equal to what's in a 12-ounce can of soda. The best ways to control your intake of added sugar are to read food labels and cut out sugar-sweetened beverages, suggests Dr. Sun.
        ""For labels, note the number of grams of sugar per serving and the total number of servings,"" he says. ""The label might say 5 grams of sugar per serving, but you might eat three or four servings, so you end up consuming a lot more added sugar."" A good rule is to choose products that have less than 10 grams per serving and to monitor how many servings you eat.
        Instead of buying sugar-sweetened beverages, make your own healthier versions. Begin with plain or sparkling water and then add slices of fresh fruit or an ounce or two of 100% fruit juice for flavor.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-silver-lining-for-migraine-sufferers-2019032716274,A silver lining for migraine sufferers?,"Could there be any benefit associated with having migraine headaches? Most migraine patients would agree this is an odd question. Migraine is a common, inherited, lifelong, and often debilitating illness that impacts people most during their productive working and parenting years. It has been associated with a higher risk of vascular disorders such as stroke and heart attack, and psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety. What could possibly be good about migraine?
        Migraines may protect against type 2 diabetes
        But maybe there is some good news. A study published in JAMA Neurology suggests that, at least in women, having a diagnosis of active migraine is somewhat protective against the development of type 2 diabetes. In this study, which followed nearly 75,000 women for 10 years, women with active migraine were 20% to 30% less likely to develop type 2 diabetes over the course of the study than women with no history of migraine. In addition, if the migraine condition improved and the headaches lessened, the chances of developing diabetes went up. This supports the notion that migraine is protective against developing diabetes, and this is not simply a chance association.
        Headache specialists had long observed that their migraine patient populations did not develop diabetes as frequently as the general population, so this finding was not entirely unexpected. The reason for this relationship, though, remains unclear; after all, what could it be about having a headache that could make your blood sugar and insulin function improve? Looked at the other way around, one consideration could be that elevated blood sugar levels are somehow protective against developing a headache. Yet another explanation may have to do with CGRP, a protein molecule in the body that is active in both conditions and may be the factor that links them.
        This was a large, well-conducted study. Two limitations were that it only studied women and that the population studied was a rather homogenous group of mostly white professionals. Nonetheless, experts feel that the findings can likely be generalized to other populations.
        Migraines may protect against alcoholism
        There is another beneficial effect of migraine: research has suggested that migraine sufferers are relatively protected against the development of alcoholism. This may be a more intuitive relationship than with diabetes, since many people with migraine report that they avoid alcohol because it can trigger headache.
        Migraines may have offered an evolutionary advantage
        The possible evolutionary advantages of migraine have also been studied. As a rule, conditions that impair the function of an individual should lead to poorer survival in the long run and eventual dying out of the trait. And yet, after millions of years, migraine survives and thrives.
        Several evolutionary explanations have been cited. One is that migraine may have originally evolved as a protective alarm system against toxins entering the body. Avoiding the ingestion of toxic substances because they produce headache could result in improved health and evolutionary advantage, compared to individuals without headache who might overuse such substances and thus suffer undesirable consequences. The migraine that we know today may have developed as a result of overactivity or oversensitization of that evolutionarily important early warning system.
        However small the practical and daily consequence to those who suffer its effects, migraine may in fact have one or more silver linings after all.","Paul Rizzoli, MD","October 20, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/tips-for-healthy-eating-away-from-home,Tips for healthy eating away from home,"With today's hectic lifestyles, most of us end up eating out at least once a week. That could mean grabbing a sandwich from the supermarket deli counter for lunch, ordering take-out for dinner, or splurging on a special meal at a favorite restaurant.
        Meals away from home make it harder to control ingredients, calories, and portions. This can be particularly challenging for people with type 2 diabetes (and for those of us trying to avoid getting this condition). The following tips can help you enjoy eating out without abandoning your efforts to eat well:
        Ask how the food is prepared. Before you order, ask about ingredients and how the menu selections are prepared. Try to choose dishes made with whole grains, healthy oils, vegetables, and lean proteins. Meat that has been broiled, poached, baked, or grilled is a more health-conscious option than fried foods or dishes prepared with heavy sauces.
        Look for less. Your eyes are the perfect instrument for sizing up portion sizes. Use your estimating techniques to size up the food on your plate.
        
          1 thumb tip = 1 teaspoon of peanut butter, butter, or sugar
          1 finger = 1 oz. of cheese
          1 fist = 1 cup cereal, pasta, or vegetables
          1 handful = 1 oz. of nuts or pretzels
          1 palm = 3 oz. of meat, fish, or poultry
        
        Plan on eating half your meal and take the rest home to enjoy for lunch or dinner the next day.
        Order an extra side of veggies. Non-starchy vegetables, such as green beans, broccoli, asparagus, or summer squash, will help you fill up with low-calorie choices.
        Think ahead. Learn important nutrition information ahead of time. Most fast-food chains provide calories, sodium, and fat content for their menu items. Check out www.calorieking.com for a listing of over 50,000 foods, including many restaurant items. You can also visit company-specific websites (such as www.mcdonalds.com or www.pizzahut.com) for nutrition breakdowns, or call and request a pamphlet. Many locations display posters with this type of nutrition information.",Unknown,"October 20, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/exercising-safely-with-diabetes,Exercising safely with diabetes,"If you have diabetes, exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. It can improve your sensitivity to insulin and help you build muscle and shed excess fat, all of which go a long way to keeping your blood sugar levels under control. However, you'll likely need to take a few more precautions when exercising than someone who doesn't have diabetes.
        First, consult your doctor before starting or changing a fitness routine. This is especially important if you are overweight or have a history of heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetic neuropathy. For people who are 35 or older and who have had diabetes for more than 10 years, current guidelines recommend a visit to your doctor to discuss your plans before beginning a new exercise program. Although not performed routinely, your doctor may order an exercise tolerance test (also known as a treadmill test) to monitor the performance of your heart and your blood pressure during exercise. The results can help you and your doctor determine the intensity of exercise that's best for you.
        In general, the best time to exercise is one to three hours after eating, when your blood sugar level is likely to be higher. If you use insulin, it's important to test your blood sugar before exercising. If the level before exercise is below 100 mg/dL, eating a piece of fruit or having a small snack will boost it and help you avoid hypoglycemia. Testing again 30 minutes later will show whether your blood sugar level is stable.
        Because of the dangers associated with diabetes, always wear a medical alert bracelet indicating that you have diabetes and whether you take insulin. Also, keep hard candy or glucose tablets with you while exercising in case your blood sugar drops precipitously.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/are-certain-types-of-sugars-healthier-than-others-2019052916699,Are certain types of sugars healthier than others?,"Most people consume many different types of sugars from a variety of foods and beverages in their diet. A high intake of sugar is linked to an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. But whether some sugars are healthier (or worse) than others remains a question of interest to many.
        Sugar basics
        Sugar provides energy that our cells need to survive. Sugar is a type of carbohydrate, a macronutrient that provides energy (in the form of calories) from foods and beverages we consume. Carbohydrates are classified into two subtypes of sugar: monosaccharides, or ""simple sugars"" (consisting of one molecule),` and disaccharides (two molecules). The monosaccharides include glucose, fructose, and galactose. The major disaccharides include sucrose (one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule), lactose (one glucose molecule and one galactose molecule), and maltose (two glucose molecules).
        Fructose, glucose, and sucrose are found naturally in fruit and some vegetables, while lactose is found in dairy and maltose is found in germinating grains. Fructose and glucose are also found naturally in honey, as well as in common table sugar.
        Added versus natural sugars
        An increasingly important distinction among sugars as they pertain to health is whether they occur naturally in foods such as fruit, vegetables, and dairy, or whether they are added sugars (added to foods and beverages during manufacturing, processing, or preparation).
        Sugary beverages are the greatest source of added sugar in the diet, followed by sweets and grains such as ready-to-eat cereals. Intake of added sugar, particularly from beverages, has been associated with weight gain and higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
        Natural and added sugars are metabolized the same way in our bodies. But for most people, consuming natural sugars in foods such as fruit is not linked to negative health effects, since the amount of sugar tends to be modest and is ""packaged"" with fiber and other healthful nutrients. On the other hand, our bodies do not need, or benefit from, eating added sugar.
        Are all added sugars created equal?
        Added sugars come from a variety of sources and go by many different names, yet they are all a source of extra calories and are metabolized by the body the same way. A common misconception exists that some added sugars such as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) are unhealthy, while others such as agave nectar (from the succulent plant) are healthy.
        The reality is that most added sugars are composed of glucose and fructose in varying ratios. For example, sucrose (common table sugar) is 50% glucose and 50% fructose; the most common form of HFCS (which is produced from corn starch through industrial processing) contains 45% glucose and 55% fructose; and some types of agave nectar contain up to 90% fructose and 10% glucose.
        Whether an added sugar contains more or less fructose versus glucose has little impact on health. Some types of added sugar — honey, for example — may also contain micronutrients or other bioactive compounds. But these properties have little benefit when it comes to metabolic health.
        In short, it's best to limit all sources of added sugar to within the recommended intake level. For most people, one type of sugar isn't better than another.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sleep-paralysis-causes-symptoms-and-treatments,"Sleep paralysis: Causes, symptoms, and treatments","For many people, sleep paralysis is a distressing condition affecting their sleep and emotional health. While there is still much to learn about sleep paralysis, understanding the source of sleep paralysis symptoms can help with treatment and prevention.
        What is sleep paralysis?
        Sleep paralysis is a temporary sense of paralysis that occurs between stages of wakefulness and sleep. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you are conscious but unable to move or speak.
        One of the primary differences between sleep paralysis and other sleep states such as dreaming and nightmares is that you are awake during an episode of sleep paralysis.
        Types of sleep paralysis
        There are two types of sleep paralysis:
        
          Isolated sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis is isolated when it appears without any other signs of narcolepsy or other sleep disorders. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder in which a person may frequently fall into sudden episodes of deep sleep at any time.
          Recurrent sleep paralysis. This condition involves multiple sleep paralysis episodes over time. Recurrent sleep paralysis can be associated with narcolepsy.
        
        In many cases, both types of sleep paralysis occur together. In this case, you may experience recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (RISP). RISP involves ongoing instances of sleep paralysis without an association with narcolepsy.
        When does sleep paralysis typically occur?
        Sleep paralysis usually occurs when
        
          falling asleep
          waking from sleep
          at both times.
        
        Sleep paralysis is considered a parasomnia, or an abnormal behavior that occurs during sleep. Because it is linked to the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of the sleep cycle, sleep paralysis is considered a REM parasomnia.
        During REM, the eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming occurs, but the muscles of the body are relaxed to reduce movement. This muscle relaxation is controlled by the brain and called REM atonia. The purpose of atonia is to keep you from acting out your dreams, and typically ends when you wake up.
        However, during sleep paralysis you wake up suddenly from REM, regaining awareness even as your muscles are still relaxed, in atonia. For this reason, sleep paralysis may feel like temporary paralysis. In addition to atonia, the mental imagery of REM sleep also seems to persist even as you are in an aware state.
        How long does sleep paralysis last?
        An episode of sleep paralysis can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The episode usually ends on its own, or when someone moves or touches you or speaks to you. Making an intense effort to move can also end an episode.
        What does an episode of sleep paralysis feel like?
        An episode of sleep paralysis often involves hallucinations that can be frightening or cause anxiety. Hallucinations during sleep paralysis fall into three categories.
        
          Intruder hallucinations involve a sense of evil or a disturbing presence in the room, such as a bedroom intruder.
          Chest pressure hallucinations describe a sense of pressure on the chest, often accompanied by sensations of being choked or suffocated.
          Vestibular-motor (V-M) hallucinations can include feelings of movement, such as flying or out-of-body sensations.
        
        Can you die from sleep paralysis?
        Sleep paralysis can be frightening and can cause emotional distress for some people. However, it usually does not happen frequently enough to cause significant health effects, and is not a serious medical risk on its own.
        People who experience recurrent or frightening episodes may develop unhealthy sleep habits to avoid sleep, leading to sleep deprivation. This can have negative effects on a person's health.
        Symptoms of sleep paralysis
        Sleep paralysis may involve such symptoms as:
        
          inability to move the arms, legs, body, and head when falling asleep or waking up
          inability to speak
          full awareness of what is happening
          hallucinations.
        
        Episodes last from a few seconds to a few minutes, and may occur once in a person's life or repeatedly over their lifetime.
        What causes sleep paralysis?
        While the exact cause of sleep paralysis is not understood, research has linked certain sleep habits to the condition:
        
          inadequate sleep
          an irregular sleep schedule or a sleep schedule that often changes (this is often the case for shift workers)
          sleeping on your back.
        
        In addition, sleep paralysis has also been linked with
        
          sleep disorders such as narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a disorder that causes sudden episodes of deep sleep caused by a problem with the brain's ability to regulate sleep.
          some mental conditions, such as bipolar disorder, PTSD, or panic or anxiety disorders
          use of certain medicines, such as for ADHD
          substance use
          alcohol use.
        
        Many people report stressful events or an emotional experience preceding the episodes.
        In addition, research suggests there may be a genetic predisposition to this condition.
        How is sleep paralysis diagnosed?
        Sleep paralysis can affect men and women. It can be seen at any age, though it tends to first appear in the teen years. After appearing during the teenage years, episodes can occur more frequently in later years.
        If you experience episodes of sleep paralysis that make you feel anxious or if you have repeated episodes of sleep paralysis, speak with your doctor. It is possible that sleep paralysis may be due to another medical problem that needs further attention.
        To learn more about how sleep paralysis is affecting your health, your doctor may ask about your symptoms, sleep habits, and factors that affect your sleep. You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire about your sleep, or even complete a sleep diary to help identify sleeping patterns.
        Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may refer you to a sleep specialist for further diagnosis, testing, and treatment.
        Your doctor may have you do a sleep study called a polysomnography. In this procedure, small wafer-thin electrodes and other sensors are pasted on specific body sites to take a variety of readings during the night. The sensors will record muscle activity, movements, breathing, blood oxygen level, heart rate, and rhythm.
        Readings are collected on a single printout (called a polysomnogram) and analyzed by a technician and physician. If a breathing problem is detected early on, you may be awakened and given treatment, such as PAP, during the second half of the night. This allows the sleep experts to monitor how well the treatment works for you.
        Your doctor may also want you to take one or more daytime sleep tests as well. One test, called a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), measures how long it takes you to drift off while lying down in a quiet room. The procedure is usually repeated four or five times during the day at two-hour intervals. The test also determines what stages of sleep you experience during a brief nap.
        MSLT can help to show if your sleep paralysis is a sign of narcolepsy. Falling asleep within eight minutes each time indicates extreme sleepiness. A person who enters REM sleep very quickly (within about 20 minutes) during two or more naps may also have narcolepsy.
        How to prevent sleep paralysis
        If you experience occasional sleep paralysis, one of the best ways to prevent sleep paralysis episodes is to improve the quality of your sleep.
        Try any of these sleep hygiene techniques to help improve sleep quality and prevent sleep paralysis:
        
          Get adequate sleep. Try to get seven to nine hours of sleep per night on a regular basis.
          Keep a consistent sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at consistent times every day, including on weekends.
          Create an ideal sleep environment. Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet.
          Ensure your mattress and pillow suit your body's needs. Choose a pillow that keeps your neck and head naturally in alignment. Your mattress needs will depend on the level of firmness that feels best to your body. Memory foam mattresses boast the benefit of molding to your body's pressure points.
          Reduce distractions. Avoid using electronic devices before going to bed.
          Relax before bed by taking a bath, reading, or listening to soothing music.
          Try new sleeping positions if you sleep on your back. Sleep experts have found a correlation between sleeping on your back and sleep paralysis.
          Do what you can to ease stress in your life, especially just before bedtime.
          Curb substance use: avoid alcohol intake, especially in the evening, and steer clear of nicotine altogether.
          Reduce caffeine intake. If you can't or don't want to give up caffeine, avoid it after 2 p.m.
        
        If you are diagnosed with narcolepsy or another sleep disorder, a sleep doctor will work with you to find a treatment plan for your disorder.
        If you are diagnosed with a mental health condition such as anxiety or bipolar disorder, your doctor will oversee your ongoing treatment with medication and behavioral therapy to help treat your mental health condition. Treating your underlying mental health condition may help resolve sleep paralysis.
        Be sure to see your doctor if sleep paralysis routinely stops you from getting a good night's sleep.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/eat-these-fruits-for-their-anti-inflammatory-benefits,Eat these fruits for their anti-inflammatory benefits,"They're nature's original desserts. And naturally sweet fruits are essential in protecting our bodies from disease.
        Eating at least one-and-a-half to two cups of diverse fruits every day can boost antioxidant activity. Fruits are particularly abundant in anti-inflammatory compounds, which are important in protecting our bodies from heart disease, diabetes, and certain forms of cancer and bowel disease.
        How to get enough healthful fruits in your diet? One strategy is to eat with the seasons, choosing grapes and stone fruits in the summer, apples and pears in the fall, persimmons and pomegranates in the winter, and citrus and cherries in the spring.
        While all fruits tend to be rich in disease-protective nutrients, some have received particular attention in the nutrition world for their anti-inflammatory benefits.
        Berries. From strawberries and blackberries to cranberries and blue­berries, these gemlike fruits are particularly potent in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Along with fiber and vitamin C, berries possess plant pigment phytochemicals, such as anthocyanins and ellagic acid, which may be behind their health benefits. Studies have linked increased berry consumption with lower risks of heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes.
        Apples. Maybe it's true what they say about an apple a day. A study of nearly 35,000 women, found that consumption of this fruit — along with its relative, pears — was linked with a lower risk of death from heart disease. The star components of apples — fiber, vitamin C, pectin, and polyphenols — have been associated, primarily in animal studies, with anti-inflammatory effects and an increase in beneficial microbes in the gut.
        Stone fruits. Cherries, peaches, apricots, and plums are all examples of stone fruits. These fruits contain fiber, vitamin C, potassium, and a variety of phytochemicals associated with their colors. For example, cherries have garnered the lion's share of the research among stone fruits. Some studies suggest that cherries can reduce pain and soreness after exercise as well as a reduced risk of gout attacks. The high levels of phenolic compounds in cherries, which have been linked to reduced inflammation, may be behind those benefits.
        Citrus. Oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes are famously rich in vitamin C. They also contain fiber, potassium, calcium, B vitamins, copper, and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals such as flavonoids and carotenoids. Though there is little human research on citrus, the nutrients found in citrus fruits have been associated with heart-protective effects.
        Pomegranates. Those tiny pomegranate seeds contain big rewards of vitamins C and K, potassium, fiber, and potent phytochemicals such as anthocyanin and resveratrol. These nutrients may be behind the potential benefits of eating pomegranates.
        Grapes. These succulent fruits are burst­ing with fiber, vitamins C and K, and powerful phytochemicals.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/healthy-lifestyle-can-prevent-diabetes-and-even-reverse-it-2018090514698,Healthy lifestyle can prevent diabetes (and even reverse it),"The rate of type 2 diabetes is increasing around the world. Type 2 diabetes is a major cause of vision loss and blindness, kidney failure requiring dialysis, heart attacks, strokes, amputations, infections, and even early death. Over 80% of people with prediabetes (that is, high blood sugar with the high risk for developing full-blown diabetes) don't know it. And one in four people who have full-blown diabetes don't know they have it. Research suggests that a healthy lifestyle can prevent diabetes from occurring in the first place — and even reverse its progress.
        Can a healthy diet and lifestyle prevent diabetes?
        The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a large, long-term study, asked the question: we know an unhealthy diet and lifestyle can cause type 2 diabetes, but can adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle prevent it? This answer is yes: the vast majority of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be prevented through diet and lifestyle changes, and this has been proven by 20 years of medical research.
        Researchers from the DPP took people at risk for type 2 diabetes and gave them a 24-week diet and lifestyle intervention, a medication (metformin), or a placebo (a fake pill), to see if anything could lower their risk for developing diabetes. The very comprehensive diet and lifestyle intervention had the goal of changing participants' daily habits, and included: 16 classes teaching basic nutrition and behavioral strategies for weight loss and physical activity; lifestyle coaches with frequent contact with participants; supervised physical activity sessions; and good clinical support for reinforcing an individualized plan.
        Perhaps not surprisingly, the diet and lifestyle intervention was incredibly effective. After three years, the diet and lifestyle group had a 58% lower risk of developing diabetes than the placebo group. Participants ages 60 and older had an even better response, with a whopping 71% lower risk of developing diabetes. The diet and lifestyle effect lasted: even after 10 years, those folks had a 34% lower risk of developing diabetes compared to placebo.
        Men, women, and all racial and ethnic groups had similar results (and almost half of participants represented racial and ethnic minorities). These results are not surprising to me or to other doctors, because we have all seen patients with prediabetes or diabetes get their sugars down with diet, exercise, and weight loss alone.
        Meanwhile, the medication group had a 31% lower risk of diabetes after three years, and an 18% lower risk after 10 years, which is also significant. It's perfectly all right to use medications along with diet and lifestyle changes, because each boosts the effect of the other. Studies looking at the combination of medication (metformin) with diet and lifestyle changes have shown an even stronger result.
        Dietary recommendations to prevent diabetes (and even reverse it)
        
          Decrease intake of added sugars and processed foods, including refined grains like white flour and white rice. This especially includes sugary drinks, not only sodas but also juices. The best drinks are water, seltzer, and tea or coffee without sugar.
          Swap out refined grains for whole grains. Whole grains are actually real grains that haven't been stripped of nutrients in processing. Foods made from 100% whole grain (like whole wheat) are okay, but intact whole grains (like farro, quinoa, corn, oatmeal, and brown rice) are even better.
          Increase fiber intake. High-fiber foods include most vegetables and fruits. Legumes are also high in fiber and healthy plant protein. Legumes include lentils, beans, chickpeas, peas, edamame, and soy. People who eat a lot of high-fiber foods tend to eat fewer calories, weigh less, and have a lower risk of diabetes.
          Increase fruit and vegetable intake. At least half of our food intake every day should be nonstarchy fruits and vegetables, the more colorful the better. Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, and high-fiber fruits like berries of all kinds, are especially healthy.
          Eat less meat, and avoid processed red meat. Many studies have shown us that certain meats are incredibly risky for us. People who eat processed red meat are far more likely to develop diabetes: one serving a day (which is two slices of bacon, two slices of deli meat, or one hot dog) is associated with over a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Eating even a small portion of red meat daily (red meat includes beef, lamb, and pork), like a palm-sized piece of steak, is associated with a 20% increased risk of type 2 diabetes. In fact, the less meat you eat, the lower your risk of diabetes. People who don't eat red meat at all, but do eat chicken, eggs, dairy, and fish, may significantly lower their risk of developing type 2 diabetes, by about 30%; those who eat only fish, 50%; those who eat only eggs and dairy, 60%; those who are vegan, 80%.
          Eat healthier fats. Fat is not necessarily bad for you. What kind of fat you're eating really does matter. Saturated fats, particularly from meats, are associated with an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease. Plant oils, such as extra-virgin olive oil and canola oil, carry less risk. Omega-3 fats, like in walnuts, flax seeds, and some fish, are actually quite good for you.
        
        Diet and lifestyle changes that can help prevent diabetes
        The CDC's Diabetes Prevention Program, used in many clinics, is a free tool to help you learn and stick with the healthy diet, physical activity, and stress management techniques that reduce your risk of diabetes.
        Another helpful tool is the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Nutrition Source Healthy Eating Plate, which shows you what your daily food intake should look like: half fruits and vegetables, about a quarter whole grains, and a quarter healthy proteins (plant protein is ideal here), with some healthy fats and no-sugar-added beverages.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/rare-and-often-aggressive-merkel-cell-cancer-is-best-caught-early-202310162982,"Rare and often aggressive, Merkel cell cancer is best caught early","First, some good news: Merkel cell cancer is exceptionally uncommon. Roughly 1,600 cases occur in the US annually. But this rare skin cancer sometimes goes unnoticed initially. That's worrisome because it often metastasizes early — that is, spreads to other parts of the body such as the lungs and bones.

Here's what to know about Merkel cell skin cancer: where and how it starts, what it looks like, who is more likely to get it, how it's diagnosed and treated — and most importantly, steps you can take to help prevent it.

Where and how does Merkel cell cancer start?

Merkel cells are tiny oval-shaped cells found in the outermost layer of skin. Seen close to nerve endings, they help with the perception of touch.

Rarely, these cells begin to multiply uncontrollably, creating clusters of cancerous cells. Typically the tumors occur in regions that receive greater sun exposure, such as the face, neck, and back of the hand.

Sun exposure isn't the only factor, though. A virus called MCV, or Merkel cell polyomavirus, is thought to trigger development of this cancer in about 80% of all cases. Aging increases the risk of this cancer, and plays a role, too.

What does Merkel cell cancer look like?

It appears as a reddish or purplish bump on the skin and often grows rapidly. Most people don't experience any pain or itching.

Unfortunately, the tumor cells may spread to different parts of the body, including the brain, lungs, bones, and other areas of the skin. This may occur early: nearly half of people with Merkel cell cancer have metastases when first diagnosed.

Who is most likely to develop Merkel cell cancer?

Certain factors increase risk for developing Merkel cell cancer:


	age older than 65
	high exposure to ultraviolet light from sunlight or tanning beds
	fair skin
	family or personal history of skin cancers
	gender (men are more than twice as likely to be affected as women).


People are also more likely to get this cancer if their immune systems aren't strong because they


	take drugs that lower their immune response such as high doses of steroids
	have certain health problems such as blood disorders or HIV
	have had organ transplants and need to take immunosuppressive drugs.


What steps can you take to prevent Merkel cell cancer?

Protect your skin from the sun. Wear UV-protective clothing that covers your trunk, arms, and legs. Wide-brim hats can protect your scalp, face, and part of the neck. Regularly apply broad-spectrum sunscreen on all uncovered skin.

Do not use tanning beds. They increase your chance of developing skin cancers.

Visit your dermatologist regularly for a total skin check if you have had skin cancer, or if a family member (parent, sibling, or child) has had it.

Tell your dermatologist or medical team if you notice any skin changes. Any new mole, bump, or lump should be checked.

How do I find out if I have Merkel cell carcinoma?

If a dermatologist suspects you have Merkel cell cancer or another skin cancer, they will remove a small piece of the skin lesion to look at it under a microscope. This procedure will confirm if the lesion is skin cancer.

How is Merkel cell cancer treated?

Treatment depends on where the tumor is, its size, and whether it has spread. That can be determined by removing lymph nodes near the tumor and through scans.


	If the tumor has not spread: Surgical removal can be done to remove the tumor and a margin of normal skin around it.
	If cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body: Radiation treatment is an option. Chemotherapy, a treatment with medications, may be recommended, though it is not as effective as radiation. Immunotherapy, which can help the immune system recognize and kill cancer cells, is also an option in some cases.


There is a high risk that this cancer will come back after treatment. So people who have had it should regularly see a dermatologist or their cancer team for surveillance.",Lais Lopes Almeida Gomes,"October 16, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-skin-creams-are-most-effective-for-eczema-202310122981,Which skin creams are most effective for eczema?,"Quelling the discomfort of atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema, can be a daily quest. This inflamed, itchy skin condition can interfere with sleeping, socializing, and many other activities.
        If home remedies such as gentle cleansing and regular moisturizing don't provide relief, your doctor might recommend a prescription treatment to apply to your skin. Which prescription cream is most effective? A new study boils it down to a few overall winners.
        What is atopic dermatitis and the itch-scratch cycle?
        Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. The areas commonly affected include the face, hands, feet, or the skin folds of the elbows or behind the knees.
        We don't know exactly what causes atopic dermatitis. Genes, the environment, and an overactive immune system all seem to play a role in creating inflammation, which feels itchy. Scratching the itch creates more irritation and inflammation, which causes more itching.
        As the itch-scratch cycle continues, the rash gets worse. The skin might tear, ooze, and crust over, which can be painful.
        Which skin treatments were more effective in the study?
        Some prescription topical skin treatments for atopic dermatitis are more effective than others, according to a 2023 study published online by The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.
        Scientists evaluated more than 200 randomized trials involving more than 43,000 people with atopic dermatitis (average age 18). The researchers compared almost 70 different prescription creams or ointments, which are broadly called topical treatments and are designed to be applied to affected areas of skin.
        These treatments fall into five categories. If you have eczema, their generic names may or may not be familiar to you, but your medical team is likely to know them well:
        
          topical corticosteroids, divided into seven classes ranging from the most to the least potent, decrease the release of an inflammatory chemical called phospholipase A2
          topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors interrupt inflammatory signals as they enter cells
          topical PDE4 inhibitors raise the production of a chemical called phosphodiesterase-4, or PDE4, and lower the body's inflammatory response
          topical calcineurin inhibitors help suppress the production of chemical messengers that tell the body to ramp up its defenses
          other topical treatments, including antibiotics and prescription moisturizers.
        
        Researchers looked at which medications had outcomes important to patients, including which
        
          were best at improving quality of life
          were best at reducing eczema-related severity, itch, sleep disturbances, or flare-ups
          caused the fewest serious side effects
          were discontinued least often due to serious side effects.
        
        Which atopic dermatitis medications proved to be most effective?
        The study yielded some predictable results and a surprise. The overall winners were
        
          two calcineurin inhibitors: pimecrolimus (Elidel) and tacrolimus (Protopic)
          moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, a large group that includes fluocinolone acetonide (Synalar cream 0.025%) and triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog cream/ointment 0.1%).
        
        What did these medications improve?
        
          Pimecrolimus improved six of seven outcomes, and was among the best at reducing sleep disturbances and eczema flares.
          High-dose tacrolimus (0.1%) improved five outcomes, and was among the best at reducing itch and eczema flares.
          Moderate-potency steroids improved four to six of the seven outcomes, and were best at reducing eczema itch, flares, and serious side effects.
        
        ""That's in line with what we often prescribe,"" says Dr. Connie Shi, a dermatologist who often treats people with eczema at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""The strongest topical steroids appeared to be the most effective at reducing eczema severity in the study. However, for longer-term maintenance we may consider switching to a moderate-potency steroid, or one of the nonsteroid options, to minimize the risk of thinning the skin, which can occur with long-term use of topical steroids.""
        The surprise finding: the study found little to no effectiveness from using a topical cream twice daily versus just once daily. ""The traditional advice is twice daily,"" Dr. Shi says. ""Once a day would make it more convenient to use, and it may help people stay on their medication regimen without decreasing effectiveness.""
        Which treatments were less effective in this study? The researchers found that topical antibiotics were among the least effective treatments for eczema.
        Should you change your treatment?
        ""While the study included more than 40,000 people, what worked for participants may not always work for you, as different people may respond differently to the same treatment,"" Dr. Shi explains. ""There are many factors to consider when prescribing a treatment, including your age, the areas on your skin that are affected, the severity of the eczema, and potential side effects.""
        The bottom line? ""If a treatment regimen is working for you, then continue it, as long as you don't have any serious side effects,"" she says. ""If your current regimen isn't working well, talk with your doctor or a dermatologist to see if there's another prescription cream or ointment that you may want to try.""",Heidi Godman,"October 12, 2023"

So, it is important to ask how tightly blood glucose (also called blood sugar) should be controlled to decrease the risk of harm to these organs.
        Blood sugar: too high, too low, or just right?
        To answer this question, first let's discuss how diabetes is different than other chronic health conditions. For example, a doctor can tell you that your cholesterol levels need to be below a certain number to lower the risk of heart disease. Diabetes is different. Diabetes is a unique condition in which both high and low glucose levels are harmful to the body.
        Diabetes control is measured as A1c, which reflects average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. High glucose levels (A1c levels greater than 7% or 7.5%) over a long period can cause damage to the major organs of the body. However, medications and insulin that are used to lower glucose levels can overshoot and lead to glucose levels that are too low. Low glucose levels (known as hypoglycemia) can result in symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, excessive sweating, feeling dizzy, difficulty thinking, falling, or even passing out.
        So, both high and low glucose levels are harmful. Thus, diabetes management requires balancing the risk of high and low glucose levels, and requires constant assessment to see which of these glucose levels is more likely to harm an individual patient.
        Different blood sugar goals over a lifetime
        The next consideration in answering the question about tight glucose control is to understand why younger and older adults need different goals. In younger individuals, longer life expectancy means a higher risk of developing complications over many decades of life. Younger adults typically recover from hypoglycemic episodes without severe consequences.
        On the other hand, people in their 80s or 90s may not have several decades of life expectancy, and so the concern about developing long-term complications due to high glucose levels is decreased. However, hypoglycemia in these individuals may lead to immediate consequences such as falls, fractures, loss of independence, and subsequently a decline in quality of life.
        In addition, tighter control of diabetes frequently requires complicated treatment regimens, such as multiple insulin injections at different times of the day or a variety of glucose lowering pills. This further increases the risk of hypoglycemia, as well as stress, to both older patients and their caregivers at home.
        Identifying the why of blood sugar control
        Thus, when considering goals for blood glucose in older adults, it is important to ask why we are managing diabetes. As the reason to tightly control diabetes is to prevent complications in the future, tighter control of diabetes could be a goal in older adults who are in good health and have few risk factors for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia risk factors include previous history of severe hypoglycemia that required hospital or emergency department visits, memory problems, physical frailty, vision problems, and severe medical conditions such as heart, lung, or kidney diseases.
        In older individuals with multiple risk factors for hypoglycemia, the goal should not be tight control. Instead, the goal should be the best control that can be achieved without putting the individual at risk for hypoglycemia.
        Lastly, it is important to remember that health status is not always stable as we get older, and the need or ability to keep tight glucose control may change over time in older adults. Goals for all chronic disease, not just blood sugar control, need to be individualized to adapt to the changing circumstances associated with aging.

Many people have developed habits over 20, 30, or 40 years that are ingrained and can take a significant effort to modify. Does having a partner who is supportive and participatory help? A recent study demonstrated it can.
        The RESPONSE-2 Trial is a lifestyle intervention study that enrolled patients with coronary artery disease. More than 800 study participants were randomized into either a nurse-coordinated referral of patients and their partners to three widely available community-based lifestyle programs, or to usual care. The community-based intervention programs targeted weight reduction, increasing physical activity, and smoking cessation. Both the intervention and control groups continued to receive visits to their cardiologist, participate in cardiac rehab programs, and attend general counseling sessions on healthy lifestyles, risk factors, and medication adherence. Success was defined as improvement in one of the three risk factors without deterioration in the other two after 12 months.
        Results showed the proportion of successful patients who improved at least one of the lifestyle risk factors was 37% in the intervention group compared with 26% in the control group. Weight loss was the most successful component, with almost two times the number of patients achieving significant weight loss (at least 5% of starting weight) in the intervention group compared to the control group. Patients whose partner participated in the community-based program had the highest proportion of success.
        Modifiable lifestyle risk factors for heart disease
        It is well established that obesity puts you at risk for high cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes — all factors that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. By managing your weight through physical activity and healthy eating, you can reduce these risk factors, and thus decrease heart disease risk.
        How can a partner help?
        There are many challenges to improving our diet: what we eat, how much we eat, and where we eat, to name a few.
        What we eat: What is put on the table will translate into what we eat. A partner can develop a shopping list with you to determine what is brought into the house. You can create a menu together that is consistent with healthy eating guidelines. Limiting food brought into the house that is not heart-healthy can play a major role in someone's success. Once food is readily available, it is even more challenging for someone trying to modify their food intake. Making sure there are plenty of vegetables, fresh fruit, and lean protein, along with healthy fats, some low-fat dairy, and whole grains, can contribute to your success.
        How much we eat: Some people may eat mostly healthy foods, but they eat too much and therefore may struggle with their weight. A partner can help support you in preparing a reasonable amount of food so that there are not many leftovers. When plating food, you and your partner can use the ""balanced plate"" guidelines of 1/2 the plate with lower-calorie vegetables, 1/4 plate with lean protein, and 1/4 plate with whole grains or a healthy starch.
        
          
        
        Where we eat: Prior to the pandemic, Americans allocated a fair amount of their food dollar to consuming food away from home — as takeout, fast food, and in restaurants. With the shutdown of many establishments in 2020 and early 2021, cooking at home rose significantly. However, now that dining out has reopened, many Americans are resuming pre-pandemic habits. This can result in some meals being higher in overall calories, saturated fat, and sodium than home-cooked meals. A partner can help in the decision regarding how often and where to eat out. In addition, a partner can help choose restaurants where healthy options are readily available.
        Tips on healthy eating out
        Don't start out famished. Skipping meals or starving yourself can cause you to overeat! You may also find it difficult to avoid all those tempting foods.
        Don't feel like you have to eat everything on your plate. Send back what you don't want. Better yet, bring it home in a doggy bag and you'll enjoy the meal twice as much.
        Avoid nibbling. Listen to your body when it tells you it's full. Have the waiter or wait staff remove extra food from the table. The longer it stays, the more apt you will be to nibble.
        Eating is not meant to be a race. Eating too fast can lead to overeating, as it takes 20 minutes for your body to know it's full. So, take your time, put your fork down between bites, and focus on the social aspect of eating.
        Order a la carte. Who says you must order an entree? Make your own. You can choose any combination of appetizers, soups, salads, and side dishes. This allows more variety, and gives you more control over what and how much you eat.
        Longstanding habits are hard to change, but you can make small changes every day. A partner who is willing and able to support you in the change process may be a helpful resource for your success.","Katherine D. McManus, MS, RD, LDN","October 10, 2023"

          Q. I get headaches after drinking red wine. Why? I'm 56 years old and in excellent health.
        
        A. Getting a headache after drinking red wine seems to be common, but no single explanation has been found. Several theories have been proposed, but none has much evidence behind it.
        One theory holds that the culprit is histamine, a compound found in grape skins. Red wine contains more histamine than white wine because it's made from the whole grape (including the skin), not just the juice. Some people have a shortage of an enzyme that breaks down histamine in the small intestine. Alcohol also inhibits the enzyme, so the combination may boost histamine levels in the blood, which can dilate blood vessels and cause a headache.
        Tannins, another grape-skin constituent, could be at fault. Tannins are plant chemicals that impart flavor to red wines and contain antioxidants. But they also spur the release of certain chemicals called neurotransmitters associated with pain. 
        Some experts think that sulfites, a preservative in wine, are to blame. But many white wines and other foods also contain sulfites.
        These potential culprits vary from wine to wine, so if you don't want to give up red wine altogether, you might try different brands or grape varieties to see how they affect you. When you try a new red wine, start with less than half a drink. If it's going to give you a headache, it'll do so within 15 minutes.
        Any alcoholic beverage can dilate blood vessels in the brain and cause a headache. Avoid drinking wine, beer, or liquor on an empty stomach or when you're dehydrated. Try to drink a glass of water between glasses of wine. And limit your wine intake to no more than one glass per day. But if you have two at a sitting, they should be separated by at least an hour.",Unknown,"October 9, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/migraine-a-connection-to-cardiovascular-disease,Migraine: A connection to cardiovascular disease?,"Some people who get these intense, throbbing headaches may face a heightened risk of stroke and heart attack.
        
        
          
        
        About one in six adults in the United States reports having migraines, but these debilitating headaches are three times more prevalent in women. During a migraine attack, people often feel nauseated and are sensitive to light and sound. And up to a third of migraineurs experience odd visual or physical sensations known as an aura (see ""What is a migraine aura?"").
        Usually, the aura occurs soon before the headache, although some people experience just the aura without a headache. Both versions are known as migraine with aura or classic migraine. And both have long been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, especially stroke. But migraine sufferers should interpret this risk in context, says Dr. Christopher Anderson, chief of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        ""Migraines tend to be most common in younger women, and their baseline risk of stroke is quite low in the first place,"" Dr. Anderson explains. The latest evidence comes from a 2020 study in JAMA of nearly 28,000 women who were part of the Women's Health Study. All were ages 45 or older and had no evidence of cardiovascular disease when the study began in the early 1990s. Researchers tracked the women's health until 2018.
        Just 5% of the participants reported having migraine with aura. Their annual rate of heart attack, stroke, or death from cardiovascular disease was slightly higher (3.4 per 1,000 women) than the rate among women who had migraines without aura or no migraines (2.1 per 1,000 women).
        
          
            
              
                What is a migraine aura?
                A migraine aura refers to a visual or sensory disturbance that strikes within the hour before the headache takes hold. The vision changes often include a blind spot, known as a scotoma, that affects both eyes but just one side of the visual field.
                Although scotomas usually appear black in people with other conditions, in migraines they are typically white or gray (or rarely, colored). A scotoma typically appears as a shimmering or scintillating zigzag in the shape of a crescent that expands across one side of the visual field and eventually moves off into the peripheral vision. One common variant is called ""fortification spectrum,"" because the pattern of bright geometrical lines resemble the walls of a medieval fort.
                An aura can also cause tingling on one side of the body, especially in the face or hand. Occasionally, people experience language auras that cause transient speaking problems, which can also occur with a stroke or ministroke. Very rarely, an aura will cause one-sided weakness in a leg, arm, or the face; this is known as a hemiplegic migraine. Again, these symptoms can also occur with a stroke or ministroke.
              
            
          
        
        A shared mechanism?
        Experts aren't exactly sure what's behind this observation, but one theory points to a shared underlying mechanism. Migraines are thought to result from unusual patterns of electrical activity in the brain caused by sweeping waves of neurons firing and then turning off. A migraine aura may be a manifestation of this phenomenon, which doctors refer to as cortical spreading depression. ""It may reflect some sort of blood vessel instability that also makes people more prone to cardiovascular issues,"" says Dr. Anderson.
        If you get migraines with aura, there aren't any specific steps you can take to limit your cardiovascular risk. However, women who are 35 and older who have migraine with aura should be sure to tell their primary care provider or gynecologist about their headaches. Taking estrogen-containing birth control pills or hormone therapy may further raise stroke risk in these women. As a result, they might want to consider other, nonhormonal or estrogen-free treatment options. ""We don't necessarily want to dissuade women from taking hormonal medications, as the risk-and-benefit calculation is different for everyone,"" says Dr. Anderson. ""Just make sure all of your doctors are aware of all of your health conditions and current medications,"" he advises.
        Don't dismiss new symptoms
        Auras don't occur before every migraine, but once you've had one, you're considered to have classic migraine. However, in adulthood, people typically do not develop new symptoms during future migraines — most people seem to have their own particular, predictable version of these headaches. So if you experience a new symptom, don't dismiss it, says Dr. Anderson. For example, if your typical aura consists of flashes of light but you start to experience numbness or weakness in your hand, it could be something other than a migraine, he cautions. Seek emergency care as soon as possible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/when-headaches-wont-go-away,When headaches won't go away,"What to do when you have a headache that won't go away – and how to tell if it's a migraine.
        
        
          
        
        When one of her bad migraines hits, Jacqueline G. (last name withheld) can't do anything but lie down in a dark room and wait for the waves of pain to recede. ""It's completely debilitating,"" says the 73-yearold, who has been plagued by severe migraines since her 20s. ""The nausea comes on right away, and then I can't keep anything down—even crackers or ice. And it can last from early morning to 12 at night.""
        Migraines are a particularly disabling form of headache because they launch a four-tiered attack:
        
          The first strike is the prodrome (or preheadache), a sick or moody feeling that may set in a day or two before the actual headache starts.
          Next, for about 20% of migraine sufferers, comes the aura—flashing lights, bright spots, or other visual phenomena that distort or even interrupt sight for a few minutes to an hour.
          Then the migraine hits, a crescendo of headache that can involve throbbing pain and nausea, as well as increased sensitivity to sound and light.
          And finally, the postdrome may occur—a ""headache hangover"" that leaves you feeling tired and drained from the whole ordeal. This feeling can last for a day or more.
        
        Women are three times more likely to get migraine headaches than men, in part because the hormone estrogen ""primes the pump."" After menopause, migraine headaches in women usually become less frequent. Yet some women—like Jacqueline—continue to have migraines even after they've seen the last of their menstrual cycle.
        People who get migraines often have ""triggers"" that instigate their headaches. Common migraine triggers include:
        
          strong odors
          stress
          lack of sleep
          loud noises or bright lights
          changes in weather
          low blood sugar from skipping meals
          foods such as red wine, chocolate, aged cheeses, dried fruits, nuts, beans, cured meats, soups and bouillons made with the preservative monosodium glutamate (MSG), yeasty beers and breads, and diet drinks containing artificial sweeteners such as aspartame.
        
        
          How to get rid of migraine headaches
        
        The first step to help reduce migraine attacks is to try to remove the triggers. Keeping a headache diary can help pinpoint your migraine triggers. For one month, write down
        
          what time each headache started and ended
          the intensity and location of the pain (for example, behind your eyes or in the back of your head)
          what warning signs heralded the headache
          what you ate that day
          what you were doing before the headache hit (for example, exercising)
          what treatment you used, and whether it helped.
        
        Then, go over your diary with your primary care doctor, neurologist, or headache specialist to see where you can eliminate or modify triggers. If trigger avoidance isn't enough, your doctor might recommend migraine medications, which follow two therapeutic approaches:
        Acute treatments (also known as abortive therapies) relieve pain and nausea, but you need to take them at the first twinge of a headache. Examples include:
        Triptans—migraine-specific medicines that narrow blood vessels in the brain, such as frovatriptan (Frova), naratriptan (Amerge), zolmitriptan (Zomig), rizatriptan (Maxalt), and sumatriptan (Imitrex).
        Pain relievers—NSAIDs, including aspirin and ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), can help with less severe migraines. Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) also helps some people with migraines. Some of these products are formulated specifically for migraines, combining one or more pain relievers with caffeine (such as Excedrin Migraine).
        One note of caution: The overuse or misuse of some migraine medicines can trip off additional headaches—called rebound headaches—especially if you use these drugs more than three times a week. Talk to your doctor if you notice that you're getting more headaches than usual while on these medications.
        Preventive treatments can reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. They are generally recommended for people who have frequent migraine attacks (more than two or three a week), or whose migraines haven't responded well to other treatments.
        
          Other types of headaches
        
        Migraines aren't the only type of headache that can cause misery. Others include:
        Tension headaches—These common headaches feel like a pressure or tightness on both sides of the head. They can last from 30 minutes to several days. Tension headaches can occur from time to time, or on a daily basis. How to treat them: Address the health problem that's causing tension headaches, such as stress, sleep apnea, depression, or jaw clenching.
        Cluster headaches—These sharp, severe headaches typically arrive in ""clusters"" at the same time of day or night. Cluster headaches are usually focused on one side of the head, often behind the eye. They can last anywhere from 5 minutes to a couple of hours. You may also have a runny nose, tearing in one eye, and a feeling of agitation. 
        Sinus headaches—This type of headache occurs when the lining of the sinus passages becomes swollen and inflamed. The throbbing pain is often accompanied by pressure around the eyes, cheeks, and forehead; a stuffy nose; cough; and yellow-green mucus.
        If you get regular headaches, you'll probably start to see a pattern to the symptoms. If you develop any unusual or particularly severe symptoms, call for medical help right away. Even if headaches have become part of your routine, talk to your doctor. Your doctor can get you started on a treatment to relieve your aching head and finally stop headaches from interfering with your life.
        
          
            
              
                
                  When a headache signals something more serious
                
                In rare cases, headaches can be a sign of a serious health issue, such as a tumor, meningitis, or a burst aneurysm. Any of these signs warrants an immediate call for medical help:
                
                  a sudden, severe headache
                  a severe headache along with a fever, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, weakness anywhere in your body, confusion, double vision, or a stiff neck
                  the ""worst"" headache of your life
                  a severe headache when you rarely, or never, get headaches
                  a headache that starts after a head injury.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sinus-headache-or-sign-us-up-for-a-migraine-consultation-2016120110758,Sinus headache or sign-us up for a migraine consultation,"Many people mistakenly believe their headaches are due to sinus problems when actual reason is migraine. In reality, more than 85% of people who suspect that they have sinus headaches in fact have migraines.
        
          Why the confusion between sinus headaches and migraines?
        
        It begins with the many symptoms that both migraines and sinus headaches share, which include pressure in the face, an association with barometric/seasonal weather changes, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. The autonomic nervous system controls many of the involuntary functions in your body including heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating. In the case of migraines, autonomic dysfunction can cause eye redness, eyelid swelling/drooping, tearing, sinus congestion, and even a runny nose.
        Response to treatment can also further drive patients to believe that they have sinus headaches rather than migraines. For example, a patient may have a headache involving a pressure sensation in the face, and calls their primary care physician thinking a sinus infection is causing the symptoms. The doctor will often order a refill of medications that worked in the past for patient's sinus problems. The patient feels better after taking these medications, and believes that the infection is cured.
        
          Here's why you want to know whether you have migraines and not sinus headaches
        
        An incorrect diagnosis of sinus headaches can also serve to skew a patient's family history. Migraine is a genetic disorder that is passed down through family members. Patients often deny that any of their family members have migraines, but when asked about sinus headaches, they will often respond, ""Actually, my mother had sinus headaches."" When questioned about the mother's sinus headache behavior, the same patients frequently respond, ""She would lay down, and insist that the room be dark and quiet. She would also ask for a bucket to be placed by the head of the bed even though she rarely ever threw up."" Such responses tend to lead the physician and patient to the conclusion that migraines actually do run in the family, as sinus headaches are not typically accompanied by light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, and nausea. The same patients will also return for a follow-up appointment noting, ""It turns out that my sister, cousin, and aunt all have migraines, which they thought were due to sinus problems.""
        
          Three telltale signs it's a sinus headache and not a migraine
        
        Three features that are more suggestive of sinus headache than migraine. These are:
        
          Thick, infectious looking mucous.A little clear drainage can be seen with a number of conditions, and is not necessarily indicative of a sinus infection.
          Fever. It would be very unusual for migraine to present with fever, but fever is a primary symptom of a sinus infection.
          Imaging. If an imaging study or evaluation with an endoscope looking up the nose shows a sinus problem, then the headaches are likely related to that — unless the headaches continue after the sinus problem is successfully treated.
        
        In conclusion, if you suffer from frequent sinus headaches, there is a good chance that you are actually experiencing migraines. Making the correct diagnosis and formulating an appropriate treatment plan can reduce the frequency and intensity of headaches, as well as avoid unnecessary testing, visits to specialists, and taking medicines that are not actually treating the problem.

          Q.
          I recently felt pain that begins in my lower jaw and goes up the side of my face toward the temple. What would cause this, and should I be concerned?
        
        A. There are several conditions to consider, a couple of which require prompt treatment.
        A common cause of new jaw pain is an irritated nerve. Doctors call this condition neuralgia. If you had shingles in the past, you might be experiencing post-herpetic neuralgia. Or it could be a disorder called trigeminal neuralgia, also known as tic douloureux. People with diabetes also can develop facial neuralgias.
        Jaw pain also could be a symptom of coronary artery disease, although there would typically be other symptoms, such as chest pain or pressure and shortness of breath with physical exertion or emotional stress.
        Another potential cause of sudden jaw pain is temporal arteritis. This is an inflammation of blood vessels that causes headaches and jaw pain that develops after chewing for a while. It is important to at least consider this condition because it requires prompt treatment with the drug prednisone to avoid complications like losing eyesight.
        Two other possibilities also come to mind: cluster headaches and TMJ disorder. Cluster headaches could cause your symptoms, especially if the pain is severe, appears around the same time each day, and lasts for a few hours. This type of headache tends to be throbbing and is often located around one eye and higher up in the head. TMJ (temporomandibular joint) disorder also might play a role if there is discomfort and tenderness at the point where the lower jaw hinges to the upper jaw.
        Since there are multiple possibilities, you should see your doctor to discuss your symptoms and treatment options.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/handling-hypoglycemia,Handling hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia is a potentially dangerous condition in which blood sugar falls too low. Too much exercise, too little food or carbohydrates, a missed or delayed meal, or a combination of these factors can bring on hypoglycemia.
        
          Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the reaction, but commonly include
        
        
          nervousness
          sweating
          feeling cold and clammy
          trembling or shakiness
          rapid heartbeat
          lightheadedness
          hunger
          irritability.
        
        
          If early symptoms aren't recognized and treated quickly, blood sugar levels may continue to fall, resulting in
        
        
          drowsiness
          weakness
          blurred vision
          slurred speech
          confusion
          clumsiness
          personality change or strange behavior such as belligerence or silliness.
        
        At its worst, hypoglycemia can cause seizures or coma.
        Most people with type 2 diabetes don't have to worry about hypoglycemia. It may, however, occur in those who use insulin or take a diabetes medication known as a sulfonylurea. Changes in eating habits, such as dieting— especially if carbohydrates are reduced—or increased exercise can lead to hypoglycemia. Talk with your doctor before making any changes in your diet or increasing your exercise.
        
          The 15/15 Rule to treat a low blood sugar
        
        Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of hypoglycemia, so that if it occurs, you can take steps to treat it appropriately and prevent the problem from recurring.
        If you think you're having an episode of low blood sugar, don't ignore your symptoms. If possible, test your blood sugar with a finger-stick test. If it is low, follow the 15/15 rule. Eat 15 grams of carbohydrate and wait 15 minutes. Here are some foods that will provide about 15 grams of carbohydrate to lower blood sugar:
        
          eat three glucose tablets or four dextrose tablets
          drink 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice
          drink 5 to 6 ounces (about half a can) of regular soda, such as Coke or Pepsi
          eat five to seven Life Savers
          eat 2 tablespoons raisins
          eat six jelly beans.
        
        Don't eat foods containing chocolate, peanut butter, nuts, or fats. Fat slows the body's absorption of carbohydrates, so foods with fat won't raise your blood sugar quickly enough. After the carbohydrate is eaten, wait about 15 minutes for the sugar to get into your blood. If you do not feel better within 15 minutes, more carbohydrate can be consumed. Your blood sugar should be checked to make sure it has come within a safe range.

The tasty green fruit is great in salads, smoothies, and desserts. And it might have an added bonus of helping to ease chronic constipation, according to a small randomized trial. Scientists asked more than 180 adults (some with constipation, some without) in Italy, Japan, and New Zealand to take part in two four-week courses of treatment. In one regimen, they ate two peeled kiwifruits per day. In the other, they took 7.5 grams of psyllium (a natural ingredient found in fiber supplements such as Metamucil or Fiberall) daily. The order of the two regimens was randomly assigned, and participants took a four-week break in between. The results: both treatments seemed to help constipated participants produce more bowel movements and experience less straining and abdominal pain, with kiwi being slightly more effective than psyllium. Scientists say kiwi contains not only fiber (about 3 grams per half-cup serving), but also raphides (natural needle-shaped crystals), which both help improve bowel function. The findings were published in the June 2023 issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology.

An analysis of almost 70,000 people in the United States hospitalized for heart failure in 2010 to 2020 found that only 25% were referred for cardiac rehab. The referral rate was similar for 8,300 people with Medicare who were fit enough for rehab six weeks after leaving the hospital, but only 4% of those who got referrals took part in such programs. People who weren't referred were more likely to be older, Black, have a lot of health problems, or live in a rural area. The findings were published online July 11, 2023, by Circulation: Heart Failure. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised three-month program for people who have heart failure or chronic chest pain (angina) as well as people who've had a heart attack, heart bypass surgery, a heart transplant, stenting to open arteries, or valve surgery. But people often miss out on cardiac rehab because of bias in referrals, transportation issues, or fear of being too unfit to take part.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/harvard-study-even-weekend-warriors-achieve-heart-benefits,Harvard study: Even weekend warriors achieve heart benefits,"We're all supposed to exercise for at least 150 minutes per week. But if daily activity is a challenge, maybe you can squeeze a week's worth of exercise into one or two days per week. This ""weekend warrior"" approach is linked to the same heart-healthy benefits as daily exercise, according to a Harvard study published July 18, 2023, in JAMA. Researchers analyzed the health data and physical activity of almost 90,000 people (average age 62) who fit into one of three categories: they exercised throughout the week, jammed all exercise into one or two days a week, or didn't exercise at all. Participants wore fitness trackers for a week and were then followed for about six years. Compared with people who didn't exercise, weekend warriors had a 27% lower risk for heart attacks, a 38% lower risk for heart failure, a 22% lower risk for atrial fibrillation, and a 21% lower risk for stroke. The numbers were similar for people who exercised throughout the week. The study was observational and doesn't prove that the weekend warrior pattern is as good for the heart as daily exercise. But if you're pressed for time, the concentrated approach might help you reach your weekly exercise goals until you can get back to a daily routine. Just don't overdo it if you're not used to a lot of activity. Build up your minutes gradually.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/nasal-spray-slows-rapid-heart-rhythm,Nasal spray slows rapid heart rhythm,"A nasal spray containing the experimental drug etripamil can quickly and effectively treat an abnormally fast heart rhythm called supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), according to a new study.
        Caused by an electrical misfire that overrides the heart's natural pacemaker, SVT occurs sporadically and can lead to heart rates as high as 180 to 200 beats per minute. While it may resolve on its own, SVT may persist and make people dizzy or lightheaded. Coughing or gagging sometimes helps, but people usually need to go to an emergency room for an injection of a drug to slow the heart.
        Published July 8, 2023, in the Lancet, the study included 184 people who were followed for nearly two years. When people used etripamil spray at home, it was twice as effective as a placebo spray in restoring SVT back to a normal heart rhythm (and helped them avoid emergency department visits). The company that makes etripamil plans to submit the drug for FDA approval in late 2023.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-closer-look-at-alcohols-effect-on-heart-health,A closer look at alcohol's effect on heart health,"Along with many major health organizations, the American Heart Association (AHA) warns about the dangers of excessive drinking, which can contribute to high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke. It also discourages people from drinking alcohol to improve their health, although the AHA maintains that moderate drinking (no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks or fewer per day for men) is acceptable.
        This complex advice stems from conflicting studies about the health effects of light to moderate alcohol consumption. While some research focusing on inherited factors (see ""Using genetics to explore drinking's effects"") has hinted that even light drinking may be harmful, other studies have looked for mechanisms through which moderate drinking could benefit the heart.
        Limited evidence suggests that alcohol may raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels, boost antioxidant levels, or enhance blood flow. But none of these explanations has proven very convincing. A recent report raised another possibility: reduced stress.
        
          
            
              
                Using genetics to explore drinking's effects
                One well-known problem of observational studies is that they can't prove cause and effect. Light to moderate drinkers tend to be educated and relatively wealthy, which often enables healthy habits and good medical care. Also, people who are ill or taking certain medications are often advised to avoid alcohol. If you compare these abstainers to drinkers, the drinkers appear healthier by comparison, but that's not necessarily due to the alcohol.
                In an attempt to adjust for these and other confounding factors, researchers have looked at genetic factors that influence alcohol use. But the studies — which found that even small amounts of alcohol might increase heart disease risk — relied on gene variants linked to alcohol use disorder or binge drinking. A predilection to heavy drinking, which has many damaging health effects, isn't necessarily a good way to assess the effects of light to moderate drinking, says Dr. Kenneth Mukamal, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. In addition, genetic factors are multifaceted and complex (see ""Genetic profiling for heart disease: An update"").
              
            
          
        
        The stress connection
        A study published in the June 20, 2023, Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that brain scans of people who reported light to moderate drinking showed less activity in the part of the brain that responds to stress, compared with the scans of people who abstained or drank very little. Stress not only raises blood pressure and heart rate but also triggers inflammation that causes plaque buildup, which contributes to heart attacks.
        The finding is limited by the fact that the brain scans were commonly done for cancer surveillance or diagnosis, says Dr. Ken Mukamal, an internist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who studies how alcohol and other lifestyle factors affect health. ""The stress level of someone in the midst of a cancer workup is likely quite high and may not reflect the typical stress level of an average person,"" he notes. Still, he says it's an intriguing finding that merits further study.
        In the moment, alcohol can help people feel relaxed, and that's especially true when people drink in social situations. It's possible that light to moderate drinkers have stronger social ties, which in turn provide resilience against stress. The study authors are now focusing on other interventions — such as meditation or exercise — that might lower the brain's stress activity without the potentially harmful effects of alcohol.
        How is drinking linked to diabetes?
        A 2022 study showed a link between moderate drinking (eight to 16 drinks per week) and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, but specifically among people who drank alcohol with meals. Many short-term trials that randomly assign people to drink either alcohol or a nonalcoholic beverage show lower blood sugar levels and better insulin sensitivity among people who drink moderate amounts of alcohol. While these biomarkers aren't a perfect representation of diabetes risk, they're pretty close, says Dr. Mukamal. People with diabetes are twice as likely to have heart disease as people without the condition.
        But again, sticking to moderate intake is important. If you drink alcohol, enjoy it with a meal, which will slow down the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream. Because alcohol is high in calories, drinking excessive amounts can lead to weight gain, which raises the risk of diabetes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/hidden-causes-of-weight-gain,Hidden causes of weight gain,"The reason for gaining weight isn't always a mystery. For example, you might know you've been eating more and exercising less, a potent combo that often results in extra pounds. But sometimes the cause isn't quite so obvious. And you might not be aware of many of the other factors that can contribute to weight gain.
        Age-related causes
        Getting older brings physiological changes that can affect weight. Chief among them is muscle loss. Starting in middle age, we lose about 1% of muscle mass per year, which affects strength and metabolism (how fast we burn calories). ""Smaller muscles use fewer calories. If your diet doesn't change, you'll consume more calories than you need. The excess is stored as fat,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, an obesity medicine specialist and co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Here are other age-related changes that can affect weight.
        Chronic stress. It's harder to manage stress as we get older. And if you're constantly under stress, you might have consistently high levels of the stress hormone cortisol. One job of cortisol is helping the body replenish energy stores. In some people, that might indirectly promote weight gain by increasing appetite (since the body thinks it needs energy) and increasing the storage of unused energy as fat. ""But mostly, stress leads to compulsive behaviors, such as eating 'comfort' foods, which are often full of sugar, unhealthy fat, extra calories, and salt,"" Dr. Apovian says.
        Poor sleep. Age-related changes affect our ability to sleep well. ""If you're a chronic 'short sleeper,' getting six hours or fewer each night, it might affect hormones that regulate appetite. Short sleep is associated with higher levels of hormones that make us hungry, lower levels of hormones that tell us we're full, and higher levels of cortisol,"" Dr. Apovian says.
        Sex hormone changes. Older men and women experience reductions in certain sex hormones. In women, low estrogen levels are associated with sleep problems and increased body fat. In men, reduced testosterone levels are linked to less muscle mass.
        Underlying conditions
        Weight gain, especially if it's new, can signal a number of health conditions. For example, someone with heart failure might experience weight gain from fluid retention—which might appear as swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, or belly. ""This would likely be accompanied by symptoms such as fatigue or shortness of breath,"" Dr. Apovian says.
        Other underlying conditions associated with weight gain include
        
          diabetes
          certain kidney diseases
          sleep apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep)
          thyroid problems.
        
        Medication side effects
        Taking certain medications regularly can lead to weight gain. Some drugs, such as prednisone, can make you retain fluid and increase your weight.
        And many medications affect brain chemicals that regulate appetite, which might make you hungrier than usual, so you might eat more and gain weight. Examples include
        
          antidepressants such as paroxetine (Paxil) or phenelzine (Nardil)
          antihistamines that contain the ingredient diphenhydramine (the active ingredient in Benadryl)
          antipsychotics such as clozapine (Clozaril) or olanzapine (Zyprexa)
          beta blockers such as the drug atenolol (Tenormin) or metoprolol (Lopressor)
          sleep aids that contain the drug diphenhydramine, such as Sominex, Unisom SleepGels, or ZzzQuil.
        
        Other potential causes
        Some potential causes of weight gain aren't yet well understood and are currently being studied.
        One possibility is late-night eating. Some evidence, including a 2022 Harvard study, suggests that eating late at night might make us hungrier in the daytime, slow metabolism, and increase body fat.
        Another suspected factor in weight gain is the population of microbes that live in your gut (their genes are called your microbiome). Considerable evidence suggests gut microbes might influence appetite, metabolism, blood sugar, and fat storage. The strongest support comes from studies of animals. In humans, the evidence is less clear.
        ""Studies have found that the gut microbes of people with obesity are different from those of people who are lean,"" Dr. Apovian explains.
        ""But we don't know if this causes people to develop obesity. It could be that people who are genetically programmed to gain weight have a certain microbiome,"" she notes. ""Or it could be that people with obesity are eating a different way than lean people are eating, which may change the microbiome. We need more research for better answers.""
        What you should do
        Any recent or excessive weight gain warrants a visit to your doctor, who can hunt for new underlying conditions and check if your medications might be influencing your weight. Getting those two aspects of health under control are essential.
        It might also help to see a dietitian to determine the right calorie intake for your current needs.
        Beyond that, Dr. Apovian says the best way to control weight as we age is clean living: eating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, limited amounts of whole grains and starchy vegetables, and ample amounts of lean protein to help build muscle; avoiding late-night eating; getting seven to nine hours of sleep per night; exercising briskly every day for at least 20 minutes; and strength training at least twice a week. ""You can rebuild muscle,"" Dr. Apovian says, ""but it takes a combination of healthy lifestyle habits to control weight.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/genetic-profiling-for-heart-disease-an-update,Genetic profiling for heart disease: An update,"As the leading cause of premature death in this country, cardiovascular disease is to blame for more than $150 billion in lost productivity each year. Thanks to decades of research, we know a great deal about what predisposes people to coronary artery disease, the most prevalent form of heart disease and the root cause of most heart attacks. However, doctors still can't predict heart attacks very accurately. Some people who appear prone to heart attacks never have one, while others succumb to heart disease despite having no obvious risks.
        Can genetic profiling help? Perhaps, according to a 2022 scientific statement from the American Heart Association that looked at the promise and challenge of such testing. Using a small sample of blood or saliva, these tests analyze millions of common variants in your DNA to create what's known as a polygenic risk score. You can have zero, one, or two copies of any gene variant, each of which may either raise or lower your risk of coronary artery disease.
        Millions of variants
        ""Ten years ago, there were just 20 or 30 known variants that affect coronary artery disease, but today there are more than three million,"" says Dr. Nicholas Marston, a preventive cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Scientists discover variants by comparing the genetic codes of people without coronary artery disease to those of people with the disease. Many of these variants occur in genes known to affect heart disease, such as those related to cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood clotting. Others aren't well understood and may provide targets for future research, potentially fueling new drug discovery efforts, he adds.
        The evidence to date
        A polygenic risk score reflects the overall impact of all the variants together and is expressed as a percentile. But a high score (for instance, the 95th percentile) doesn't mean you have a 95% chance for developing the disease. Rather, it means that among 100 people, your score is higher than 95 people and the same as or lower than five.
        So far, research using polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease suggests they may offer modest improvements for predicting risk in people who are middle-aged or younger. In some cases, the score can help doctors decide whether to be more or less aggressive in prescribing cholesterol-lowering medications like statins, says Dr. Marston. For example, a 35-year-old man with a father who died of a heart attack at age 45 may wonder what he can do to escape that fate, especially if his cholesterol numbers look fine. Standard risk calculators to guide statin treatment don't apply to people under 40, so a polygenic risk score can help the doctor decide if and when the man should start a statin.
        In addition to statins, more powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs like alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) are available. These drugs are expensive, and insurance doesn't always cover them. So it doesn't make sense to give them to everyone. A polygenic risk score may help identify which heart attack survivors would benefit most from these medications, says Dr. Marston.
        Who offers polygenic risk scores?
        Currently, people can find their scores by participating in a research study, such as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network (eMERGE) study. Scientists at some hospitals at Harvard and nine other institutions around the country are investigating the genetic risk of several heart-related conditions, as well as cancer and other diseases (see www.emerge.study).
        A handful of direct-to-consumer companies also provide cardiovascular-based scores for $250. Dr. Marston has recommended the test for several of his patients, who must pay out-of-pocket since insurance doesn't cover the tests. Another limitation: the scores are based mainly on people with European ancestry, which means the scores may not be reliable for people of different ethnicities. But efforts to expand the diversity of the data are under way.
        For older people, polygenic risk scores for heart disease aren't as helpful. By the time you're 70, decades of lifestyle habits have shaped your risk, and genetic factors are less relevant. ""Ultimately, you want the results to be actionable. We won't see a big uptake for using polygenic risk scores until they demonstrate a role in medical decision making,"" says Dr. Marston.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/low-dose-aspirin-linked-to-anemia,Low-dose aspirin linked to anemia,"Although daily, low-dose aspirin can help prevent heart attacks, this widely used drug comes with a downside: an increased risk of bleeding. This ranges from minor problems (such as noticeable bruising) to more serious but rare complications, such as bleeding in the brain.
        New research now finds older people who take low-dose aspirin every day are more likely to develop anemia, a condition marked by a reduced amount of red blood cells. The findings are yet another reminder to be cautious about daily aspirin use. Although around half of older adults say they take low-dose aspirin, current guidelines recommend this practice only for people who have coronary artery disease or another vascular disease and for those who are under 70 and at high risk of a heart attack. (For more details, see ""Advice about daily aspirin"" in the July 2021 Heart Letter.)
        ""We can't talk about all the good that aspirin does without mentioning the potential harm,"" says cardiologist Dr. Gregory Piazza, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Decades ago, doctors recommended low-dose aspirin for most men over 50, but that's no longer the case. Unless you have diagnosed cardiovascular disease, the risk of bleeding likely outweighs the drug's heart-protecting benefits, as several recent large studies comparing aspirin to a placebo have shown.
        More harm than good
        One of those studies was the ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) trial, which followed more than 19,000 initially healthy adults over age 70 for nearly five years. In these people, low-dose aspirin did not protect against heart attack or stroke. But it did raise the risk of major bleeding — especially in the stomach and brain — by 30%.
        Aspirin may also cause subtle, undetected internal bleeding that leads to anemia, based on a new analysis of the ASPREE data that looked at participants' hemoglobin and ferritin levels, which were measured yearly. Hemoglobin carries oxygen in the blood; ferritin helps store iron in your body. Anemia is defined as having a hemoglobin level of less than 12 milligrams per liter (mg/L) for men and less than 11 mg/L for women.
        This new analysis, published in the July 2023 Annals of Internal Medicine, found that people who took aspirin were 20% more likely to have anemia compared with those not taking the drug. Although mild cases of anemia might not cause any symptoms, the condition can lead to fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and dizziness, all of which result from the diminished oxygen levels in the body.
        Aspirin's actions
        Aspirin discourages blood clots by preventing tiny cell fragments in the blood called platelets from clumping together. But the drug also blocks substances that help maintain and protect the delicate tissue lining the gastrointestinal tract. ""Long-term aspirin use can damage this protective layer, making bleeding more likely,"" says Dr. Piazza. Doctors refer to small amounts of bleeding as ""occult"" bleeding, since it often remains hidden and unrecognized.
        This minor bleeding can occur in the stomach or farther down the gastrointestinal tract. If you have any sort of breach in this pathway, such as a hemorrhoid or a tiny colon polyp, taking daily aspirin can make it more likely to bleed. In fact, this phenomenon may explain why aspirin use has been linked to lower risk of death from colon cancer. Aspirin may reveal the cancer by causing a cancerous polyp to bleed and show up as blood in a person's stool. The resulting earlier diagnosis and treatment may extend survival, Dr. Piazza explains.
        The bottom line
        If you're currently taking low-dose aspirin, check with your doctor to make sure it makes sense for you. ""With my patients, we review all their medications at every visit,"" Dr. Piazza says. People may have taken aspirin for years, but since bleeding risk rises with age, it might be time for them to stop. Or they may have started taking a different, more powerful clot-preventing medication that renders the aspirin unnecessary. A common example is clopidogrel (Plavix), which is often prescribed after a person gets an artery-opening stent.
        If your doctor recommends low-dose aspirin, make sure you get an annual blood test that checks your hemoglobin levels. It's commonly done as part of an annual physical. But for heart disease prevention, doctors tend to focus on cholesterol and blood sugar values and may pay less attention to hemoglobin levels, says Dr. Piazza.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/an-elevated-high-sensitivity-troponin-level,An elevated high-sensitivity troponin level,"Q.
          I'm 73-year-old man with heart disease (I had a coronary bypass when I was 45). I pay close attention to my health and exercise regularly. Recently, I went to the emergency room with chest pain. Although my electrocardiogram and, later, a stress echocardiogram showed no problems, my troponin was elevated, ranging from 57 to 63 ng/L on several repeated tests. Should I worry about the elevated troponin? Is there a way to lower this level?
        
        A. Troponins, which are proteins involved in muscle contraction, are found almost exclusively in heart and skeletal muscle cells. During a heart attack, reduced blood flow damages parts of the heart muscle, which then releases troponins into the bloodstream. That's why emergency room physicians routinely check blood troponin levels in people with suspected heart attacks.
        The original tests detected troponins that are unique to heart cells, including two subtypes of the protein: troponin T or I. Newer versions of the tests detect very small amounts of troponins at concentrations that are 10 to 100 times more sensitive than the original test. Known as high-sensitivity troponin tests, they can detect heart attacks earlier and more accurately.
        A normal range differs for each type and brand of test. But in general, the normal range for women is zero to 10 nanograms per liter (ng/L); for men, it's zero to 14. When a person has heart attack symptoms, troponin tests are usually done twice in the first few hours, and often several more times over the following 24 hours, depending on the findings.
        To diagnose a heart attack, clinicians consider the troponin values and electrocardiogram findings, along with the person's current symptoms and history of heart-related problems. With a minor heart attack, troponin levels can rise two to three times the upper limit of normal, but can go as high as 500 ng/L with a major heart attack. The values usually rise over a 24-hour period and then slowly fall over the following week.
        Many other conditions can cause elevated troponins, such as myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease), and chronic kidney disease. Prolonged exercise can also raise troponin levels, but usually only in athletes training for marathons or triathlons. Sometimes, people have elevated levels without a clear cause. In such a situation, which may be the case for you, the troponin level remains fairly constant. Your doctor likely suspected this was the case but ordered the stress echocardiogram to check for any areas of decreased blood flow in your heart. Your troponin may simply be naturally higher than the average person's, but there's nothing anyone can do to lower their troponin level. You can now just continue maintaining your healthy lifestyle!

The six food categories are fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, fish, and dairy products.
        Researchers compiled a healthy diet score from 245,000 people from around the world. The score was determined by how much and how often people ate foods from these six categories. After more than nine years, the researchers found that people with the highest diet scores (meaning they regularly ate high quantities from the six categories) had fewer cases of cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, strokes, and death than people with lower scores. The researchers also determined how many daily or weekly servings were linked to better health outcomes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/testosterone-therapy-may-be-safe-for-men-at-risk-for-heart-attack-and-stroke,Testosterone therapy may be safe for men at risk for heart attack and stroke,"Does testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) raise men's risk for heart attacks or stroke? A new study suggests not, although with some caveats. Researchers enrolled 5,246 men ages 45 to 80 with testosterone levels of less than 300 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL). (Normal levels range from 300 to 1,000 ng/dL.) More than 50% had existing cardiovascular disease, while the others were considered at increased risk because of such factors as diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, and an imbalance of lipids (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides).
        For an average of 22 months, the men applied a gel to their skin daily. For half of the men, the gel was a placebo (inactive). For the others, it contained enough testosterone to maintain their hormone levels between 350 and 750 ng/dL. At the three-year follow-up, the researchers found no difference in the rate of heart attacks, strokes, or death from cardiovascular problems between the TRT and placebo groups. However, compared with the men using the placebo, those using TRT were more likely to have developed atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rate that can increase the risk for stroke and heart failure) and pulmonary embolism (in which a blood clot travels to a lung artery and blocks blood flow).
        The researchers pointed out that their findings do not apply to men who do not have a testosterone deficiency. Men considering TRT should discuss possible risks with their doctor, especially if they have any cardiovascular disease risk factors. The results were published in the July 13, 2023, issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/try-this-take-a-tactical-breather,Try this: Take a tactical breather,"Next time you feel overwhelmed by stress or need to stay mentally sharp in a high-stress situation, try tactical breathing.
        This breathwork (sometimes referred to as box breathing) is used by military and law enforcement personnel to remain calm and collected in dangerous situations. It works like this:
        
          Gradually take a full inhalation through the nose while counting one, two, three, four. With each count, draw in more air, so when you reach the count of four, you inhale to your maximum.
          Hold your breath as you count one, two, three, four again.
          Then slowly exhale through the mouth, again counting from one to four. Release some air with each count, fully exhaling when you reach four.
          After full exhalation, hold your breath again for a count of four.
          Repeat the breathing cycle several times.
        
        Tactical breathing can damp down the body's sympathetic nervous system, which directs our response to dangerous or stressful situations. It also engages the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls the body's ability to relax.
        Tactical breathing also can be used to calm a racing mind when you're trying to sleep and to help soothe pain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/no-bones-about-it,No bones about it,"Although osteoporosis, the bone-weakening disease, strikes more women, men are not immune. In fact, estimates suggest about 6% of men ages 65 and older have osteoporosis, and about one in five will break a bone because of it. Research also has shown that following a fracture due to osteoporosis, men are more likely to die than women.
        ""Looking out for your bones is equally important as other aspects of your health as you age,"" says Dr. Harold Rosen, an endocrinologist with Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""There are many ways men can keep their bones strong to help prevent osteoporosis or slow its progress if it occurs.""
        Close to the bone
        During your life, bones undergo a continuous maintenance cycle called remodeling, in which they are simultaneously broken down and rebuilt. But as you age, the body eventually loses bone faster than it can rebuild it. This is what causes osteoporosis, where bones become thinner, more porous, weaker, and more susceptible to fractures. Most men begin losing bone density around age 60, and over time, they can get osteoporosis. Besides age, other factors can contribute to osteoporosis, including smoking, heavy alcohol use, family history, and chronic diseases of the kidney, lungs, stomach, and intestines.
        Several medications, when used over the long term, can significantly increase the risk of osteoporosis. Chief among these are corticosteroids, like prednisone, used to treat inflammatory bowel disease and other inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.
        Other medications that may cause the problem include androgen deprivation therapy, used to treat prostate cancer; anticonvulsants for epilepsy; certain drugs given to organ transplant patients; and some chemotherapy drugs.
        Slowing the loss
        Preventing osteoporosis and treating it if it occurs is about trying to stop or at least slow the bone loss. ""It's sometimes possible to slightly increase bone density, but the main goal is to preserve as much of your bone mass you have left,"" says Dr. Rosen. Here are some ways to help do that.
        Calcium and vitamin D. Both calcium and vitamin D work together to keep bones healthy. Calcium is a building block of bone, while vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. For older adults, the goal of adequate calcium intake is to limit bone loss.
        ""Consuming more calcium does not mean you are feeding your bones calcium. Instead, you are supplying your body with enough calcium so it won't pull calcium from your bones and thus weaken them,"" says Dr. Rosen.
        The recommended daily calcium intake for men ages 50 to 70 is 1,000 milligrams (mg); for men ages 71 and older, it's 1,200 mg. Recommendations for vitamin D are 15 micrograms (mcg) or 600 international units (IU) daily until age 70 and then 20 mcg (800 IU) afterward. How can you tell if you lack calcium or vitamin D? Dr. Rosen says to examine your diet and outdoor exposure. ""It's often easy to get enough calcium through a regular healthy diet."" he says.
        For instance, one cup of milk, yogurt, or calcium-fortified orange juice, or an ounce of cheese all have between 300 and 400 mg of calcium each (and 100 IU of vitamin D in fortified milk). ""So, eating three or four servings can give people plenty of calcium,"" says Dr. Rosen. Other good calcium sources include one cup of soymilk (300 mg), ½ cup of tofu (138 mg), and ½ cup of cooked turnip greens (100 mg).
        Sunlight exposure is the best way to improve your vitamin D level. One study found that eight to 10 minutes of sun exposure to 25% of the body (hands, face, neck, and arms) produces the recommended daily amount of vitamin D in people with light skin. (People with darker skin may need 15 to 30 minutes of sun exposure.)
        But that can be a challenge in the winter or if you live in a northern climate, or if you're diligent about limiting sun exposure for skin care reasons. (Sunscreen blocks UVB light, but few people put on enough to block all UVB, or they use sunscreen irregularly, so sunscreen typically has a limited effect on vitamin D level.)
        Therefore, Dr. Rosen recommends taking a daily multivitamin or a vitamin D supplement. For most people, a 1,000 IU dose is sufficient. (Most multivitamins also contain a decent amount of calcium — around 200 to 300 mg.)
        Exercise. Research has suggested that weight-bearing activities (in which your bones support your weight) can help to slow bone loss and even increase bone density, although estimates suggest it's a modest 1% to 2% increase in adults.
        Weight-bearing examples include speed walking, running, stair climbing, and elliptical training. These activities put stress on bones that, in turn, pushes bone-forming cells into action. Regular exercise also builds muscle and improves balance and agility, all of which helps lower your risk of falls.
        Dr. Rosen suggests adopting an exercise program that includes weight-bearing activities, strength training, and balance, stretching, and flexibility exercises, such as yoga, tai chi, or Pilates.
        Medications. Low testosterone levels can contribute to osteoporosis. Men with confirmed low levels of this hormone should consider a bone density test (see ""Do you need a bone density test?""). ""Replacing testosterone can help maintain and might even improve bone health,"" says Dr. Rosen.
        A class of drugs known as bisphosphonates can treat osteoporosis in men by reducing the rate at which bones break down. Examples include alendronate (Fosamax), pamidronate (Aredia), risedronate (Actonel), and zoledronic acid (Reclast). Talk with your doctor about whether testosterone therapy or bisphosphonates are warranted.
        
          
            
              
                Do you need a bone density test?
                Osteoporosis is called a ""silent disease"" because there are typically no symptoms, and most people who have it don't know until they break a bone. One way to diagnose osteoporosis and determine future fracture risk is with a bone density test, which uses specialized x-rays to measure the thickness and strength of bones. The lower your bone density, the higher your risk of breaking a bone. Speak with your doctor about whether you may benefit from this test.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/lending-a-helping-hand,Lending a helping hand,"The Greek philosopher Plato once said, ""Happiness springs from doing good and helping others.""
        Almost 2,500 years later, research shows that Plato was correct — people who devote time to helping others are often happier than those who don't.
        There are many ways lending a hand helps our minds and moods. One way is to turn our attention away from our own problems.
        ""Too much self-focused attention is linked with more negative thinking and a higher risk of anxiety and depression,"" says Robert Drozek, a psychotherapist with Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital who specializes in the use of ethics in psychotherapy. ""But serving redirects our energy and helps us realize that we have something to offer people, and they sometimes need our help.""
        Serving others helps brain health in other ways, too. It increases social connections, which can protect against loneliness and depression, and improves executive function skills like planning, attention, and remembering tasks. And when you help others, your brain releases feel-good chemicals like serotonin and dopamine.
        You don't need to devote much time to reap these benefits. A study in the August 2020 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that older adults who did any kind of service work for two hours a week felt more optimistic and had a greater sense of purpose compared with those who performed no service.
        How can you help yourself by helping others? Here are a few ways.
        Volunteering
        Volunteering provides a sense of purpose and an emotional boost as you support a cause or organization you believe in. You could also volunteer in professional fields or industries that match your life or work experience, like education, health care, or the arts.
        ""Volunteering in this way also offers opportunities to find structured and defined roles that fit your schedule, skills, and comfort levels,"" says Drozek.
        You can even volunteer from home. For instance, thanks to computers, being a ""virtual"" volunteer is common. You can provide administrative, accounting, or marketing assistance via computer or video chat. Telephones are still crucial for volunteer work. For example, you can make calls to help raise money for nonprofits, answer a hotline, or make check-in calls to homebound adults.
        
          
            
              
                Finding opportunities
                Search online for volunteering opportunities in your ZIP code on websites such as Volunteer Match (www.volunteermatch.org) or Idealist (www.idealist.org). You can look for local mentoring programs at the website of the National Mentoring Partnership (www.mentoring.org).
              
            
          
        
        Mentoring
        Mentors share their knowledge, wisdom, and experience with people who need direction. Many times, this is a child or young adult.
        A good place to begin is with a national program like Big Brothers, Big Sisters of America or the United Way. Also, many high schools, senior centers, churches, and faith-based organizations have mentoring opportunities. If you are more interested in sharing your professional expertise, contact your area Junior Achievement program or the local business community, or service clubs.
        Random acts of kindness
        Look for opportunities to serve others in daily life. For example, write to a friend saying you are thinking about them. Order takeout food for a neighbor. Send a gift in the mail. For an additional benefit, do the act anonymously, and don't tell anyone about it. ""This further takes the focus away from you and your worries,"" says Drozek.
        Different perspective
        An indirect way to serve others is to see things from their point of view. When you interact with someone — whether a friend, acquaintance, or stranger — focus the interaction entirely on the other person. What is going on with them? What issues do they face? Are they in pain or feeling conflict?
        Avoid injecting yourself — for instance, by describing how the same situation happened to you (unless they ask for feedback or advice).
        ""By lending an ear, you can provide emotional support they may need in that moment,"" says Drozek. ""Even if the exchange is generic and friendly, placing emphasis on the other person can boost their mood, and in the process, yours, too.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/overcoming-heart-health-obstacles,Overcoming heart health obstacles,"Prevention is the best medicine, but many men wait for a problem to arise before seeking help. For heart disease — the No. 1 cause of death among men — it could be runaway blood pressure, escalating cholesterol levels, or even a heart attack.
        Even when faced with the reality of heart disease, men often encounter obstacles that keep them from managing their condition or lowering their risk. What can they do?
        To find out, we asked two cardiologists — Dr. Haider Warraich and Dr. Dale Adler with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital — what they hear from their male patients and the advice they offer.
        Think about the future. During consultations, Dr. Warraich asks his patients about how they define longevity. ""When they reflect on what they hope to achieve as they age, most say they value a high quality of life and independent living rather than simply living a few years longer than normal,"" he says. Getting men to focus on their future helps them define goals and then determine if they are on the path to meet them. ""It helps them understand their shortcomings, like needing to be serious about weight loss or managing cholesterol, and can motivate them to make lasting changes,"" says Dr. Warraich.
        Monitor your blood pressure. Men sometimes don't feel in control of their heart health, says Dr. Warraich. One way they can play an active role is to regularly monitor their blood pressure. ""The heart health risks of high blood pressure are far-reaching, and even if men are not taking medication to manage high levels, keeping tabs on their numbers can be a proactive way to look out for potential problems,"" says Dr. Warraich. Men can easily do this by investing in a home blood pressure monitor. Record weekly readings and alert your doctor about sudden changes.
        Confront suspicions about medication. Dr. Adler has found that many men who need blood pressure medicine, statins to manage cholesterol, or other medications are hesitant to take them. ""They often focus too much on potential side effects and less on the benefits,"" he says. Much of this may reflect a general mistrust of medicine and the idea they have to take the pills indefinitely.
        But Dr. Adler says men can overcome this resistance by realizing they have a say in how the drugs are used. ""I tell my patients that by making diet and lifestyle changes, they can possibly take lower doses or even eventually stop taking them,"" he says. ""When they understand their power, they are more open to taking medication they need for better heart health.""
        Schedule time for health. Consistency is vital for maintaining heart-healthy exercise. But one of the top complaints Dr. Adler hears is lack of time. ""In general, men are receptive to routine and schedules, but they often don't do well when it gets disrupted,"" he says. Dr. Adler advises his patients to find a few blocks of time that work with their schedule and daily energy levels so they have multiple options. For instance, in the morning as soon as you wake up, or in the evening before dinner (exercise before a meal also curbs appetite).
        Also, treat workout sessions as critical meetings, and always have a backup plan in place. ""This way, if you miss your scheduled workout, you can automatically go to plan B."" For example, take a quick walk, do five minutes of squats and push-ups, or stop by the gym.
        Make weight loss a group effort. One of the greatest threats to heart health is weight gain. ""Weight loss is not easy, but studies have found that sharing your weight-loss efforts through friendly competitions or online community forums is a tool for staying motivated and overcoming setbacks,"" says Dr. Adler. You could also enlist friends and begin your own weight-loss club, where you share your daily or weekly weigh-ins, exchange tips and strategies, talk about challenges, and encourage each other.
        Learn portion control. ""People are generally not great at estimating food portions,"" says Dr. Adler. This is one reason weight-loss programs like Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers are effective, he adds. ""They give you the exact portions you are supposed to eat, which is what you need to feel satisfied.""
        He tells his patients trying to eat healthier or lose weight to always plan their meals in advance and get in the habit of measuring portions. ""This way, you can take the guesswork out of what to eat and avoid consuming extra calories.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/statin-alternative-lowers-heart-related-deaths,Statin alternative lowers heart-related deaths,"For people who can't take statin drugs, a cholesterol-lowering drug called bempedoic acid (Nexletol) can also lower the risk of heart attacks and related problems, a new study shows.
        Published July 11, 2023, in JAMA, the study included about 4,200 people with high LDL (bad) cholesterol who couldn't take statins because of side effects. Their average age was 68, and about two-thirds had diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to take either bempedoic acid or a placebo. Over a follow-up period of about 40 months, those taking the drug were 30% less likely to die of a heart-related condition, have a heart attack or stroke, or need an artery-opening stent compared with the people who took placebos. Bempedoic acid reduced LDL levels by 21%.
        About 5% to 10% of people who try statins have to stop taking them, mostly because of muscle-related symptoms. This problem is less likely with bempedoic acid, although the drug has other side effects, including a slightly increased risk of gout and gallstones. Still, bempedoic acid can be a good alternative for people at high risk of heart disease who can't take statins.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/weather-and-air-pollution-linked-to-heart-related-hospitalizations,Weather and air pollution linked to heart-related hospitalizations,"A model that takes weather and air pollution into account may help forecast future heart problems, according to a study in the June 2023 issue of JACC Advances.
        To create the model, researchers looked at atmospheric and weather data in tandem with hospital admissions for heart failure, heart attack, and stroke over a 10-year period. They analyzed data on more than 24 million Canadians, divided into five progressive age groups, ranging from age 18 to over 70. Lower temperatures, high wind speed, atmospheric pressure, high precipitation, and high degrees of pollution were all linked to high risk of being hospitalized with one of the serious cardiovascular conditions, particularly in older people.
        According to the authors, the environmental factors they identified could one day be used to help predict the incidence of cardiovascular problems, enabling better planning during high-risk periods. In addition, people could be advised to avoid going outside and to be extra careful during times of unfavorable weather and poor air quality.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/higher-bmi-associated-with-greater-odds-of-joint-disease,Higher BMI associated with greater odds of joint disease,"A higher body mass index (BMI) is one of the major risk factors for developing osteoarthritis. But a new study suggests that carrying extra weight also makes it more likely a person will experience an inflammatory joint condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis.
        The study, published online May 23, 2023, by the journal Arthritis and Rheumatology, involved nearly 362,000 adults participating in the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database. Researchers analyzed how participants' BMI — a calculation of body size that considers height and weight — related to their likelihood of developing any of five joint conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and inflammatory spondylitis (a type of spinal arthritis). Other than osteoarthritis, most other joint diseases are driven by inflammation.
        Participants with higher BMIs (significantly greater than the ""normal"" BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9) had higher rates of rheumatoid arthritis (52%), osteoarthritis (49%), psoriatic arthritis (80%), gout (73%), and inflammatory spondylitis (34%) compared with people in the normal BMI range. Weight control can help reduce the risk of developing a joint disease, the study authors concluded.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/hormone-therapy-linked-to-higher-risks-of-gerd,Hormone therapy linked to higher risks of GERD,"Women who have used hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms may be more likely to develop gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, a new analysis suggests.
        The study, published online June 27, 2023, by the journal Menopause, analyzed data from five earlier studies involving more than one million women, none of whom had been diagnosed with GERD before the study's start. Researchers found that participants who were current or past users of hormone therapy for relieving menopausal symptoms were 29% more likely over all to develop GERD, which is characterized by heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and chest pain. Women who used estrogen alone had a 41% higher odds of GERD, while progesterone-only hormone therapy was linked to a 39% higher risk. Hormone therapy combining estrogen and progesterone was associated with only a 16% higher risk for GERD.
        The study was observational, meaning it couldn't prove that hormone therapy causes GERD, only that an association exists. Female hormones are believed to relax the muscles that control the lower esophageal sphincter (the valve between the bottom of the esophagus and top of the stomach), allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. Women considering hormone therapy should review their other risk factors for GERD and make necessary lifestyle changes to prevent it, including quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and not lying down after eating heavy meals, the study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-bumpy-truth,The bumpy truth,"Noticing a new lump or bump on your skin is never a happy discovery, especially if it's something unfamiliar — not your garden-variety wart, mole, or hives — and you're not sure whether to worry.
        Even the term ""lump"" or ""bump"" can be confusing. Located on or just under the skin, these growths can be almost flat or ""cause the skin to pooch out over them,"" says Dr. Rachel Reynolds, interim chair of dermatology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Beyond that, their characteristics run the gamut: soft and squishy or rock-hard, movable or fixed in place, round or irregularly shaped, or growing slowly or quickly.
        Regardless, they seldom signal something serious. ""People feel a lump and often immediately think it's cancer,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""But that's quite rare.""
        Most common types
        Aside from highly common basal and squamous cell skin cancers — which can appear as shiny or wartlike domes — the vast majority of other skin bumps are either epidermal cysts or lipomas, Dr. Reynolds says. What are their qualities?
        Epidermal cysts often appear on the face or back and ""may feel like a marble under the skin,"" she says. They grow as benign ""buds"" off hair follicles, filling with a cheesy protein called keratin. (Pilar cysts are another version, but on the scalp.) As they grow, epidermal cysts can become inflamed or infected.
        ""Sometimes, even after being present for many years, they act like a boil, enlarging and becoming red and tender,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""If that happens, see a doctor, since some will require drainage or antibiotics.""
        Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that often appear on the trunk or shoulders. They usually grow slowly and can run in families. ""You can't see most lipomas unless they get really big,"" she says. ""But if you are able to feel them, they're really squishy, without any sharp edges.""
        A lipoma can become uncomfortable if it presses on surrounding nerves. In this case, your doctor can remove it surgically or with liposuction, or dissolve it by injecting it with a drug called deoxycholic acid (Kybella).
        Diverse list
        Other types of skin growths are defined by a variety of diverse features.
        Cherry angiomas are smooth, red bumps representing an overgrowth of superficial blood vessels in the skin. They can range in size from a tiny dot to the diameter of a pencil eraser. Cherry angiomas tend to appear suddenly, especially on the torso, and are more common in people over 40.
        Dermatofibromas are small, firm, brown or pink spots that contain scar tissue, sometimes appearing after a skin injury or insect bite. They might itch or pucker inward if you pinch them, but they aren't painful.
        Keloids occur when scar tissue continues to grow beyond an injured area. These large bumps aren't harmful, although ""they can become itchy and unsightly,"" she says.
        Sarcomas are cancerous tumors that can appear deceptively similar to cysts or lipomas, but typically grow more quickly. ""A sarcoma may feel firmer under the skin, but not like a marble, as an epidermal cyst does,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""It's a little more ill-defined, and sometimes it's painful."" If the lump hurts even when it's left alone, that's a particularly concerning sign.
        When to act
        While sarcomas are one of the few types of skin lumps that are dangerous, Dr. Reynolds urges caution about any lump appearing near lymph nodes — immune system nodules located in the armpits, groin, and neck. While lymph nodes can enlarge from a cold or other infection, swollen nodes sometimes signal cancer. Other symptoms might also be present, including weight loss, fever, and chills.
        ""Get checked,"" she says. ""Some lymph nodes become temporarily inflamed, enlarge, and then go back down, but it's something that should be monitored.""
        A dermatologist can usually diagnose a skin bump or lump on sight alone. Occasionally, imaging tests or a biopsy may be needed to determine the culprit. You can be proactive by doing the following:
        Pointing it out. At your next primary care appointment, ask your doctor to take a look. ""Seek a more urgent visit if something is growing quickly, bleeding, feels painful, looks infected, or is red or tender,"" Dr. Reynolds says.
        Speaking up. Your doctor might not focus on a benign bump unless you mention that it's painful, irritating, or cosmetically unappealing.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/mastering-memory-maintenance,Mastering memory maintenance,"You know something's important to you when you can't seem to get it out of your mind. For many of us as we age, staying sharp seems to be that thing — a priority that becomes increasingly pressing as we hear frightening projections that dementia will affect nine million Americans ages 65 and older by 2030 and 12 million by 2040.
        ""There's more focus on this now because medical science has done a relatively good job of treating heart disease and cancer, but made fewer strides in addressing memory disorders such as dementia,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. ""I think more people are worried about this than ever.""
        But concern need not feed a sense of helplessness. Indeed, research is revealing we may possess more power against brain decline than once believed. A large new study zeroes in on the potent influence a healthy lifestyle exerts on memory maintenance, even in older adults with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia.
        ""Just because you have a family history of a medical condition or neurocognitive disorder like dementia doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be stricken with it,"" says Lydia Cho, a neuropsychologist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""Our genetics don't completely define our physical and neurocognitive health. We have a choice for how to improve our bodies and minds to live the healthiest life we can.""
        Healthy habits matter
        The new study, published online Jan. 25, 2023, by The BMJ, involved more than 29,000 people in China without dementia (average age 72). Participants initially underwent cognitive testing, as well as genetic testing a variant of the APOE gene, APOE4, which is known to raise the risk for Alzheimer's.
        Participants also reported how stringently they stuck to six good lifestyle habits: eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, not smoking, not drinking alcohol, being socially active, and engaging in brain-challenging activities. Over the next 10 years, participants periodically reported their lifestyle habits and had additional cognitive tests.
        By the study's end, people who stuck with at least four healthy habits exhibited significantly slower memory decline than those who didn't practice any healthy habits — and this was true even among participants with the Alzheimer's-related gene.
        Dr. Budson wasn't surprised by the findings, noting that earlier studies reported similar results. ""But I'm thrilled that additional evidence has shown that by making these healthy lifestyle changes, people really are able to reduce their risk of developing dementia,"" he says. ""I think the study's message is clear: your fate, to a large extent, is in your own hands.""
        The central six
        Let's dissect the six lifestyle habits that appear to stem memory decline and why practicing each is important to our brain health.
        1. Eat a healthy diet. Doing so reduces the risk of clots and other blood vessel problems in the brain, thereby cutting the risk of stroke — the second leading cause of memory problems. ""What's bad for the brain? One important example is eating simple sugars and carbohydrates in processed foods, which causes glucose and insulin spikes that can damage brain cells,"" Dr. Budson says.
        2. Exercise regularly. Defined in the study as at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, consistent exercise boosts brain health through two pathways: reducing the risk of stroke and generating growth factors that help spawn new brain cells. ""Plus, there are more new brain cells produced in a structure called the hippocampus — which is critical for learning and memory — than in any other part of the brain,"" Dr. Budson says.
        3. Don't smoke. ""By not smoking, you're doing two very important things: reducing the risk of stroke and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of your red blood cells,"" Dr. Budson says.
        4. Limit drinking. ""There's no evidence that having a single alcoholic beverage a day causes permanent damage to the brain, but there's increasing evidence that having more than one drink per day can,"" Dr. Budson says. ""We all should be aware that with even a single drink, our memory performance will simply not be as good as if we abstained.""
        5. Stay socially active. This can mean regularly visiting friends or relatives, attending parties, participating in meetings, traveling, and chatting online. (See ""Enjoy time online? It may stave off dementia."") Scientists don't fully understand why this tactic keeps brains healthier. ""I think it's because social interactions activate very large areas of the brain,"" Dr. Budson says. ""It's important to keep your mind active, and social interactions are truly one of the best ways to do that.""
        6. Challenge your brain. This can include both fun pursuits and more serious ones — reading, writing, playing chess and card games, taking a course, learning a new language, and the like. ""Crossword puzzles are especially good because they force people to think about concepts and the relationships between words and ideas in new, flexible, creative ways,"" Dr. Budson says.
        
          
            
              
                Enjoy time online? It may be linked to lower dementia risk
                Whiling away a few hours online by posting on social media, playing games, and surfing websites can certainly feel relaxing. But if you're wary that it's just a time sink, think again: using the Internet regularly may be linked to a lower risk of dementia, according to a new observational study.
                The study, published online May 3, 2023, by the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, tracked more than 18,000 people (average age 55, 54% women) for an average of eight years. Every other year, researchers asked participants about their Internet use and administered cognitive testing. Nearly 65% of study participants reported being regular Internet users.
                People who connected online for about two hours a day were about half as likely to develop dementia than those who didn't use the Internet regularly. The Internet users also maintained better verbal reasoning and memory. The benefits disappeared at high levels of Internet use — defined as six to eight hours a day.
                The study authors speculated that online engagement could develop and maintain what's called cognitive reserve — the brain's ability to resist decline and find alternate ways to function efficiently. This could compensate for brain aging. But the study was observational — meaning it couldn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between Internet use and dementia risk — and participants' Internet use was self-reported.
                ""If we take the findings at face value, this would mean Internet use is another cognitive activity that can keep your brain active and healthy, which can potentially increase thinking and memory skills in the short term and reduce the risk of dementia over the long term,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. More study is needed to determine if specific types of online activity might be related to health outcomes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/healthy-eating-for-blood-sugar-control,Healthy eating for blood sugar control,"If you have diabetes, your healthy eating plan should not be that different from a healthy eating plan for someone without diabetes. In fact, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) echoes the dietary guidelines recommended for the general public: A diet centered on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (peas and beans), and low-fat dairy products.
        How carbs fit in
        However, you'll want to pay special attention to your carbohydrate intake. For most people with diabetes, carbohydrates should account for about 45% to 55% of the total calories you eat each day.
        Make sure you choose your carbohydrates wisely — ideally, from vegetables, whole grains, and fruits.
        Try to avoid highly refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta, and rice, as well as candy, sugary soft drinks, and sweets. Refined carbohydrates tend to cause sharp spikes in blood sugar, and can boost blood triglyceride levels.
        The facts on fiber
        Vegetables, fruits, and whole grains not only provide more nutrition per calorie than refined carbohydrates, they also tend to be rich in fiber. Your body digests high-fiber foods more slowly — which means a more moderate rise in blood sugar.
        Fiber comes in two forms: insoluble fiber, the kind found in whole grains, and soluble fiber, found in beans, dried peas, oats, and fruits. Soluble fiber in particular appears to lower blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity, which may mean you need less diabetes medicine.
        In addition, a number of studies suggest that eating plenty of fiber reduces the chances of developing heart disease — and people with diabetes need to do all they can to lower their risk.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fall-shots-whos-most-vulnerable-to-rsv-covid-and-the-flu-202309272977,"Fall shots: Who's most vulnerable to RSV, COVID, and the flu?","The fall calendar doesn't just warn us of impending cold temperatures: It also points toward seasonal upticks in cases of RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), COVID, and influenza. These respiratory viruses were dubbed a ""tripledemic"" last year. After they collided to overload health care systems across the country, hospitalizations rose in tandem for all three illnesses over the fall and winter months.
        Warding off severe cases — which may lead to hospitalization or death — should be top of mind, especially for those who are most vulnerable, a Harvard expert says. And updated versions of all three vaccines are now available to help protect us.
        Why do cases of flu, RSV, and COVID typically rise in fall?
        ""This is typically the time of year we start to see viral infections increase, which has a lot to do with kids going back to school,"" says Dr. John Ross, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who is board-certified in infectious diseases.
        ""Also, we're starting now to have weather that's more favorable for viral transmission, particularly lower humidity. Viruses survive better in dry air. And drier air also affects our airways and makes them more vulnerable to being infected.""
        Who is eligible for each shot?
        Eligibility recommendations vary by age and vulnerability to serious illnesses. Additionally, some shots are designed to help protect specific groups against serious illness.
        The CDC recommends these shots for the following groups.
        
          RSV
        
        
          Babies under 8 months and older infants at risk of severe RSV: A new shot, nirsevimab (Beyfortus), provides antibodies that protect against RSV for about five months.
          If you're pregnant: One vaccine (Abrysvo) is approved at 32 weeks to 36 weeks of pregnancy. Having this shot during pregnancy protects infants during the first six months of life.
          If you're over 60: Two vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) are approved. Ask your health provider if you should consider getting one.
        
        
          COVID
        
        
          Everyone 6 months and older should consider getting one of the updated COVID boosters, which were approved and authorized for emergency use by the FDA in early September. 
          Age 5 and older: Regardless of prior vaccination, children and adults are eligible for one dose of an updated mRNA vaccine if it's been at least two months since their last COVID vaccine, the FDA says.
        
        
          Flu
        
        
          Everyone 6 months and older should receive a flu vaccine.
          Different vaccines are approved for different age groups and for people with certain health issues or allergies. Most protect against four strains of flu virus (quadrivalent vaccines) expected to circulate this season.
          Three vaccines could potentially be more effective for people over 65: Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent vaccine; Flublok Quadrivalent Recombinant vaccine; and Fluad Quadrivalent adjuvanted flu vaccine. If these are not available, it's fine to get any other flu shot approved for your age and health issues or allergies.
        
        Who is likely to benefit most?
        Getting the right vaccines can help people avoid missed work or school days and running the risk of making others sick. And the protection offered by these shots is especially important for certain groups.
        For all three viruses, the people most vulnerable to severe illness are similar, Dr. Ross says, including
        
          adults 65 and older
          those with compromised immune systems or underlying lung conditions such as COPD and asthma
          those who are pregnant.
        
        ""Certainly with COVID and flu, pregnancy outcomes are worse with those infections,"" Dr. Ross says. ""I'm not saying that RSV isn't a risk for pregnant mothers, but there's not much data. The reason pregnant women are offered RSV vaccination is so the maternal antibodies they produce protect the newborns, because they're at very high risk for RSV with very bad outcomes.""
        Additionally, an even wider range of people are more prone to complications from the flu, according to the CDC. This includes
        
          infants under 2
          people with heart disease, neurologic conditions, blood disorders, endocrine disorders such as diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, liver or metabolic disorders
          people who have had a stroke.
        
        What else should you know about flu, COVID, and RSV shots?
        Beyond broad guidance determining who's eligible for each type of vaccine, Dr. Ross offers other useful insight that may guide your choices.
        
          When is the best time to get a flu shot?
        
        The CDC recommends getting a flu shot in September or October, and Dr. Ross agrees. ""These are usually the months the flu vaccine becomes available and vaccine clinics are easiest to find,"" he says. ""My personal approach is just to get the vaccine when it's available, so you don't forget.""
        
          Will the updated COVID vaccines protect against newer strains of the virus?
        
        The latest mRNA shots by drugmakers Pfizer and Moderna are monovalent, meaning they protect against one variant — XBB.1.5, the most recent to descend from Omicron earlier in 2023. Though that strain is no longer dominant, the boosters should still guard against closely related subvariants that are now circulating, Dr. Ross says. ""People can feel comfortable about their protection regardless,"" he says.
        
          What else should I know about RSV shots?
        
        The version meant for infants, Beyfortus, isn't a vaccine at all. It's a monoclonal antibody product that directly delivers antibodies that protect babies for the duration of a single fall-winter RSV season. These antibodies can prevent RSV or lessen its severity.
        Dr. Ross says adults over 60 considering RSV vaccination should be aware of the potential for two rare but potentially serious side effects of the nervous system: the autoimmune conditions Guillain-Barre syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or ADEM. Guillain-Barre can lead to bodywide paralysis, while ADEM can cause weakness and seizures. The risk of these side effects after RSV vaccination in adults is about one in 7,000 — far higher than occurs after flu vaccination, Dr. Ross notes.
        ""If you're a totally healthy 60-year-old, I'm not sure it makes sense to get the RSV vaccine,"" he says. ""It's a conversation you should have with your doctor.""
        
          How should I schedule shots if I'm getting several vaccines?
        
        Research suggests that it's safe to get both flu and COVID vaccines at the same time. Reactions (such as muscle aches, fatigue, and headache) are slightly higher when flu vaccine and an mRNA COVID vaccine are combined, according to one study, though these reactions usually are mild and disappear quickly.
        ""Because RSV vaccines are newer, I don't think we know much about combining these shots with other vaccines,"" says Dr. Ross. Scheduling this vaccine separately is a good idea, although you should talk to your doctor about potential risks and benefits for your situation.",Maureen Salamon,"September 27, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-your-daily-nap-doing-more-harm-than-good,Is your daily nap doing more harm than good?,"A midday snooze can be helpful, but the need for one might signal chronic sleep deprivation.
        
        
          
        
        In many cultures, napping in the afternoon is not only common, but a regular part of daily life. In the United States, as many as a third of adults regularly partake in a midday catnap, according to the National Sleep Foundation.
        If you are in good health, these short daytime sleeps can bring benefits: helping you catch up on a late night, making you feel less cranky, or ensuring you're well rested if you do a job that falls outside traditional daytime work hours. They can also keep you safe on the road, protecting you from drowsy-driving accidents.
        ""In addition to reducing sleepiness, naps have been shown to improve memory in the laboratory setting.
        But the research on napping isn't all rosy.
        There have been some large epidemiology studies that have suggested both benefits and harms with napping on a population level. It is difficult to draw conclusions on the individual level.
        The pros and cons of naps
        For example, some studies have found that adults who take long naps during the day may be more likely to have conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and depression. The urge to sleep during the day may be a sign that they are not getting enough sleep at night, which is associated with a higher risk of developing those chronic conditions. Daytime drowsiness may also be a sign that you are getting low-quality sleep, which may indicate a sleep disorder.
        In some instances, napping sets up a vicious cycle. You sleep during the day to make up for lost sleep at night, but then you have a harder time falling asleep at night because you slept during the day.
        Limiting naps is one potential strategy to improve overall nighttime sleep.
        How to nap well
        If you do plan to take a nap during the day, here are some guidelines you can follow to help ensure that it won't interfere with your nighttime slumber.
        Time it right. The best time to sleep is the early afternoon, when your body experiences a natural circadian dip. If you take a nap in the late afternoon or evening, it will likely be harder to fall asleep later.
        Keep it short. Abbreviated sleeps, around 20 minutes, may be best to avoid grogginess when you wake up. Shorter naps can also help to prevent you from having trouble falling asleep that evening. Time it right by setting an alarm.
        Get comfortable. For a high-quality rest, be sure to find a quiet, cozy spot where you won't be distracted.
        Examine your motivation. If you need to nap during the day, it is important to assess why you may be sleepy enough to fall asleep during the day, especially if you nap regularly. Track how much sleep you are getting at night. If you aren't getting enough, try to improve your sleep habits (see ""Tips for better nighttime sleep""). If you are already getting at least seven or more hours of sleep at night and are still tired during the day, discuss this with your doctor.
        
          
            
              
                Tips for better nighttime sleep
                If you find yourself tossing and turning at night, here are some strategies you can use to rest more soundly.
                Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.
                Avoid alcohol and caffeine late in the day. These can both interfere with sleep quality.
                Turn off electronics at least one hour before bedtime. Blue light from screens, such as your television or phone, can make it harder for you to fall asleep. So shut them down at least an hour before you turn in.
                Exercise regularly. Daily workouts during the day can help promote better nighttime sleep.
                Set the stage. You'll get the best sleep if your room is cool, dark, and quiet.
                Be alert to signs of a sleep disorder. Pay a visit to your doctor if you are sleeping for the recommended seven to eight hours a night and are still feeling fatigued.

        A barium swallow, or upper GI series, is an x-ray test used to examine the upper digestive tract (the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine). Because these organs are normally not visible on x-rays, you need to swallow barium, a liquid that does show up on x-rays. The barium temporarily coats the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and intestine, making the outline of these organs visible on the x-ray pictures. This test is useful to help evaluate potential problems in the esophagus, stomach and first part of the intestine. Images may suggest conditions such as an ulcer, narrowing of the esophagus, or an abnormal mass that could be a benign tumor or cancer,
        How do I prepare for the test?
        Tell your doctor and the x-ray technicians if there is any chance you could be pregnant. If you have diabetes or take an SGLT2 inhibitor for weight loss, let your doctor know because medication adjustment may be necessary prior to the test.
        Stop eating and drinking the night before your test. This is important because food in your stomach or intestine could prevent the doctors from seeing a clear outline of these structures on the x-rays. Usually it isn't a problem for you to take most of your regular pills, but you should check with your doctor.
        What happens when the test is performed?
        You wear a hospital gown for the test. At the start of the test, you drink barium, a liquid that looks like a milk shake but does not taste nearly as good (most patients say it tastes like chalk). You might also be asked to swallow some tablets that ""fizz,"" causing air-bubbles to be released in your stomach. This might make you feel like burping, but try not to. You will get better pictures if you can keep yourself from burping.
        The x-ray technician may ask you to stand or lie in different positions over the next few minutes, to help spread around the liquid you have swallowed. Most often, the x-ray pictures are taken while you lie on your back on a table. The x-ray machine or the table is moved a few times so it can take pictures of all of the internal structures. You are asked to hold your breath for each picture so that your breathing movement does not blur the image.
        What risks are there from the test?
        There are no significant risks. You are exposed to a small amount of radiation during the test, but the amount of radiation is too small to be likely to cause any health problems.
        Must I do anything special after the test is over?
        After the test, you can eat normally and do your normal activities. You should drink more water than usual to help clear out the barium and to prevent constipation, which might be a side effect of the test. Your stool may appear light in color for a couple of days.
        How long is it before the result of the test is known?
        Typically you can get the results within a day or two.",Unknown,"September 21, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/when-and-how-should-you-be-screened-for-colon-cancer-202309202975,When — and how — should you be screened for colon cancer?,"Colon cancer is the second-deadliest form of cancer after lung cancer. If recent messages about colon cancer screening have left you a little confused, that's understandable. In August, the American College of Physicians (ACP) released updated guidance for colon cancer screening that differs from other major organizations, including recommendations from the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the US Preventive Services Task force (USPSTF).

So, what do you need to know?

How does the advice differ?

First, please note that this advice applies only to people at average risk without a family history of colon cancer. If you have family history, or if other health issues put you at higher-than-average risk for colorectal cancer, talk to your doctor about the best course of action for you.

The main point of disagreement relates to the age at which people should start getting screened. The new ACP guidance says 50, while the other two organizations recommend 45. That earlier age is endorsed by the U.S. Multisociety Task Force on Colorectal Cancer. It's also endorsed by many physicians, including Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Andrew T. Chan, a gastroenterologist and director of epidemiology at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, who helps explain key facts below.

Why do experts suggest starting screening earlier?

""We're facing an unexplained and alarming increase in the incidence of colon cancer in people younger than 50,"" says Dr. Chan.

Overall, deaths from colon cancer dropped by 2% per year from 2011 to 2020. But that's not the case among people younger than 50. In that age group, deaths from colon cancer rose between 0.5% and 3% during the same time period, according to statistics published in 2023.

The rising rates of colon cancer in younger people are occurring in all racial and ethnic groups, with the steepest rises seen among Alaskan Natives and Native Americans. Overall, Blacks and African Americans are more likely to get and die from colon cancer than whites, and early-onset cases are higher in Black individuals than whites.

Efforts to encourage colon cancer screening began in the mid-1990s. Today, about 60% of adults over 50 follow the advice to receive a colonoscopy (described below) on a regular basis. This track record, while not perfect, likely explains the decline in deaths from colon cancer in older adults.

""I think that promoting earlier screening will help stem the rise in early-onset cases, at least for those in their 40s. We've also seen that earlier colonoscopies may be associated with lowering incidence of colon cancer even later in life, ""says Dr. Chan.

What are the different screening tests for colon cancer?

The two most widely used screening tests are a standard colonoscopy and various stool-based tests.

Colonoscopy. For this test, a gastroenterologist or surgeon snakes a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end through your rectum and beyond to inspect the entire length of your colon. Considered the gold-standard test, this procedure can detect precancerous polyps called adenomas, and allow for their removal.

The test requires taking laxatives and drinking lots of fluids beforehand to clean all the fecal material (stool) out of your colon. Serious complications, which include perforation or bleeding, are rare, occurring in about three in 1,000 procedures. If no polyps are found, a repeat colonoscopy isn't recommended for another 10 years. If you have polyps, or your risk or symptoms change, this interval will be shorter.

Stool tests. The more worrisome colon polyps (adenomas) often shed tiny amounts of blood and abnormal DNA into the stool. This can be detected from samples you collect yourself at home.


	Two tests, the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical test (FIT), check for blood. They require small stool samples that you put on a card or in a tube that's then mailed to a lab. These tests should be done every year.
	A third option, the FIT-DNA test, checks for both blood and abnormal DNA; it's usually repeated every three years.


Additionally, the guidelines from the American College of Physicians suggest another option: flexible sigmoidoscopy, which inspects only the lower part of the colon, once every 10 years, combined with a fecal FIT testing every two years. However, doctors in the United States rarely order sigmoidoscopy today.

If flexible sigmoidoscopy or any of these stool tests show evidence of a problem, a colonoscopy is needed to check for adenomas or cancer.

Why might stool-based screening make sense for younger adults?

Colonoscopy isn't necessarily the best initial screening test for everyone, says Dr. Chan. That's especially true for younger people, mainly because it's time-consuming and inconvenient.

""Maybe you just can't find time in your schedule or are worried about having a colonoscopy,"" he says. If that's the case, a stool-based test — which is noninvasive and takes very little time — is an appropriate option.

""The worst option is not doing anything, because early detection and treatment can prevent deaths,"" he says.",Julie Corliss,"September 20, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/got-expendable-body-parts-202309182974,7 organs or glands you may do just fine without,"There was a time when pediatricians routinely recommended tonsil removal, even for healthy children — including me. As far as I can tell, I suffered no ill effects — plus, I got extra ice cream!
        That practice is no longer routine. But it does raise an interesting question: Why do we have body parts that can be safely removed? If they're not needed, why do humans have them in the first place?
        One theory is that these nonessential organs and glands once served important roles in the lives of our evolutionary ancestors but now represent anatomic remnants. For example, it was long thought that the appendix helped our predecessors digest food, but over thousands of years became obsolete. And some organs are supremely useful during certain stages of life, but then become expendable.
        Seven (mostly) unnecessary body parts
        Here are seven removable parts of the body:
        Appendix
        This organ is about the size of your little finger and hangs from the lower right side of your colon. For reasons that aren't clear, this part of the intestinal tract sometimes becomes blocked, infected, or inflamed. Aptly enough, the word appendicitis means inflammation of the appendix. While it may settle down with antibiotic treatment, emergency surgical removal (an appendectomy) is often necessary.
        Tonsils
        A network of lymph nodes throughout the body is part of the immune surveillance system that helps trap dangerous invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Consider your two tonsils as larger, specialized lymph nodes watching out for these intruders. They are located at the back of the throat just to the sides of and behind the uvula, the dangling piece of tissue above them.
        Now, removing the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is only recommended for people with repeated bouts of bacterial throat infections such as strep throat, a condition common in children. Once removed, other lymphoid tissue, including the actual lymph nodes, can take over the job of the tonsils.
        Adenoids
        Situated in the back of the nose where the nasal passages meet the mouth and throat, adenoids are similar to tonsils. They can also become inflamed, infected, and swollen. So when the tonsils are removed, the adenoids are generally removed at the same time. The combined procedure is called tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. As is true for the tonsils, other lymphoid tissue takes over when the adenoids are gone.
        Gallbladder
        The gallbladder sits just under the liver in the upper right part of the abdomen. It stores bile made in the liver and releases it into the digestive tract when needed to help digest fatty foods. The gallbladder may need to be removed (a cholecystectomy) if it becomes inflamed, a condition called cholecystitis. Most often this occurs due to infection or gallstones, which are a hardened collection of bile. In some cases, rest and antibiotics can control gallbladder inflammation so removal can be delayed or even avoided.
        Uterus
        This remarkable reproductive organ has a single purpose: to support fetal growth until birth. When necessary, the uterus can generally be removed (hysterectomy) without impairing health. Common reasons for removal include painful or excessive menstruation, benign growths called fibroids that cause pain or bleeding, or cancer.
        Thymus gland
        This small gland sits high in the upper chest behind the breastbone. In a fetus or newborn, it's quite important in the development and maturation of the immune system. But adults can live well without it. Surgery to remove the thymus (a thymectomy) may be recommended if the thymus becomes cancerous, or if a person develops the autoimmune condition myasthenia gravis.
        Spleen
        Like adenoids and tonsils, the spleen is made up of lymphoid tissue. It filters the blood, removing infectious organisms, aging blood cells, and other abnormal cells traveling through the bloodstream. But sometimes the spleen becomes overactive and begins removing healthy cells.
        For example, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) may develop when platelets (clotting blood cells that prevent excessive bleeding) are removed from circulation. With few platelets left in the bloodstream, bruising and bleeding may be life-threatening. Although medications can help, removal of the spleen (a splenectomy) may be necessary. Or sometimes trauma to the spleen, especially after sports injuries and car accidents, causes internal bleeding, which may lead to splenectomy.
        People who lack a spleen are more prone to certain infections, so if removal isn't urgent, a number of vaccinations are recommended before splenectomy.
        The bottom line
        I've heard it said that at least half of all body parts are unnecessary. That's a myth. But as with most myths, there is some truth to it: there are indeed many body parts that can be safely removed. That said, it's generally best to avoid unnecessary surgery and keep the parts you were born with if you can.
        Sure, you can survive and thrive despite having your appendix removed. But it's worth keeping in mind that our understanding about so-called spare parts may change over time. The appendix is a good example: researchers have discovered that the appendix may play a role in immune development and stores ""good bacteria"" to repopulate the gut in case of future illness. And there is evidence that removing the thymus may slightly increase the risk of cancer, autoimmune disorders, and death.
        Someday we may discover important functions for other body parts we now consider expendable. And maybe then I'll wish I had my tonsils back.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","September 18, 2023"

        If you've got a vomiting kid, you don't need to rush out to the drugstore and buy those oral rehydration solutions. Just add some water to the juice you have in the refrigerator, and you're all set.
        That's the bottom line of a study published in JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association). Researchers studied about 600 children who came to the emergency room with stomach flu and minimal dehydration. Half of them were given dilute apple juice, and half were given an oral rehydration electrolyte solution (like Pedialyte), colored to look like apple juice and sweetened to make it taste better. The families whose children got the apple juice were told to give them whatever fluids they would take once they got home, while the ones who got the electrolyte solution were told to continue giving the solution at home.
        The children that got apple juice were less likely to need intravenous fluids or end up back in the emergency room.
        There are a few reasons why doctors have recommended the special solutions. The major reason is that they worry that fluids that have a lot of sugar in them, like juice or Gatorade, can worsen diarrhea. The other reason is that when you have a lot of vomiting or diarrhea, you can lose electrolytes like sodium that are crucial for your body's function. And certainly, in children with severe dehydration or in very small infants, these are real worries.
        But for the average child sick with stomach flu who has only mild dehydration, these aren't big worries. Those kids generally do just fine as long as they get fluids into them — pretty much any fluids. And as any parent knows, kids are most likely to drink fluids that are familiar to them, and that taste good. Solutions like Pedialyte are not familiar to most children — and while they don't taste bad, they can have an odd taste that many children don't like.
        Here are some important tips when giving fluids to children with vomiting and diarrhea:
        
          Start with clear fluids, like the diluted apple juice used in the study. Once they are keeping that down well, you can try milk or other fluids.
          The ""dilute"" part is also a good place to start. A little extra water, and a little less sugar, is easier on the stomach. Once they are keeping fluids down, it's less important to add the water.
          When children are vomiting, give them little bits at a time (an ounce or two) to be sure it stays down. Sometimes kids will be thirsty and want to take more — but their stomach can't handle it yet. Keep giving the small amounts until they are keeping fluids down.
        
        If your child can't keep anything down or is having repeated diarrhea, goes more than 6 hours without urinating, seems excessively tired to you, has a high fever, or has really bad pain of any kind, call your doctor. You should also call for advice if your child is less than 6 months old or has any ongoing medical problems.

          Q.
          I have about three episodes of heartburn per month and it often lasts all day. What do you suggest?
        
        A. Heartburn is caused by stomach acid moving up and out of the stomach and into the lower part of the esophagus. Reducing the overall acidity in the stomach protects the esophagus from irritation when the stomach contents back up (reflux).
        The fastest treatment is to neutralize the acid already in the stomach and lower esophagus by taking an over-the-counter antacid. While antacids work within minutes, they often don't last, so you may have to take repeated doses until symptoms subside.
        For longer-lasting relief, you can try an H2 blocker, which stops stomach cells from making acid. There are several over-the-counter brands of H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and ranitidine (Zantac). Generic versions also are available. H2 blockers come as a pill, liquid, or chewable or effervescent tablet. Most people react well to all of them.
        H2 blockers begin to act within an hour and last for another 10 to 12 hours. (If you still need the occasional antacid, wait 30 to 60 minutes after taking one before adding an H2 blocker.) Proton-pump inhibitors are even stronger acid blockers. Over-the-counter brands include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24HR), omeprazole (Losec, Omesec, Prilosec OTC), and omeprazole with sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid). If your heartburn doesn't respond to these drugs or lasts for more than 10 days, see your doctor.

        We all benefit from inflammation, the process by which our immune system detects and disables foreign molecules or microbes. Although we may not enjoy the runny nose and scratchy throat of a winter cold—the signs of our immune system at work—inflammation eventually rids us of the virus responsible. However, when inflammation persists at low levels after the invader is eradicated, it can become our enemy. Many major diseases that plague us—including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, depression, and Alzheimer's—have been linked to chronic inflammation.
        Our diets play an important role in chronic inflammation because our digestive bacteria release chemicals that may spur or suppress inflammation. The types of bacteria that populate our gut and their chemical byproducts vary according to the foods we eat. Some foods encourage the grow of populations of bacteria that stimulate inflammation, while others promote the growth of bacteria that suppress it.
        That's why one of the most powerful tools to combat inflammation comes not from the pharmacy, but from the produce counter. Many experimental studies have shown that components of foods or beverages may have anti-inflammatory effects.
        Choose the right foods, and you may be able to reduce your risk of illness. Consistently pick the wrong ones, and you may promote chronic inflammation, which sets the stage for a host of degenerative diseases
        
          Inflammation-promoting foods
          Not surprisingly, the foods that contribute to inflammation are the same ones generally considered bad for our health, including sodas and refined carbohydrates, as well as red meat and processed meats.
          Some of the foods that have been associated with an increased risk for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease are also associated with excess inflammation. It's not surprising, since inflammation is an important underlying mechanism for the development of these diseases.
          Such unhealthy foods are also likely to contribute to weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for inflammation. Yet in several studies, even after researchers took obesity into account, the link between foods and inflammation remained, which suggests weight gain isn't the sole driver. Mounting evidence suggests that certain components or ingredients in processed foods, like the emulsifiers added to ice cream, may have independent effects on inflammation.
        
        
          Inflammation-fighting foods
          Fortunately, you are probably already enjoying many of the foods and beverages that have been found to reduce the risk of inflammation, and with it, chronic disease. They include the following:
          Fruits and vegetables. Most fruits brightly colored vegetables contain high levels of natural antioxidants and polyphenols—protective compounds found in plants.
          Nuts and seeds. Studies have also associated nuts and seeds with reduced markers of inflammation and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
          Beverages. The polyphenols in coffee and the flavonols in cocoa are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea is rich in both polyphenols and antioxidants.
        
        
          Anti-inflammatory eating
          It's best to focus on an overall healthy diet rather than singling out individual ""good"" and ""bad"" foods, so you won't need bookkeeping software to balance your intake of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory foods. In general, a healthy diet means one high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils. If your plate is dominated by unprocessed plant-based foods and bursting with color, you're on the right track.
          In addition to lowering inflammation, a more natural, less processed diet can have noticeable effects on your physical and emotional health. A healthy diet is beneficial not only for reducing the risk of chronic diseases, but also for improving your mood and your overall quality of life.",Unknown,"September 18, 2023"

But if things change, home remedies often help.
        
        
 Image: © ttsz, JFalcetti/Thinkstock
        You received good news after your last colonoscopy: no cancer or precancerous polyps. But with the good news came with another finding: though you don't have symptoms, you do have diverticulosis and hemorrhoids. The news may be puzzling, but don't worry. Both conditions are common and usually don't cause any problems.
        
          Diverticulosis
        
        Diverticulosis is the term used to describe the presence of diverticula — pouch-like structures that sometimes form in the muscular wall of the colon and bulge outward. Between 40% and 60% of people have them, and they get more common as we age. They tend to cluster in the sigmoid colon, just above the rectum.
        Diverticulosis only causes symptoms if one of the diverticula bleeds or gets infected. When bleeding does occur, it tends to be intense for a short period, but usually stops on its own. We don't know the cause of the diverticular bleeding, only that something injures a blood vessel in the pouch. Even if bleeding stops on its own, you can still lose a considerable amount of blood, so you should see a doctor.
        In some people, diverticula can get infected. That's called diverticulitis. It's not clear why or how diverticulitis develops. Age, obesity, a lack of exercise, and a low-fiber diet are risk factors for the condition. 
        Typical symptoms of diverticulitis include lower abdominal pain, more often on the left side; fever; and change in bowel habits, either loose stools or constipation. Mild cases might not even need antibiotics. But most often doctors will treat will oral antibiotics initially to prevent it from getting worse. People with more severe disease, such as an abscess (pocket of infection) or pus that needs drainage, often need hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics.
        
          Preventing problems
        
        It's not clear yet if we can prevent diverticulosis or diverticulitis. Exercising, controlling your weight, and eating less red meat and more fiber may help. Some data suggest that more fiber reduces the risk of both developing diverticula and getting symptoms if you already have them.
        Adults should get 25 to 30 grams of dietary fiber every day from foods such as beans, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. A fiber supplement may also help. But add fiber to your diet slowly, since you can get gas and bloating if you increase your fiber intake too fast.
        What about the warning that eating foods with small seeds can add to diverticulitis risk? There used to be a theory that seeds, nuts, and popcorn increased the risk of diverticulosis and diverticulitis, because they might lodge in the pouches and cause irritation or infection. However, that's never been proved. Seeds and nuts are an important source of fiber.
        
          Hemorrhoids
        
        Hemorrhoids have a bad rap, but we all have these pillow-like clusters of veins in the lining of the lower part of the rectum and anus, which help play a role in preventing stool leakage. When they become enlarged, however, they are anything but helpful and can even contribute to some leakage in addition to pain, itching, and bleeding.
        What causes hemorrhoids to swell? The veins are anchored by connective tissue. If the tissue is weakened, the hemorrhoids bulge out. The weakened tissue may be caused by a combination of genetics and pressure from sitting on a toilet too long or straining to have a bowel movement. Pregnancy is also a common trigger.
        When hemorrhoids in the lower rectum (internal hemorrhoids) swell, they may bleed, and you may see bright red blood in the toilet. But you won't feel the hemorrhoids unless they extend beyond the anus and become itchy.
        The hemorrhoids most people complain about (called external hemorrhoids) are located outside the anus. If they become swollen, the overlying skin becomes irritated, erodes, and may itch or hurt. A clot can form inside the hemorrhoid, which can be very painful.
        
          Treatment and prevention
        
        Hemorrhoids are typically diagnosed from a medical history and physical exam. Home remedies are usually effective to treat external hemorrhoids. Sitting in a warm bath may help soothe an irritated hemorrhoid. And lifestyle changes can also make a difference. Avoid sitting and straining on the toilet for long periods, and make sure stool moves along. He suggests increasing dietary fiber intake; using stool softener, such as docusate (Colace); or using a gentle laxative if you're constipated, such as polyethylene glycol 3350 (Miralax).
        Internal hemorrhoids that are bothersome are usually resolved with minimally invasive procedures performed in a doctor's office.",Unknown,"September 18, 2023"

https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/upper-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy-or-egd-a-to-z,Upper endoscopy (eophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD),"What is the test?
        This test inspects your esophagus, stomach and the first section of intestine (the duodenum) using an endoscope. An upper endoscopy allows the doctor to explore the cause of such symptoms as difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, vomiting up blood, or passing blood in the stool. It can also diagnose irritation, ulcers, and cancers of the lining of the esophagus and stomach. During this type of endoscopy, the doctor can also take biopsy samples of tissue.
        How do I prepare for the test?
        Don't eat or drink anything for eight hours before this test. It's also best to stop taking aspirin and other NSAIDs for several days beforehand, to reduce the chances of bleeding should your doctor need to take a biopsy. Ask your doctor if you should avoid taking any other medicines on the day of the test. If you have diabetes, talk with your doctor about ways to avoid low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) since you will be fasting. If you wear dentures, remove them before the test. Arrange for a ride home because the medicine given for this test will make you drowsy.
        What happens when the test is performed?
        The nurse will place an intravenous catheter into your arm. During the procedure, the nurse will be monitoring your heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen content of your blood. You'll probably be given a sedative through an IV. This medicine may prevent you from remembering the test; it might even make you sleep through it.
        The doctor will spray a local anesthetic into your throat to prevent you from gagging when the endoscope is inserted. The endoscope used in this test is about half an inch in diameter and long enough to reach from your mouth through your stomach and into the first part of your small intestine. When the doctor places the endoscope in your throat, he or she asks you to swallow. This helps guide the endoscope into your esophagus. You are likely to feel pressure against your throat while the tube is in place and you might experience a ""full"" feeling in your stomach.
        The doctor gently advances the tube through your esophagus into your stomach. He or she will then move the scope into the duodenum. The camera at the end of the scope takes pictures that appear on a video screen. Your doctor will watch for any suspicious spots on the lining of your esophagus, stomach and duodenum. If any appear, your doctor might use some small clippers on the end of the scope to remove a tiny piece of tissue for a biopsy.
        Though the exam itself takes only 10-15 minutes, you will probably be in the exam room for 40 minutes or more because of the time it takes to set up. Your throat will feel numb, but this will wear off about 30 minutes later. The sedative will make you sleepy for an hour or more.
        What risks are there from the test?
        Complications are rare. One possible complication is aspiration (accidentally inhaling saliva into the lungs), which can cause pneumonia. If a biopsy is taken, or if the endoscope injures the wall of the esophagus or stomach, it can cause bleeding. If severe, internal bleeding can require a transfusion. In rare cases, perforation of the lining of the stomach, esophagus, or intestine can also occur, requiring surgery. The sedative given can sometimes cause an allergic reaction.
        Must I do anything special after the test is over?
        Medical personnel will probably watch you for half an hour or more after the test. Although you may eat an hour after the test, you shouldn't drive or drink alcohol for the rest of the day due to grogginess from the sedative. Call your doctor if you experience dizziness, chest pain, difficulty or pain with swallowing, fever, black stools, or vomiting material that looks like coffee grounds. The last two symptoms can indicate that you are bleeding from your stomach lining.
        How long is it before the result of the test is known?

https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/percutaneous-transhepatic-cholangiography-ptca-a-to-z,Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTCA),"What is the test?
        Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is an x-ray test that can help show whether there is a blockage in the liver or the bile ducts that drain it. Since the liver and its drainage system do not normally show up on x-rays, the doctor doing the x-ray needs to inject a special dye directly into the drainage system of the liver. This dye, which is visible on x-rays, should then spread out to fill the whole drainage system. If it does not, that means there is a blockage. This type of blockage might result from a gallstone or a cancer in the liver.
        How do I prepare for the test?
        Tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to lidocaine or the numbing medicine used at the dentist's office, or to x-ray dye. Also tell your doctor if you could be pregnant, since x-rays can harm the developing baby. If you have diabetes and take insulin, discuss this with your doctor before the test.
        Most people need to have a blood test done some time before the procedure, to make sure they are not at high risk for bleeding complications. If you take an anticoagulant drug (blood thinner), aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or other medicines that affect blood clotting, talk with your doctor. It may be necessary to stop or adjust the dose of these medicines before your test.
        You will be told not to eat anything on the morning of the test so that your stomach is empty. This is a safety measure in the unlikely case you have a complication, such as bleeding, that might require surgery.
        What happens when the test is performed?
        You lie on a table wearing a hospital gown. An IV (intravenous) line is inserted into a vein in case you need medicines or fluid during the procedure. An area over your right rib cage is cleaned with an antibacterial soap. Then the radiologist may take a picture of your abdomen with an overhead camera. Medicine is injected through a small needle to numb the skin and the tissue underneath the skin in the area where the dye is to be injected. You may feel some brief stinging from the numbing medicine.
        A separate needle is then inserted between two of your ribs on your right side. The needle is advanced into your liver. A small amount of x-ray dye is injected, and some pictures are taken that are visible on a video screen. Your doctor adjusts the placement of the needle until it is clear that the dye is flowing easily through the ducts (drainage tubes) inside your liver.
        Because taking the x-ray pictures sometimes requires a significant amount of time, the doctor replaces the needle with a softer plastic tube. First, the syringe holding the dye is detached from the top of the needle, leaving the needle in place. The doctor then gently pushes a thin wire through the needle and into the duct where the needle has been sitting. Next the needle is pulled out, sliding over the outside end of the wire. The wire is left with one end inside the liver to hold the position where the needle had been. The doctor then slides a thin plastic tube similar to an IV line along the wire, like a long bead on a string, until it is in the same place where the needle was. The wire is then pulled out, and the syringe with the dye is reattached to the tube.
        Then more dye is injected through the plastic tube, and pictures are taken with the video camera as the dye spreads inside the liver. If there is no blockage, the dye drains out of the liver through the bile ducts and begins to show up on the x-ray in your small intestine. Once all of the needed pictures have been taken, the plastic tube is pulled out, and a small bandage is placed over your side. The whole test usually takes less than an hour.
        What risks are there from the test?
        It is possible to have serious bleeding from this test. In some cases, blood leaks to the outside surface of the liver and causes a buildup of blood there. In other cases, blood can leak directly into the liver's drainage system, in which case it might start showing up in your intestine, causing a bloody bowel movement. It is possible that you could develop an infection after the test, although this is rare. The only soreness you are likely to have is at the skin surface where the needle went in. This should last for only a day or two.
        In rare cases, the dye used in the test can damage your kidneys. This kidney effect is almost always temporary, but some people have permanent damage.
        Because x-rays are used, there is a small exposure to radiation. In large amounts, exposure to radiation can cause cancers or (in pregnant women) birth defects. The amount of radiation from the video x-ray in this test is very small—too small to be likely to cause any harm. (The people performing the test will wear lead shields, since they would otherwise be exposed to this radiation over and over.)
        Must I do anything special after the test is over?
        Call your doctor right away if you have pain in your right abdomen or shoulder, fever, dizziness, or a change in your stool color to black or red.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-to-do-if-you-think-your-child-has-the-flu-2019013015882,What to do if you think your child has the flu,"Once influenza season is underway, it's natural that if you hear your child start coughing, you wonder: could this be the flu or another virus? And if you think it is the flu, what should you do?
        Is it the flu, RSV, COVID –– or just a cold?
        It's not always easy to tell these illnesses apart, especially at the beginning.
        
          Flu: The flu usually comes on suddenly, and its symptoms can include fever, runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, feeling tired, and generally just feeling rotten. Some people have vomiting and/or diarrhea, too. Not everyone has all these symptoms, and the illness can range from mild to severe.
          RSV: Along with fever and sore throat (and feeling tired and rotten), RSV often causes a lot of nasal congestion and a mucusy cough. In some babies, it causes wheezing.
          COVID causes similar symptoms to flu and RSV, but the cough generally isn't as mucusy, the fatigue can be worse, and some people will lose their sense of taste and/or smell.
          The common cold generally causes similar symptoms to flu, RSV, and COVID, but milder and often without a fever. However, some people have bad colds — and some people have mild cases of the flu, RSV, or COVID.
        
        Call your doctor for advice
        Because these illnesses are so similar, it's a good idea to call your doctor's office if your child has cold symptoms. You don't necessarily need an appointment, but you should call for advice. Describe your child's symptoms. Based on the symptoms, and your child's particular situation (such as any medical problems they might have, or vulnerable people like infants or elderly living with you), your doctor
        
          may suggest testing for COVID, flu, or RSV
          may want you to bring your child in
          may want to prescribe antiviral medication.
        
        Because every child and every situation is different, you should call and get advice that is tailored to your child and family.
        What helps when your child has the flu?
        Once you've called your doctor for advice or have a diagnosis of flu, the steps below will help your child feel more comfortable and speed recovery.
        Stock up on supplies
        There are a few things that make getting through the flu easier, including:
        
          acetaminophen and ibuprofen for fever and aches
          a reliable thermometer, if you don't have one
          hand sanitizer (buy a few to keep all over the house)
          tissues
          fluids to keep your child hydrated, such as clear juices, broth, oral rehydration solution (for infants), and popsicles (which are great for sore throats, and eating them is the same as drinking). If you don't have a refillable water bottle (one with a straw is great if kids are lying down), get one of those too.
          honey (if your child is older than a year) and cough drops (if your child is at least preschool age)
          saline nose drops
          a humidifier, if you don't have one
          simple foods like noodle soups, rice, crackers, bread for toast.
        
        Make sure your child rests
        Turn off or at least limit the screens, as they can keep children awake when their body needs them to sleep. Keep rooms darkened, and limit activity. If they aren't sleeping, quiet things like reading (or reading to them), drawing, card games, etc. are best.
        Push fluids, don't worry about food
        When children are fighting the flu, the most important thing is that they stay hydrated. They need a bit of sugar and salt too, which is why juices and broths are good choices. If they only want water, give them some crackers to get the sugar and salt — but don't worry too much if they don't want to eat more than that. They will eat more when they feel better.
        Watch for warning signs
        Most children weather the flu fine, but some children get very sick, and there can be complications. Call your doctor or go to an emergency room if your child has
        
          a high fever (102° F or higher) that won't come down with acetaminophen or ibuprofen, or a new fever after your child seemed to be getting better
          any trouble breathing
          severe pain of any kind
          severe sleepiness, so that it's hard to wake them or keep them awake
          trouble drinking or keeping fluids down
          anything that seems strange or worries you (I always respect a parent's ""Spidey sense"").
        
        Keep your child home until they are well
        That doesn't necessarily mean they can't go to school or daycare until they are cough- or runny nose-free, but it does mean that they have to be fever-free for at least 24 hours, not coughing constantly, able to eat and drink, and have enough energy to do whatever school or daycare entails. Not only is this important for your child's recovery, but it's important for preventing the spread of influenza. Which leads me to the last point…
        Do your best to keep others from getting sick
        Besides keeping your child home (and staying home yourself if you catch it), there are other things you can do, such as:
        
          Make sure everyone in the house washes their hands frequently (that's where the hand sanitizer all over the house comes in handy).
          Teach everyone to cover coughs and sneezes (they should do it into their elbow, not their hands).
          Don't share cups, utensils, towels, or throw blankets.
          Wipe down surfaces and toys regularly.
          Discourage visitors (use technology for virtual visits instead).
          Be thoughtful about physical contact. Some degree of contact and snuggling is part of parenthood, but siblings may want to keep a bit of distance, and you can always blow kisses and do pretend hugs instead of the real thing.
        
        Remember, too, that it's never too late to get a flu shot if you haven't already.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/will-digestive-enzyme-supplements-help-your-heartburn-2018041313643,Digestive enzyme supplements for heartburn?,"My love affair with spicy food came to a sad end a few years ago. Age — and I'm guessing too many jalapenos — have left me prone to heartburn if I eat meals with a fiery flare. My doctor says there's no underlying condition causing the problem, and advises me to avoid the foods that seem to trigger symptoms. But that's tricky sometimes.

So I was particularly interested when a friend suggested that an over-the-counter (OTC) digestive enzyme supplement might help. I learned pretty quickly that there are lots of ads for the pills and powders. It's a booming business, with sales for OTC digestive enzymes of all kinds expected to reach $1.6 billion by 2025.

About the supplements touted for heartburn relief

OTC digestive enzymes claim they can help you break down food, just like digestive enzymes your own body makes (mostly in the pancreas). For example, the enzymes produced by the pancreas include:


	lipase, which breaks down fats
	amylase, which breaks down carbohydrates
	proteases and peptidases, which break down proteins.


The supplement versions of these enzymes come from plants and animals. Plant sources include bromelain, derived from pineapples; papain, derived from papayas; and lactase that's obtained from purified yeasts or fungi. Animal sources include enzymes from the pancreases of pigs, cows, or lambs.

But there's no way to know what's really in supplements. The FDA does not regulate them, therefore you can't be sure what the pills are really made of or the exact amounts of enzymes they may contain. ""It's buyer beware,"" warns Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.

Do supplements help heartburn?

Sometimes the body doesn't make enough digestive enzymes. This can slow the digestion process and lead to uncomfortable symptoms.

Would a digestive enzyme supplement help treat the symptoms of occasional heartburn, caused by acid reflux, slow stomach emptying, or an unknown reason (like I have)? The answer is that we don't know. ""Unfortunately, there is little evidence that OTC digestive enzymes are helpful for heartburn,"" says Dr. Staller.

But we do know that OTC digestive enzymes can help manage other conditions. For example, if you don't make enough of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase, needed to digest the sugar in beans, you may benefit from taking an alpha-galactosidase supplement (Beano, Bean Relief).

Or if you don't make enough of the enzyme lactase, needed to digest lactose — the sugar in milk and milk-based products — you may benefit by taking a lactase supplement (Lactaid, Lactrase). ""If you don't have lactase, the undigested lactose goes to the colon, which leads to more fluid entering the colon and more gas produced by bacteria in the colon. That creates bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea,"" explains Dr. Staller. ""A supplement might help.""

What about prescription enzymes?

Sometimes doctors recommend taking prescription-strength digestive enzymes. These may be necessary when digestion enzyme levels are low because of a health condition such as chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis.

Taking prescription digestive enzyme medications helps bring levels back to normal. ""People with known deficiencies clearly get a benefit,"" says Dr. Staller.

But these medications are not appropriate treatments for heartburn.

The rest of my story

Because I am persistent, I asked if it would hurt to try an OTC digestive enzyme for occasional heartburn. Both my doctor and Dr. Staller had the same answer: ""In most cases, it's unlikely to be harmful. But don't spend a lot of money on them,"" Dr. Staller advised. In other words, it won't hurt, but we don't know if it will help. So don't make a big investment in the treatment.

With that dubious green light and a lot of curiosity, I tried an OTC enzyme made from papaya. And guess what — it helped! But as a health reporter I know that this could have been the result of my own personal hope (the placebo effect) or just a happy coincidence.

I also know that ignoring my doctor's orders to avoid spicy foods (which is my heartburn trigger, but may not be someone else's) would be foolish, and could cause damage to my esophagus. So would using digestive enzymes as a crutch to eat anything I want.

The lesson for me is that the OTC digestive enzyme supplement is there if I need it in a pinch, and that it might or might not work.

But I won't make a habit of using it. I'll keep the spice factor dialed down to a lower heat, and l'll just have to learn to love being symptom-free the way I once loved those jalapenos.",Heidi Godman,"September 12, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fermented-foods-for-better-gut-health-201805161607,Fermented foods for better gut health,"Naturally fermented foods are getting a lot of attention from health experts these days because they may help strengthen your gut microbiome — the 100 trillion or so bacteria and microorganisms that live in your digestive tract. Researchers are beginning to link these tiny creatures to all sorts of health conditions from obesity to neurodegenerative diseases.
        Fermented foods are preserved using an age-old process that not only boosts the food's shelf life and nutritional value, but can give your body a dose of healthy probiotics, which are live microorganisms crucial to healthy digestion, says Dr. David S. Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.
        Not all fermented foods are created equal
        The foods that give your body beneficial probiotics are those fermented using natural processes and containing probiotics. Live cultures are found in not only yogurt and a yogurt-like drink called kefir, but also in Korean pickled vegetables called kimchi, sauerkraut, and in some pickles. The jars of pickles you can buy off the shelf at the supermarket are sometimes pickled using vinegar and not the natural fermentation process using live organisms, which means they don't contain probiotics. To ensure the fermented foods you choose do contain probiotics, look for the words ""naturally fermented"" on the label, and when you open the jar look for telltale bubbles in the liquid, which signal that live organisms are inside the jar, says Dr. Ludwig.
        Try making your own naturally fermented foods
        Below is a recipe from the book Always Delicious by Dr. Ludwig and Dawn Ludwig that can help get you started.
        Spicy pickled vegetables (escabeche)
        These spicy pickles are reminiscent of the Mediterranean and Latin American culinary technique known as escabeche. This recipe leaves out the sugar. Traditionally, the larger vegetables would be lightly cooked before pickling, but we prefer to use a quick fermentation method and leave the vegetables a bit crisp instead.
        
          2 cups filtered water
          1 to 1-1/4 tablespoons sea salt
          2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
          1 jalapeño or a few small hot chiles (or to taste), sliced
          1 large carrot cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds or diagonal slices
          1 to 2 cups chopped cauliflower or small cauliflower florets
          3 small stalks celery (use only small inner stalks from the heart), cut into 1-inch-long sticks
          1 bay leaf
          1 cabbage leaf, rinsed
        
        Warm the water (no need to boil). Stir in the sea salt until it dissolves completely. Set aside to cool (use this time to cut the vegetables). Add the vinegar just before using. The brine can be made ahead of time and stored in a sealed glass jar on the counter to use when ready to pickle.
        Set a quart-size canning jar in the sink and fill it with boiling water to sterilize. Empty the jar and tightly pack the vegetables and bay leaf inside to within 1 to 2 inches from the top of the jar. Pour the brine over the vegetables to fill the jar to within 1 inch from the top. Wedge the cabbage leaf over the top of the vegetables and tuck it around the edges to hold the vegetables beneath the liquid.
        Set jar on the counter and cover with a fermentation lid. (Alternatively, use a standard lid and loosen it a bit each day for the first few days, then every other day, to allow gasses to escape.) Let pickle for three to five days, depending on the indoor temperature. Check the taste after a couple of days, using clean utensils. Vegetables will pickle faster in warmer climates. Make sure the vegetables stay packed beneath the level of the liquid and add salted water (2 teaspoons sea salt dissolved in 1 cup warm filtered water) as needed.
        When the vegetables are pickled to your liking, seal the jar with a regular lid and refrigerate. Vegetables will continue to slowly pickle in the refrigerator. They will keep for about one month. Taste for saltiness before serving and, if desired, rinse gently to remove excess salt.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/6-self-help-tips-for-hemorrhoid-flare-ups-201307196496,6 self-help tips for hemorrhoid flare-ups,"Getting older has its benefits—and its drawbacks. Included in the latter are hemorrhoids. These swollen blood vessels on the outer rectum and anus can turn bowel movements into intensely painful experiences. Classic symptoms include rectal pain, itching, bleeding, and possibly prolapse (protrusion of hemorrhoids into the anal canal). Although hemorrhoids are rarely dangerous, they can be a painful recurrent bother.
        Hemorrhoids come in two varieties. The internal type sprout from within the rectum. External hemorrhoids develop on the anus itself. Either way, stools passing by them can cause pain and bleeding.
        But simple self-help measures can ease the ordeal of most hemorrhoids and allow healing. Here are effective steps you can take to care for hemorrhoids—and when it's time to seek out a procedure to remove them.
        
          What helps hemorrhoids
        
        Here are six self-help tips to ease hemorrhoid pain and promote healing:
        
          Step up the fiber. The most important thing is to add fiber to your diet. This is best done with foods that help hemorrhoids, but some people find they need to take a fiber supplement to get 20 to 30 grams of fiber per day. To start, try a psyllium husk fiber supplement, such as Metamucil or a generic equivalent. If psyllium causes gas or bloating, try a supplement containing wheat dextrin or methylcellulose.
          Lubricate the process. Mixing a tablespoon of mineral oil with applesauce or yogurt and eating it at breakfast or lunch allows stool to slide by the hemorrhoid more easily. But don't do this for a long period (if you try this, you may want to place a liner in your undergarments to absorb any oil leakage.)
          Don't delay. When you feel the urge, go to the bathroom immediately; don't wait for a more convenient time. Putting off bowel movements can worsen constipation, which then aggravates hemorrhoids.
          Try elevation. Elevating your feet a bit with a step stool as you sit on the toilet changes the position of the rectum in a way that may allow for easier passage of stools.
          Off-the-shelf remedies. Over-the-counter products are available for hemorrhoids. These include witch hazel infused pads and soothing creams, like Preparation H and its generic equivalents. If these don't work, ask your doctor about prescription preparations.
          Sit in a sitz. Don't overlook the relief offered by sitz baths. Using a basin that fits under the toilet seat, soak the inflamed area in warm water for 10 to 15 minutes, two to three times a day.
        
         
        If hemorrhoids persist no matter what steps you take to make them go away, or they begin to bleed, interfere with bowel movements, or make life difficult, ask your doctor about medical procedures to remove or reduce hemorrhoids.",Daniel Pendick,"September 12, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/leaky-gut-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-you-2017092212451,"Leaky gut: What is it, and what does it mean for you?","Before the medical community had better understanding of the mechanisms that cause disease, doctors believed certain ailments could originate from imbalances in the stomach. This was called hypochondriasis. (In Ancient Greek, hypochondrium refers to the upper part of the abdomen, the region between the breastbone and the navel.) This concept was rejected as science evolved and, for example, we could look under a microscope and see bacteria, parasites, and viruses. The meaning of the term changed, and for many years doctors used the word ""hypochondriac"" to describe a person who has a persistent, often inexplicable fear of having a serious medical illness.
        But what if this ancient concept of illnesses originating in the gut actually holds some truth? Could some of the chronic diseases our society faces today actually be associated with a dysfunctional gastrointestinal system?
        What exactly is leaky gut?
        Inside our bellies, we have an extensive intestinal lining covering more than 4,000 square feet of surface area. When working properly, it forms a tight barrier that controls what gets absorbed into the bloodstream. An unhealthy gut lining may have large cracks or holes, allowing partially digested food, toxins, and bugs to penetrate the tissues beneath it. This may trigger inflammation and changes in the gut flora (normal bacteria) that could lead to problems within the digestive tract and beyond. The research world is booming today with studies showing that modifications in the intestinal bacteria and inflammation may play a role in the development of several common chronic diseases.
        Who gets a leaky gut (and why)?
        We all have some degree of leaky gut, as this barrier is not completely impenetrable (and isn't supposed to be!). Some of us may have a genetic predisposition and may be more sensitive to changes in the digestive system, but our DNA is not the only one to blame. Modern life may actually be the main driver of gut inflammation. There is emerging evidence that the standard American diet, which is low in fiber and high in sugar and saturated fats, may initiate this process. Heavy alcohol use and stress also seem to disrupt this balance.
        We already know that increased intestinal permeability plays a role in certain gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. The biggest question is whether or not a leaky gut may cause problems elsewhere in the body. Some studies show that leaky gut may be associated with other autoimmune diseases (lupus, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis), chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, arthritis, allergies, asthma, acne, obesity, and even mental illness. However, we do not yet have clinical studies in humans showing such a cause and effect.
        A path toward a healthier gut
        Although it is unusual to hear the term ""increased intestinal permeability"" in most doctors' offices, alternative and integrative medicine practitioners have worked on gut healing as an initial step to treat chronic diseases for decades. Other cultures around the world often recommend specific diets to make people feel better. Even in the United States, it is common to see people changing their diets after getting sick. A common initial step some practitioners take is to remove foods that can be inflammatory and could promote changes in the gut flora. Among the most common are alcohol, processed foods, certain medications, and any foods that may cause allergies or sensitivities.
        Controversy still exists on whether leaky gut causes the development of diseases outside the gastrointestinal tract in humans. However, it is always a good idea to eat a nutritious, unprocessed diet that includes foods that help quell inflammation (and avoids foods known to trigger inflammation), which may, at least in theory, help to rebuild the gut lining and bring more balance to the gut flora. This recipe could make you feel better, without any side effects. It is definitely worth a try.","Marcelo Campos, MD","September 12, 2023"

It's called the diaphragm, and it helps us breathe: when it moves downward, it causes the lungs to pull in air through the nose and mouth. And when it moves upward, it forces air out of our lungs. The movement of the diaphragm is directed by the brain, which sends signals down nerves that end in the diaphragm. A hiccup occurs when the brain sends a signal for the diaphragm to shift forcefully downward, suddenly pulling a lot of air into the back of the throat.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/weak-kidneys-pay-attention-but-dont-worry-excessively,Weak kidneys? Pay attention but don't worry excessively,"You often hear older people say I have weak kidneys. That doesn't mean they can't do their job or are destined to fail. But it does indicate you have some form of chronic kidney disease. The kidneys — the body's blood-filtering urine factory — have less capacity to filter toxins from the blood and excrete them in the urine.
        How the kidneys work
        Every day, a healthy kidney filters a total of about 200 quarts of blood, removing waste products, excess water, and certain chemicals. If the kidneys didn't keep things in balance, you would slowly poison yourself.
        The kidneys have a remarkable ability to keep working despite changing conditions, like drops in blood pressure. The tiny filtering tubes in the kidney, called glomeruli, adapt in various ways.
        In a serious health crisis, the kidneys may shut down completely as a defensive move to keep fluids in the body. That's called an acute kidney injury, and it happens frequently to people who are hospitalized.
        What causes low kidney function?
        Half of U.S. adults over 75 may have below-normal kidney function. Most of them will never get sick from it.
        Several conditions or factors can injure the kidneys, leading to lower kidney function and possible chronic kidney disease. These include:
        
          diabetes
          smoking
          excessive alcohol consumption
          uncontrolled hypertension
          high cholesterol
          in addition, some medications can injure the kidneys.
        
        If you are leading a heart-healthy lifestyle (regular exercise and a nutritious plant-based diet), that will help protect your kidneys.
        How low is low?
        A healthy kidney filters wastes from the blood at a rate of 90 milliliters (ml) per minute or more. This is known as the glomerular filtration rate, or GFR. With time, many men's kidneys start to slip, but function must decline quite a lot before you start to really feel the impact. You feel fine up to the point that kidney function is almost gone, which means you can lead a normal life with reduced kidney function.
        On the other hand, lack of early warning from symptoms can deny you the chance to slow the slide. Most people don't start feeling really ill until kidney function is under 10%.
        How is kidney function tested?
        As part of standard blood tests, your doctor can check the creatinine level to assess kidney function. Creatinine is released from muscle cells into the bloodstream.
        Creatinine is one of the things that the kidneys filter from the blood. If the kidneys start to lose some function, blood creatinine level rises. The creatinine level is used to calculate an estimate of the GFR and provide an estimate of your kidney function.
        Most people who have a minor reduction in kidney function can take steps to not keep the kidneys from getting worse. If the function is somewhat low but stable, you may need to see your doctor only once per year. If the GFR is declining or it is already under 50, it's best to see a kidney doctor.
        How high blood pressure damages the kidneys
        High blood pressure can cause tiny cracks in the lining of arteries, which provide a breeding ground for fatty deposits that hamper blood flow. As the arteries that feed blood to the kidneys narrow, the body produces renin, a hormone that makes small arteries narrow further. This worsens high blood pressure, causing even more kidney damage. Over time, restricted blood flow can damage or destroy the nephrons, the tiny filtering units inside your kidneys.
        How to protect your kidneys and improve kidney function
        If kidney function begins to decline, you can take the following steps.
        Keep your blood pressure and blood sugar within norms
        This will help slow the decline in kidney function. In particular, keep blood pressure below 130/80.
        Lower your cholesterol
        Taking a statin medication to lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol may help to protect the kidneys. Also, individuals with reduced kidney function are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease, so reducing cardiac risk factors is important.
        Consider medication
        Certain prescription medications can protect the kidneys. The ones that physicians often use for this purpose are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), and SGLT2 inhibitors. These drugs lower pressure in the kidney filters and limit further damage.
        Eat a plant-based diet; limit protein intake
        Plant-based proteins rather than animal-based proteins may put less strain on weak kidneys.
        Use NSAIDs with caution
        Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, interfere with kidney function. Taking them when you are also depleted of fluids can lead to kidney shutdown and possibly hospitalization. For pain relief, acetaminophen (no more than 3,000 milligrams per day) is safer. If you must take an NSAID, be sure to drink plenty of water.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/prostate-cancer-a-new-type-of-radiation-treatment-limits-risk-of-side-effects-202309062969,Prostate cancer: A new type of radiation treatment limits risk of side effects,"When it comes to limiting side effects from radiation therapy, the name of the game is precision. Doctors want to treat the cancer while avoiding healthy tissues, and fortunately technological advances are making that increasingly possible.
        One newer technique called stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can focus precisely targeted beams of high-dose radiation on a tumor from almost any direction.
        The entire course of therapy requires only five individual treatments over two weeks, making SBRT more convenient than earlier low-dose methods that require more visits to the clinic. The treatment relies on specialized types of medical imaging scans that allow doctors to visualize where cancer exists in the body.
        Advances in technology
        Recently, doctors have begun to integrate SBRT with imaging scans that can visualize a tumor's movements in real time. Simple acts such as breathing, swallowing, or digesting food can shift a tumor's position. But this new technique — which is called magnetic resonance–guided daily adaptive SBRT, or MRg-A-SBRT for short — continually adjusts for those motions, so that doctors can focus more precisely on their targets.
        Now, a new study helps to confirm that MRg-A-SBRT has fewer side effects than a related method called CT-SBRT, which uses computed tomography for imaging.
        According to the study's lead author, Dr. Jonathan Leeman, a radiation oncologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MRg-A-SBRT offers several advantages over CT-SBRT: one is that doctors using it can adjust treatment plans to account for a tumor's daily motions (this is called adaptive planning). The technology collects multiple MRI images per second during a radiation procedure, thus ensuring accurate real-time targeting. And finally, MRI visualizes the prostate with better resolution.
        Analysis of studies
        During the new study, Dr. Leeman and his colleagues searched the medical literature for every published clinical trial so far evaluating SBRT for prostate cancer, either with MRI or CT guidance. (This type of study is called a systematic review.)
        The team ultimately identified 29 clinical trials that monitored outcomes for a total of over 2,500 patients. Short-term data on side effects was collected for up to three months on average after the procedures were completed.
        Leeman's team used statistical methods to pool results from the studies into combined datasets. They found that the MR-SBRT-treated patients had fewer side effects. Specifically, 5% to 33% of men treated with MR-SBRT had genitourinary side effects, compared to between 9% and 47% of men who had the CT-guided treatments. Similarly, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects in the MR-SBRT-treated men ranged from 0% to 8%, compared to between 2% and 23% among men whose treatments were guided by CT.
        Conclusions and comments
        The authors concluded that ""technical advances in precision radiotherapy delivery afforded by MRg-A-SBRT translate to measurable clinical benefit"" (i.e., better tolerated treatments). But precisely why the treatments were better tolerated remains unclear. Is it because MR-scanning has better resolution? Did adaptive planning (and real-time targeting) account for the lower risk of side effects, or can that be attributed to some combination of all these factors? Dr. Leeman says that adaptive planning is ""likely the main differentiator,"" but he adds that further studies are needed to confirm where the benefits come from.
        To place this important work in perspective, we reached out to the authors of the new paper, as well as Dr. Anthony Zietman and Dr. Nima Aghdam, two Harvard-affiliated radiation oncologists who are also on the editorial board of the Harvard Medical School Annual Report on Prostate Diseases. All these experts feel this new technology has very promising potential.
        But both groups cautioned that as with all newly developed innovations, results from additional studies — including clinical trials that are currentlyongoing — will be needed before more widespread uptake of the technology is warranted. Dr. Marc B. Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, says he ""agrees with this conservative, yet optimistic assessment.""",Charlie Schmidt,"September 6, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/harvard-health-ad-watch-why-are-toilets-everywhere-in-this-drug-ad-202308162965,Harvard Health Ad Watch: Why are toilets everywhere in this drug ad?,"If the first goal of a drug advertisement is to grab your attention, this ad for Entyvio (vedolizumab) works.
        You see a young woman getting into her car, sitting in her work cubicle, sitting in a restaurant, and finally in the waiting room of her doctor's office. But she's not sitting on the seat of the car or on a chair; in every scene, she's sitting on the lid of a toilet.
        Strange, right?
        Why all the toilets?
        The voiceover provides a clue: ""When you live with moderate or severe Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, your day can be full of reminders of your condition. Never knowing, always wondering."" And there's another hint: the woman keeps grimacing and clutching her belly.
        But these clues may not be enough. What's never explained in this ad is that abdominal pain and sudden diarrhea are among the most common symptoms of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, conditions known collectively as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The ""never knowing, always wondering"" refers to the way people with these conditions often have unpredictable bouts of diarrhea and an urgent need to get to a restroom. And that's why there are toilets everywhere.
        What does this ad get right?
        The ad provides useful information about:
        
          How this treatment works. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two forms of IBD that cause inflammation of the intestinal tract. Given as an infusion every two months, vedolizumab works by blocking cells involved in that inflammation. The ad uses visually appealing animations and graphics to get these points across.
          Side effects. The FDA requires every drug ad to describe common and potentially serious side effects. For vedolizumab, possible side effects include infusion reactions, allergic reactions, liver problems, and an increased susceptibility to infection. The ad highlights an infection called PML, noting that it's ""a rare, serious, potentially fatal brain infection.""
          Benefits. The voiceover states that ""in clinical trials, Entyvio helped many people achieve long-term relief and remission.""
        
        What else do you need to know?
        As with most drug ads, this ad doesn't provide all the information that's important to know about this medication, especially if you're a person with IBD for whom this drug might be helpful.
        For starters, the ad never explains that diarrhea and abdominal pain are among the most common symptoms of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And while the ad focuses on frequent diarrhea, it never mentions more serious complications, such as
        
          bleeding, fistulas (abnormal connections between the intestines and other parts of the body), perforation of the bowel, and bowel blockage 
          an increased risk of colorectal cancer
          inflammation in other parts of the body, including joints and eyes.
        
        The ad also omits:
        
          Explaining how moderate to severe Crohn's and ulcerative colitis is defined. Generally, it would include people with either condition who have large areas of intestinal inflammation, deep ulcers in the walls of the intestines, or who have had surgery; and those who haven't responded to other standard treatments.
          Other ways to treat Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Steroids, azathioprine, infliximab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, and other drugs are also options to treat these disorders. 
          The high cost of this drug (up to $52,000/year). For some, health insurance may cover much of this cost, and a discount program is mentioned at the end of the ad (though eligibility details are not provided). Still, for many people with IBD, the cost of expensive drugs like Entyvio is a major barrier to receiving optimal care.
        
        Also troubling is the way the ad skims over two important points:
        
          Little information is provided about PML. The ad doesn't even say what the letters stand for: progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. PML is a virus that can infect the brain, often causing death or severe neurologic disease.
          What benefits does the drug deliver? Only one sentence speaks confidently about benefits, and no details are provided. How often people do taking this drug have at least some relief from their symptoms? How often do they experience remission of symptoms? And how long do these improvements last?
        
        The bottom line
        The ad ends with the young woman driving home after her doctor's visit. She's sitting on a regular seat for the first time. She glances at the rearview mirror and smiles at the toilet that's been relegated to the back of the car. The message is clear: she's better now and doesn't have to worry about having to rush to the toilet since her doctor prescribed vedolizumab.
        Of course, it doesn't always work out this way in real life. Then again, drug ads aren't intended to show real life. They're intended to promote a product. That's a good reason to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism about drug ads, and to rely instead on your doctor and other unbiased sources for your health information, such as the National Institutes of Health websites.","Robert H.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/should-i-worry-about-the-side-effects-of-proton-pump-inhibitors,Should I worry about the side effects of proton-pump inhibitors?,"Q.
          I have had intermittent heartburn for years. My doctor ordered an upper endoscopy to look at my esophagus and stomach. My esophagus is inflamed due to acid reflux. I was told to stay on prescription-strength pantoprazole indefinitely. But I worry about side effects. If I eat less acidic foods and don't experience heartburn, is it necessary to take this drug to keep my esophagus healthy?
        
        A. Pantoprazole (Protonix) is a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). Drugs in this class are the most potent acid inhibitors. Examples of other PPIs include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), and rabeprazole (AcipHex). Most are available in low doses and less expensive generic formulations over the counter. Doctors can prescribe higher doses if needed.
        There is no simple yes-or-no answer to your question, but here is how I approach this common situation. First, I would ask these questions: Did you have the endoscopy because the heartburn was more frequent or severe? Were you taking any acid blockers before the endoscopy, and if yes, at what dose and for how long?
        These questions are to understand the severity of your esophageal inflammation (esophagitis). If your reflux was severe, or if you had been on treatment for a few weeks before the endoscopy and still had visible esophagitis, your doctor's recommendation sounds correct. Treating esophagitis with a high-dose PPI is not just about controlling symptoms. Persistent severe esophagus inflammation from acid reflux can lead to scarring and narrowing of the lower esophagus. It also increases your risk of developing a condition called Barrett's esophagus, which can lead to cancer.
        Most people who take PPIs have minimal, short-term side effects. PPI use is associated with a slightly increased risk of infections. It's possible to develop lower blood levels of vitamin B12 or magnesium. Studies looking at other long-term concerns regarding bone thinning, dementia, and kidney disease have provided some reassurance that PPIs are not the cause.
        Many people with acid reflux and esophagitis can use less potent anti-acid therapy. Your doctor may advise a repeat upper endoscopy before making any changes, or you might begin to taper down first.
        If you and your doctor decide it's the right time to transition, you will want to do it gradually. Never stop the acid blocker abruptly, as this could lead to rebound heartburn, since your body is used to the medication.
        It's also important to maintain lifestyle changes to reduce acid reflux, including losing weight if needed, not lying down after eating, and avoiding foods that typically cause heartburn.

        The study included more than 59,000 people who wore activity trackers on their wrists for a week. All were part of the UK Biobank, a large database of genetic, lifestyle, and health information from more than a half-million people in the United Kingdom.
        After a median follow-up of nearly seven years, researchers found that people who did more than an hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily had a 74% lower risk of developing diabetes compared with people who did less than five minutes of physical activity per day.
        That finding was true even among people at high genetic risk for diabetes, who are 2.4 times as likely to get diabetes than people at low genetic risk. The study was published online June 5, 2023, by the British Journal of Sports Medicine.

Each of the studies randomly assigned people to two groups. Half were shown their scan results; the others were either not shown their results or were not scanned. The study follow-ups lasted one to four years.
        Researchers found greater improvements among people who saw images of their plaque buildup.

        For the study, researchers pooled results from 30 trials (including a total of nearly 2,400 people) published over the past four decades. All participants were randomly assigned to follow either a vegetarian diet (which included dairy and eggs but no meat), a vegan diet (which omitted all animal products), or an omnivorous diet (which included meat and dairy products). The average duration of the diets was 29 weeks. Compared with people eating an omnivorous diet, those following a vegetarian or vegan diet experienced average drops in levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B of 7%, 10% and 14%, respectively, from levels measured at the start of the study. (Apolipoprotein B is a particle found on LDL as well as other artery-clogging lipoproteins in the blood.)

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/autoimmune-diseases-pose-a-threat-to-the-heart,Autoimmune diseases pose a threat to the heart,"Your immune system, a network of specialized cells and organs, defends your body against viruses, bacteria, and other invaders. But sometimes, for reasons that remain largely mysterious, immune cells launch an inappropriate attack against the body's own tissues. The resulting outpouring of white blood cells and other substances cause inflammation, triggering the pain, redness, and swelling that characterizes many autoimmune diseases (see ""Autoimmune diseases: From common to rare"").
        But inflammation also damages the linings of blood vessels, encouraging the buildup of fatty plaque that can narrow arteries (atherosclerosis), boost blood pressure, and raise the risk for a heart attack or stroke. This connection likely explains why people with autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, have higher rates of heart disease. Until recently, however, the scope and severity of this problem has been unclear.
        
          
            
              
                Autoimmune diseases: From common to rare
                In the United States, up to 8% of people have an autoimmune disease, which occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy organs or tissues. For unknown reasons, women are twice as likely as men to develop these conditions. Out of the more than 100 known autoimmune diseases, the three described below are among the most common and best studied. But the majority are rare and therefore less well understood.
                Psoriasis. The inflammation in psoriasis affects the skin, causing a pink or dull-red, scaly skin rash that occurs in patches, usually on the back of the elbow, in skin folds, and on the scalp. About one in three people with psoriasis also has psoriatic arthritis, which causes joint inflammation (especially in the fingers, toes, or knees) and morning stiffness.
                Rheumatoid arthritis. The immune system attack targets tissue lining the joints, creating inflammation marked by swelling, pain, and stiffness. It typically strikes multiple joints at once, especially in the hands and feet. Other symptoms include fatigue and lingering morning stiffness.
                Lupus. The inflammatory process in lupus can affect almost any organ in the body, triggering a wide array of symptoms. Common early symptoms include fever and joint pain similar to rheumatoid arthritis. One distinct symptom is a a ""butterfly rash"" across the bridge of the nose and cheeks. Damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, and blood vessels can also occur.
              
            
          
        
        A heightened risk
        But in 2022, the Lancet published a study that looked at cardiovascular disease rates in combination with 19 of the most common autoimmune diseases. Depending on the specific condition, people with these diseases were up to three times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people without an autoimmune disease.
        ""My patients have said to me, 'I had no idea that my autoimmune disease could affect my heart,'"" says Dr. Brittany Weber, a cardio-rheumatology specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Many of the people she treats have rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or lupus — three common conditions linked to cardiovascular problems.
        Awareness of this elevated risk is especially important because autoimmune disease typically strikes when people are in their 20s or 30s. In turn, heart problems may develop up to a decade earlier than in people without an autoimmune disease. A calcium scan, which detects early signs of atherosclerosis, can help assess a person's risk and guide treatment advice, says Dr. Weber. Sometimes, people blame rheumatoid arthritis for symptoms (for example, shortness of breath when climbing stairs) that are actually caused by heart disease, she adds.
        Treatment advice
        In addition to prescribing statins and other medications that lower heart attack risk, cardio-rheumatologists also work with rheumatologists to manage the appropriate use of disease-modifying biologic drugs, some of which carry a higher risk of cardiovascular side effects than others.
        The same diets recommended for preventing heart disease are also beneficial for people with autoimmune diseases. Maintaining a healthy weight helps, too. Exercise is often particularly challenging for people with autoimmune diseases, especially those with severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis, who may have limited mobility. ""Many of my patients like swimming, which is easy on the joints,"" says Dr. Weber. Others find yoga to be helpful, especially because of the added stress relief and relaxation yoga provides. Using an elliptical machine is another exercise that can raise the heart rate without putting too much pressure on the joints.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/heart-attacks-may-speed-cognitive-decline,Heart attacks may speed cognitive decline,"Just as our bodies become less nimble with age, so do our brains. Being more forgetful or taking longer to recall names or events is a normal part of growing older. But sometimes, these cognitive changes occur faster than usual. Now, new research has found that such accelerated cognitive decline may be more common after a heart attack (see ""Cognitive changes after a heart attack"").
        Cognition — the ability to reason and remember — can be assessed in many different ways. The new study considered global (that is, overall) cognition, which encompasses such areas as learning, processing speed, and executive function (the ability to carry out mental tasks such as planning ahead or remembering instructions). Immediately after a heart attack, survivors experienced no apparent cognitive changes. But they showed a faster, persistent drop in global cognition over the following years compared with people who didn't have heart attacks. The decline was equal to about six to 13 years of normal cognitive aging, according to the study authors.
        
          
            
              
                Cognitive changes after a heart attack
                To better understand the causes of cognitive problems — and potential prevention strategies — researchers looked at data from six large studies done in the United States over the past five decades. Their findings, in the July 2023 issue of JAMA Neurology, are summarized below.
                Who: 30,465 adults with no history of heart attack, stroke, or dementia. Just over half (56%) were women; 29% were Black, and 8% were Hispanic.
                When: The studies ran from 1971 to 2019.
                What: During follow-up periods that ranged from about five to 20 years,1,033 people had a heart attack. (Among that group, 137 had two heart attacks.) All participants had at least one cognitive assessment, and those who had a heart attack had at least one assessment both before and after the event.
                Key findings: Cognitive changes were not apparent immediately after a heart attack. But in the following years, heart attack survivors experienced a faster-than-normal decline in cognitive ability.
              
            
          
        
        Heart-brain links
        What might explain these findings? Heart attacks may lead to changes that directly affect blood flow to the brain or that trigger atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder known to increase the risk of major strokes. Such strokes, in turn, can cause severe cognitive problems that interfere with function (dementia). People who experience heart attacks also have higher rates of depression, another condition tied to dementia.
        However, the same factors that lead to narrowed heart arteries — the root cause of most heart attacks — can also lead to cerebral small vessel disease. Also known as microvascular ischemic disease, this condition results from high cholesterol and the relentless pounding of high blood pressure inside the brain's small arteries. Over time, the linings of these vessels thicken, choking off blood flow and causing tiny ""silent"" strokes.
        ""A single microscopic stroke isn't visible on a brain scan. But if dozens or hundreds accumulate, they show up as bright areas on an MRI scan,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, chief of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology at the VA Boston Healthcare System and a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. The bright spots are known as white matter lesions (white matter consists of bundles of nerve fibers that connect brain cells).
        In recent decades, doctors have come to realize that cerebral small vessel disease is to blame for the vast majority of cases of vascular dementia — that is, the type of dementia caused by blood vessel problems, as opposed to Alzheimer's disease. Previously, vascular dementia was thought to result mainly from strokes in large vessels, most of which occur when a clot blocks a brain artery, Dr. Budson explains.
        Brain aging: Normal vs. fast
        In fact, most older people's brain scans show some evidence of white matter lesions; they're recognized as markers of the typical cognitive changes that occur with age. But people who have heart attacks likely have more (and perhaps some as yet unrecognized) risk factors for tiny strokes. As a result, they likely have more white matter lesions and experience even greater cognitive decline. ""As a neurologist who looks at brain scans all the time, I believe this is the most likely explanation,"" says Dr. Budson.
        For preventing heart attacks, the evidence for following a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and maintaining a normal weight is already very strong. Consider the extra protection for your brain health as an added bonus.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/after-the-baby-grows-up-how-will-your-heart-fare,"After the baby grows up, how will your heart fare?","Pregnancy is seldom a walk in the park. But if yours was marked by complications such as high blood pressure or diabetes, you probably hoped those hurdles were behind you after your baby was born.
        Hope isn't a strategy, however, when it comes to protecting your health. And it's becoming increasingly evident that certain pregnancy and reproductive factors raise red flags about your cardiovascular health years or decades down the line. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine equates pregnancy to a ""cardiovascular stress test,"" noting that certain complications point toward higher risks for heart attack or stroke later in life.
        ""We now understand that pregnancy is a window into a woman's future health,"" says Dr. Brett Young, an OB/GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        For example, women who had high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia (a condition marked by high blood pressure that can impair function of the heart, kidneys, and other organs) while pregnant later develop chronic high blood pressure at least twice as often as women whose blood pressure remained normal in pregnancy. Women who had these blood pressure problems also have 70% higher rates of diabetes and 30% higher rates of elevated cholesterol later in life, according to a Harvard-led 2018 study in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
        Diabetes or blood pressure complications, estimated to affect 5% to 10% of pregnancies, are on the rise as obesity rates climb and more women decide to have babies later in life.
        ""While they often resolve soon after, those conditions can translate into long-lasting increased risks for heart disease for these women,"" says Dr. Nicolas-Sonny Nguyen, a Boston-area family medicine doctor and clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School. ""Once you've finished having children, years or decades may go by where these health issues may not come up.""
        Common disease features
        New research magnifies these revelations. Pregnancy and childbirth complications can pose deadly implications as long as 50 years later, according to a study published online March 8, 2023, by Circulation.
        The analysis, which used long-term data from more than 46,000 women who gave birth between 1959 and 1966, tracked participants' deaths from any cause until 2016. Pregnancy-related high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, and preterm delivery were all linked to a greater risk of death in the decades following childbirth.
        Meanwhile, problems such as infertility, miscarriage, and stillbirth may be associated with greater stroke risks later in life, according to an analysis published online June 22, 2022, by The BMJ. Researchers reviewed data on nearly 619,000 women ages 32 through 73 from seven countries. Infertility was associated with a 15% higher risk of stroke, while repeated miscarriages were linked to a 37% higher risk. Women who'd had recurrent stillbirths were 44% more likely to die of a hemorrhagic stroke, characterized by uncontrolled bleeding in the brain.
        What's the link? Pregnancy and reproductive difficulties can share common features with cardiovascular disease, including blood vessel problems and fat deposits in blood vessel walls, Dr. Young says.
        ""Pre-eclampsia is a systemwide condition that affects many organs,"" she says. ""We think of it as a disease of the placenta, but the consensus is that it's actually a blood vessel disease that also affects the kidneys, heart, and brain.""
        Similarly, diabetes during pregnancy may signal simmering problems with a woman's insulin production or how efficiently her cells use energy. ""Even if you had gestational diabetes for only a few months of your life in a span of five, six, or more decades, those few months may have made a difference in your risks,"" Dr. Nguyen says.
        The need for check-ups
        The mounting research drives home the importance of preventive care and screenings for women who had complicated pregnancies and deliveries — especially at midlife and beyond, when heart disease risks already increase.
        ""The risks become less silent when women who had these pregnancy conditions reach menopause or beyond,"" Dr. Nguyen says.
        But even younger women — including those whose pregnancies weren't marked by complications — shouldn't skip regular primary care visits. A 2022 study in the journal Hypertension suggests that limited medical follow-up in the year after childbirth may miss high blood pressure in one of 10 new mothers whose blood pressure wasn't elevated during pregnancy.
        If you've dealt with pregnancy or reproductive difficulties, tell your primary clinician and your other doctors. Your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels should be monitored regularly, and any irregularities should be ""treated aggressively,"" Dr. Young says.
        ""Even if a woman had problems during only one of her pregnancies many years ago, that history is very important. It should be part of a conversation for the rest of her life,"" Dr. Nguyen says.
        Also don't ignore even mild symptoms that might be heart disease trouble signs, such as chest pain, unusual fatigue, neck or jaw pain, or shortness of breath.
        ""Talking about symptoms that pop up is important because early recognition is key,"" Dr. Nguyen says. ""Create a platform to have these conversations with your clinicians instead of waiting years, when coronary artery disease has perhaps been brewing for a while.""
        
          
            
              
                High blood pressure during pregnancy also endangers the brain
                Cardiovascular health isn't the only thing that might suffer in the aftermath of pregnancy-related high blood pressure. A new analysis suggests this complication is linked with later cognitive problems as well.
                The study, published online May 9, 2023, by Neurology, involved more than 2,200 women (average age 73), 83% of whom had at least one pregnancy. Every 15 months over an average of five years, participants took nine tests of memory and thinking that evaluated aspects such as processing speed, executive function, language, and overall cognition.
                After assessing the women's medical records for pregnancy-related data, researchers found that those who'd had high blood pressure during pregnancy experienced a greater decline in many aspects of thinking skills compared with women who maintained normal blood pressure while pregnant. The effects were even more pronounced among women who'd had pre-eclampsia, a more severe pregnancy-related blood pressure disorder.
                The findings aren't surprising, given that blood vessel problems that may contribute to pregnancy complications can also affect vessels that carry blood to the brain, says Dr. Brett Young, an OB/GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The results also suggest monitoring and managing blood pressure during and after pregnancy could pay important dividends for brain health later in life.
                The findings are consistent with the understanding that pregnancy can illuminate a woman's future health risks, including many conditions that affect the blood vessels, Dr. Young says. ""The brain,"" she says, ""requires healthy blood vessels just like the placenta does — it's a system based on blood vessels.""
              
            
          
        
        Big-picture risks
        Pregnancy complications, of course, are far from the only factor that influences a woman's future pregnancy risk. Also important are family history, race, diet, weight, and physical activity levels.
        ""It's important to know that heart disease affects one in five women, regardless of age,"" Dr. Nguyen says. ""Some women may think, 'I'm 35 and had my kids, I'm healthy, and there's no way for me to get heart disease.' But that's not true. I emphasize this to encourage women to optimize their lifestyle.""
        ""When you see your health care providers, be honest and thorough about your medical history, especially relating to your pregnancies,"" says Dr. Nguyen.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-apple-cider-vinegar-curb-appetite,Can apple cider vinegar curb appetite?,"Q.
          My friend says she drinks apple cider vinegar at bedtime to help her eat less and lose weight. Could it work?
        
        A. Scientific evidence doesn't support drinking apple cider vinegar to dampen appetite or help with weight loss. But even on a commonsense level, it's not likely. Here's why: changing only a single part of our routine — such as drinking a shot of apple cider vinegar each evening — can't help us shed excess pounds as effectively as broader efforts that include changing our overall diet and exercising more often.
        Beyond that, apple cider vinegar's high acidity level makes bedtime a less-than-ideal time to drink it. Anyone prone to heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should avoid eating or drinking anything acidic at least 30 to 60 minutes before sleep to lessen the odds of uncomfortable burning in the chest. Over time, drinking undiluted vinegar can also erode your tooth enamel.
        People who still want to consume apple cider vinegar can do it more safely and comfortably if they mix a small amount into a large glass of water or combine it with other ingredients in salad dressings.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/eating-junk-food-may-affect-deep-sleep,Eating junk food may affect deep sleep,"Want better-quality sleep? Cut back on junk food. Researchers found that eating an unhealthy diet high in processed food can affect people's deep sleep (also known as slow-wave sleep). During this sleep stage, the pituitary gland in the brain releases a burst of growth hormone, which helps build and repair muscles, bones, and other tissues. Deep sleep also boosts cognitive function and memory.
        The study, published online May 28, 2023, by Obesity, looked at 15 healthy men with normal sleep habits (sleeping an average of seven to nine hours per night). The participants ate either a healthy or unhealthy diet for one week. The two diets contained the same number of calories, adjusted to each individual's daily requirements. However, the unhealthy diet had a higher content of sugar and saturated fat and included many processed foods.
        After a week on the diet, the participants spent two nights at a sleep laboratory where their slow-wave brain activity was measured. They first slept a regular night that matched their usual sleep schedule. The next night they were kept awake past their regular bedtime and then allowed to catch up on their sleep to mimic disrupted sleep. After several weeks, the study was repeated, with everyone switching to the other diet and revisiting the sleep lab.
        The researchers found that when participants followed the unhealthier diet they had poorer-quality deep sleep (indicated by a decrease in slow-wave activity). This was true for both normal and disrupted sleep. They noted that it is difficult to draw conclusions from only one week of poor eating. Still, the findings suggest there may be important ways diet can influence sleep quality.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/rethinking-psa-testing,Rethinking PSA testing,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing has a complex role in prostate cancer diagnosis. On the one hand, it can help identify early prostate cancer. On the other, routine PSA screening can lead men to have biopsies or invasive treatments they may not need.
        This has caused the medical community to re-evaluate how best to use the PSA test.
        ""While men in their 40s should begin a dialogue with their doctor about the pros and cons of PSA screening through middle age, work is ongoing to achieve the ultimate goal: developing a screening regimen that identifies only the prostate cancers that need to be cured,"" says Dr. Mark Pomerantz, an oncologist with Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""And there is a way for PSA testing to help achieve this.""
        The ABCs of PSA
        PSA is a chemical made by the prostate. A PSA test measures the amount in a man's blood. A PSA level of less than 4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) is considered normal.
        ""Though there is no level below 4 that guarantees freedom from prostate cancer, a level higher than 4 is the conventional threshold for considering a biopsy to look for cancer,"" says Dr. Pomerantz.
        The PSA test initially was developed for use in men already diagnosed with prostate cancer and undergoing treatment, and it's highly reliable in this regard. PSA levels can reveal whether cancer has returned after surgery or whether the tumors have grown or shrunk after treatment with hormones or radiation.
        But decades ago, research showed that in men not known to have prostate cancer, PSA levels higher than 10 ng/mL often indicated the presence of the disease. Soon after, it became the go-to prostate cancer screening test. However, PSA screening is far from perfect, especially when a man's level is between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL.
        These somewhat higher PSA levels frequently happen for reasons other than cancer, such as a benign enlarged prostate, an inflamed prostate (prostatitis), bike riding, or recent ejaculation. A man with this screening result often ends up proceeding with a biopsy — an invasive procedure with its own potential complications — just in case cancer is present.
        And even when a biopsy confirms that cancer is the source of a rising PSA level, many men end up undergoing treatment for low-risk, slow-growing cancer that might never affect their longevity or quality of life.
        ""Treatments like surgery and radiation, beyond the stress and invasiveness associated with the procedures, also involve possible side effects like incontinence and erectile dysfunction,"" says Dr. Pomerantz.
        In addition, research has produced mixed results on whether regular PSA screening helps men in the long run. ""Even after 30-plus years of using the PSA test for screening, it still isn't clear how well it prevents prostate cancer deaths,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. ""And the reality is that even among men with prostate cancer, most will die from something else.""
        The main problem with using PSA tests to find prostate cancer? Most older men already have some traces of the cancer.
        ""You could take 100 random middle age or older men off the street, examine their prostates, and more than half would probably have some low-risk cancer, even though they may be healthy and unaffected by it for life,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. ""If you go snooping around for prostate cancer, you will find it.""
        Better ways to use testing
        So the question has become this: what role does PSA testing now play in prostate cancer screening?
        ""The result of a PSA test no longer needs to be the final word in who does or doesn't get a biopsy,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. ""Men now have other ways to check for cancer that can minimize the need for invasive biopsy.""
        For example, if a PSA test suggests possible cancer, doctors now can order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate. The technology produces a high-resolution image of the entire prostate gland. Cancerous tissue has different magnetic properties than normal tissue, and an MRI scan can capture these differences.
        If MRI reveals no cancer, your doctor may recommend you continue to monitor your prostate with PSA testing. If the scan does show the possibility of cancer, the detailed image can help the doctor determine the tumor's size and which part of the prostate should be sampled with a biopsy.
        ""This targeted approach can help with a more accurate diagnosis and avoid the need for repeated biopsies,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. ""It brings us closer to our goal in prostate cancer screening — reliably finding the aggressive prostate cancers and avoiding overdiagnosis.""
        Another role for PSA testing
        Periodic PSA testing is regularly used during active surveillance, a wait-and-see approach to prostate cancer management in which men monitor their cancer for changes and explore treatment options only if it becomes more active.
        ""The monitoring approach of active surveillance is ideal for many men diagnosed with low-risk cancer,"" says Dr. Pomerantz.
        After an initial biopsy, active surveillance involves more frequent PSA testing to look for any changes. If your PSA level increases, your doctor may order an MRI scan to determine whether a repeat biopsy is needed.
        ""In this way, PSA tests can help men better monitor their condition and avoid jumping into treatment,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. ""It can help men feel proactive about managing their prostate cancer.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heart-attacks-strike-in-different-ways,Heart attacks strike in different ways,"Mention heart attack, and many people think of a man clutching his chest in pain. But the symptoms are often subtle, and the underlying process causing the heart attack can differ.
        ""Heart attacks are defined by damage to the heart muscle from a limitation of blood flow, but there are multiple ways this can occur,"" says Dr. Stephen Wiviott, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Regardless of the cause, this damage can result in permanent reduction of heart function or even death. This is why it's so important for people to recognize the different signs, so they know when to seek care.""
        Symptoms and causes
        Chest discomfort remains the most common heart attack symptom. But the discomfort can feel more like mild pressure, a pulled muscle, or heartburn rather than the pain that people may expect. Sometimes other symptoms predominate, such as pain in the jaw, shoulders, or arms; nausea with or without vomiting; sweating; or shortness of breath.
        People who have a heart attack often say, in retrospect, ""I just felt awful."" There are two different mechanisms by which most heart attacks happen. Both are related to insufficient blood flow to an area of the heart, most often related to fatty plaque buildup in coronary arteries.
        A type 1 heart attack occurs when a plaque ruptures and releases chemicals that trigger the formation of a blood clot. The clot blocks the artery, cutting off blood flow to part of the heart.
        A type 2 heart attack does not involve a ruptured plaque. It happens when there is a mismatch between the amount of blood a portion of heart muscle needs and the blood supply in the coronary artery feeding that area of the heart.
        The setting for this type of heart attack can be a condition that puts extras stress on the heart like the flu or pneumonia, an abnormal heart rhythm resulting in an accelerated heart rate, or a big spike in blood pressure.
        Why type matters
        Even though type 2 heart attacks may sound less ominous, they actually have a worse prognosis. Research has found that people with this type of heart attack are more likely to die over the next few years compared with those who experience a type 1 attack.
        This is not necessarily because type 2 attacks cause more heart damage, but because they typically occur in patients who are older and who have other medical problems in addition to blockages in the arteries. These features raise the risk of a second heart attack, heart failure, and stroke.
        In comparison, people with type 1 heart attack may be more likely to get proven therapies (such as immediate cardiac catheterization to open the blockage with angioplasty or a stent) and to start taking medications to prevent another heart attack (such as blood clot inhibitors and high-dose statin drugs). They are also less likely than people with type 2 attacks to have other illnesses.
        Recognize and react
        The takeaway here is that you should be aware of the signs of heart attacks so you can immediately call 911. ""Always be mindful about potential heart symptoms. Seek immediate attention if they are severe or persistent, and contact your physician if you are unsure,"" says Dr. Wiviott. ""Your body is sending you a warning, so don't ignore it.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sugary-drinks-appear-to-increase-health-risks-for-people-with-diabetes,Sugary drinks appear to increase health risks for people with diabetes,"People with type 2 diabetes have higher risks of developing cardiovascular disease or dying earlier if they drink a lot of sugary beverages, including soda, fruit punch, or lemonade, a new study suggests. But that risk is lower if they drink healthier choices.
        The Harvard-led study, published online April 19, 2023, by The BMJ, involved 9,252 women and 3,519 men who were diagnosed with diabetes at the study's start or at some point during the following 18.5 years. Every two to four years, participants reported how often they drank sugary beverages, artificially sweetened drinks, fruit juice, coffee, tea, low- or full-fat cow's milk, or water.
        Those who regularly drank sugar-sweetened drinks were more likely than other participants to have cardiovascular disease, die from it, or die for any reason during the study period. Each daily serving of a sugary drink raised the risk of dying from any cause by 8%. But all such risks decreased among participants who drank healthier beverages. These findings can help people with diabetes to better manage the condition, study authors said.

But the evidence against meat has been inconsistent, with some studies suggesting risks only from processed red meat such as hot dogs, bacon, ham, and salami. Also, men tend to eat more meat than women. So which kind of red meat affects health, and is one sex more vulnerable to it than another? To find out, researchers reviewed dozens of observational and randomized studies that tracked red meat consumption (including 43 studies looking at heart disease and 27 looking at diabetes) among more than five million men and women. The researchers found that both unprocessed and processed red meat are linked to higher risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, with no apparent difference in risk between men and women. The authors urge all adults to reduce their red meat intake as a way to protect health. The findings were published June 2, 2023, in the European Heart Journal.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heart-healthy-eating-how-does-your-diet-stack-up,Heart-healthy eating: How does your diet stack up?,"When you consider that 80% of heart disease can be prevented by healthy lifestyle habits, it makes sense to prioritize the one habit you can't live without: eating. But many people — including doctors — aren't sure which diets are best for keeping your heart healthy.
        This problem was the inspiration behind a recent scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA), published May 30, 2023, in Circulation, says Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""People hear about all sorts of popular diets in the news and on social media. But they don't have a good sense about which ones actually have scientific evidence behind them,"" he says. Neither do most doctors, as they receive very little nutrition training as part of their education. (Note that although the word ""diet"" is often associated with weight loss, it more generally refers to the kinds of foods people typically eat.)
        Evidence-based ranking
        The statement ranks 10 popular diets based on how well they align with the AHA's dietary guidelines, which recommend limiting saturated fat and excess carbohydrates, especially highly processed carbs and sugary drinks (see ""Popular diets: Common names, key features, and rankings""). The evidence comes from decades of randomized trials, population-based studies, and other research, says Dr. Hu, who served as a reviewer for the scientific statement.
        ""It's no surprise that all of the top-tier diets are mostly plant-based,"" says Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, and nuts are all naturally low in saturated fat. They're also good sources of fiber and contain a variety of antioxidants. ""What I like about the DASH and Mediterranean diets is that they include fish, which is a good source of both healthy fats and protein,"" she says. Canned fish, such as sardines, herring, and tuna, are affordable options, she adds. But these two diets (along with various iterations of vegetarian-style eating patterns) can also include a range of other healthy proteins, like beans, nuts, poultry, dairy products, and eggs.
        Another reason the top two diets get high marks is that they encourage people to limit refined grains and added sugars. ""A healthy dietary pattern should focus on whole, real foods and limit processed foods, which tend to add extra salt, sugar, and fat into your diet,"" says McManus. Over all, vegetarian and pescatarian diets tend to be quite healthy, but not if people simply avoid meat and fill up on processed foods, she adds.
        Be flexible
        Don't feel you have to abandon the familiar foods you grew up eating. ""Following cultural traditions and preferences is important for helping people stay with a diet over the long term,"" says Dr. Hu.
        McManus agrees. ""You might need to make some adjustments to how your traditional favorite foods are prepared by swapping in a healthier fat or using less sodium,"" she says. You'll be more likely to stick with healthy, lasting changes if you make small, gradual changes that are flexible, family-friendly, and realistic, she adds.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/chronic-stomach-pain-in-children-whats-the-most-common-cause-202308232964,Chronic stomach pain in children: What's the most common cause?,"The most common cause of chronic stomach pain in children isn't anything you can find on a test or cure with a medicine. And that can make it very challenging to diagnose — and treat.
        You may not have ever heard of functional abdominal pain. Yet it ranks as the most common cause of stomach pain lasting two months or more in children and teens.
        What is functional abdominal pain?
        The mind and the body are tightly connected in ways that we are still working to understand, and this is particularly true of the mind and the gastrointestinal tract. Stress — particularly chronic stress, depression, and anxiety — can lead to pain that is very real. Sometimes the pain is the only symptom of stress, especially in children who are high-achieving or tend to hide their emotions.
        Sometimes the pain doesn't start from stress but from an infection or other illness, and stays once the illness is gone or adds additional pain to the illness while it is being treated. Worry about the pain and its possible cause can make things worse. The nervous system of the gut can go into overdrive.
        What are common symptoms of functional abdominal pain?
        Children with functional abdominal pain can have mild symptoms that just show up occasionally, or they can have more severe symptoms that interfere with daily life. Along with stomachaches, they can have nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea — or some combination of all of them. They may have a poor appetite or complain of feeling full very quickly.
        When should you contact your child's doctor?
        It's important to check in with your doctor if your child is having chronic stomachaches. They should have a physical examination, and your doctor may want to do some testing, such as blood or stool tests, as there are many medical conditions that can cause chronic stomachaches.
        It's particularly important to call your doctor if your child
        
          is losing weight
          has blood in their stool
          has severe pain
          has fever, rashes, sore joints, or other signs of illness.
        
        If your doctor finds that your child's examination and tests are normal, and they aren't losing weight, chances are that your child has functional abdominal pain.
        For some families, getting this diagnosis sounds like the doctors are saying that it is all in the child's head. But nothing could be further from the truth. It is very real pain — but it is not being caused by something dangerous, which is very good news.
        How can you help a child diagnosed with functional abdominal pain?
        There are many ways to help a child who has functional abdominal pain once the diagnosis is made. They include:
        
          Understanding and managing stressors in the child's life, if there are any
          Medications recommended by your health care team can help with symptoms, such as laxatives for constipation
          Cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a kind of therapy that teaches strategies for managing pain, as well as managing any stress or sadness that can be contributing
          Meditation, yoga, and other ways for a child to relax and regulate how they react to their world
          For some children, a low-FODMAP diet can be helpful
          Probiotics, peppermint oil preparations, and some other supplements are sometimes used to help soothe and prevent pain.
        
        Most children with functional abdominal pain can receive care from their pediatrician. Regular visits are a good idea, to check in to see how things are going and adjust any treatments. If things aren't getting better, a referral to a gastroenterologist can be helpful.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/when-a-pain-in-the-neck-is-serious,When a pain in the neck is serious,"You probably don't give much thought to your neck, unless something goes wrong and you start to feel neck pain. This underappreciated body part has to be strong enough to support a heavy weight (your head) yet still allow you to tilt, turn, and nod your head easily.
        Most of the time, neck pain doesn't signal a serious medical problem. But it's worth learning about one of the rare exceptions: a tear in one of the arteries of the neck, known as a cervical artery dissection (see ""What is a cervical artery dissection?""). Although these occur in only about two in 100,000 people per year, they are one of the most common causes of stroke in people under age 50.
        Over the past two decades, awareness of cervical artery dissection has grown. This may stem in part from the recognition that stroke rates seem to be rising among younger people, despite an overall downward trend in deaths caused by stroke.
        
          
            
              
                What is a cervical artery dissection?
                
                  
                  
                  
                    Image courtesy of N. Rost, MD, Massachusetts General Hospital
                  
                
                Two pairs of blood vessels in the neck — the carotid and vertebral arteries, known collectively as the cervical arteries — carry blood to the brain.
                A tear in the lining of one of these vessels is called a cervical artery dissection.
                Blood leaks between the layers of the artery wall and forms a clot. The clot may completely block blood flow through the artery or break off and lodge in an artery in the brain. If either happens, the result is a stroke.
              
            
          
        
        More common before age 50
        Cervical artery dissections are seen more often in younger adults for two main reasons. First, a small percentage of people have underlying inherited connective tissue disorders that make their arteries more likely to tear. For these people, an artery tear is more likely to manifest at a younger age. In older people, other types of strokes (such as those associated with brain arteries narrowed by fatty plaque) are more common. But dissections can still happen in older people. A study in the journal Neurology found that one in 14 people diagnosed with a cervical artery dissection was age 60 or older.
        The second (and perhaps bigger reason) artery dissections are more common before age 50? Younger adults are more likely to engage in exercise that involves neck movements that can precipitate a tear. Dissections have also been reported after strenuous weightlifting, head-flinging dance moves, and even yoga. If not done properly, certain positions such as a shoulder stand can cause hyperextension of the neck.
        Hairdresser and chiropractor cautions
        You can also hyperextend your neck while tipping your head back to have your hair washed at a salon sink. Even though there are only a dozen or so such cases described in the medical literature, there's a name for this phenomenon: ""beauty parlor stroke syndrome."" To play it safe: Ask your hairdresser for a neck extension, which is a little cushion that props up your head so you don't feel any strain on your neck.
        Not surprisingly, whiplash sustained during a car accident can also cause a cervical artery dissection. And in rare cases, so can the quick, thrusting neck movements some chiropractors and other health care professionals use to treat neck pain, known as cervical manipulative therapy or ""adjustment."" However, it's not clear whether the neck therapy itself causes the tear, or whether the pain from an existing tear might prompt people to seek out such treatment.
        Unusual, persistent neck pain
        With a cervical artery dissection, the neck pain is unusual, persistent, and often accompanied by a severe headache. The neck pain from a carotid artery tear often spreads along the side of the neck and up toward the outer corner of the eye. A vertebral artery tear may feel like something sharp is stuck in the base of your skull. If you experience such pain — especially if you also have stroke symptoms such as dizziness, double vision, jerky eye movements, unsteadiness while walking, or slurred speech — call 911 immediately.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/8-ways-to-get-constipation-relief,8 ways to get constipation relief,"Most healthy adults have bowel movements three times a day to three times a week. Constipation refers to bowel movements that occur less often than expected or when the stool is hard, dry, and difficult to pass. Though constipation may be a common problem, it is still uncomfortable and stressful when it strikes.
        The good news is that most people with simple constipation can get relief with at-home treatments such as diet changes, hydration or judicious use of laxatives. Here are top ways to get constipation relief:
        1. Dietary fiber
        One of the first steps you can take to relieve constipation is to increase your intake of fiber through your diet. Fiber needs vary by age and sex, but generally adults should get 22 to 34 grams of fiber a day.
        There are two different types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Both types of fiber are important for health, digestion, and preventing diseases. But they act differently in the body.
        Soluble fiber absorbs the water in your food. In doing so, it turns to gel, which slows digestion. Some types of soluble fiber may help lower cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. Soluble fiber is found in the following foods:
        
          Oat bran
          Barley
          Nuts
          Seeds
          Beans
          Lentils
          Peas
          Some fruits and vegetables
        
        Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, doesn't absorb water and adds bulk to your stool. It can help food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestine, relieving constipation. Insoluble fiber can be found in foods such as:
        
          Wheat bran
          Vegetables
          Whole grains
        
        You can check the fiber content of common foods and drinks on the USDA food sources of dietary fiber page.
        Tip: Leave the skin on fruits and vegetables to increase fiber.
        2. Fiber supplements
        Because dietary fiber provides a host of health benefits, you should aim for getting as much of your daily fiber as you can through foods. However, only about 5% of the U.S. population achieves the recommended level of dietary fiber consumption.
        For individuals who are not obtaining their daily fiber needs through diet, fiber supplements are a convenient way to enhance a low-fiber diet. Popular fiber supplements include the brand names Metamucil, All-Bran, and Citrucel.
        Fiber supplements vary in their active ingredients. Metamucil's active ingredient is the soluble fiber, psyllium. Citrucel's active ingredient, methylcellulose, is also a soluble fiber. However, the active ingredient in All-Bran is the insoluble fiber, wheat bran.
        Fiber supplements are among the safest ways to promote regular bowel movements, though they do act slowly and can cause gas and bloating. You should drink plenty of fluids when taking supplements.
        Because there are many different types of fiber supplement to choose from, with some offering other health benefits, you should speak with your doctor about the right fiber supplement for you.
        3. Hydration
        Keeping hydrated is an important action to take for constipation relief. Water, other liquids, and foods with a high water content can help fiber work better, making stool softer and easier to pass.
        Good fluid choices include:
        
          Water
          Naturally sweetened fruit juices
          Vegetable juices
          Clear soups
        
        Staying hydrated is good for your overall health and can help you avoid getting constipated in the first place. How much water should you drink? Most people need about four to six cups of plain water each day. But it may be surprising to learn that optimal water intake is an individualized number.
        4. Osmotic laxatives
        The name may sound technical, but osmotic laxatives are a class of medicines that include products you may be very familiar with, such as milk of magnesia.
        These laxatives use natural salts, magnesium salts, or undigested sugars to draw water into the large intestine, softening and loosening the stool. MiraLax is another example of an osmotic laxative.
        5. Stool softeners
        Stool softeners add moisture to stools to make them softer and easier to pass. Docusate is one example of a stool softener.
        Stool softeners are often recommended for people who should avoid straining, such as people who have hemorrhoids or have recently had abdominal surgery.
        6. Lubricants
        Lubricants, such as mineral oil, help stools slide out with more ease. They may be a good choice if your stools feel stuck low in your bowels, if you have an internal tear or ""fissure,"" or if you have pain from hemorrhoids during bowel movements. Mineral oil is taken by mouth and can cause pneumonia if aspirated into the lungs.
        7. Stimulant laxatives
        Stimulant laxatives provide constipation relief by causing the intestines to contract more frequently or more forcefully, encouraging stool to move through the colon. Stimulant laxatives that contain senna, cascara, or bisacodyl, are more aggressive. These medicines may relieve constipation that is severe or has not responded to other treatments.
        Because of side effects, as well as the possibility of the large intestine becoming dependent on their use, stimulant laxatives should only be used as directed and only for brief periods.
        Stimulant laxatives can be taken by mouth or inserted into the rectum as a suppository. When taken as a suppository, stimulant laxatives can work in 15-60 minutes. Taken by mouth, stimulant laxatives can cause a bowel movement in 6 to 8 hours,
        8. Enema
        Enemas are another option for constipation relief. They mechanically flush stool from the rectum and lower part of the large intestine.
        An enema works by loosening the stool in the rectum, thereby triggering the rectal muscles to squeeze as a reaction to their being stretched. A traditional enema is done with a bag of liquid (usually a mixture of salt and water) attached to a plastic tube with a tapered tip. After the tip is inserted into the anus, the enema fluid can be emptied into the rectum. The fluid is then expelled, washing stool out with it.
        When to call your doctor
        If self-care treatments don't work, you should see your doctor for constipation relief. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to treat your constipation.
        If you have fecal impaction (a large lump of dry, hard stool that stays stuck in the rectum), the hard stool may have to be removed by a doctor or nurse using a lubricated, gloved finger inserted in the rectum. This procedure can be painful, so a topical anesthetic is often applied. Some people may need to be sedated.
        Typically, an enema is given after the hard stool is removed. A high-fiber diet, stool-softening medication, or laxative may be recommended to promote regular bowel movements.",Jenette Restivo,"August 10, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/common-celiac-disease-symptoms,Common celiac disease symptoms,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that mainly affects the gastrointestinal tract. In people with celiac disease, an allergic reaction is triggered when gluten (a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley) is ingested. Over time, the immune reactions triggered by gluten inflame and damage small structures on the surface of the intestine.
        Unmanaged celiac disease can cause uncomfortable digestive symptoms, as well as symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Some symptoms result from inflammation in the intestines, while other symptoms stem from a lack of nutrients, due to the failure of the damaged intestine to digest food properly.
        The symptoms of celiac disease vary so widely that there is no such thing as a typical case. Some people with celiac disease experience mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, which can delay a medical diagnosis.
        Digestive symptoms
        Digestive symptoms of celiac disease are more common in children than adults. Children generally develop symptoms only after they start eating foods that contain gluten.
        Digestive symptoms of celiac disease may include:
        
          
            bloating
          
          
            diarrhea
          
          constipation
          gas
          
            lactose intolerance
          
          loose, greasy, bulky, foul-smelling stools
          nausea or vomiting
          abdominal pain.
        
        Non-digestive symptoms
        Some people with celiac disease experience symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Problems associated with celiac disease or caused by poor absorption of nutrients include:
        
          bone or joint pain
          iron-deficiency anemia
          weight loss
          arthritis
          fatigue
          bone loss
          tingling or numbness in the hands or feet
          dermatitis herpetiformis (a skin condition characterized by extremely itchy bumps or blisters)
          depression, irritability, or mood changes
          delayed start or missed menstrual periods
          infertility or repeated miscarriages
          symptoms involving the mouth, such as canker sores
          liver disease.
        
        How long after eating gluten can symptoms start?
        The reaction and reaction time varies among individuals. Some people will have a reaction within two to three hours of gluten consumption. Others may not feel anything until the next day or a few days after, and some not at all.
        Common symptoms after exposure to gluten include:
        
          nausea
          vomiting (very severe in some cases)
          gas/bloating
          cramps
          abdominal pain
          diarrhea
          constipation
          tiredness
          brain fog
          muscle and joint pain.
        
        Diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease
        Celiac disease should not be self-diagnosed. If you suspect you or your child has celiac disease, see a doctor.
        Treatment for celiac disease is focused on eliminating gluten from the diet, which should be done in consultation with a doctor. After a person begins eating a gluten-free diet, symptoms typically improve and may go away. However, if a person consumes small amounts of gluten, symptoms may flare up.",Jenette Restivo,"August 10, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/celiac-disease-diet-avoiding-foods-that-contain-gluten,Celiac disease diet: Avoiding foods that contain gluten,"Celiac disease is a chronic digestive and immune disorder in which consuming foods containing gluten triggers an immune reaction that causes gastrointestinal discomfort and, over time, damages the small intestine. If enough damage is done, the intestine may no longer be able to properly absorb nutrients, leading an individual with celiac disease to become nutrient-deficient. This could affect systems throughout the body.
        For this reason, it's important for people with celiac disease to follow a strict diet that excludes gluten.
        What is the connection between gluten and celiac disease?
        Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. In celiac disease, the immune system mistakenly recognizes gluten as ""foreign.""
        When people with celiac disease eat foods containing gluten, the immune system attacks the gluten when it gets into the small intestine. The attacks damage villi, which are small, fingerlike projections in the small intestine that help the body absorb nutrients from food. As villi become eroded and flattened, they have trouble absorbing nutrients. In the short term, this can lead to diarrhea and other digestive symptoms.
        Left unchecked, the inability of the small intestine to absorb nutrients can lead to malnutrition, weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, infertility, seizures, and nerve problems.
        Diet and treatment of celiac disease
        While there is no ""cure"" for celiac disease, avoiding gluten can prevent recurring symptoms. A gluten-free diet can also relieve celiac disease symptoms and even allow damage to the small intestine to heal.
        Because avoiding gluten is the only way to prevent symptoms and intestinal damage from celiac disease from returning, people with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet for life.
        Foods to avoid with celiac disease
        If you have celiac disease, you should seek the advice of a doctor or a registered dietitian for ways to maintain a balanced diet while avoiding gluten.
        Many foods can contain gluten — including many you wouldn't expect, like canned soups, sour cream, and cold cuts. That's why a person with celiac disease has to be vigilant about reading labels and asking questions about food ingredients.
        In general, avoid the following foods if you have celiac disease:
        
          Cereals, breads, or other grain products that include wheat, rye, barley, or oats. This includes white or whole-wheat flour (including cookies, crackers, cakes, and most other baked goods), semolina, couscous, bread crumbs, most pastas, and malt.
          Processed cheese, cheese mixes, low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese, or sour cream.
          Dairy products such as yogurt or ice cream that contain fillers or additives.
          Canned soups or soup mixes.
          Creamed vegetables.
          Products that contain modified food starch, food starch, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, stabilizers, or fat replacers or substitutes. (Examples of fat replacers include cellulose, gelatin, dextrins, gums, modified dietary fibers, whey protein, microparticulated egg white, and milk protein.) Check the label for these ingredients.
          Prepared or processed meats.
          Beer, gin, and whiskey.
          Flavored coffee, malted milk, or herbal tea with malted barley.
        
        What happens if you are celiac and keep eating gluten?
        Avoiding gluten is not easy. Gluten is common in foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, and cake.
        Consuming anything containing wheat, barley, or rye, even in small amounts, can trigger a celiac flare-up. Research has shown that the total daily gluten consumption that seems to be safe for most people with celiac ranges from just 10 to 50 milligrams (mg) of gluten; a slice of wheat bread contains 2,000 mg.
        Individuals with celiac disease should be aware of the risk of cross-contact in their food. Cross-contact is when a gluten-free food or food product is exposed to a gluten-containing ingredient or food — making it unsafe for people with celiac disease to eat. Cross-contact can happen at home, in restaurants, and in other food service locations. Cross-contact can occur when the same appliances or cleaning supplies are used for both gluten-containing and gluten-free foods.
        Cross-contact can also occur during the growing, processing, and manufacturing processes. Manufacturers can be contacted to ask if they batch-test their product for gluten, if they know how their raw materials were sourced and produced, and what procedures they go through to prevent cross-contact in the factory.
        What are good foods to eat if you have celiac disease?
        While the list of foods to avoid on a celiac diet seems long, you can follow a gluten-free diet and still enjoy many healthy foods. When you're shopping, look for products marked ""gluten-free.""
        If you have celiac disease, focus on foods you can enjoy that do not contain gluten. These include:
        
          fruits
          vegetables
          meat and poultry
          fish and seafood
          dairy
          beans
          legumes
          nuts
          chia
          corn
          flax
          millet
          potato
          quinoa
          rice
          soy
          tapioca
          wine
          gluten-free oats. (Oats are naturally gluten-free, but processing increases the risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing grains. Therefore, oats without a gluten-free label are not considered safe for individuals with celiac disease.)
        
        What happens if celiac disease is left untreated?
        It is important to adhere to a gluten-free diet if you have celiac disease. If left untreated, celiac disease can lead to severe malnutrition and can put you at risk of serious consequences, including osteoporosis (thin bones), anemia, infertility, liver disease, neuropathy (damaged nerves), and seizures.",Jenette Restivo,"August 10, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/prostate-cancer-an-emerging-surgical-alternative-shows-promise-in-older-men-202308092963,Prostate cancer: An emerging surgical alternative shows promise in older men,"Think of prostate cancer surgery and what likely comes to mind is a radical prostatectomy, which is an operation to remove the entire prostate gland along with the seminal vesicles that produce semen. However, men with localized prostate cancer — meaning cancer that is still confined to the prostate — have another surgical option.
        Called focal therapy, this alternative procedure treats only the cancerous part of the prostate and leaves the rest of the gland intact. The aim is to remove ""clinically significant"" tumor tissue, cancer that would spread further if it wasn't treated at all. While there is a small risk that some cancer may be left behind after treatment, focal therapy also has the benefit of minimizing risks for erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, which are both potential side effects of radical prostatectomy. And growing evidence shows it can be an effective strategy.
        Last year, researchers reported that 1,379 men treated with focal therapy or radical prostatectomy had similar cancer outcomes after five years of follow-up. The men were 66 years old on average, and doctors treated them with a technique called high-intensity focused ultrasound, or HIFU. This approach destroys cancer by subjecting it to high-energy ultrasound waves that heat tumors to high temperatures.
        Now, findings from the same research team show that focal therapy is also an effective option for older men with prostate cancer. During this newer study, researchers assessed outcomes for 649 men ages 70 and above who were treated at 11 sites in the United Kingdom. Two-thirds of the men had cancer with an intermediate risk of further spread, and the remaining third had more aggressive, high-risk prostate tumors that are more dangerous.
        All the men were treated with HIFU or a different type of focal therapy, cryotherapy, that destroys cancer by freezing it. The primary goal of the study was to assess ""failure-free survival,"" whereby treated men avoid a prostate cancer death, or worsening disease leading to further interventions.
        What the data reveals
        After follow-up durations ranging up to five years, 96% of the men were still alive, and the overall failure-free survival rate was 82%. No differences in outcomes between HIFU- and cryotherapy-treated men were reported. The men with high-risk cancer had worse outcomes: their failure-free survival rate was 75%, compared to 86% among men with intermediate-risk disease.
        But 88% of the high-risk men and 90% of the intermediate-risk men also avoided hormonal therapy, a treatment that — because of its side effects — most men don't want. The authors concluded that focal therapy may be an acceptable treatment that controls prostate cancer in older men as well as radical prostatectomy does.
        It's important to note that complications from focal therapy are possible. For instance, a small percentage of men in the new study developed urinary tract infections, and some also wound up with urinary retention, a treatable condition that occurs when the bladder can't empty completely. The authors didn't assess functional outcomes after surgery, such as erectile dysfunction or urinary incontinence. But mounting evidence from other studies shows that long-term urinary incontinence after focal therapy is very rare.
        The findings are encouraging, but Harvard experts emphasize that more evidence with focal therapy is still needed. ""Despite promising results such as those reported in this and other studies, long-term outcomes (e.g., 10 to 15 years or more) following focal therapy must still be assessed to fully determine how this treatment option compares to radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy,"" says Dr. Boris Gershman, aurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School focusing on prostate and bladder cancer. ""Additional studies can also help us refine the types of prostate cancer that focal therapy is most appropriate for, and which types should be given therapies that treat the entire prostate gland.""",Charlie Schmidt,"August 9, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/basal-cell-carcinoma-a-to-z,Basal cell carcinoma,"What is basal cell carcinoma?
        Basal cell cancer is the most common form of skin cancer diagnosed in the United States.
        Basal cells are small, round skin cells normally found in the upper part of your skin. When these cells become cancerous, they usually turn into small skin tumors that can destroy skin and nearby tissues. They can grow large over time, causing damage around and under them. Basal cell tumors rarely spread beyond the original cancer site.
        Basal cell cancer can grow on any part of the body. However, most basal cell cancers are found on some part of the face. This can cause disfigurement, and can interfere with the function of the eyelids, nose, and mouth.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        Basal cell cancer often develops because of repeated, long-term exposure to the sun. People with light skin and blue eyes are at particularly high risk. Less often, basal cell cancer may be caused by exposure to arsenic or certain industrial pollutants. Older people who received X-ray treatment for acne as teenagers are at higher risk of developing basal cell cancer.
        Symptoms of basal cell carcinoma
        Basal cell skin cancer usually appears as a tiny, painless bump with a pink, pearly surface. As the cancer slowly grows, the center of the bump may become sore and develop into a crater that bleeds, crusts, or forms a scab.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        A rare type of basal cell cancer may look like a small scar.
        Although it is commonly located on the face, basal cell cancer can develop on the ears, back, neck and other skin surfaces frequently exposed to the sun.
        Diagnosing basal cell carcinoma
        Your doctor will examine your skin. He or she will do a biopsy, which involves removing skin so it can be examined in a laboratory. The doctor may remove some, or all, of the abnormal skin for the biopsy.
        Expected duration of basal cell carcinoma
        Once a basal cell cancer develops on the skin, it usually grows slowly. It can become very large, especially if it is on your lower back, the back of your shoulder or some other area that you do not usually see in the mirror.
        Preventing basal cell carcinoma
        Unprotected exposure to sunlight increases your risk of developing basal cell cancer. You can help to reduce this risk in several ways:
        
          Apply sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher before you go outdoors.
          Limit your time outdoors when the sun is at its peak (in most parts of the United States, from about 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.).
          Wear sunglasses with ultraviolet light protection.
          Wear long pants, a shirt with long sleeves and a hat with a wide brim.
          Be aware that some drugs may increase your skin's risk of damage from the sun. These include certain antibiotics, and drugs used to treat psychiatric illness, high blood pressure, heart failure, acne and allergies. If you take prescription medications, ask your doctor if you need to take extra precautions to limit sun exposure.
          Be aware that some skin care products can make your skin more vulnerable to damage from sunlight. These include products containing alpha-hydroxy acids.
        
        If a basal cell cancer develops on your skin, early detection may limit damage. Examine your skin thoroughly every one to two months. Use a mirror to check your skin on less visible areas, such as your back, shoulders, upper arms, buttocks and the soles of your feet.
        Treating basal cell carcinoma
        Determining the right treatment depends on many factors, including:
        
          The size and location of the cancer
          Whether it has returned after previous treatment
          Age
          A patient's general health.
        
        Treatments for superficial basal cell cancer with low risk of recurrence include:
        
          Curettage and electrodessication. A sharp instrument scrapes away visible cancer. Then an electric probe kills remaining microscopic cancer cells.
          Excision. Visible cancer and some healthy tissue is cut away, then the skin is stitched closed.
        
        Less invasive treatments for low-risk superficial basal cell cancer include:
        
          Topical imiquimod cream (Aldara)
          Topical fluorouracil. An anticancer drug applied directly to the skin.
          Photodynamic therapy, which kills cancer with chemicals and light.
          Cryosurgery. Cancerous cells are frozen with liquid nitrogen.
        
        The most common treatments for larger basal cell cancers with a higher risk of recurrence are:
        
          Moh's micrographic surgery. The tumor is shaved away in thin layers. Each layer is checked under a microscope to see if it contains cancerous cells. This procedure preserves as much healthy skin as possible while making sure that all of the cancer is removed.
          Radiation. High energy rays are used to destroy the cancer.
        
        Once treatment is finished and the cancer is gone, the doctor will schedule regular follow up skin examinations. Once you have been diagnosed with basal cell cancer, you are at higher risk to develop another basal cell cancer.
        When to call a professional
        Call your doctor or a dermatologist (a doctor who specializes in skin problems) if you notice:
        
          A pearly nodule on your skin
          A new skin growth
          A skin ulcer that does not heal.
        
        Prognosis
        The outlook is usually excellent. Most basal cell cancers are cured if they are treated early.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-overlooked-symptoms-that-may-signal-heart-trouble,5 overlooked symptoms that may signal heart trouble,"Chest discomfort is linked to heart attacks. But what about signs of heart failure, valve problems, and irregular heartbeats?
        
        
 
        Chest pain is not always present in people with heart disease. Instead, other symptoms can be the signals that alert you to heart disease.
        ""Any symptom that seems to be provoked by exertion and relieved by rest could be heart-related. Particularly in people with underlying risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, tobacco use, a sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and a strong family history of heart disease, other symptoms besides chest pain may be the clue to a heart problem,"" says Dr. Randall Zusman, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        When any of the following symptoms appear with no obvious reason, pay attention and report them to your doctor.
        
          1. Fatigue
        
        Fatigue can be caused by many illnesses and by medicines. But a constant, new fatigue also can sometimes signal heart failure (a condition in which the heart fails to pump well) or coronary artery disease. ""It's less common as an indication of coronary artery disease, but it can be,"" Dr. Zusman says.
        
          2. Unexplained aches or pains
        
        The blockage of the blood supply to the heart muscle that occurs with coronary artery disease leads the heart to ""cry out in pain"" when it is asked to work harder. However, that pain is not always felt in the chest. Sometimes it is felt in the shoulders, arms, back, jaw, or abdomen. Particularly when pain in these locations occurs with exercise and disappears with rest, the pain could well be a sign of heart disease.
        
          
            
              
                
                  When to report symptoms
                
                It's better to err on the side of caution, especially if you have
                
                  symptoms that come on with activity and are relieved with rest
                  several symptoms at a time, such as fatigue and swollen feet
                  known heart disease or factors that raise your risk for heart disease (like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or smoking).
                
              
            
          
        
        
          3. Shortness of breath
        
        Don't be too quick to assume shortness of breath is just a matter of being out of shape. Unexplained shortness of breath that occurs with small amounts of activity could indicate heart trouble. ""If you climb up five flights of stairs, I expect you to be short of breath. But if you go up 10 stairs and you're short of breath, that may indicate a heart problem,"" Dr. Zusman warns.
        
          4. Swollen feet or ankles
        
        Leg, ankle, or foot swelling — the kind that leaves an indentation if you press your finger into it — could be a sign of heart failure. It also could be caused by kidney or liver disease, venous insufficiency (weak leg veins), or a side effect of some drugs (particularly nifedipine or amlodipine).
        
          
            
              
                
                  Is it a heart attack?
                
                Heart attacks may be provoked by exercise, but they also can occur when someone is at rest. Call 911 if one or more of the following symptoms come on suddenly:
                
                  shortness of breath
                  pressure or pain in the chest or upper abdomen
                  dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting
                  pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, the neck, the jaw, or upper abdomen.
                
              
            
          
        
        
          5. Heart palpitations
        
        The term ""palpitations"" means a heartbeat that feels irregular or rapid. Most palpitations are harmless. They may be caused by anxiety, caffeine intake, or dehydration.
        
          But sometimes palpitations indicate a heart problem. It's important to note how your palpitations feel, how often they occur, and what you're doing when you experience them. For example, if you're resting — like watching television — and your heart suddenly starts beating irregularly or rapidly, bring that to your doctor's attention.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/calm-your-anxious-heart,Calm your anxious heart,"Managing anxiety can improve your quality of life and take stress off your heart.
        
        A wave of dread overcomes you—your chest hurts, your heart flutters, and you can't catch your breath. These classic anxiety symptoms are often mistaken for a heart attack—and for good reason. Emotional turmoil triggers the release of stress hormones, which act on the same brain areas that regulate cardiovascular functions such as heart rate and blood pressure.
        A toxic mix
        Anxiety most often travels in the company of its henchmen—stress and depression. In fact, anxiety and depression are likely different expressions of a shared underlying biology. As many as two-thirds of people with anxiety disorders also suffer from depression at some point in their lives, and over half of people with depression also have an anxiety disorder. Long-term, unrelenting stress can be a precursor to both conditions.
        Stress, anxiety, and depression can be viewed as one family of related problems. It's hard to tease them out. For example, two people may have similar biology, but one of them is anxious, while the other is more depressed.
        Heart effects
        The relationship between heart health and depression is well documented. There is mounting evidence for an independent anxiety–heart disease link as well. In particular, people who have generalized anxiety disorder (see ""Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder"") seem to suffer higher rates of heart attack and other cardiac events. The effect is more pronounced in people who already have a diagnosis of heart disease, and the risk rises with the intensity and frequency of anxiety symptoms.
        There are several theories about how constant anxiety of this type may affect the cardiovascular system. Anxiety disorders can change the body's stress response, the combination of hormonal and physiological reactions that helps all animals fight or flee from a real threat. People with anxiety disorders have inappropriate ups and downs that can cause high blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances, or heart attack. A malfunctioning stress response promotes inflammation, which damages the artery linings and sets the stage for the buildup of coronary plaque. People with anxiety also have low levels of omega-3 fatty acids, and lower levels may be linked to a higher risk of heart disease. The presence of anxiety and depression also appears to make platelets ""stickier,"" so blood is more likely to clot.
        The connection between anxiety and heart health also travels in the other direction. A diagnosis of heart problems is likely to raise a person's baseline anxiety. In addition, people who are anxious may also have adopted unhealthy habits (like smoking or overeating) that add to cardiac risk.
        There's still much to be learned about how anxiety affects the heart. But its harmful effects—along with stress and depression—should not be ignored.
        Treating anxiety
        The choice of treatment for anxiety depends on a number of factors, such as its severity, which symptoms are dominant, and other health conditions. The primary approaches for treating anxiety entail talk therapies and medications.
        Very often, doctors recommend a dual approach that combines psychotherapy and medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy, the most studied technique, helps you identify automatic negative thoughts, understand why they aren't rational, and come up with ways to limit destructive thoughts and reinforce positive ones. Depending on an individual's needs, other types of psychotherapy may be recommended. Relaxation exercises, biofeedback, and meditation are other pill-free techniques for managing anxiety.
        Many people find relief by taking antidepressant medicines, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft). These are especially useful in people also burdened by depression. However, when seeking medication for anxiety, be sure to discuss your cardiovascular condition with your doctor to avoid adverse effects and undesirable drug interactions.
        Don't forget regular exercise, after your doctor gives you the go-ahead. It's good for your heart and also helps to boost your mood and calm your nerves.

                  The thyroid gland, which wraps around the windpipe, releases hormones that have wide-ranging effects on the body.
                
              
            
          
        
        
          Too little or too much of this crucial hormone can contribute to heart problems. 
        
        Located at the base your throat, the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland releases hormones that affect every organ in your body—especially your heart. Thyroid hormone influences the force and speed of your heartbeat, your blood pressure, and your cholesterol level. As a result, a malfunctioning thyroid gland can cause problems that masquerade as heart disease or make existing heart disease worse.
        An estimated 6% of people in the United States have thyroid disease. Most of them—about 80%— have an underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism. When thyroid levels drop, all the systems in the body slow down, triggering a range of symptoms that include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and dry skin. But these symptoms are very common in people as they grow older, including those with normal thyroid levels.
        More than half of people with normal thyroid function have symptoms of hypothyroidism. In addition, some people over age 60 with low thyroid levels don't have the classic symptoms. That's why recognizing hypothyroidism can be particularly tricky, he adds. Certain factors make people more likely to have thyroid problems.

        Hypothyroidism can affect the heart and circulatory system in a number of ways. Insufficient thyroid hormone slows your heart rate. Because it also makes the arteries less elastic, blood pressure rises in order to circulate blood around the body. Elevated cholesterol levels, which contribute to narrowed, hardened arteries, are another possible consequence of low thyroid levels.
        Another noncardiac symptom—muscle aches—may also be relevant. Muscle aches can be a symptom of hypothyroidism as well as a side effect of cholesterol-lowering statin medications, a condition known as statin-related myalgia. In fact, research suggests that hypothyroidism is more common in people who can't tolerate statins. Sometimes treating hypothyroidism helps relieve statin-related myalgia.
        Hyperthyroidism: Excess thyroid hormone
        The opposite problem, hyperthyroidism, or too much thyroid hormone, is far less common, affecting less than 1% of the population. But it, too, can harm the heart.
        The classic symptoms include sleeplessness, heat intolerance, excess sweating, weight loss, extreme hunger, and loose bowels. Excess thyroid hormone also causes the heart to beat harder and faster and may trigger abnormal heart rhythms. One is atrial fibrillation, a disorganized rhythm in the heart's upper chambers. A related symptom is palpitations, a sudden awareness of your heartbeat. People with hyperthyroidism may also have high blood pressure. In a person with clogged, stiff heart arteries, the combination of a forceful heartbeat and elevated blood pressure may lead to chest pain or angina.
        
          
            
              
                Who's at risk for thyroid problems?

                  The following factors affect your odds of having a thyroid problem:
                  Family history. People whose first-degree relatives (parents or siblings) have an underactive or overactive thyroid face a higher risk of a similar problem.
                  Gender. Women are five to eight times more likely to have thyroid problems than men.
                  Age. The prevalence of hypothyroidism rises with age, especially after age 60.
                  Race. Whites have higher rates of hypothyroidism than Hispanic Americans and African Americans.
                  Health history. Thyroid problems are more likely among people with a personal or family history of certain conditions, including type 1 diabetes, Addison's disease, pernicious anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, premature gray hair, radiation treatments to the head and neck, and vitiligo.",Unknown,"August 8, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-we-reduce-vascular-plaque-buildup,Can we reduce plaque buildup in arteries?,"Cholesterol is a fatty substance that occurs naturally in the body, High blood levels of cholesterol encourage the formation and growth of vascular plaques that put you at risk for heart attack and stroke.
        What causes arterial plaque?
        Plaque forms when cholesterol lodges in the wall of the artery. To fight back, the body sends white blood cells to trap the cholesterol, which then turn into foamy cells that ooze more fat and cause more inflammation. That triggers muscle cells in the artery wall to multiply and form a cap over the area. But the soft plaque beneath the cap is dangerous.
        For example, if your blood pressure spikes, it puts pressure on the thin wall of the plaque, which can break open, form a clot, and cause a heart attack. Most major heart attacks occur when plaques rupture.
        Plaques that gradually enlarge over time are often covered by thick, fibrous caps that can resist breaking apart. They can still block blood flow, causing angina (chest pain brought on by exertion or emotional stress). These blockages can also lead to different type of heart attack.
        Can you unclog your arteries, or reduce plaque buildup?
        Making plaque disappear is not possible, but with lifestyle changes and medication they can shrink and stabilize.
        Doctors especially want to target the softer plaques before they rupture. For example, if you have a 30% blockage in the artery from soft plaque, the goal is to try to suck out the cholesterol from the inside, so the plaque shrivels down to 15% and leaves nothing inside it.
        How do you get the cholesterol out of the plaque? By lowering levels of cholesterol in the blood, where it travels inside particles called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) deposits cholesterol into blood vessel walls.
        The drugs used most often to reduce LDL cholesterol levels are statins — such as atorvastatin (Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor). Statins block the liver enzyme that promotes cholesterol production. Very intensive lifestyle changes have also been shown to shrink plaque.
        Those lifestyle modifications include:
        
          Eating a Mediterranean diet
        
        It can reduce heart disease risk by 30%. It is rich in olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts and fish; low in red or processed meats; and moderate in the amounts of cheese and wine you can consume.
        
          Kicking the habit
        
        Smoking damages the lining of the arteries. Quitting can help raise HDL levels.
        
          Exercising
        
        Aerobic exercise can raise HDL, lower blood pressure, burn body fat, and lower blood sugar levels. Exercise combined with weight loss can also lower LDL levels. Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise.
        Busting the cholesterol myth
        
          Why you can't live without this tricky substance. 
        
        Cholesterol is often vilified as the bad guy, but we need this waxy, fatty substance to make vitamin D, hormones, bile that aids digestion, and the coverings of our cells. The liver produces 75% of the body's cholesterol, but all cells have the ability to make it.
        When cells need more cholesterol, the liver sends it via the bloodstream in packages made of cholesterol on the inside and protein on the outside. These cholesterol-laden particles are known as low-density lipoprotein, or LDL. Too much LDL in the blood can cause cholesterol to lodge in the artery walls and form plaques. That's why LDL is known as ""bad"" cholesterol.
        Whereas LDL particles deposit cholesterol into plaques of atherosclerosis, some high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles help remove cholesterol from plaques. That's why it's often referred to as ""good"" cholesterol.
        
          How much HDL and LDL should you aim for?
        
        An HDL of 60 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or greater is associated with a lower risk of heart disease. Your personal goal for LDL depends on your cardiovascular risk profile. For people who have coronary artery disease or other evidence of cardiovascular disease, the goal is an LDL of less than 70 mg/dL and some doctors are now aiming for an LDL of less than 55 mg/dL.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/top-7-reasons-you-have-a-headache,Top 7 reasons you have a headache,"When a bad headache strikes, you just want it to end. The aching, throbbing pain can be debilitating and result in missed appointments, work, or time with family and friends.
        Regardless of whether you are prone to migraines, tension headaches, or cluster headaches (see ""Is this your headache?""), you may be able to reduce their frequency by identifying what brings them on. Here's a look at the most common triggers for each of these kinds of headaches.
        Stress
        Stress can cause tight muscles in the shoulders and neck, which often leads to tension headaches. When tension headaches become frequent, the pain in shoulder and neck muscles is felt by the brain as pain in the head.
        Hunger itself can trigger a migraine or tension headache. But eating certain foods may trigger migraines. It could be just one type of food — like beans or nuts — or many foods, such as avocados, bananas, cheese, chocolate, citrus, herring, dairy products, and onions. Processed foods with nitrites, nitrates, yellow food dyes, or monosodium glutamate can be especially problematic.
        Alcohol intake
        Alcohol is a common migraine trigger. For some people, a few ounces of red wine are all it takes to provoke a headache, although any kind of alcohol can be a trigger. It's not clear if the alcohol itself is to blame or if another component in the drink causes the problem.
        Environment
        Environmental factors such as bright light, smoke, humidity, intense scents, or cold weather are associated with migraine headaches. People with cluster headaches often note that their headaches occur with specific seasonal changes. 
        Hormones
        Changes in estrogen levels are associated with migraines in women, and women suffer from migraines more often than men. Menstrual cycles may be tied to migraine in younger women. Varying estrogen levels during perimenopause can sometimes start migraines in women who never experienced them before. Estrogen therapy may also be a migraine trigger. Menopause does seem to end migraines in most women.
        Caffeine withdrawal
        If you normally consume caffeine in coffee or tea, stopping intake abruptly may trigger a migraine. This may be because caffeine causes blood vessels to constrict; without caffeine, the blood vessels widen and bulge out with each heartbeat — a chief reason for the pounding pain of migraines.
        Lack of sleep
        A lack of sleep is associated with migraines and tension headaches. For people with migraine, falling asleep can often stop an attack or at least decrease the severity of pain.
        
          
            
              
                
                  Is this your headache?
                
                Here are three common types of headaches and their symptoms.
                
                  Tension headache. Pain often starts in the neck and back and works its way up to feel like a tight band around your head. It often goes away with rest.
                  Migraine headache. Pain typically begins on one side of the head, throbs or pounds, and makes you sensitive to light and sound. It may cause nausea. A migraine can last for hours or days.
                  Cluster headache. A cluster headache feels like a stabbing pain in the eye. It may cause eye tearing or redness, runny nose, or nasal congestion. It may last for a few minutes or hours, go away, and come back several times per day. These headache clusters can occur for months, disappear, and reappear a long time later.
                
              
            
          
        
        What you can do
        Understanding your headache triggers can help you avoid getting headaches in the future. But identifying triggers can be tricky, especially if you have more than one (like several kinds of food). Try keeping a diary to note the day, time, symptoms, and circumstances surrounding a headache (what had you eaten? where did it happen?).
        If avoiding triggers isn't enough to keep headaches at bay, talk to your doctor. There are many prescription medications as well as pill-free treatments (acupuncture, meditation, biofeedback, relaxation therapy) that can help reduce headache frequency.
        And you'll need to go a step further: Make sure you get enough sleep, exercise, eat a healthy diet, limit alcohol intake, and reduce stress. Headaches are a condition of hypersensitivity, so you need balance in your system to fight triggers.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-lowdown-on-glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load,The lowdown on glycemic index and glycemic load,"What are the facts about the glycemic load of foods? If you have diabetes, you probably know you need to monitor your carbohydrate intake. But different carbohydrate-containing foods affect blood sugar differently, and these effects can be quantified by measures known as the glycemic index and glycemic load. You might even have been advised to use these numbers to help plan your diet. But what do these numbers really mean — and just how useful are they?
        Glycemic index vs. glycemic load
        The glycemic index (GI) assigns a numeric score to a food based on how drastically it makes your blood sugar rise. Foods are ranked on a scale of 0 to 100, with pure glucose (sugar) given a value of 100. The lower a food's glycemic index, the slower blood sugar rises after eating that food. In general, the more processed a food is, the higher its GI, and the more fiber or fat in a food, the lower it's GI.
        But the glycemic index tells just part of the story. What it doesn't tell you is how high your blood sugar could go when you actually eat the food. To understand a food's complete effect on blood sugar, you need to know both how quickly it makes glucose enter the bloodstream and how much glucose per serving it can deliver. A separate measure called the glycemic load does both — which gives you a more accurate picture of a food's real-life impact on your blood sugar. Watermelon, for example, has a high glycemic index (80). But a serving of watermelon has so little carbohydrate that its glycemic load is only 5.
        Glycemic load diet
        Some nutrition experts believe that people with diabetes should pay attention to both the glycemic index and glycemic load to avoid sudden spikes in blood sugar. The total amount of carbohydrate in a food, rather than its glycemic index or load, is a stronger predictor of what will happen to blood sugar. But some dietitians also feel that focusing on the glycemic index and load adds an unneeded layer of complexity to choosing what to eat.
        The bottom line? Following the principles of low-glycemic-index eating is likely to be beneficial for people with diabetes. But reaching and staying at a healthy weight is more important for your blood sugar and your overall health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/are-fats-so-bad,Are fats so bad?,"For years, fat was a dirty word in the dietary world. After World War II, large studies established links between saturated fat and heart disease. Most dietary experts advised people to reduce their fat intake, not only because of the heart connection, but also because fat has more calories per gram than protein or carbohydrate and was assumed to contribute more to weight gain.
        Many people did so, but they often replaced the lost calories with large amounts of carbohydrates— especially refined carbohydrates. They also stopped eating healthy fats, like olive and canola oils. Instead of helping us slim down, the decline in fat consumption was accompanied by higher rates of overweight and obesity.
        What went awry? As it turns out, the ""all fat is bad"" message was wrong. Foods that contain fat help fill you up, so you stop eating earlier.
        More important, not all fats are alike. Saturated fat, found mainly in meat and dairy foods, contributes to clogged arteries and cardiovascular disease. But monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, found in plants and healthful oils, actually protect your health by improving your cholesterol profile.
        Fat has little direct effect on blood sugar levels. It is a major energy source for your body, and it helps you absorb certain vitamins and nutrients.
        Another type of fat needed for a variety of vital physiological functions is the family of omega-3 unsaturated fats. Your body can't make these on its own; it must get them from food. Good sources of omega-3s include fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines, and mackerel. Flaxseeds, walnuts, wheat germ, canola oil, unhydrogenated soybean oil, and flaxseed oil are also rich in omega-3s.
        Trans fats are the worst fats for your health. These fats are made when hydrogen is added to healthy unsaturated fats to solidify them and make them less likely to spoil. Trans fats raise harmful LDL cholesterol, lower beneficial HDL cholesterol, increase inflammation, and make blood more likely to clot.
        The FDA has ruled that ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, the main source of trans fats in the American food supply, are no longer ""generally recognized as safe.""  By now, most food companies have stopped using them. But to be sure, look for products that have a zero on the ""trans fat"" line in the Nutrition Facts box.",Unknown,"August 2, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-importance-of-exercise-when-you-have-diabetes,The importance of exercise when you have diabetes,"For people who have diabetes—or almost any other disease, for that matter—the benefits of exercise can't be overstated. Exercise helps control weight, lower blood pressure, lower harmful LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, raise healthy HDL cholesterol, strengthen muscles and bones, reduce anxiety, and improve your general well-being. There are added benefits for people with diabetes: exercise lowers blood glucose levels and boosts your body's sensitivity to insulin, countering insulin resistance.
        Many studies underscore these and other benefits from exercise. Following are some highlights of those results:
        
          Exercise lowered HbA1c values by 0.7 percentage point in people of different ethnic groups with diabetes who were taking different medications and following a variety of diets—and this improvement occurred even though they didn't lose any weight.
          All forms of exercise—aerobic, resistance, or doing both (combined training)—were equally good at lowering HbA1c values in people with diabetes.
          Resistance training and aerobic exercise both helped to lower insulin resistance in previously sedentary older adults with abdominal obesity at risk for diabetes. Combining the two types of exercise proved more beneficial than doing either one alone.
          People with diabetes who walked at least two hours a week were less likely to die of heart disease than their sedentary counter- parts, and those who exercised three to four hours a week cut their risk even more.
          Women with diabetes who spent at least four hours a week doing moderate exercise (including walking) or vigorous exercise had a 40% lower risk of developing heart disease than those who didn't exercise. These benefits persisted even after researchers adjusted for confounding factors, including BMI, smoking, and other heart disease risk factors.
        
        In general, the best time to exercise is one to three hours after eating, when your blood sugar level is likely to be higher. If you use insulin, it's important to test your blood sugar before exercising. If the level before exercise is below 100 mg/dL, eating a piece of fruit or having a small snack will boost it and help you avoid hypoglycemia. Testing again 30 minutes later will show whether your blood sugar level is stable. It's also a good idea to check your blood sugar after any particularly grueling workout or activity. If you're taking insulin, your risk of developing hypoglycemia may be highest six to 12 hours after exercising.
        Because of the dangers associated with diabetes, always wear a medical alert bracelet indicating that you have diabetes and whether you take insulin. Also keep hard candy or glucose tablets with you while exercising in case your blood sugar drops precipitously.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/surprising-causes-of-neck-pain,Surprising causes of neck pain,"A sore neck can dog you in every position — lying down, sitting, standing, or walking — and the discomfort can be debilitating. The pain might come from structural neck problems such as arthritis (worn cartilage at the ends of your neck bones) or degenerated discs (worn cushions between your neck bones).
        But often the cause is related to strains in the neck muscles, triggered by something subtle in your daily routine. Here are some surprising culprits behind neck pain and strain, plus quick fixes to feel better.
        Binge-watching a TV show
        Like to watch back-to-back episodes of your favorite program? You might be holding your neck in an awkward position for hours at a time. ""A lot of people lean way back while they watch TV, extending the neck backward. Or they lean to the side, forcing the neck too far sideways. Both positions can strain neck muscles,"" says David Evangelista, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        Quick fixes: ""Use a horseshoe-shaped travel pillow that goes around your neck when you lean back to watch TV. If you lean to the side, use more pillows to fill the gap between your head and shoulders. And change your position every 15 or 20 minutes to give your neck a break, so it doesn't get stiff,"" Evangelista says.
        Leaning forward
        You might lean forward throughout the day, whether that's toward a computer monitor that's hard to see or toward another person during a conversation. If you extend your neck each time, that can strain the muscles and cause pain.
        Quick fixes: If you're going to lean, keep your back straight and tilt forward at your hips. If you can't see your computer monitor well, pull it closer to you or increase the font size. If you have eyeglasses for reading or distance vision, see if they help. If they don't help enough, you can get glasses just for using a computer. If you don't use eyeglasses, get an eye exam: you may need a pair. Similarly, if you lean forward a lot to hear people in conversation, consider getting a hearing test.
        Wearing a flimsy bra
        Wearing a bra with little support makes your muscles and ligaments do all the heavy lifting. For someone with heavy breasts, the extra weight can pull the neck forward and stress the neck and shoulder muscles, leading to neck and back pain.
        Quick fixes: Get a better bra. Make sure both the underwire and middle section of the bra lie flat against your body, the cups aren't too tight or too loose, and the band is level across your back and doesn't ride up. Or try a sports bra or posture bra that brings the weight of the breasts closer to your ribcage and distributes it across your torso.
        Sleeping in risky positions
        Sleeping seems harmless, but some sleep positions pose big risks for the neck. When you sleep on your stomach, for example, you rotate your head to the side. Sleeping on your side without the right support pushes your neck toward your shoulder. Staying in these positions for hours can cause neck muscle strain and pain.
        Quick fixes. Avoid sleeping on your stomach. And if you're a side sleeper, check the support under your neck. ""Lie on your side with your head on your pillow. If you can easily slide your hand in the space between your head and shoulders, you're not getting enough support at night. Get a new pillow to fill the gap. Any material will do,"" Evangelista says.
        Sitting ""comfortably""
        For many people, sitting comfortably means slouching, which is bad for your neck and back. ""Poor posture puts abnormal strain on the spine, including the neck and the ligaments holding it together, and that can cause pain,"" Evangelista says.
        Quick fixes: Sit up straight: pull your chin back, lower your shoulders, and arch your back. If that's challenging at first, sit on the edge of your chair for a few minutes, which makes sitting up straight a little easier, and then sit farther back on the seat. If your budget allows, get an ergonomic desk chair with low-back support, adjustable height, and a thick seat cushion.
        Looking at electronic screens
        We all spend a lot of time looking at electronic devices. For example, you might be looking up at a TV mounted on a wall, or down at a smartphone or laptop. The trouble is that your head is heavy; angling it up or down for a long time leads to muscle strain and pain.
        Quick fixes: Keep TVs, smartphones, and computer screens at eye level. Consider lowering the height of your TV, elevating your computer screen by putting it on a small stand, or raising your smartphone screen by putting it on a stand or a pillow on your lap. ""Wearing a travel pillow around your neck can add neck support,"" Evangelista says.
        Lifting heavy dumbbells
        Evangelista says many people lift dumbbells that are too heavy. ""That throws off your body mechanics. Your trapezius muscles in the back overcompensate. They're connected to the neck, and the overuse can cause neck pain,"" he says.
        Quick fixes: If you're struggling to lift a dumbbell, use a lighter weight. Make sure you're using proper form; a physical therapist or certified personal trainer can guide you.
        Getting stressed
        ""We carry a lot of stress in our necks. We raise our shoulders and tense our muscles,. If you have any underlying neck problems, it irritates them,"" Evangelista says.
        Quick fixes: Practice stress management. Try some deep breathing exercises, go for a quiet walk in nature, or learn how to meditate. ""I've seen people whose neck problems go away when they get stress under control,"" Evangelista says. ""It's an important part of any plan to reduce neck pain.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/get-moving-to-manage-osteoarthritis,Get moving to manage osteoarthritis,"The estimated 32 million Americans with osteoarthritis face a dilemma: exercise is often difficult and painful, but it is precisely what they should do to help manage their pain.
        ""Regular exercise and movement can help people with osteoarthritis in many ways,"" says Dr. Jeffrey Katz, professor of medicine and orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School. ""Besides helping with pain management, it can improve patients' level of function and may delay the need for a joint replacement.""
        Casing the joints
        Osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, is a chronic and progressive disease characterized by loss of the cartilage that covers and protects the ends of the bones where they meet at a joint.
        ""The condition slowly wears away joint cartilage so that forces usually absorbed by the cartilage are transferred to bone, which has pain sensitive nerve fibers,"" says Dr. Katz. ""Cartilage breakdown can also lead to pain, swelling, inflammation and activity limitation.""
        Osteoarthritis most often occurs in the knees, hips, and lower back. The condition becomes more common with age, but other factors can increase a person's risk, such as a family history of the disease, previous injury, and excess weight.
        There is no cure for osteoarthritis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), or aspirin, can temporarily soothe pain and inflammation. Steroid injections also may offer short-term relief.
        Another way to manage symptoms is to get moving. ""Exercise can't help replace lost cartilage or necessarily slow its natural decline,"" says Dr. Katz. ""It has a supporting role — strengthening the bones and surrounding muscles to protect the affected joints from excess stress so they can work better.""
        Get evaluated
        If you have osteoarthritis, and are having difficulty initiating an exercise program, Dr. Katz recommends seeing a physical therapist.
        ""An expert evaluation can help identify alignment issues, weakness, and limitations in joint motion that can make joint pain worse and make movements more difficult,"" he says. ""Physical therapists can also design an individualized exercise program and teach patients how to perform the exercises accurately and safely. Working with a physical therapist also can help people overcome any fear or hesitation about movement increasing their pain.""
        
          
            
              
                Preventing the pain of osteoarthritis
                Not only can exercise keep osteoarthritis from possibly becoming worse, but it may reduce the risk of developing the condition. One study that looked for a connection between running and osteoarthritis risk in the hip or knee found that only 3.5% of people who ran for exercise eventually got knee or hip osteoarthritis, compared with 10% of inactive people. Another study found that among people who had mild knee osteoarthritis or were at higher-than-average risk for the disease, those who walked an average of almost 7,000 steps per day (more than three miles) did not experience additional cartilage loss over two years.
              
            
          
        
        Exercising your options
        A standard exercise program typically includes aerobic exercises and resistance training to increase strength in the major muscle groups supporting the joints, like the buttocks, thighs, and the muscles in the lower back. You might use weights, exercise bands, body weight, or another means of providing resistance.
        ""Your program will depend on various factors, including which joints are involved, how severe the pain is, your fitness level, and whether you have other medical conditions,"" says Dr. Katz.
        Low-impact aerobic activities are also part of an overall exercise strategy, as they help strengthen muscles, improve endurance, and increase your joints' range of motion. Examples include power walking, swimming, using an elliptical trainer, cycling, or riding a stationary bike.
        ""Your physical therapist can recommend the best low-impact activities to complement your exercise program and how long and often to do them,"" says Dr. Katz.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-almost-last-word-on-alcohol-and-health,The (almost) last word on alcohol and health,"New information has again opened the debate about what role, if any, alcohol plays in health. Is a moderate amount good for your heart? Can you still enjoy the occasional beverage, or should you become a teetotaler as you age?
        Like so much in life, it's complicated.
        ""There's good evidence that, in general, moderate drinkers who average one to two drinks a day tend to live longer,"" says Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition and director of the Program in Cardiovascular Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""Whether that is directly linked with alcohol, other lifestyle factors, or some combination is still being explored.""
        Different findings
        Why might alcohol be healthy? It's thought that moderate intake helps raise levels of ""good"" HDL cholesterol, higher amounts of which are associated with a lower risk for heart disease. Alcohol also may discourage the formation of small blood clots that can lead to heart attacks and stroke.
        Still, new studies have cast doubt on the connection between alcohol and good health.
        For instance, a meta-analysis (that is, a study based on data collected in multiple earlier trials) published in March 2023 in JAMA Network Open concluded that low-volume drinkers (1.3 to 24 grams of alcohol daily, or less than two standard drinks) did not live longer than people who never drank.
        Medium-volume drinking (25 to 44 grams, about two to three daily standard drinks) also didn't offer significant health protection. Rimm is quick to pump the brakes on this and similar conclusions based on data from multiple studies.
        ""New findings do not mean that everything else that came before is wrong,"" he says. ""The problem with these studies is that they combine good and poor research. So, it's difficult to make a conclusion with information where alcohol is assessed so differently. For many studies they completely ignored measuring drinking patterns.""
        Another issue is that most alcohol-related studies are observational — that is, they can show an association, but not cause and effect.
        Other factors linked with alcohol intake may contribute to drinkers' well-being. For instance, a study published in March 2022 in JAMA Network Open found that moderate drinkers had the lowest heart disease risk compared with nondrinkers, suggesting that some alcohol intake may benefit heart health.
        Yet the research team also discovered that light-to-moderate drinkers had healthier lifestyles than abstainers. They were more physically active, ate more vegetables and less red meat, and didn't smoke as much.
        Glass half full
        What seems clear in most research supporting the health benefits of alcohol is that the amount is key. Light to moderate intake remains the best advice.
        The CDC classifies moderate alcohol intake for adult men as two standard drinks or fewer on days when they drink. A standard drink is approximately 12 ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol by volume, or ABV), 8 to 9 ounces of malt liquor (7% ABV), 5 ounces of wine (12% ABV), or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof spirits (40% ABV). (See ""What is a standard drink?"".)
        Of course, most people don't drink daily, and some may go for long periods without alcohol. ""But even occasional drinkers may still receive some benefits,"" says Rimm.
        Does the type of alcohol matter? Not really. Your body reacts to alcohol the same way whether it comes from a California wine, Scotch whiskey, or craft beer. ""The differences between beverages are the percentage of alcohol,"" says Rimm.
        (To more accurately analyze your drink's alcohol content per serving size, use this drink calculator from the National Institutes of Health: /size.)
        Your choice of beverage can have adverse health effects unrelated to the alcohol. For instance, a gin-and-tonic cocktail contains high amounts of sugar, and most beer is high in carbohydrates and calories.
        One part of the alcohol debate everyone agrees on is not drinking too much.
        ""Studies have found that regularly drinking beyond the recommended amount can raise a person's risk for numerous health problems, like liver failure, high blood pressure, heart failure, and several types of cancer,"" says Rimm. Also, avoid regular excessive drinking and binge drinking (consuming five or more drinks on one occasion).
        
          
        
        Last call
        So what is the conclusion? According to Rimm, if you don't drink, there is no reason to begin. If you only occasionally drink, don't increase your intake for health reasons. But for the casual or regular drinker, it's fine to enjoy an alcoholic beverage — in moderation.
        But you should also weigh your alcohol intake with your overall heart health, adds Rimm. For example, if you have high blood pressure, you may want to drink less or abstain from drinking and focus on getting your blood pressure under control.
        ""If you have any health issues, it's best to speak with your doctor about what is the proper amount of alcohol for you,"" says Rimm.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-are-you-coughing-at-night,Why are you coughing at night?,"Some people don't cough during the day, but then start hacking once they're in bed. Several conditions can cause this, and some have a common culprit: gravity.
        Common triggers
        Several health issues are associated with nighttime coughing. These are some of the most common:
        Postnasal drip. Postnasal drip describes a constant trickle of mucus from the upper airways — the sinuses and throat. ""In the daytime, when you're upright, these fluids drain naturally with the help of gravity, and you swallow and clear them. When you lie down, you lose the help of gravity, and mucus collects at the back of the throat. If mucus lands on the vocal cords in the throat, or if you inhale some mucus and it enters the lungs, it triggers a wet cough that produces phlegm or mucus,"" explains Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya, an ear, nose, and throat specialist (otolaryngologist) at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Stomach acid generally is squeezed down into the intestine when the stomach contracts, or is pulled down by gravity. However, when the circular muscle between the stomach and the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) fails to tighten properly, acid can squirt back up, irritating the lining of the esophagus and structures in the throat. This backwash is called reflux. When you lie down, acid doesn't flow naturally into the intestine and can reflux even more easily. ""When acid gets on the vocal cords, you start to cough. In severe cases, acid gets into the windpipe and causes wheezing,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. GERD can cause a dry cough that may or may not be accompanied by a burning feeling (heartburn) or pain in your chest.
        Medication side effects. Some drugs — for example, ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril, others) or enalapril (Vasotec), which are used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease — can cause a frequent, dry cough as a side effect. ""In the daytime it might feel more like a need to clear your throat. At night, it's much worse,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says.
        Heart failure. Heart failure is the term for a gradual decline in the heart's ability to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. ""When the heart isn't pumping well, fluid backs up and seeps into other tissues. In the daytime, when you're upright, gravity forces the fluid into the lower extremities. When you lie down, some fluid builds up in the lungs, which makes you cough,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. ""A dry cough at night may be one of the first signs of heart failure.""
        What you should do
        When a new nighttime cough lasts more than a few weeks, see your doctor to rule out the most dangerous causes, like heart failure. Your doctor can also review your prescriptions for potential side effects that might lead to a cough, and swap out a medication if necessary.
        Those causes aren't too hard to suss out. ""But it can take a bit of trial and error to figure out if GERD or postnasal drip is causing nighttime coughing. I'll typically recommend a month of treatment for one or the other, depending on symptoms, and see if the person gets better,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. ""If one avenue doesn't work, we can try the other. It's better than doing an expensive diagnostic test that requires anesthesia.""
        GERD treatment involves dietary modifications (avoiding foods and drinks that seem to make your GERD symptoms worse) plus drugs that suppress acid, such as omeprazole (Prilosec).
        For postnasal drip, treatment involves medication that either thins mucus secretions (so they flow more easily and don't go in wrong places) or dries up mucus production (to decrease the volume of secretions).
        Other things you can do
        In addition to medical treatment, these strategies might help reduce nighttime coughing:
        Sleep on a wedge pillow. The elevation helps you swallow secretions better and makes it harder for stomach acid to reflux.
        Use a room humidifier. ""This is especially helpful in the winter, when dry air makes secretions thicker. A humidifier can break them up and thin them out,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says.
        Stay upright after eating. Wait an hour or two before you lie down.
        Keep cough drops handy. If you wake up coughing, sit up and (when possible) suck on a cough drop to calm an irritated throat.
        Try some honey. Have a teaspoon of honey, or put some in a cup of decaffeinated tea. Some people find that honey can soothe a sore throat and suppress a cough. And at the very least, it can be a comforting treat.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/24-hour-blood-pressure-monitoring-outperforms-clinic-readings,24-hour blood pressure monitoring outperforms clinic readings,"Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) involves wearing a device that automatically records blood pressure every 30 to 60 minutes for 24 hours. New research suggests that ABPM — especially the nighttime readings — can better predict death from cardiovascular disease and other causes than conventional blood pressure readings done in a clinic.
        The study included more than 59,000 people (average age 59) from 223 primary care practices in Spain. Most (59%) were being treated for high blood pressure. Researchers estimated the associations between patients' clinic blood pressure and ABPM readings and deaths occurring during a median follow-up of nearly 10 years.
        They found that ABPM was almost five times more informative for predicting death than clinic blood pressure measurements, and the nighttime readings were about six times more informative. The findings highlight the need to evaluate and control nighttime blood pressure, say the authors, whose study was published online May 5, 2023, by the journal Lancet.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/calcium-score-may-foretell-heart-risk-better-than-genetic-test,Calcium score may foretell heart risk better than genetic test,"Specialized tests may help doctors better determine a person's risk of developing heart disease. A new study suggests that one such test, a calcium score (which quantifies the plaque inside the heart's arteries), appears to improve risk assessment, while a gene-based risk score does not.
        The study, published in the May 23/30, 2023, issue of JAMA, included 3,208 adults from two large studies; none had heart disease at the outset. For each participant, researchers calculated a traditional heart disease risk score based on factors such as body mass index, blood pressure, and cholesterol values. Participants got CT scans to determine their calcium scores. They also got a polygenic risk score, which relies on a blood test that detects multiple genetic variants associated with heart disease.
        After a median follow-up of just over 14 years, researchers found that combining the calcium score with the traditional risk calculation provided a meaningful improvement in predicting heart disease risk. That was not the case for the polygenic risk score. However, the polygenic risk score may prove more useful in people who are younger than the study participants, whose average age was in the mid-60s.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/whats-the-latest-on-wearables-for-finding-atrial-fibrillation,What's the latest on wearables for finding atrial fibrillation?,"Five years ago, the FDA granted marketing clearance for the first smart watch capable of capturing the heart's electrical ""signature,"" known as an electrocardiogram or ECG. An app enables the watch to detect atrial fibrillation (afib), the most common heart rhythm disorder (see ""What is atrial fibrillation?""). Today, four additional smart watches with similar capabilities have FDA clearance, and more are expected on the market soon.
        Because bouts of afib are often short-lived and sometimes symptomless, diagnosing it can be challenging. An annual ECG at your doctor's office, which lasts less than 10 seconds, may not pick up afib if it is occurring only occasionally. And unless you have symptoms, medical devices that check the heart for longer periods of time don't make sense.
        But your smart watch can continuously monitor your pulse for an abnormally rapid or irregular heart rate and tell you to when record an ECG, which involves opening an app and touching the side of the watch for 30 seconds. In theory, this capability could pick up more cases of afib, which is important because afib raises the risk of stroke. Knowing you have the problem means you can take action. For people at higher risk, taking anti-clotting medications may help lower the risk of stroke.
        The current evidence
        But what do we actually know about how well these consumer devices work, and who might benefit from using one? If you already have one of these smart watches or are considering getting one, here's what you should know.
        Currently, there are no randomized trials using smart watches to screen for afib that show a health benefit associated with their use. However, an analysis using simulated data based on average Americans suggests the strategy would be cost-effective in people ages 65 and older, says cardiologist Dr. Shaan Khurshid, a research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and one of the lead authors of the study, which was published in 2022 in JAMA Health Forum. ""In older adults, consumer wearable devices have the potential to improve outcomes and lower costs by decreasing strokes,"" he says.
        How reliable are the readings? According to a study published in February 2023 in JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology, about a quarter of the ECG readings from five smart devices were deemed ""inconclusive."" But setting those cases aside, the devices were all highly accurate in finding afib. The tested devices were the Apple Watch 6, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, the Withings ScanWatch, the Fitbit Sense, and the AliveCor KardiaMobile (a credit card–sized device you touch with your fingers and use with a smartphone).
        The devices are not cheap; most ECG-enabled smart watches start at around $250. People should also be aware of the potential emotional cost of a false positive result (when the ECG incorrectly reports afib), which could cause anxiety. In addition, processing the sheer volume of patient data available is already a challenge for many doctors, and the need to review multiple smart watch ECG tracings could further strain our health care system. Finally, the people who would likely benefit most from afib screening may be the least able to afford or know how to use a consumer device, an issue that could further exacerbate existing health disparities in this country.
        
          
            
              
                What is atrial fibrillation?
                Atrial fibrillation (afib) is a heart rhythm disorder that causes a rapid, irregular heartbeat. These bouts may occur for occasional, brief periods or much longer — even permanently in some people. About one in 11 people ages 65 and older has the condition, which is more common in those with high blood pressure, obesity, and sleep apnea.
                Possible symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness. But sometimes, afib goes unnoticed. Recognized or not, this erratic heart rhythm can cause blood to pool in the heart's upper chambers. This increases the likelihood of clots, which can travel to the brain and block blood flow, causing a stroke.
              
            
          
        
        The bottom line
        For people considering buying a smart watch, the ECG recording capability is a potential added benefit, says Dr. Khurshid. ""But if you don't want to spend the money, there are many other ways to screen for afib,"" he adds. These strategies, which include simply checking your own pulse or wearing a heart monitor for a couple weeks, depend on your afib risk and symptoms.
        If you already have afib, a smart watch may help you monitor the condition over the long term, which could help inform your doctor's treatment advice.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/race-racism-and-heart-disease-why-awareness-matters,"Race, racism, and heart disease: Why awareness matters","In the United States, Black adults are more than twice as likely to die of cardiovascular disease than white adults. Growing evidence points to structural racism as a ""fundamental driver"" of this stark disparity, according to a 2020 presidential advisory from the American Heart Association (AHA).
        Structural racism refers to the systems in a society that create and maintain racial inequality. But the damaging health effects of the underlying problem — racial discrimination — have been studied for decades. More than 25 years ago, sociologist David R. Williams, professor of public health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, developed the Everyday Discrimination Scale. It's designed to quantify the hassles and indignities people experience in daily life and whether they feel this unfair treatment is due to their race, gender, age, or other characteristics. A recent update reviewed some of the cardiovascular effects related to race (see ""Racial discrimination and heart health: The evidence"").
        ""While there's a great deal of literature on the health effects of stress, the traditional measures have not always fully captured the stressful effects of discrimination, which can extend beyond daily indignities to also include a higher frequency of traumatic experiences, such as being unfairly stopped by police and exposure to gun violence,"" says Williams.
        
          
            
              
                Racial discrimination and heart health: The evidence
                Cardiovascular disease and related health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity are often collectively referred to as cardiometabolic disease. Dozens of studies have explored how racial discrimination may worsen these common conditions. A review in the March 28, 2023, issue of the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities synthesized the evidence to date.
                The review assessed 123 peer-reviewed studies done in the United States and published from 1996 to 2022. All the studies included people with cardiometabolic diseases who belonged to racial or ethnic minorities. Blacks were the most frequently studied racial group, accounting for 53% of participants across all the studies. The Everyday Discrimination Scale (see main story) was the most commonly used measure of discrimination. About three-quarters of the studies found that racial or ethnic discrimination was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease.
              
            
          
        
        Downstream effects
        Discrimination can also affect employment opportunities and advancement, which has downstream effects that contribute to health disparities, according to Dr. Michelle Albert, president of the AHA. ""If you can't get a well-paying job or develop wealth, these circumstances limit where you can afford to live. That, in turn, affects your access to healthy foods, safe places to exercise, and good medical care,"" she says. In addition, discrimination has been linked to other factors that are hard on the heart, including social isolation, depression, and unhealthy coping skills such as smoking and alcohol use.
        Like other stressful experiences, the experience of discrimination can activate the fight-or-flight response, triggering a release of hormones that raise blood pressure. Over time, blood pressure spikes can damage the blood vessels, kidneys, and heart, says Dr. Albert, director of the Center for the Study of Adversity and Cardiovascular Dis-ease at the University of California, San Francisco.
        The price we pay
        Given that cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of disability and death in this country, the financial impact of race-based health disparities is substantial, says Williams. The cost to society at large includes not just higher health care spending but also productivity losses related to job absenteeism and premature death. While Blacks make up about 14% of the population, nearly 40% of people currently living in the United States belong to a racial or ethnic minority. People in the other groups, which include Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans, also experience cardio-vascular disease disparities to varying degrees.
        The AHA's Office of Health Equity sponsors community and workplace programs to address discrimination and other barriers to equitable health care. But on a personal level, everyone can benefit from becoming more aware of their implicit biases — the unconscious assumptions people have about groups of people that may underlie some discriminatory behaviors. Project Implicit (see health.harvard.edu/bias) includes online tests to explore implicit bias.
        ""The data on the health effects of discrimination are a call to each one of us to treat each person we encounter every day with the dignity and respect that they deserve as a human being,"" says Williams.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/living-longer-free-of-heart-disease,"Living longer, free of heart disease?","Q.
          As a 78-year-old male, I have an estimated life expectancy of another nine years. Like most people my age, I would like to live longer and stronger. Because the CDC estimates that about a third of guys like me will die of heart disease, it seems that taking special care of my cardiovascular health could extend the quality and length of my life. But will I just be transferring my risk to other diseases that will end my life in roughly the same time frame?
        
        A. Thanks largely to advances in medical care — especially in the field of cardiology — the average life expectancy in the United States rose dramatically over the past few decades. In 1960, the average person lived 70 years, but by 2019, that number had risen to 79. Unfortunately, this upward trend slowed in recent years and the number began falling gradually, due to the rise in rates of diabetes and obesity, both of which are leading contributors to poor cardiovascular health. The dramatic death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic also reduced average life expectancy, which fell to 76 years in 2021.
        Ideal cardiovascular health is important at any age, especially when it comes to avoiding strokes, which are often debilitating. As such, prevention remains an important strategy even for people in their 70s and 80s. For the most part, the advice is similar to that for younger people. Lifestyle habits, such as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet that includes lots of plant-based foods, and getting sufficient sleep (at least seven hours a night) should be the central focus. And even for people in their 80s, there's a clear benefit to treating high blood pressure, elevated LDL cholesterol, and diabetes to lower their risk of heart problems. Avoiding having a heart attack, especially at the age of 80 of older, is a good thing in itself; you avoid the need for hospitalization, procedures, cardiac rehabilitation, and many new medications.
        Here's the good news: research suggests that people who follow those heart-healthy recommendations also appear to have a lower risk of developing cancer. The opposite is also true: people with risk factors for heart disease — especially heart attack survivors — may have a higher risk of developing cancer.
        And keep this in mind: what's good for your heart is also good for your brain. Taking steps to dodge heart disease also seems to help prevent dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, currently the seventh leading cause of death in this country.
        Of course, there's no guarantee that these or other diseases won't occur as you age. Still, shifting the cause of death away from heart disease will likely improve your longevity — maybe enabling you to reach 100!

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/does-coffee-help-or-harm-your-heart,Does coffee help or harm your heart?,"Many people can't imagine starting their day without a cup or two of coffee. Despite its popularity, however, coffee has been a bit controversial when it comes to heart health.
        ""The thinking about coffee's effects on the heart has swung in both directions,"" says Dr. J. Michael Gaziano, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. In the 1960s, coffee was considered a risk factor for coronary artery disease, although later research suggested that only heavy coffee consumption (more than five or six cups a day) might harm the heart. But people who drink excessive amounts of coffee often differ in many other ways from those who enjoy modest amounts, Dr. Gaziano notes.
        A java jolt?
        Because coffee contains caffeine, a stimulant, people have long wondered whether drinking coffee might ""jazz up"" the heart, triggering palpitations (the odd sensation of a skipped, missed, or strong heartbeat) or atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm problem marked by a rapid, irregular heartbeat).
        However, people who drink moderate amounts of coffee (one to three cups per day) actually appear to have a lower risk of atrial fibrillation, according to a 2019 study co-authored by Dr. Gaziano. Those who drank either more or less coffee were no more or less likely to develop atrial fibrillation, the study found.
        Like a lot of dietary research, that study was observational: people reported what they consumed and researchers tracked their health over many years. But a new study took a different approach — it directly measured the short-term effects of drinking coffee (see ""The coffee connection: More steps, less sleep, possible palpitations?"").
        
          
            
              
                The coffee connection: More steps, less sleep, possible palpitations?
                Many coffee drinkers appreciate the energizing buzz from a morning cup of joe. But does that boost have any short-term effects on the heart or other heart-related behaviors or risk factors — namely, exercise, sleep, and blood sugar levels?
                To find out, researchers put wearable sensors on volunteers for a two-week period. Their study, the Coffee and Real-time Atrial and Ventricular Ectopy (CRAVE) trial, was published March 23, 2023, in The New England Journal of Medicine. (Atrial and ventricular ectopy refers to premature contractions of the heart's upper or lower chambers. People typically experience these as strong, fast, or irregular heartbeats, known as palpitations.)
                Who: 100 healthy men and women, average age 39.
                What: Participants wore three separate devices: one that tracked activity levels and sleep, one that measured blood sugar, and one that monitored heart rhythm. They were also tested for common genetic variants that affect how quickly people metabolize caffeine.
                How: Researchers directed participants to drink as much caffeinated coffee as they wanted for two days and to activate the heart monitor after every cup they drank. They were then to abstain from coffee for two days. They repeated this cycle for 14 days.
                Key findings: On the days people drank coffee, they took an average of 1,000 extra steps per day. But they slept about 36 fewer minutes per night, on average. Coffee drinking had no apparent effect on blood sugar levels. And while coffee consumption did not increase premature atrial contractions, it did appear to slightly increase the incidence of premature ventricular contractions. Genetic differences in caffeine metabolism had no meaningful effects on any of these outcomes.
              
            
          
        
        Steps and sleep
        ""This new trial provides an important piece of the puzzle,"" says Dr. Gaziano. One finding — that people took more steps on coffee-drinking days — upholds other research showing that caffeine can slightly enhance physical performance. On the other hand, caffeine's adverse effects on sleep are also well known, and insufficient sleep is increasingly recognized as a risk to cardiovascular health.
        It's hard to know whether the extra exercise balances out the decreased shut-eye people may get from drinking coffee. Most people know how they react to coffee and adjust their intake accordingly, says Dr. Gaziano, who enjoys a daily cup that contains half decaffeinated coffee.
        Limitations of the study
        But like all studies, the new study has limitations. For instance, it included only relatively young, healthy coffee drinkers. So the findings may not apply to older people, who tend to be more likely to have palpitations. In fact, people who avoid coffee (and so weren't part of the study) may avoid the beverage because they notice it triggers palpitations.
        Other heart-related effects
        The study also discovered that drinking coffee led to a slight increase in premature ventricular contractions. These brief rhythm disruptions (which can feel as though the heart is pounding or flip-flopping) are common and usually harmless, especially in healthy people. However, people with heart disease who notice persistent, odd heart rhythms should talk to their doctor.
        Earlier research has investigated coffee's effects on other common heart-related risks. Although drinking coffee raises blood pressure, the effect is temporary and doesn't make you more likely to develop high blood pressure; it may even lower your risk. Unfiltered coffee, such as French press coffee and espresso, contains compounds that may raise harmful LDL cholesterol. But the effect is likely trivial compared with the rest of your diet, especially if you drink no more than two cups of unfiltered coffee daily.
        ""The question I have is, what is the overall impact on the outcome I care most about, which is cardiovascular disease?"" says Dr. Gaziano. When you look at the evidence as a whole, coffee doesn't seem to have a positive or negative effect, he says. If you like coffee, enjoy up to a few cups per day — as long as it's not interfering with your sleep. And don't dump a lot of cream and sugar into your coffee, since that adds saturated fat and empty calories, he adds.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/screening-advice-thats-not-just-skin-deep,Screening advice that's not just skin deep,"After decades of public service campaigns, the message has clearly sunk in: melanoma kills. Awareness about the deadliest skin cancer — which claims 8,000 lives each year — has soared over the past two decades.
        But now there's a new bulletin to absorb. Contrary to popular wisdom, the vast majority of people don't need to see a dermatologist each year to check for the malignancy. Skin checks every two to three years are sufficient for 80% of us, says Dr. Katherine Brag, a dermatologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Many dermatologists are flooded by calls from ""worried well"" patients who request annual skin exams they don't need, Dr. Brag says. They've paid attention to statistics indicating that melanoma is diagnosed in 200,000 Americans each year, with rates doubling between 1982 and 2011. An estimated one in 40 women will develop melanoma in her lifetime, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.
        ""Everyone is understandably afraid of melanoma. Even though it represents only a small fraction of diagnosed skin cancers, it accounts for more than 70% of deaths,"" Dr. Brag says. ""It's hugely concerning — and deservedly so. But most people who get a skin check get a perfectly clean bill of health.""
        
          
            
              
                Watch for these melanoma signs
                Most melanoma lesions are found by the patient or a partner, not by a doctor. Staying vigilant is as easy as remembering the alphabet. Look for these features in body moles and see your dermatologist immediately if you notice any.
                A = Asymmetry or irregular shape.
                B = Borders that are uneven.
                C = Colors that vary within the same mole.
                D = Diameter that's larger than the width of a pencil eraser.
                E = Evolution or change over time in size, shape, or color.
              
            
          
        
        The case against hypervigilance
        Much research reinforces Dr. Brag's approach. In April 2023, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — which offers science-based recommendations about disease prevention — said there isn't enough evidence to support annual melanoma screenings for people with no symptoms who are at average risk for the disease. The benefits don't clearly outweigh the risks, which include unnecessary — and potentially disfiguring — biopsies, along with higher health care costs, the task force said.
        Additionally, most cases of melanoma aren't found during skin cancer screenings. More than half are self-detected — usually because they're bleeding — and women spot these cancers more often than men, according to a 2016 study in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.
        And deaths from melanoma don't drop when clinicians detect the malignancy during routine skin checks, either, according to a 2021 study in JAMA Dermatology. ""Screenings don't necessarily improve outcomes from melanoma itself, and that's the point of a screening,"" Dr. Brag says.
        Risk-increasing scenarios
        So who can benefit from a yearly skin exam? About 20% of people, who have any of the following risk factors:
        Dozens of atypical moles. Most of us have between 10 and 40 common moles, which are small, round, and smooth. Atypical moles tend to be larger, with irregular or blurred borders. If you've got several dozen, a yearly skin check is warranted, since there's a slight chance they can develop into melanoma.
        Family history of melanoma and atypical moles. If a first-degree relative such as a parent, sibling, or child has had melanoma or many atypical moles, your risk rises. ""When someone tells me her grandfather had melanoma at 89, that's different from telling me her mother had it at 40,"" Dr. Brag says. ""One is a function of age and many years of sun exposure, and the other may be more familial.""
        Previous skin cancer of any kind. Depending on how long ago you had a skin malignancy, this risk factor may warrant getting skin checks even more frequently, such as every three or six months. Ask your doctor.
        Genetic mutations or predisposition. People with BRCA gene mutations, a family history of certain inherited cancers, or dysplastic nevus syndrome (an inherited skin condition marked by unusual moles and melanomas) all face higher melanoma odds.
        Organ transplantation or inflammatory bowel disease. Both of these scenarios can involve taking immune-suppressing drugs that can increase patients' chances of developing skin cancer.
        History of blistering sunburns. Three sunburns before age 15 substantially increase your melanoma risks.
        Tanning bed use. Multiple tanning bed sessions—especially before age 20—dramatically increase melanoma risks.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/talk-therapy-for-depression-may-help-lower-heart-disease-risk,Talk therapy for depression may help lower heart disease risk,"People with depression have a higher risk for additional health problems. Does that mean that treating depression might protect these individuals from other chronic conditions? Researchers explored this question by looking at how psychotherapy (talk therapy) may affect a person's risk for cardiovascular disease. In psychotherapy, a person works with a therapist to discuss concerns, identify harmful thought patterns, and help manage negative behaviors and emotions. It's often used as a first-line treatment for depression. In the study, researchers looked at data on 636,955 people who were free of cardiovascular disease, met specific criteria for depression, and completed a course of psychotherapy. Three years later, patients whose depression symptoms improved after therapy were 12% less likely to have experienced a heart attack or stroke than those whose symptoms were unchanged.
        The researchers pointed out that improving depression symptoms with therapy does not directly affect cardiovascular disease risk. Instead, they theorized that therapy likely helped people make healthier lifestyle changes, such as adjusting their diet and exercising more, which in turn improved their heart health. The results appeared May 7, 2023, in the European Heart Journal.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/keep-midday-naps-to-less-than-30-minutes,Keep midday naps to less than 30 minutes,"The health benefits of taking afternoon naps are well documented. They can improve mood, reduce fatigue, and increase alertness. But how long should they last? A study in the May 2023 issue of Obesity suggested the ideal duration is less than 30 minutes.
        The observational study included 3,275 healthy adults. Baseline health measurements were taken, and participants completed a questionnaire on their napping habits and other lifestyle factors like diet and sleep. The results found that compared with people who did not nap, those who took midday naps lasting 30 minutes or longer had a higher body mass index and levels of cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure. By contrast, those who had shorter naps (less than 30 minutes) did not share these risks and were even less likely to have elevated blood pressure than those who never napped.
        According to the researchers, some of these risks may be the result of long naps disrupting daily circadian rhythms, which can lead to insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes). Another possible connection could be overeating, as many people who napped for longer than 30 minutes reported feeling hungry and craving sweet foods afterward.
        Does it matter how often you nap? All afternoon nappers, no matter how long they slept, averaged about four naps per week, but the researchers found no link between frequency and higher health risks. So, enjoy your afternoon naps, but keep them under 30 minutes, and don't nap too late in the afternoon, as it could interfere with your night's sleep.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/diet-and-prostate-cancer,Diet and prostate cancer,"A plant-based diet can help people lower their risk for heart disease and diabetes. But what about prostate cancer? Can this medically touted eating pattern protect you from the most common cancer among men?
        ""Unfortunately, there is no miracle prostate cancer diet,"" says Dr. Bradley McGregor, an oncologist with Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""But as we learn more about the role diet plays in disease prevention, there is growing evidence that plant-based diets may lower your risk of prostate cancer and even help slow its spread.""
        What the science says
        With some minor variations, the most studied plant-based diets — Mediterranean, MIND, and DASH — are similar. They emphasize eating plenty of fruits and vegetables (especially cruciferous vegetables), beans and legumes, whole grains, fatty fish, nuts and seeds, and olive oil while reducing the intake of red meat and processed foods. Plant-based diets also can include similar eating patterns, like vegetarian, vegan, and pescatarian (which adds sea-food to an otherwise vegetarian diet). So what does current science say about plant-based diets and prostate cancer? Let's begin with the overall risk.
        Much research supports the conclusion that following a plant-based diet is linked with a lower risk of cancer in general. Studies that have looked at only prostate cancer have been promising, too. For instance, a study published in the 2022 volume of BMC Medicine that involved more than 409,000 people found that compared with meat eaters, vegetarians and pescatarians had a 43% lower risk of prostate cancer over 10 years.
        If you have prostate cancer, can a plant-based diet help slow its growth? In a study published March 1, 2021, in the journal Cancer, 410 men on active surveillance for localized prostate cancer recorded their daily diets for three years. In those who ate more fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, and fish, the cancer was less likely to grow to the point of needing treatment.
        Another analysis of this connection — part of the ongoing CaPSURE Diet and Lifestyle Study — was presented in 2023. Approximately 2,000 men (average age 72) with early- to mid-grade prostate cancer periodically completed questionnaires about how much and how often they consumed 140 different foods. After about 7.5 years, those who reported diets with the highest amount of plant foods had a 52% lower risk of prostate cancer progression and a 53% lower risk of recurrence than those who ate the lowest amount of plant foods.
        However, other research has not been as supportive. For instance, a 2020 study in JAMA found that increasing vegetable intake did not lower the risk of prostate cancer progression in men on active surveillance.
        
          
            
              
                Planting the seeds for a better diet
                Many men find following a plant-based too strict. One way to overcome this barrier is to begin making small changes in your diet and build from there. For instance, focus only on replacing red meat with fish, add more vegetables to meals, and choose fruits and nuts for snacks instead of processed foods. To learn more about how to adopt a plant-based diet, visit /meddiet.
              
            
          
        
        Foods that fight cancer
        These contradictions arise because most diet-related research only shows an association rather than cause and effect, says Dr. McGregor. ""While the observational evidence for following a plant-based diet is strong, we can't be sure if certain foods or combinations are better than others, or even what specific amounts are ideal for managing prostate cancer.""
        Still, when researchers have looked at individual foods common in plant-based diets and their effect on prostate cancer, the results have been promising.
        For instance, large studies have found that men with moderate to high fish intake are less likely to develop prostate cancer or die from it than men who do not eat fish. The fish's high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, known to fight inflammation, are often cited as protective benefits. Studies also have found that carotenoids (compounds that occur naturally in certain plants) have antioxidant properties that may protect the body against unstable molecules that damage DNA and cause cancer cells to form.
        What you don't eat
        Another part of diet and prostate cancer is what you don't eat. ""Following a plant-based diet means you eat fewer processed foods, red meat, and foods high in cholesterol and saturated fat, all of which are linked to a higher risk of aggressive prostate cancers,"" says Dr. McGregor. ""You also probably consume fewer calories over all, which can help manage excess weight, another risk factor linked with prostate cancer.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/when-to-worry-about-your-memory,When to worry about your memory,"Ever had those ""senior moments""? You misplace your phone (which was just in your hand). You lose your train of thought during a conversation. You forget directions five minutes after being told. You can't remember the day, but then it pops into your head.
        These memory slips can be embarrassing and stressful, but are they normal mental lapses — or early signs of dementia?
        ""The brain is like any other part of the body, and over time, it may not function as well,"" says Ana Trueba Yepez, a psychologist with the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""Brain regions involved with memory — like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex — can shrink, which makes it more difficult to multitask, stay focused, and hold on to information.""
        The good news is that these kinds of memory lapses are not automatic red flags for dementia. ""These episodes can be alarming, but for the most part, they are not something to worry about,"" says Trueba Yepez.
        Look for warning signs
        Senior moments may come and go. It's when they become more frequent or severe or if new cognitive issues emerge that they may signal a problem.
        For example, during conversations, you now have difficulty following conversations. Or you cut off people when they talk or begin discussing something unrelated to the conversation. Another warning sign is when memory lapses begin to interfere with daily life. For instance, you miss scheduled appointments, forget to pay bills, or fail to take regular medication. You may also have difficulty making decisions and forget regular grooming.
        ""Many times, people are not aware that memory issues have worsened,"" says Trueba Yepez. ""If you suspect any changes, no matter how innocent, it's best to ask family or friends to look for and point out changes in your memory, with examples.""
        Still, even these changes are not an automatic indicator of dementia. Sometimes, other factors like diet, alcohol use, medication, and mental problems (such as depression and anxiety) affect your memory. ""Many times, these issues show up in other ways besides memory problems, such as eating more unhealthy foods, showing less interest in your favorite activities, and not keeping up with hygiene and personal appearance,"" says Trueba Yepez.
        
          
            
              
                Manage your memory with DANCERS
                Enhance your memory and protect against dementia with DANCERS:
                D: Disease management. Control your weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels.
                A: Activity. Cardio exercise improves oxygen and blood flow to the brain.
                N: Nutrition. Poor nutrition leads to poor brain health. Adopt a plant-based diet.
                C: Cognitive stimulation. The more you engage your brain, the more likely you can retain memory.
                E: Engagement. Social isolation is linked to lower cognitive function.
                R: Relaxation. Your brain needs downtime. Do relaxing activities like yoga, meditation, or reading.
                S: Sleep. Sleep is when your brain cleans out toxins. Get seven to nine hours of sleep per night.
              
            
          
        
        Seeking help
        A primary care doctor is your first point of contact if you, or someone else, suspects a problem. As scary as it may seem to confront changes in memory, there are many benefits to taking a proactive approach, including these:
        Ruling out other causes. A medical evaluation can help determine if symptoms are related to a condition, like depression, anxiety, or insomnia. Other factors also can affect memory, such as an infection, a new medication, or an unintended interaction between a prescription drug and an over-the-counter product. Addressing the underlying problem may lead to improved memory.
        Discovering a problem early. Memory issues could be related to a series of tiny strokes that produce only subtle symptoms, such as short episodes of confusion. In these episodes, small arteries in the brain become narrowed or clogged with fatty deposits, decreasing blood flow. ""The brain damage is often so small and subtle that most people don't notice it or shrug it off,"" says Trueba Yepez. It's important to spot this problem as early as possible to prevent it from progressing to a condition called vascular dementia. Certain medications, such as statins and low-dose aspirin, and lifestyle changes may help prevent further cognitive decline.
        Getting help sooner. If your doctor may refer you for a neuropsychological evaluation to assesses other cognitive skills, such as attention, executive function, and language. If you are diagnosed with early dementia, it's best to catch it sooner than later, so you can begin to manage the condition.

        The international study, published online April 5, 2023, by Neurology, involved nearly 4,500 people (average age 62). About half of the group had already experienced a stroke. Participants were asked about their sleep behaviors over the prior month, including how many hours they usually slept, impaired sleep quality, and napping habits, as well as snoring, snorting, and other breathing problems during sleep. Too little sleep was defined as less than five hours nightly, while too much sleep was defined as more than nine hours.
        Each of the sleep symptoms raised stroke risk, but participants who reported five or more symptoms were five times likelier to have had a stroke compared with those who had no sleep issues. The results held even after the researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect stroke risk, such as smoking, physical activity level, depression, and alcohol consumption. The results suggest sleep problems should be factored into stroke prevention efforts, the study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/9-gerd-symptoms-to-know,9 GERD symptoms to know,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic medical condition that occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus — the tube connecting the mouth and stomach. This usually happens because the ringlike muscles that prevent backflow don't work properly.
        Common symptoms of GERD
        Two of the most common symptoms of GERD are heartburn and regurgitation. Many people experience both symptoms. However, some people can experience one without the other.
        Heartburn
        Heartburn can feel like a sharp, painful burning in the upper abdomen or middle of the chest, behind the breastbone. This is the most common symptom of GERD, and can rise up from the lower tip of the breastbone toward your throat. Heartburn may be worse when you eat, bend over, or lie down.
        Regurgitation
        Regurgitation is the backflow of stomach contents through your esophagus and into your throat or mouth. This may cause you to taste food or stomach acid.
        Other symptoms of GERD
        While chronic heartburn and regurgitation are common symptoms of GERD, you may experience one or more less common symptoms of the disease. Not all adults with GERD experience heartburn or regurgitation.
        Other symptoms of GERD may include:
        
          
            nausea
          
          difficulty swallowing (food sticks going down) or pain while swallowing (as food goes down)
          recurring sour or bitter taste in the mouth
          chronic cough
          hoarseness
          sore throat
          chest pain, or tightness in your chest or upper abdomen that may wake you up in the middle of the night.
        
        What health conditions can be mistaken with GERD?
        Pain that feels like heartburn also can be a symptom of a heart attack. In fact, the classic symptom of both heartburn and heart disease is discomfort in the center of the chest.
        Of the over eight million emergency room visits for chest pain each year, severe heartburn (GERD) accounts for over half the cases in which actual heart problems are ruled out.
        While heartburn is more likely to appear after a large or spicy meal, heart attacks are more common after physical exertion or stress. But if you're unsure, seek medical help right away.
        When should I see a doctor about GERD?
        You should see a doctor if you think you have GERD, or if your symptoms don't get better with over-the-counter medicines such as antacids or lifestyle changes. By seeing your doctor early, the physical cause of GERD can be treated, and more serious problems avoided.
        Always see a doctor if you have symptoms that could indicate GERD complications or other serious health problems, such as:
        
          chest pain
          loss of appetite
          persistent vomiting
          problems swallowing or pain while swallowing
          signs of bleeding in the digestive tract, such as
	vomit that contains blood or looks like coffee groundsstool that contains blood or looks black and tarry
          unexplained weight loss.
        
        If you think you may be having a heart attack, go to the emergency room.
        Up to 20% of the US population has GERD. GERD is more common among older adults, obese persons, and pregnant women.",Jenette Restivo,"July 31, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/gerd-diet-foods-to-avoid-to-reduce-acid-reflux,GERD diet: Foods to avoid to reduce acid reflux,"One of the most effective lifestyle changes you can make to prevent the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is to ensure your diet and eating habits do not trigger symptoms.
        Foods to avoid for GERD
        While people with acid reflux were once instructed to stick to bland foods, that's no longer the case. There are many healthy and delicious foods you can eat if you have GERD, as well as many interesting ways to prepare them.
        Still, some foods are more likely to trigger reflux and heartburn. Reflux-triggering foods include:
        
          Fatty and fried foods, which linger longer in the stomach, making it more likely that stomach acid leaks back up into the esophagus, causing uncomfortable GERD symptoms.
          Spicy foods, citrus, tomato sauces, and vinegar, which may intensify heartburn.
          Chocolate, caffeine, onions, peppermint, carbonated drinks, and alcohol, which are all common heartburn triggers.
        
        If you eat any of these foods regularly, try eliminating them to see if doing so reduces your reflux. Then you can try adding them back one by one.
        Best foods for GERD
        When making food choices, some foods have been found to be less reflux-triggering. The following foods may help you ease or avoid symptoms.
        
          Non-citrus fruits. While you should avoid citrus fruits, you can enjoy non-citrus fruits such as bananas, melons, apples, and pears, among others.
          Vegetables. Try to eat your vegetables raw. While tomato sauce may bother you, a fresh tomato may not.
          Lean meats. Lean meats that are grilled, poached, broiled, or baked are your best options. Try using fresh herbs, rather than spices, to make them flavorful.
          Oatmeal, whole-grain bread, rice, and couscous. These are all good sources of healthy complex carbs and fiber.
          Unsaturated fats from plants and fish. Replace saturated fats and trans fats with oils such as olive, sesame, canola, sunflower, and safflower; avocados; nuts and seeds; soybean; and fatty fish such as salmon and trout.
        
        Best GERD eating habits
        Besides specific types of foods, changes to eating habits can also help to prevent repeated bouts of heartburn and acid reflux.
        
          Eat smaller, more frequent meals.
          Do not lie down after eating. This means no naps right after lunch. When you're standing or sitting, gravity helps keeps acid in the stomach, where it belongs.
          Do not eat during the three to four hours before you go to bed. So, no late suppers or midnight snacks.
          Avoid vigorous exercise for a couple of hours after eating. A strenuous workout can send acid into your esophagus.
          If you're taking medication to help control your symptoms, it's probably okay to have a ""trigger"" food occasionally. But you should generally avoid foods that once caused heartburn.",Jenette Restivo,"July 31, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/exercise-and-your-arteries,Exercise and your arteries,"More than 300 years ago, the great English physician Thomas Sydenham observed, ""A man is as old as his arteries."" It's as true today as it was then. And in a 21st-century update on 17th-century wisdom, we might add that your health is only as good as your arteries, since these blood vessels carry vital oxygen-rich blood to all your body's tissues.
        Today we also know that regular exercise is one of the best ways to maintain artery health.
        Your arteries
        Doctors used to think of arteries as passive conduits for blood, working for your body the way a garden hose works for your lawn. Wrong! In fact, arteries are complex structures with crucial regulatory functions, and they are in the front line of the battle for cardiovascular health.
        Every artery has three layers in its wall. The inner layer, or intima, is composed of a thin layer of endothelial cells that are in direct contact with the bloodstream. The middle layer, or media, is composed chiefly of smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers. The outermost layer, or adventitia, is made up of supporting tissues that are dense and strong in larger arteries but nearly absent in the delicate blood vessels of the brain.
        Endothelial cells have a crucial role in vascular health, and exercise has an important effect on endothelial cells. If all the endothelial cells in your body were placed side by side, they would cover a football field; together, they weigh more than three pounds.
        Among other things, endothelial cells produce a molecule called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has two crucial functions. It keeps the arterial lining smooth and slippery, preventing white blood cells and platelets from latching on and causing damaging inflammation and artery-blocking blood clots. In addition, it relaxes the smooth muscle cells of the artery wall's middle layer, preventing spasms and keeping arteries open.
        Movement improves artery health
        Exercising muscles need more blood. And in response to regular exercise, they actually grow more blood vessels by expanding the network of capillaries. In turn, muscle cells boost levels of the enzymes that allow them to use oxygen to generate energy. More oxygen-rich blood and more efficient metabolism: It's the formula that explains why people who exercise regularly enhance their endurance and strength.
        To find out if exercise can affect arterial aging, scientists in Italy studied four groups of healthy people: young exercisers, young non-exercisers, elderly exercisers, and elderly non-exercisers. Comparing sedentary youths with sedentary senior citizens, they found that age took a substantial toll on endothelial function and nitric oxide production. But in people who exercised regularly, age had a much smaller effect; endothelial function still declined over the years, but there was a much smaller and more gradual drop in nitric oxide production. Indeed, exercise helped keep arteries young.
        The Italian researchers studied people who biked, ran, or swam at very high levels. But you don't have to be a triathlete to help your arteries stay young; just 2–3 miles of brisk walking nearly every day is a giant step in the right direction.
        And it's never too late to start. Scientists from the University of Colorado enrolled 20 sedentary men with an average age of 53 in an exercise program that consisted primarily of walking. At the end of three months, the men had improved their endothelial function so much that they achieved results similar to those of middle-aged and older men who had exercised for years. True, the Colorado volunteers were all healthy, but similar studies of patients with coronary artery disease have demonstrated that exercise can produce important gains in endothelial function, even in people who already have atherosclerosis.",Unknown,"July 31, 2023"

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/5-causes-of-sciatica,5 causes of sciatica,"Sciatica isn't actually a health condition; it's a symptom, and a misnamed one at that. Sciatica refers to the symptoms of buttock, thigh, and leg pain, but it can arise from a variety of causes. Sciatica gets its name from the sciatic nerve, the body's largest. There's one sciatic nerve on either side of the body. Each nerve extends through the buttock and down the leg into the foot and toes. Yet the most common causes of sciatica don't involve direct injury to a sciatic nerve itself, but rather to the nerves higher in the spine that join to form the sciatic nerve.
        The right treatment for sciatica depends on the cause, such as a herniated disc, injury, or a pinched sciatic nerve in the buttocks. Sciatica can also happen in late pregnancy as ligaments get looser and the growing baby puts indirect pressure on the sciatic nerve.
        
          For most people, home treatment may be all you need. Even if you don't know what's causing your sciatica, you can take steps to relieve your pain at home. For example:
        
        
          Move. A few days of rest is okay but ideally you want to move as much as you can as soon as you can. If moving seems to make the pain worse, it's best to see a doctor and talk through what's going on.
          Ice and heat. Ice is helpful for the first week. After that applying heat can help.
          Over-the-counter pain relievers: Don't take more than the recommended dose.
        
        
          Although most sciatica gets better on its own, it's sometimes prudent to visit the doctor to make sure your pain doesn't have a more serious cause. An office visit is in order if
        
        
          you are under age 20 or older than 55 and having sciatica for the first time
          your symptoms are severe
          you have weakness in a leg or foot
          you have a fever in addition to your pain.
          you have a history of cancer

However, today we are increasingly realizing that different systems of the body are interconnected and cannot be completely understood in isolation. The brain-gut connection is one very important example of this phenomenon.
        Anatomy of the brain-gut connection
        What exactly is the connection between brain and gut? The brain sends signals to the digestive, or gastrointestinal (GI), tract via the sympathetic (""fight or flight"") nervous system and the parasympathetic (""rest and digest"") nervous system. The balance of signals from these two inputs can affect the speed at which food moves through the digestive system, absorption of nutrients, secretion of digestive juices, and level of inflammation in the digestive system.
        The digestive system also has its own nervous system, the enteric nervous system, consisting of approximately 100 million nerve cells in and around the GI tract. The enteric nervous system receives inputs from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems but can also function independently of them.
        The enteric nervous system is also intimately interconnected with millions of immune cells. These cells survey the digestive system and convey information, such as whether the stomach is bloated or whether there is infection in the GI tract or insufficient blood flow, back to the brain. Thus, the brain and GI system communicate with one another in both directions.
        Effects of stress and negative emotions on the gut
        Because of this strong brain-gut connection, stress and a variety of negative emotions such as anxiety, sadness, depression, fear, and anger can all affect the GI system. These triggers can speed up or slow down the movements of the GI tract and the contents within it; make the digestive system overly sensitive to bloating and other pain signals; make it easier for bacteria to cross the gut lining and activate the immune system; increase inflammation in the gut; and change the gut microbiota (the types of bacteria that reside in the gut). That's why stress and strong emotions can contribute to or worsen a variety of GI conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and food allergies and sensitivities.
        The negative changes in the GI system can then feed back on the brain, creating a vicious cycle. For example, new research is demonstrating that increased gut inflammation and changes in the gut microbiome can have profound effects throughout the body and contribute to fatigue, cardiovascular disease, and depression.
        Mind-body approaches to GI ailments
        Given this strong mind-body/brain-gut connection, it should come as no surprise that mind-body tools such as meditation, mindfulness, breathing exercises, yoga, and gut-directed hypnotherapy have all been shown to help improve GI symptoms, improve mood, and decrease anxiety. They decrease the body's stress response by dampening the sympathetic nervous system, enhancing the parasympathetic response, and decreasing inflammation.
        Other integrative approaches
        We've also learned that certain kinds of foods can trigger specific reactions in the gut of sensitive individuals. In those cases, specific diets, such as low-FODMAP for IBS or avoiding acidic foods for GERD, can be helpful for managing symptoms. Diet also profoundly affects the gut microbiome. For example, eating a more plant-based diet with few refined carbohydrates and little or no red meat often leads to a healthier microbiome. These dietary changes in turn reduce intestinal inflammation and may help reduce systemic symptoms such as fatigue or depression and the risk of cardiovascular disease.
        Although each person's situation is unique, a combination of integrative approaches can be helpful for reducing GI symptoms and reestablishing both a healthy gut and a healthy mind.","Michelle Dossett, MD, PhD, MPH","July 26, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/treating-constipation-with-biofeedback-for-the-pelvic-floor-2019051616638,Treating constipation with biofeedback for the pelvic floor,"Constipation is often clinically defined as having three or fewer bowel movements a week. Sometimes this is about expectations; people generally feel like they're not ""healthy"" if they don't have a bowel movement every day. But three bowel movements a week can be normal for some people, especially if that has been their pattern for a long time.
        There are many other factors that affect how people perceive bowel movements. According to the Rome IV criteria of constipation often used in research, frequency alone doesn't explain all complaints of constipation. Patients complaining of two or more of the following also qualify for a diagnosis of constipation:
        
          feelings of incompletely evacuating (not getting everything out)
          straining
          lumpy or hard consistency of the stool
          sensation of blockage
          using a finger to dislodge the stool.
        
        When constipation is a problem, there are two main reasons for it: slow movement of the colon and pelvic floor dysfunction. Treatment for slowed movement of the colon is usually laxatives and drugs to move your colon. But getting your pelvic floor evaluated is worthwhile, because a diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunction typically involves nondrug treatment.
        Pelvic floor dysfunction
        The pelvic floor is a muscular bowl that encompasses the rectum, bladder, and (for women) the uterus. There is a complex interaction among these different organs. In the act of defecating, or having a bowel movement, the anal sphincter (the group of muscles at the end of the rectum) has to relax, and the abdominal muscles need to contract.
        A common analogy I give is that it's like getting toothpaste out of a tube. When you want the toothpaste to come out, you loosen the cap and press on the tube. However, if you leave the cap on or even tighten it, pressing is not going to get the toothpaste out. In the same way, some people who have constipation fail to relax, or actually tighten, their anal sphincter, while using their abdominal muscles to contract the colon when they are trying to defecate. This leads to feelings of incompletely evacuating; hard, small stools; or even feeling like you have to use your finger to get the stool out.
        These uncoordinated pelvic floor dynamics are usually diagnosed with a test called anorectal manometry, which uses a thin tube to measure pressures, sensations, and reflexes in the rectum and anal sphincter.
        Biofeedback-based physical therapy to treat pelvic floor dysfunction
        The good news is that treatment typically does not involve medications. Instead, treatment involves physical therapy in the form of biofeedback. Currently, the best way to undergo physical therapy is in a private setting, with the help of a trained physical therapist who coaches you on the dynamics of defecating. During these sessions, the physical therapist inserts a probe into your anal sphincter and places sticky pads on your abdomen, to detect the movement of your anal sphincter and abdominal wall as you simulate defecation.
        By doing this, you receive feedback (either visual or verbal) on what you are doing with your abdominal wall muscles and anal sphincter during a bowel movement. The physical therapist will lead you through breathing exercises, as well as muscle strengthening and relaxation exercises, in order to help you retrain the movement and coordination of your pelvic floor.
        There are currently no devices available for at-home training, but such devices are undergoing research and development.
        The physical therapist will also discuss dietary recommendations including increased water and fiber consumption, positioning techniques (like using a Squatty Potty), or massaging your abdomen to stimulate the gut.
        The usual time commitment is about four to eight sessions, one session a week. Like physical therapy for your shoulder or your back, learning what you have done in physical therapy takes time and also practice at home. Some people understand and incorporate these techniques right away, and others take more time and practice.
        Retraining your body to change the way you have a bowel movement takes time. But it could potentially help with all of the symptoms of constipation.","Judy Nee, MD","July 26, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/hemorrhoid-help-preventing-and-treating-flare-ups,Hemorrhoid help: preventing and treating flare-ups,"The best way to keep hemorrhoid flare-ups at bay is to maintain healthy lifestyle habits. Preventing constipation is key. Make sure your diet always includes enough fiber to promote healthy bowel movements, and be mindful about staying well hydrated. If you need help with your water intake, keep a water bottle by your side at all times as a reminder to drink. Jazz up your water with a slice of lemon, lime, or orange.
        Also, regular exercise supports good bowel function, so if you do not exercise on a regular basis, this is a good time to begin. Don't try to immediately reach the goal of at least 150 minutes per week of exercise. Begin with short periods of walking. Over time, you can increase your speed and duration of activity. Get your doctor's okay if you have any reservations about exercising or you plan to begin a vigorous routine.
        There are other simple, everyday habits you can develop to help with relief when a hemorrhoid flare-up arises. For example:
        Less strain, more gain. Don't delay bowel movements during flareups. Always go when you feel the urge, as putting off bowel movements can cause stool to back up, leading to increased pressure and straining, which aggravates your hemorrhoids. Also, try not to sit on the toilet for long periods; this tends to make hemorrhoids push out and swell up. A way to make going to the bathroom easier—and faster—is to elevate your feet with a step stool as you sit on the toilet. This changes the position of the rectum in a way that could allow for easier passage of stools.
        Keep the area clean. After every bowel movement, clean the anal area with a witch hazel pad, a soothing baby wipe, or a cotton cloth soaked in warm water. Be thorough but gentle. Aggressive rubbing and scrubbing, especially with soaps or other skin cleansers, can irritate the skin and make your hemorrhoids worse. Applying petroleum jelly or aloe vera gel to the anal area can soothe irritation after a bowel movement.
        Take a soft seat. Sitting on a cushion rather than a hard surface helps reduce the swelling of existing hemorrhoids and prevents the formation of new ones.",Unknown,"July 26, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/take-control-of-your-heartburn,Take control of your heartburn,"A muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) separates the esophagus from the stomach. Normally, the LES works something like a gate. The muscle relaxes when you swallow, opening the passage between the esophagus and stomach and allowing food to pass into the stomach. When the sphincter tightens, it closes the passage, keeping food and acidic stomach juices from flowing back into the esophagus. In people with acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD), the LES relaxes when it shouldn't or becomes weak and doesn't close tightly. Either problem allows the contents of the stomach to rise up into the esophagus. The LES is controlled by various nerves and hormones. As a result, foods, drugs, and certain emotions such as anxiety or anger can impair its function, causing or worsening acid reflux. The following factors are under your power to change:
        
          Certain foods. Coffee, tea, cocoa, cola drinks, and other caffeine-containing products loosen the LES and stimulate gastric acid production. Mints and chocolate, often served to cap off a meal, can make things worse by relaxing the LES. Fried and fatty foods contribute to heartburn. Some people say that onions and garlic give them heartburn. Others have trouble with citrus fruits or tomato products, which irritate the esophageal lining. 
          Eating patterns. How you eat can be as important as what you eat. Skipping breakfast or lunch and then consuming a huge meal at day's end can increase pressure in the stomach and the possibility of reflux. Lying down soon after eating will make the problem worse.
          Smoking. Smoking can irritate the entire gastrointestinal tract. In addition, frequent sucking on a cigarette can cause you to swallow air. This increases pressure inside the stomach, which encourages reflux. Smoking can also relax the LES.
          Overweight and obesity. Being overweight or obese increases the odds of having GERD and experiencing heartburn. Actually, any weight gain increases the risk of frequent GERD symptoms. In addition, eating larger meals distends the stomach, pushes the contents up toward the esophagus and loosens the LES.
          Certain medications. Some prescription drugs can add to the woes of heartburn. Oral contraceptives or postmenopausal hormone preparations containing progesterone are known culprits. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) can irritate the stomach lining. Other drugs—such as alendronate (Fosamax), used to prevent and treat osteoporosis—can irritate the esophagus. And some antidepressants, bronchodilators, tranquilizers, and calcium-channel blockers can contribute to reflux by relaxing the LES.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/living-with-lactose-intolerance,Living with lactose intolerance,"Food intolerance and food allergies often produce similar symptoms, but they're not the same. If dairy products leave you feeling gassy and bloated or cause diarrhea or nausea, you may have either condition.
        What's the difference? A dairy allergy is an immune system response to milk protein. In addition to feeling bloated or causing diarrhea, symptoms of a dairy allergy can include hives, wheezing, vomiting, cramps, and skin rashes. Dairy intolerance results from inadequate levels of lactase, the enzyme that breaks down milk sugar. While lactose intolerance can cause a lot of discomfort, it isn't life threatening, while a milk allergy can be.
        The severity of lactose intolerance varies. For some people, consuming any dairy product causes their digestive tracts to rebel. Others can enjoy yogurt, ice cream, or even an occasional glass of milk.
        The most successful approach to coping with lactose intolerance is to first avoid all dairy products. If you are lactose intolerant and love milk in all its forms, try experimenting with small amounts of dairy. In general, yogurt, cheese, and sour cream may be easier to tolerate because they contain less lactose than milk. However, several studies suggest that many people who are lactose intolerant can consume the equivalent of eight ounces of milk with no ill effects, and somewhat more when the lactose-containing food is part of a meal.
        Supplements containing enzymes produced by lactose-digesting bacteria (Lactaid, Lactrase, others) can be taken as tablets or added to foods. Some milk products (Lactaid) to which lactase has been added may contain little or no lactose, and they may taste sweeter than untreated products, because the milk sugar has already been broken down. 
        The response to these products is highly individual. What works for your will depend on the amount of lactase your body produces, the type of intestinal bacteria that inhabit your colon, and the product itself. Finding the right approach for you can be a trial-and-error process. While this may take some time and expense, experimenting isn't likely to be harmful.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/11-stomach-soothing-steps-for-heartburn,11 stomach-soothing steps for heartburn,"Heartburn, that uncomfortable burning sensation that radiates up the middle of the chest, is the most common digestive malady. It's the result of a condition known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), often called acid reflux, in which stomach acid leaks upward from the stomach into the esophagus.
        While heartburn should not be ignored, there are many stomach-soothing steps you can try before going to a doctor. These can help cool your symptoms and prevent bigger problems later on. 
        
          Eat smaller meals, but more often. A full stomach puts pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a valve-like muscle that keeps stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus.
          Eat in a slow, relaxed manner. Wolfing down your food fills your stomach faster, putting more pressure on the LES.
          Remain upright after meals. Lying down increases pressure on the LES, which makes acid reflux more likely.
          Avoid late-night eating. Eating a meal or snack within three hours of lying down to sleep can worsen reflux and heartburn symptoms. Leave enough time for the stomach to clear out.
          Don't exercise immediately after meals. Give your stomach time to empty; wait a couple of hours after eating before exercising.
          Tilt your torso with a bed wedge. Raising your torso up a bit with a wedge-shaped cushion reduces the pressure on the LES and may ease nighttime heartburn. Wedges are available from medical supply companies. Don't just prop your head and shoulders up with pillows, which can actually worsen reflux.
          Stay away from carbonated beverages. They cause belching, which promotes reflux of stomach acid.
          Find the foods that trigger your symptoms and avoid them. Some foods and drinks increase acid secretion, delay stomach emptying, or loosen the LES — conditions that set the stage for heartburn. Common offenders include fatty foods, spicy foods, tomatoes, garlic, milk, coffee, tea, cola, peppermint, and chocolate.
          Chew sugarless gum after a meal. Chewing gum promotes salivation, which neutralizes acid, soothes the esophagus, and washes acid back down to the stomach. Avoid peppermint flavors, which may trigger heartburn.
          Check your medications. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of the medications you take could worsen acid reflux or inflame the esophagus. For example, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline loosen the LES and tetracyclines such as doxycycline can cause esophageal inflammation.
          Lose weight if you need to. Being overweight puts more pressure on the stomach (and the LES).
        
        If changing your eating habits and other preventive steps don't get heartburn under control, talk with your doctor. He or she can advise you on which medications to try and recommend additional follow up if necessary.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-a-multivitamin-improve-your-memory-202307242957,Can a multivitamin improve your memory?,"We're bombarded with advertisements that tout all sorts of health benefits for vitamins and supplements, including improved memory. A May 2023 study of older adults suggests that a daily multivitamin can do just that — improve your memory enough such that it can function as if you were three years younger.
        So, should you take that daily multivitamin? Let's take a close look at the study.
        Who took part in this multivitamin study?
        This research is part of a larger study examining the effects of a multivitamin and/or cocoa (the main ingredient in chocolate) on cardiovascular and cancer outcomes. A prior sub-study found that a daily multivitamin improved thinking and memory — at least when evaluated with cognitive testing completed by phone.
        For this study, 3,562 participants were willing and able to perform some tests of thinking and memory on a home computer. Half received a multivitamin; the other half received a placebo.
        The participants identified as 93% white, 2.5% African American, and 1.4% Hispanic, so the results may not be generalizable. They were also well educated: more than half had completed college. In both groups, the average age was 71.
        How did the researchers test memory?
        The investigators evaluated the participants' thinking and memory at baseline and after one, two, and three years.
        For the memory test, participants were asked to memorize 20 words shown consecutively on a computer screen. Immediately after viewing these words, they had to type in as many words as they could remember (this was the primary measure of memory). Fifteen minutes later, they also typed in all the words they recalled (a secondary measure of memory).
        Other secondary measures included:
        
          a novel object discrimination test (is this object the same or different from one recently shown?)
          an executive control test (in an array of nine arrows, is the central arrow red or blue?).
        
        The participants repeated all of the tests one, two, and three years later.
        What were the results of this study?
        The two groups differed in immediate recall at year one:
        
          Those who took a placebo went from immediately recalling an average of 7.21 words at baseline to 7.65 words (a difference of 0.43 words)
          Those who took a daily multivitamin group went from 7.10 words at baseline to 7.81 words (a difference of 0.70 words).
        
        This result was statistically significant. Additionally, these small effects held up at years two and three. By year three, the placebo group immediately recalled an average of 8.17 words and the multivitamin group immediately recalled 8.28 words.
        No differences occurred between the two groups on secondary memory and executive function tests.
        How can a multivitamin improve memory?
        The authors note that low levels of vitamins B12 and D have been linked to cognitive decline and dementia. In a subset of participants who had their blood drawn, the levels of these vitamins did rise in the multivitamin group.
        It seems plausible that a few of the 3,562 participants had low levels of these or other vitamins that are important for thinking and memory. In the placebo group, the few who had vitamin deficiencies would likely show less improvement in memory after their baseline tests, or a small decline. By contrast, those few participants in the multivitamin group with deficiencies would have them corrected by the supplements and, therefore, would perform relatively better.
        Although this is just speculation, it would explain the small but seemingly real results — results that replicate the researchers' prior study, which used a telephone cognitive test to show thinking and memory benefit from a daily multivitamin.
        It's also worth noting that practice on memory tasks — the so-called practice effect — could contribute to small improvements shown from baseline to year one and year three.
        Should you take a multivitamin to improve your memory?
        The authors admitted that the effect of the multivitamin on immediate memory was small and may not be noticeable. However, they pointed out that this small effect could be important at the level of an entire population.
        My opinion? You shouldn't bother taking a multivitamin to try to improve your immediate recall of 20 words from 8.17 to 8.28 words. But it is worth speaking with your doctor about whether you could have a vitamin deficiency in B1, B6, B12, D, or any other important vitamins. I see several patients in my clinic every week who have startlingly low levels of vitamin D and B12. Your doctor may want to measure these levels. Or they may suggest simply taking a multivitamin daily.
        If, after reading this article, you've decided to take a multivitamin, please check with your doctor or pharmacist about which one would be best for you. Make sure that they review any other vitamins, supplements, and medications you take to avoid rare but serious interactions.","Andrew E. Budson, MD","July 24, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/understanding-triglycerides,Understanding triglycerides,"Q.
          I just got the results of my lipid profile. My cholesterol is high, but so are my triglycerides. What exactly are triglycerides, and how are they different from cholesterol?
        
        A. Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in the bloodstream. They consist of three fatty acid chains linked by a molecule called glycerol.
        When you eat food, enzymes in your gut break down fats into their component fatty acids, which are then reassembled to create triglyceride particles. These fatty particles can't move freely through the watery bloodstream. So they combine with cholesterol and protein to form lipoproteins. Your lipid profile lists two of these lipoproteins: low-density lipoprotein (better known as LDL cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (also called HDL cholesterol).
        But there are actually several other types of lipoproteins, including some that contain mainly triglycerides. Triglycerides can provide energy to fuel your body, while the extras are deposited in fat tissue. After a very heavy, fatty meal, your bloodstream may contain so many triglyceride particles that a blood sample may have a milky tint. But within a few hours, they're mostly cleared out. When you need energy between meals, hormones release the stored triglycerides into the bloodstream.
        Your liver also converts carbohydrates into triglycerides. When you eat extra calories — especially from carbohydrate-rich foods such as sweets and white bread — your liver churns out extra triglycerides. Other things that can raise blood levels of triglycerides include being overweight or obese, smoking, or heavy drinking. Certain medical conditions —including diseases affecting the liver, kidneys, or thyroid, and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes — can also lead to high triglycerides.
        For healthy adults, normal triglyceride levels are under 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Values of 151 to 200 mg/dL are considered borderline high; those 201 to 499 are high, and those 500 and higher are very high (and increase the risk of inflammation of the pancreas gland, called pancreatitis). Growing evidence suggests that above-normal triglyceride levels can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease independent of cholesterol levels.
        To get your triglycerides back into a normal range, start with lifestyle changes. Aim for a healthy weight, get regular exercise, and eat more whole, unprocessed grains. Eat fewer refined carbohydrates, and cut back on saturated fat from meat. Ideally it's best to avoid alcohol, but at the minimum, limit it to no more than one drink on any given day.

Located within the left side of the heart, the mitral valve opens to allow oxygen-rich blood from the upper chamber (atrium) to flow down into the lower chamber (ventricle). After the powerful left ventricle contracts, the two leaflets of the mitral valve snap shut, preventing blood from flowing backward into the left atrium.",Unknown,"July 24, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/looking-for-a-mellow-form-of-exercise-try-tai-chi,Looking for a mellow form of exercise? Try tai chi,"This ancient Chinese practice may help lower blood pressure and offer other heart-related benefits.
        
        
          
        
        Tai chi is a slow, flowing form of exercise that's sometimes described as ""meditation in motion."" The practice involves a series of choreographed moves with evocative descriptions, such as ""grasp the sparrow's tail"" or ""wave hands like clouds."" As your body moves, your mind has to focus. But tai chi also encourages relaxation, which helps ease stress.
        Those features are all important aspects of mind-body therapies, many of which seem to benefit heart health, says Dr. Gloria Yeh, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""On a simple level, tai chi is a very accessible form of exercise,"" she says. The movements are easy to adapt to different levels of intensity, and you can even do certain movements while seated in a chair. Tai chi doesn't require fully extending or stretching your joints, so it's also fine for people who are not so flexible.
        A gateway exercise
        Tai chi can be a good gateway exercise for people who cannot or will not engage in more conventional exercise. Even people who are out of shape can do tai chi, which can help build strength and confidence, both physically and mentally. And if you practice more vigorously or sink deeper into the poses, tai chi can provide a moderate aerobic workout.
        But the meditative aspects of tai chi that teach body awareness, slowing down, and stress management are also important, says Dr. Yeh, who directs the Mind-Body Research program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. People prone to heart disease can benefit from holistic approaches that address their overall well-being, she adds.
        Protecting the heart
        Studies exploring the health benefits of tai chi — which also include reduced pain and improved mood — date back to the 1950s. Tai chi may help lower cholesterol levels and dampen inflammation, both of which are linked to better heart health. But the best evidence seems to be for improving blood pressure, according to a 2008 review of 26 studies co-authored by Dr. Yeh in the journal Preventive Cardiology. In people with high blood pressure, systolic blood pressure (the first number in a blood pressure reading) fell seven to 32 points, while diastolic pressure (the second number) fell by two to 18 points.
        Healing the heart
        Tai chi may be a promising addition to cardiac rehabilitation, a multiweek program of structured exercise paired with lifestyle and nutrition education. Cardiac rehab, which is covered by Medicare, improves quality of life and survival after a serious heart-related problem, procedure, or surgery. But according to the American Heart Association, only about a quarter of eligible Medicare recipients participate in these programs. Studies by Dr. Yeh and others suggest that for people who decline cardiac rehab, tai chi can help them ease into exercising more, losing weight, and enjoying a better quality of life. As this research continues to grow, tai chi may become a more popular option in conjunction with cardiac rehab, says Dr. Yeh. Many academic medical centers, including Harvard Medical School, have integrative medicine programs that offer tai chi classes.
        Getting started with tai chi
        You also can find local tai chi classes at martial arts studios, community centers, health clubs, Y's, and senior centers. Costs vary widely, ranging from about $7 to $18 for an hourlong class. Wear loose, comfortable clothing, and supportive shoes like sneakers (or no shoes, if you prefer). During the class, the instructor will demonstrate graceful, slow arm and leg movements, often done with a slight bend in the knees. ""You might learn to let go of extra muscle tension, take deep breaths, and pay attention to how your body feels,"" says Dr. Yeh.
        You can learn tai chi from a watching a DVD, which you can also use to practice at home. But going to a class has certain advantages. It may be easier to grasp the concepts with a live instructor with whom you can interact, and being in a group provides both camaraderie and motivation.
        For more detailed information, check out the Harvard Medical School Special Health Report An Introduction to Tai Chi (/tai). The electronic version includes links to videos demonstrating the moves. World Tai Chi Day is celebrated on the last Saturday of April with free classes around the world; see www.worldtaichiday.org.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-are-the-symptoms-of-heart-failure,What are the symptoms of heart failure?,"Despite the name, heart failure does not mean the heart has failed completely. Instead, it means the heart isn't pumping efficiently enough to meet the body's need for blood.
        When the body first detects that it's not getting an adequate blood supply, it tries to compensate. Stress hormones rise, pushing the heart to beat faster and harder. Blood vessels narrow in an effort to keep blood pressure stable. To keep blood flowing to the heart and brain, the body diverts blood away from less important tissues. The body also retains sodium and fluid in an attempt to supplement the volume of circulating blood.
        In the short run, these fixes enable the heart to deliver a near-normal level of blood to the tissues. But over time, these compensatory measures can't keep up, and the heart weakens further.
        The two sides of heart failure
        Heart failure causes two major problems for the body: (1) the tissues and organs don't get enough oxygen, and (2) fluid builds up in the lungs and other tissues. Each of these spawns a series of problems. Lack of oxygen, for example, can lead to fatigue and mental confusion, while fluid buildup can cause weight gain and swelling in the feet and ankles. If you're unfamiliar with heart failure, you could easily interpret these as isolated symptoms. People often mistakenly attribute the early signs of heart failure to being out of shape, being overweight, or just getting old. Adding to the confusion is the fact that the symptoms can wax and wane over the course of the illness.
        Heart failure can primarily involve just one side of the heart or both sides. The weaker side of the heart influences which early symptoms predominate:
        
          When heart failure mainly affects the left side of the heart, blood backs up into the lungs, causing shortness of breath and coughing.
          When mainly the right side is affected, blood backs up into the veins and builds up in body tissues, often leading to swelling in the legs.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/standard-emergency-care-what-does-it-entail,Standard emergency care: What does it entail?,"If your heart stops beating and you stop breathing, the first step in emergency care is cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)—a combination of chest compressions, artificial respiration, and defibrillation to shock the heart back into a steady rhythm.
        What if basic CPR is not sufficient?
        Sometimes your heart will start beating using basic CPR, but most often the heart needs more than just a quick restart to continue working. That's when doctors move on to advanced cardiac life support. Your lungs may not have the strength to deliver the oxygen you need. So, you would be intubated — that is, a tube is inserted through the nose, mouth, or throat into the trachea. The tube would be attached to a breathing machine called a ventilator or respirator that pushes air into and out of the lungs. Intravenous medications to raise or lower blood pressure, control heart rate, or make the kidneys work better would be given.
        If you were in a hospital, the staff would draw blood to check how well your lungs, kidneys, and liver are working, find out if you have an infection, and make sure your blood minerals are properly balanced. A catheter would be placed in your bladder to drain urine. If your kidneys weren't working properly, dialysis would be offered. Imaging scans, other tests, and, if necessary, surgery would be done. In the United States, this is standard intensive care.
        That's pretty extensive. Wouldn't these be considered ""heroic measures""?
        No. There's a huge disconnect between the thinking of people who are in the medical profession and those who aren't. If you want anything less done, you have to be explicit.
        What if I say, yes, please do CPR, but no, don't put me on a ventilator?
        You could say that. But if you're so sick that your heart stopped beating and you stopped breathing, it's unlikely that your doctor would be able to bring you back by just pushing on your chest and shocking your heart. Usually, if the heart stops, the lungs stop breathing, too, so you need the ventilator. To decide that you only want part of the emergency care intervention rarely makes sense.
        How should people discuss this with their doctors?
        The first step is to begin the conversation. You can start by talking with your doctor. Ask him or her: What would happen to me if my heart stopped? Given my medical situation, would I likely survive? If I did survive, what would my quality of life be like?

Both speech and occupational therapists work with people to improve these areas and to develop strategies to compensate for problems— for example, using cue cards and detailed lists or simplifying daily routines.
        Coping with spatial neglect
        One fairly common effect of stroke is called ""neglect.""  This is a lack of awareness of one side of the body and the space around that side of the body.  The left side is more commonly affected than the right. If you have neglect, you may bump into things on your left without noticing them, shave or apply makeup only on the right side of your face, or eat food on only the right side of your plate.
        If you have this problem, occupational and speech therapists will cue you to look frequently toward your neglected side and then teach you to cue yourself. One example: A red line down the left margin of the page you are reading may help remind you to look all the way to the marker so you see all the words on that line. A variety of software programs and games can also help train people to pay attention to the things on the neglected side. Caregivers and family members can help by setting important objects (food, writing implements) on the person's neglected side to train him or her to focus more on that side. Prism glasses— which are shaped in a way that changes the focus point of your eyes—can be helpful to shift your view more toward the neglected side.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/they-found-colon-polyps-now-what,They found colon polyps: Now what?,"Follow-up exams at the right time are essential to prevent cancer from developing.
        
        Colorectal cancer is one of the most preventable forms of cancer—if you are screened for hidden warning signs while you are still healthy. Screening finds precancerous growths on the colon wall, called polyps, which the doctor can then remove.
        They are not cancer, and most of them have not started to change into cancer. If you get them at the precancerous phase, they don't have a chance to grow and turn into cancer.
        But you will need to come back for follow-up testing to see if more polyps turn up in the future. Here is what to expect.
        What are polyps?
        A colonoscope, the flexible device used to inspect the colon, can grab and snip off polyps if they are relatively small. The timing of follow-up depends on what kind of polyps the doctor finds, how many, and how big they are.
        Hyperplastic polyps: These polyps are not precancerous. Doctors generally remove them anyway, just to be safe.
        Adenomas: Many colon polyps are the precancerous type, called adenomas. It can take seven to 10 or more years for an adenoma to evolve into cancer—if it ever does. Overall, only 5% of adenomas progress to cancer, but your individual risk is hard to predict. Doctors remove all the adenomas they find.
        Sessile serrated polyps: Once thought harmless, this type of adenoma is now known to be risky. These are also removed.
        When to return for follow-up
        After polyps are removed, you will need to return for an additional colonoscopy. There is a 25% to 30% chance that a repeat colonoscopy will find additional polyps. How soon you need to return for follow-up depends largely on the size of the polyps found in the first exam.
        If the colonoscopy finds one or two small polyps (5 mm in diameter or smaller), you are considered at relatively low risk. Most people will not have to return for a follow-up colonoscopy for at least five years, and possibly longer.
        If the polyps are larger (10 mm or larger), more numerous, or abnormal in appearance under a microscope, you may have to return in three years or sooner.
        If the exam finds no polyps, you can usually wait 10 years for the next screening if you are at average risk for colon cancer. 
        
          
            
              
                
                  How a colon polyp progresses to cancer
                
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        Get the best exam you can
        Whenever you have a colonoscopy, you should have the highest quality exam possible so the doctor can find all the polyps. During the colon-cleansing ""prep"" before the colonoscopy, follow the instructions to the letter. Eating a low-fiber diet for four to five days may improve the quality of the prep. That's because fiber gets stuck in the nooks and crannies of the colon wall and can block the doctor's view. For colonoscopy to prevent cancer, the doctor must find and remove as many precancerous growths as possible.
        Reducing your risk
        After polyp removal, certain steps may lower your risk of colon cancer:
        Eat less meat: Eat a healthy diet, with minimal red meat—especially processed or cured meats. Studies suggest that people with meat-rich diets tend to have higher rates of colon cancer.
        Aspirin: Some research suggests that taking aspirin may reduce overall colon cancer risk, but the evidence is not definite. If you need to take aspirin for your heart, then it may offer some protection for the colon.
        Calcium: Research has also linked a calcium-rich diet to lower colon cancer risk, but this, too, is uncertain. If you are already eating a healthy calcium rich diet to preserve bone health, you might get an extra ""bump"" of cancer prevention.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/3-surprising-risks-of-poor-posture,3 surprising risks of poor posture,"America, we have a posture problem. Whether it's the result of sitting at a desk all day, looking down at a smartphone, or lounging on a couch, poor posture is dogging people of all ages. And health experts are worried. ""It's a common and important health problem among Americans, and it can lead to neck pain, back problems, and other aggravating conditions,"" says Meghan Markowski, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Other posture-related problems
        While back and neck conditions top the list of potential posture woes, there are many others — such as poor balance, headaches, and breathing difficulties. ""Researchers are also looking into whether posture affects mood, sleep, fatigue, and jaw alignment,"" Markowski says.
        Three other problems linked to poor posture may surprise you.
        1. Incontinence. Poor posture promotes stress incontinence — when you leak a little urine if you laugh or cough. ""Slouching increases abdominal pressure, which puts pressure on the bladder. The position also decreases the ability of the pelvic floor muscles to hold against that pressure,"" notes Markowski, who specializes in helping people overcome bladder, bowel, and pelvic floor problems.
        2. Constipation. Poor posture on a toilet — hunched over with your knees lower than your hips — can promote constipation. ""That position closes the anus somewhat and makes it harder for the abdominal muscles to help move feces out,"" Markowski says. Constipation is characterized by fewer than three bowel movements per week; hard, dry stools; straining to move the bowels; and a sense of an incomplete evacuation.
        3. Heartburn and slowed digestion. Slouched posture after a meal can trigger heartburn caused by acid reflux (when stomach acid squirts back up into the esophagus). ""Slouching puts pressure on the abdomen, which can force stomach acid in the wrong direction,"" explains Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""And some evidence suggests that transit in the intestines slows down when you slouch. In my opinion, it probably does play a small role.""
        What you can do
        Markowski recommends seeing a physical therapist if you suspect you have poor posture that is causing problems for you. The therapist will customize a program of exercises and stretches to improve your core muscle strength and flexibility. The core muscles (in the abdomen, pelvic floor, and back) support the spine.
        The goal is a neutral, upright spine position — not flexed too far forward or backward.
        A neutral spine is also important when it's time to move your bowels. ""Keep your back straight and lean forward at the hips. Keeping your knees higher than your hips — by placing your feet on a footstool — mimics a squatting position, which is best for helping to open the anus so you can pass feces without straining,"" Markowski says.
        To reduce the risk of stress incontinence leakage, Markowski recommends strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. ""We teach people how to control their pelvic muscles when they cough,"" she says. ""The proper neutral spine alignment will also help minimize abdominal pressure.""

        Some general posture pointers
        To attain the neutral spine position, Markowski advises you to put your shoulders down and back, pull your head back, and engage your core muscles. ""Bring your belly button in toward your spine, as if you're zipping up a snug pair of jeans. This will help to engage the transverse abdominis muscle, which acts like a corset around the spine,"" Markowski explains.
        Other tips: Use a low back (lumbar) support pillow to remind you to sit upright in a chair, and change your position every 30 to 60 minutes. ""We don't want people in fixed postures for hours at a time,"" Markowski says. ""Be vigilant, and good posture will contribute to many aspects of health.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-to-eat-when-you-have-chronic-heartburn,What to eat when you have chronic heartburn,"Avoid spicy foods, and keep some dazzle in your diet with low-fat sauces and fresh herbs.
        
        
          
        
        The fiery feeling of heartburn is the last way you want to remember a great meal. But when your doctor says you have chronic heartburn caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (see ""What is GERD?""), you may worry that a bland and disappointing menu is in your future. But the foods that trigger your heartburn may or may not be on the usual lists. That's why keeping a journal to determine which foods cause symptoms helps.
        Common culprits
        Some foods and ingredients may intensify heartburn, such as spicy foods, citrus, tomato sauces, and vinegar.
        Fatty and fried foods linger longer in the stomach, making it more likely that stomach acid leaks back up into the esophagus.
        Other common heartburn triggers include chocolate, caffeine, onions, peppermint, carbonated drinks, and alcohol.
        What's for dinner?
        You can still enjoy lean meats, fish, poultry, vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains. The trick is making them flavorful. If spices bother you, try using only small amounts, and be mindful of blends that contain cayenne or chili powder. Or use fresh herbs instead. Fresh herbs are less concentrated and may be less irritating. Instead use fresh parsley, oregano, and basil.
        Another tip: roast your food. This makes vegetables sweeter. The natural sugars come out and caramelize. Carrots, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, squash, and Brussels sprouts work well. Broiling, saut'ing, or grilling food also brings out intense flavor.
        Eat vegetables raw. Tomato sauce may bother you, but a fresh tomato may not.
        Use sauces but cut the fat. Blend low-fat yogurt with cucumber and basil, or saut' mushrooms in a little olive oil. Or make a pesto. Blend basil, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and a dash of olive oil or water. Use a tablespoon of it on food.
        Breakfast and lunch
        Avoid fatty meats like ham or bacon. Oatmeal is a great option. Throw in bananas, raisins, and maybe a hint of cinnamon. Other possibilities: low-fat yogurt with fruit or nuts, any kind of eggs, whole-grain toast, or a side of chilled whole grains like quinoa mixed with fruit or topped with a dollop of yogurt.
        For lunch, think salads with protein such as chicken or beans. But maybe use a yogurt-based dressing, to avoid vinegar and citrus.
        
          
            
              
                What is GERD?
                One of the most common causes of heartburn is called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, the tube connecting the mouth and stomach, usually because the ring-like muscles that prevent backflow stop working properly. In addition to heartburn, GERD may cause nausea, a sour taste in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, a sore throat, coughing, and tightness in the chest.
                Medications to treat GERD reduce stomach acid. Antacid pills and liquids have been around the longest. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole (Prilosec) or lansoprazole (Prevacid), and H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) or famotidine (Pepcid), are available over the counter.
                Don't fool yourself into thinking medication allows you to frequently eat foods that once caused heartburn. If medication controls your symptoms, then it's probably okay to have a 'trigger' food occasionally. But if you do that too often, the heartburn will return. You can limit and perhaps avoid medication to control GERD symptoms by losing weight if necessary, eating smaller meals and avoiding food triggers (see accompanying article).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heartburn-vs-heart-attack,Heartburn vs. heart attack,"The symptoms of these two health problems may overlap — and sometimes, so do the treatments.
        
        During your regular after-dinner walk around the neighborhood, you feel a painful sensation in the center of your chest. Could it be your heartburn flaring up again, or something more serious?
        Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), often called acid reflux. Acid from the stomach bubbles up into the esophagus, causing a painful burning just behind the breastbone. Not surprisingly, it's often mistaken for a heart attack. In fact, of the over eight million emergency room visits for chest pain each year, severe heartburn accounts for over half the cases in which actual heart problems are ruled out.
        Chest pain caused by insufficient blood flow to the heart (angina) or a heart attack is often described as a feeling of tightness, constriction, or pressure, rather than a burning sensation (see ""Heartburn or heart attack?""). But it's not always easy to tell the difference. ""Chest discomfort brought on by exercise is more likely to be a heart-related problem,"" says Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, cardiovascular specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. But you can also have angina that's not related to physical activity, she notes. If you have any symptoms you're not sure about, see a doctor. And call 911 if you feel chest tightness, have trouble breathing, break into a sweat, turn pale, or become very weak.
        GERD and heart disease are both common, and many people take medications to prevent or treat both conditions.
        
          
            
              
                Heartburn or heart attack?
                The symptoms of heartburn may mimic those of angina or a heart attack (or vice versa). If you're uncertain, don't hesitate to get to an emergency room for an evaluation as soon as possible.

        Avoiding clots
        Many people take daily, low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks, which works by discouraging the formation of blood clots. Doctors prescribe clopidogrel (a more potent clot-preventing drug) with aspirin, mainly for people who receive stents, the tiny metal mesh tubes placed in clogged blood vessels to improve blood flow. But there's a downside. ""Aspirin can increase the risk of bleeding from the stomach and the intestines, both by directly irritating the stomach lining and by making existing areas of irritation more prone to bleeding,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. Taking clopidogrel with aspirin can further increase that risk.
        Preventing bleeding
        People with heartburn often take proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). They include over-the-counter drugs such as omeprazole (Prilosec) and prescription drugs such as pantoprazole (Protonix). These drugs reduce the release of acid from the stomach lining. In addition to causing heartburn, excess stomach acid can also cause bleeding sores (ulcers) in the stomach; these, too, are treated with PPIs, among other drugs.
        Thanks to these stomach-protecting effects, doctors sometimes prescribe PPIs for people who take drugs that increase the risk of bleeding — even if they don't have heartburn.
        ""I usually recommend PPIs for people who are taking long-term aspirin or clopidogrel if they have ever had a bleeding stomach ulcer or are at high risk of developing one,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. Factors that can boost your odds include an infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria and routine use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Motrin, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox, others).
        Clopidogrel concern?
        Some research suggests a possible problem with taking both a PPI and clopidogrel. Two popular PPIs, omeprazole and esomeprazole (Nexium), inhibit a liver enzyme that helps convert clopidogrel to its active form. In theory, this could make clopidogrel less effective for heart attacks and stroke prevention. But large clinical studies have not revealed any meaningful differences. Still, anyone with lingering concerns about a possible interaction could take a different PPI, such as pantoprazole, which does not affect the liver enzyme.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/natural-ways-to-relieve-constipation,Natural ways to relieve constipation,"A few at-home tips can help you avoid the need for harsh laxatives.
        
        We often make light of constipation, but it's no laughing matter. When you can't go to the bathroom for days on end, you feel bloated and miserable. Straining day after day can also lead to more serious problems, like hemorrhoids or even prolapse (bulging) of rectal tissue.
        An estimated 40% to 60% of older adults regularly deal with constipation, although the aging process itself is not to blame. It's what goes along with aging. It's things like less physical activity, which helps the bowels move more regularly. It's the medications many older adults take.
        Constipation causes
        One of the biggest factors in constipation is diet. Eating high-fiber foods, such as raw fruits and vegetables and whole grains, helps to keep you regular. Drinking enough fluid is essential too. The fiber holds the water in the bowel so it can mix with the stool and make it softer.
        If you're getting plenty of fiber and fluids and you're still not regular, one of these constipation causes may be to blame:
        
          medicines such as narcotic pain relievers, antidepressants, aluminum-containing antacids, blood pressure medications, drugs for Parkinson's disease, and iron supplements
          lack of exercise
          regularly ignoring the urge to have a bowel movement
          diseases such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).
        
        Getting going again
        Laxatives may seem like the quickest and simplest solution, but they're not a good idea If people go right to stimulant laxatives, there is a risk that they'll become physically dependent on them.
        Before taking any laxative, try these diet and lifestyle tips for managing constipation:
        
          Stay hydrated. Drink at least four to six glasses of fluids a day. Water and fruit juices are best for preventing constipation. Limit caffeinated beverages such as soda and coffee, which can actually leach more fluid from your body.
          Bulk up on fiber. Try to get at least 25 grams of fiber daily from your diet. Good food sources include Brussels sprouts, apples, figs, bran cereal, and black beans.
          Get on a daily schedule. The longer stool sits in your intestines, the harder it becomes, and the more difficult it is to push out. That's why having a regular bowel habit is important. Because the emptying reflex works best after a meal, a useful habit is to head to the bathroom after breakfast and see if you get the urge.
          Try not to strain. It could lead to hemorrhoids, anal fissures (tears in the skin around the anus), or rectal prolapse (when part of the intestinal lining pushes out through the anal opening). Add more fiber and fluid to your diet or try a stool softener to make bowel movements easier.
        
        If you simply can't go and you want to try a laxative, start with the osmotic type (such as MiraLAX or Geri Care). The osmotic laxatives are reasonably safe. They work gently by pulling water into your intestines, making the stool softer and easier to pass.
        If you've tried everything and you still aren't regular, see your doctor, who can evaluate you for a medical problem. Call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of a bowel obstruction, which can include abdominal pain, vomiting, a swollen belly, or the complete inability to have a bowel movement.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/what-to-do-about-gallstones,What to do about gallstones,"Gallstones are one of the most common digestive problems treated in women.
        
        More than 25 million people in the United States have gallstones, and 65% to 75% of them are women. Fortunately, for most people, gallstones are ""silent"" — they don't cause major symptoms. When they do act up, there are effective ways to address the problem.
        What are gallstones?
        Gallstones begin with bile, a substance that helps with the digestion of fats and the absorption of certain vitamins. Bile is made in the liver and carried to the gallbladder, a small, pear-shaped organ that concentrates and stores it. The fat in food triggers the release of a hormone that causes the gallbladder to contract and release bile into the intestine.
        Gallstones are solid lumps that develop when the stored bile crystallizes. Most are less than an inch in diameter, but they can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball. Most gallstones are composed mainly of cholesterol. The rest — known as pigment stones — are made of calcium salts and bilirubin, a breakdown product of red blood cells.
        Cholesterol stones form when liquid bile in the gallbladder contains more cholesterol than the bile salts can dissolve. Cholesterol stones may also develop if the gallbladder doesn't contract and empty as it should. Pigment stones are associated with certain medical conditions, including liver disease, some types of anemia, and infection of the bile ducts.
        
          
            
              
                
                  Gallstone trouble
                
                
                  
                
                Gallstones cause problems when they block any of the ducts carrying bile from the liver or gallbladder (or digestive enzymes from the pancreas) to the small intestine.
              
            
          
        
        Why are women at greater risk?
        It's the effect of female hormones. Estrogen increases cholesterol in the bile, and progesterone slows the emptying of the gallbladder. That may explain why the risk for women, relative to men, decreases with age. Before age 40, women are diagnosed with gallstones almost three times more often than men are (pregnancy, for example, increases the risk), but by age 60, their risk is just slightly greater. Estrogen therapy increases the risk, especially when taken as a pill rather than a patch. Oral contraceptive pills also increase the risk slightly, but only in the first decade of use.
        Obesity is another risk factor because bodies with more fat produce more estrogen. Paradoxically, rapid weight loss also increases the risk, because very low-calorie diets interfere with bile production and therefore cause more crystallization of cholesterol. Gallstones are so common after weight-loss surgery that patients may be advised to have their gallbladders removed at the same time. Gallstones are also more likely to occur in people with diabetes or any condition that decreases gallbladder contractions or intestinal motility, such as a spinal cord injury. Finally, there's some evidence for genetic vulnerability to gallstone formation.
        What are the symptoms?
        Most people who have gallstones don't know it. Their gallstones stay silent and may only be discovered incidentally, through an ultrasound or CT scan performed for other reasons. Symptoms arise mainly when stones pass through a bile duct or obstruct it, causing biliary colic — better known as a gallbladder attack. These attacks occur when the gallbladder contracts (usually in response to a fatty meal) and presses the stones so as to block the gallbladder duct. The main symptom is pain, usually in the right upper or middle abdomen (just below the rib cage), which builds to greatest intensity within an hour and can persist up to several hours. It can be either sharp and knifelike or a deep ache; sometimes it radiates to the back or the right shoulder. There may also be nausea and vomiting. The pain subsides as the gallbladder relaxes.
        A stone lodged in a duct can also cause more serious problems, including acute cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), or cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts in the liver). Any of these conditions can cause severe pain and other symptoms, including jaundice, high fever, chills, and vomiting. Treatment usually requires hospitalization and often surgical removal of the stone.
        If you think you're having a gallbladder attack, your clinician will probably order several blood tests and an abdominal ultrasound (after you fast for at least eight hours). Ultrasound is particularly helpful in diagnosing acute cholecystitis because it also picks up any thickening of the gallbladder wall and indicates the presence of fluid, which may suggest inflammation. Other diagnostic techniques include cholescintigraphy, a radioactive injection used to view a possible blockage of the cystic duct; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the bile ducts; endoscopic ultrasonography, which introduces an ultrasound device through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine) to get images of the area; and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which uses a scope inserted through the mouth to the duodenum to view the biliary ducts.
        How are gallstones treated?
        Typically, gallstones are treated only if they cause symptoms. For recurrent gallbladder attacks, the most effective treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder, or cholecystectomy. In the past, the standard procedure was surgery requiring a five-inch incision and a hospital stay of up to a week. This approach has largely been replaced by laparoscopic cholecystectomy, in which the gallbladder is removed with instruments inserted through small incisions in the skin. This procedure requires only an overnight hospital stay and a week of recovery at home. However, there's a slight risk of injuring the bile ducts, and in a small percent of cases, the surgeon may have to switch to an open surgery with a larger incision because of complications.
        You can easily live without a gallbladder. The liver produces enough bile for normal digestion. When the gallbladder is removed, bile simply flows directly into the small intestine through the common bile duct. When no food is present, loose stools may result, but you can treat that with a bile acid–binding medication, such as cholestyramine (Questran).
        Medical options
        If you can't or don't want to undergo surgery and your gallstones are small, one option is to take ursodiol (Actigall, Urso), a naturally occurring bile acid that helps dissolve cholesterol stones when taken by mouth two to four times a day. It's also used to prevent the formation of gallstones in people who are losing weight quickly. Ursodiol dissolves only those gallstones made of cholesterol, and it may take several months before it has an effect.
        Drug therapy is occasionally combined with lithotripsy, in which sound waves from outside the body are used to break gallstones into pieces that dissolve more easily or are small enough to safely pass through the bile duct. Unfortunately, stones are likely to recur after medical treatment.
        How can I reduce my risk for gallstones?
        There's no proven way to prevent gallstones, but eating a well-balanced diet, maintaining a normal weight, and exercising regularly (at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week). Avoiding fatty foods won't prevent or get rid of gallstones, but it may reduce the frequency of attacks.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/healthy-gut-healthy-heart,"Healthy gut, healthy heart?","The gut is known as the ""second brain,"" as it produces many of the same neurotransmitters, chemicals released by nerves needed for communication with other nerves and tissues. The gut and brain are also connected through a joint partnership called the gut-brain axis that links biochemical signals both to and from the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system.
        But what about the gut and the heart? Do they have a similar connection?
        Research suggests there might be a link, but that it travels in one direction — from the gut to the heart — and that keeping your gut healthy can be another means to protect against heart disease.
        The gut-heart connection
        The gut is the primary home to trillions of microbes, collectively known as the human microbiota. These microbes help with digestion, manufacture certain nutrients, and release substances that have wide-ranging health effects.
        ""There's a complex interplay between the microbes in our intestines and most of the systems in our bodies, including the vascular, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, all of which are linked with cardiovascular health,"" says Dr. Stanley Shaw, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Since diet plays a significant role in the composition of gut microbiota, what you feed your gut can therefore affect heart health — for better and for worse.
        One way the gut does this is with metabolites, substances the gut microbiota creates when breaking down food. One particular gut metabolite, trimethylamine (TMA), forms when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a substance strongly connected with forming artery-clogging plaque.
        Research has shown that people with high TMAO levels in their blood are more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those with lower levels. Since red meat is a main source of TMA, cutting back can stop the gut from making too much TMAO.
        In fact, a study in the September 2022 issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found that among nearly 4,000 people ages 65 and older, those who ate an average of 1.1 servings of red meat per day had a 22% higher risk of heart disease compared with those who ate less.
        The researchers pointed out that about 10% of this added risk could be attributed to increased levels of TMAO as well as two other metabolites — gamma-butyrobetaine and crotonobetaine — which also are made by gut bacteria from components in red meat.
        Fiber at work
        Fiber also helps support the gut and thus the heart. According to some estimates, fiber-rich diets can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as 30%. Fiber in the small intestine binds fat and cholesterol, decreasing absorption and lowering blood cholesterol levels.
        But the gut's microbiota also helps out. Fiber gets broken down by bacteria in the colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds interact with specific receptors on cells that regulate blood pressure, better control blood sugar and body weight in people with diabetes, and dampen inflammation — all of which can improve heart health.
        Other supporting foods
        It's unclear whether eating other foods that improve gut microbiota — for example, probiotics (beneficial bacteria) found in yogurt and fermented foods (sauerkraut, miso, tempeh) — can also support heart health.
        The best advice for helping your gut help your heart is to follow a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean diet or similar eating patterns. These involve limiting red meat and eating plenty of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, all of which can have favorable effects on the gut,"" says Dr. Shaw. ""And if your gut is healthy, there is a greater chance your heart is healthy, too.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/stomachs-growl-noses-run-and-yawning-is-contagious-ever-wonder-why-202307192955,"Stomachs growl, noses run, and yawning is contagious: Ever wonder why?","There are certain things our bodies do so often and so automatically that we barely notice them. Yawning, growling stomachs, and runny noses are good examples. Each is a universal part of our daily human experience.
        But did you ever wonder why? Below are a few things we know and a few we suspect.
        Why do you yawn?
        Perhaps you associate yawning only with being tired or bored. While we don't know exactly why people yawn, there's no shortage of theories. Yawning may
        
          stretch out our lungs and nearby tissues, preventing tiny airways in the lungs from collapsing
          distribute a chemical called surfactant, a gooey liquid that coats the tiny air pockets in the lungs and helps keep them open
          help prepare our bodies for transitions between wakefulness and rest: For example, yawning often occurs after a period of relaxation and when awakening from sleep. And it may serve as an internal signal that it's time to sleep, or time to take a break from activities (such as driving).
          play a role in maintaining proper brain temperature: Our brain functions best within a narrow range of temperatures. Some experts believe yawning can help cool the brain through complex effects on nearby circulation and the sinuses.
        
        It's also unclear why yawning is contagious. In the animal kingdom, it's common to see contagious yawning among members of a group, perhaps as a signal for collective behavior (such as moving from activity to rest).
        Why does your stomach growl?
        That rumbling in your stomach is known medically as borborygmi — an excellent Scrabble word if you have the right letters. We usually assume it reflects hunger. And it's true that the experience of hunger can make itself heard in anticipation of a meal.
        But your stomach may also growl after a meal, when the stomach and intestines propel liquids and food through the digestive tract. Stress can also trigger stomach rumbling.
        What's causing all that noise — and is it ever a problem? It may be due to gas moving around in response to muscular contractions of the intestinal walls. Occasionally, noises from the abdomen may be a sign of an intestinal infection or other trouble. If you're experiencing other symptoms, such as pain or fever, check in with your doctor. But the vast majority of noises are harmless and a sign that your gut is working normally.
        Why does your nose run?
        Sometimes it can seem like your nose is running for no reason. But there are some well-known triggers, such as:
        
          Infection. When you have a cold, mucous membranes produce more mucus as part of your defense system: more mucous flowing out means fewer germs getting in.
          Allergies. Pollen, ragweed, or other triggers stimulate immune cells that produce histamine. Histamine opens up blood vessels just beneath the mucous membranes, and that leads to increased production and release of fluid and mucus. As with infection, this response may be helpful to dilute the offending trigger and rid it from the area.
          Cold, dry air. The inside surface of the nose is covered with mucous membranes that warm and humidify air well before it reaches the lungs. When you inhale dry, cold air through your nose, these membranes humidify the air by secreting water and mucus.
          Spicy foods. Spices like capsaicin act as an irritant to the sinuses and mucous membranes, which release fluid in response.
        
        The bottom line
        Some of the most common everyday human experiences are also some of the least understood. There are many other examples, of course: Why are we ticklish? What purpose do hiccups serve? What's the deal with brain freeze? Perhaps topics for another day.
        It may seem like a leap of faith, but it's likely there are very good reasons for the way our bodies work — even when we don't know what those reasons are.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","July 19, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-irritable-bowel-syndrome-the-same,Are inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome the same?,"Ask the doctors
        
          Q.
          I was recently diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. Is this the same thing as inflammatory bowel disease?
        
        A. No, they are not the same. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to two conditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which are caused by a malfunctioning immune system. In these diseases, the immune system misfires, causing the lining of the digestive tract to become chronically inflamed and irritated. Both can lead to long-term digestive tract damage. In Crohn's disease, this inflammation can occur anywhere in the digestive tract, while colitis affects only the colon and the rectum. IBD triggers a number of symptoms, including abdominal pain and cramping, fevers, ­diarrhea, and bloody bowel movements, among others.
        While people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may experience some of the same symptoms as people with IBD, there is no obvious inflammation within the digestive tract. The underlying cause of IBS is unknown, but symptoms may arise due to uncoordinated intestinal contractions that affect bowel movements and hypersensitive nerves in the gut. People with IBS commonly have diarrhea, constipation, or both, as well as abdominal pain and cramping. While IBS can cause significant distress and discomfort for those affected, people don't typically experience severe complications as a result of the condition or need to have surgery. It's most often managed through lifestyle change or medication.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection,The gut-brain connection,"Pay attention to your gut-brain connection – it may contribute to your anxiety and digestion problems
        
          
        
        The gut-brain connection is no joke; it can link anxiety to stomach problems and vice versa. Have you ever had a ""gut-wrenching"" experience? Do certain situations make you ""feel nauseous""? Have you ever felt ""butterflies"" in your stomach? We use these expressions for a reason. The gastrointestinal tract is sensitive to emotion. Anger, anxiety, sadness, elation — all of these feelings (and others) can trigger symptoms in the gut.
        The brain has a direct effect on the stomach and intestines. For example, the very thought of eating can release the stomach's juices before food gets there. This connection goes both ways. A troubled intestine can send signals to the brain, just as a troubled brain can send signals to the gut. Therefore, a person's stomach or intestinal distress can be the cause or the product of anxiety, stress, or depression. That's because the brain and the gastrointestinal (GI) system are intimately connected.
        This is especially true in cases where a person experiences gastrointestinal upset with no obvious physical cause. For such functional GI disorders, it is difficult to try to heal a distressed gut without considering the role of stress and emotion.
        
          Gut health and anxiety
        
        Given how closely the gut and brain interact, it becomes easier to understand why you might feel nauseated before giving a presentation, or feel intestinal pain during times of stress. That doesn't mean, however, that functional gastrointestinal conditions are imagined or ""all in your head."" Psychology combines with physical factors to cause pain and other bowel symptoms. Psychosocial factors influence the actual physiology of the gut, as well as symptoms. In other words, stress (or depression or other psychological factors) can affect movement and contractions of the GI tract.
        In addition, many people with functional GI disorders perceive pain more acutely than other people do because their brains are more responsive to pain signals from the GI tract. Stress can make the existing pain seem even worse.
        Based on these observations, you might expect that at least some patients with functional GI conditions might improve with therapy to reduce stress or treat anxiety or depression. Multiple studies have found that psychologically based approaches lead to greater improvement in digestive symptoms compared with only conventional medical treatment.
        
          Gut-brain connection, anxiety and digestion  
        
        Are your stomach or intestinal problems — such as heartburn, abdominal cramps, or loose stools — related to stress? Watch for these and other common symptoms of stress and discuss them with your doctor. Together you can come up with strategies to help you deal with the stressors in your life, and also ease your digestive discomforts.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/dont-take-back-pain-sitting-down,Don't take back pain sitting down,"Sitting down is supposed to be a way to relax after a long day on your feet. But for many people, sitting for any length of time is painful. It aggravates pain in the back instead of relieving it.
        What causes lower back pain when sitting?
        Although the specific reason for back pain often cannot be identified, muscle spasms are probably the most common cause. While there isn't proof from medical studies that sitting leads to more spasms, people often report tighter and more painful back muscles with prolonged sitting.
        A long car ride is a typical example. Sometimes people attribute the pain to the jarring and bouncing around that occurs on the road, but often it's just pressure from sitting that triggers the problem.
        If you experience lower back pain when sitting, the problem could be one of several common conditions, says Dr. Steven J. Atlas, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        Herniated discs
        Herniated discs refers to a problem with one of the discs that act as pads between the vertebrae in your back. In particular, a disc can become herniated, meaning it develops a bulge that can pinch a nearby spinal nerve, causing pain.
        ""There have been some studies that measured the amount of pressure on the discs,"" says Dr. Atlas. ""Not surprisingly, the pressure is lowest when you're lying down."" But there is more pressure on the discs when you're sitting than when you're standing.
        ""In fact, if I come into the exam room and a patient is standing, rather than sitting, my suspicion that the person has a disc herniation goes up a lot,"" he says.
        Sciatica
        Disc problems can cause back pain alone, but when the pain moves into the legs, this may be the nerve pain known as sciatica. Sciatica sometimes occurs when a herniated disc pinches one of your sciatic nerves. These are the longest nerves in your body, running from the lower back into each leg.
        People with sciatica typically report a burning pain that involves the lower back, the leg, and sometimes the foot.
        When lower back pain is eased by sitting
        There is one common condition in older women that is eased by sitting. This is a type of arthritis of the lower back called spinal stenosis.
        ""In cases where the arthritis is severe enough to pinch nerves going to the buttocks and legs, people often report that the pain is better when sitting than standing. This is because when you sit, you bend forward a little bit at the lower back, and this may spread out the arthritic bones enough to relieve the pain temporarily,"" says Dr. Atlas. Pain relief may also occur when you lean forward while using a shopping cart or a walker.
        
          
            
              
                When to see a doctor
                In most cases, you should be able to manage back pain by yourself. Modify your activity and slowly work toward regaining function, says Dr. Steven J. Atlas, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
                However, you should see a doctor if the pain isn't improving after you've modified your activity for a few weeks. (It can take up to four to six weeks to see improvement in sciatica from a herniated disc.)
                You should see a doctor right away if your pain is extremely severe, if it gets better but comes back, or if it occurs after an injury — such as falling down a flight of stairs, being in a car accident, or slipping on a patch of ice. That's different from back pain that begins during the course of regular movements, says Dr. Atlas. In other words, if your back starts to hurt when you lean over to tie your shoe, that's not an injury.
              
            
          
        
        How to relieve the pain
        If you're experiencing back pain when sitting, your impulse may be to lie down and then try to slowly progress back to sitting, says Dr. Atlas. But this is the wrong approach. You should lie down to relieve the pain, but the goal should be not to return to sitting, but rather to regain your ability to stand and move.
        ""The goal isn't to get into the chair. The goal is to start moving. Walking is better than sitting,"" he says. Movement is often the best medicine when it comes to relieving pain.
        Treating back pain
        If you can't manage your back pain yourself and opt to see a doctor, it's likely she or he will order treatments that follow a course similar to what you can do at home.
        ""There has been a shift away from medical intervention for back pain and an increased emphasis on treatments that don't focus on medication,"" says Dr. Atlas. ""There is also an increased appreciation that even medicines such as acetaminophen have risks, particularly in older adults.""
        A typical course of treatment starts with activity modification, progressing to exercise. ""For patients with severe symptoms, the first line of therapy might be manual treatment, such as massage, chiropractic, or physical therapy,"" says Dr. Atlas.
        Preventing problems
        Movement is the best way to ward off back pain. Regular physical activity can make the back stronger to reduce future episodes of pain. Exercises should focus on increasing strength and improving range of motion — as well as ensuring balance on both sides of the body, as some back pain can start when one side of the body is stronger than the other.
        In addition, whenever possible, avoid prolonged sitting. If you sit at a desk in the office all day, get up periodically — at least every 30 minutes — and walk around. Walk to get a drink of water or to pick up your mail. Take breaks throughout the course of the day to prevent future bouts of pain.
        Simple exercises for a healthy back
        Some simple exercises (done with the approval of your doctor) can help keep back pain at bay. These exercises build not only strength, but also flexibility.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-gut-healthier-aging,"Healthy gut, healthier aging","Support beneficial microbes in the gastrointestinal tract with these healthy lifestyle habits.
        
        
          
        
        Trillions of microbes — bacteria, viruses, fungi — call your gut home. They do more than just help you digest food. They fight harmful pathogens; make vitamin K and other important chemicals; affect the way medications work; and may influence your immune system, heart health, and cancer risk. It also appears gut microbes may play a role in healthy aging and longevity. The genes of all your gut microbes are collectively called the gut microbiome.
        Encouraging findings
        In a study published online Feb. 18, 2021, by Nature Metabolism, scientists observed that older adults whose mix of gut microbes changed the most over time lived longer than those people with less change in their gut microbiome.
        The study didn't prove that an eclectic microbiome directly caused people to live longer. However, such a microbiome was also associated with lower cholesterol levels, faster walking speeds, and higher levels of beneficial blood chemicals — all factors that lengthen the life span.
        How do you make your gut microbiome more diverse and achieve health benefits? It mainly comes down to lifestyle factors. Indeed, one of the reasons that a healthy lifestyle may protect your health is through the impact of your lifestyle on your microbiome.
        Eat a healthy diet
        Eating the right foods is one of the best ways. Your gut microbes like to eat, too, and their favorite foods are the ones that are healthiest for us: fruits, vegetables (especially dark, leafy greens), legumes (beans, peas), and whole grains (quinoa, whole wheat, brown rice). ""Those foods contain fiber. Our bodies don't break down fiber for food; fiber passes through to the gut and microbes feed on it. It gives them a good environment to grow,"" explains April Pawluk, strategic program manager at the Harvard Chan Microbiome in Public Health Center.
        But when you eat an unhealthy diet with lots of processed, fatty, sugary foods, it makes it harder for helpful microbes to survive. ""In the absence of diversity-promoting nutrients like fiber in our diets, the genes of our gut microbiome can produce chemicals that could increase our risk for developing different diseases,"" Pawluk says.
        Exercise
        Exercising appears to promote gut microbiome diversity, but the way it works is a matter of speculation, ­Pawluk says. Several ways are plausible. ""It could be that exercise changes the rate at which material moves through the intestines. Or perhaps exercise reduces inflammation in the gut. Or exercise might alter our appetite, and alter the way that our bodies process the food we eat. All of these could affect the microbiome environment,"" Pawluk says.
        Get a dog
        Dogs are always tracking things in from outside — like dirt, grass, and insects — exposing their human families to more microbes. That might help counteract the effect of a modern world on the microbiome.
        ""Over the past century, there's been a decrease in the diversity of the human microbiome, possibly because of sanitation and modern medicine,"" Pawluk says. ""Studies looking at young children growing up in a house with a pet show their microbiome becomes more diverse and they have less risk of allergies. We don't know if this helps older adults, but it wouldn't hurt.""
        Don't smoke
        Cigarettes contain lots of chemicals and toxins that are harmful to the whole body, including your gut and its residents. ""Smoking can kill some microbes and decrease microbe diversity. Smoking also puts physical stress on the body, including microbes. And when microbes are under stress, they change their function; they sense that they're in a bad situation and in some cases attack each other — or us. That can cause imbalance in the gut microbiome,"" Pawluk says.
        Consider probiotics
        One last suggestion that may affect the gut microbiome is to ingest colonies of ""good"" bacteria known as probiotics, which come in pills or powders or occur naturally in fermented foods (such as yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut). ""The intention is to boost the amount of beneficial bacteria in the gut,"" Pawluk says. ""If you've recently taken antibiotics, which kill both harmful and beneficial bacteria, probiotics may help re-establish a diverse microbiome. The thing is, if you already have a diverse gut microbiome, adding more of one species probably isn't going to promote any significant change.""
        But Pawluk says there's no evidence probiotics are harmful, especially when they come from food. And there are many reasons why you might want to eat healthy probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, which has lots of calcium, or try any of the lifestyle habits we've laid out here. They all benefit health in numerous ways.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/want-probiotics-but-dislike-yogurt-try-these-foods-202107142918,Want probiotics but dislike yogurt? Try these foods,"The top item on my grocery list is always yogurt: unsweetened, organic, made with almond milk. I'm always afraid I'll run out since I use it all the time. I put two tablespoons in every smoothie, switch it out for mayo, and nothing beats a cool cup on a hot day as an afternoon snack.
        Besides healthy doses of calcium and protein, yogurt is a prime source for probiotics, the ""good"" live bacteria and yeasts. Why are these helpful? Having a proper balance of bacteria in your gut improves digestion, blocks dangerous organisms that can cause infections, and boosts your immune system. It also helps your body absorb vital nutrients from food.
        What to know about probiotics
        Unlike vitamins, there is no recommended daily intake for probiotics, so there is no way to know which type of bacteria or quantities are best. The general guideline is to add some foods with probiotics to your daily diet.
        Hundreds of ingestible bacteria are classified as probiotics. The two found in most probiotic foods are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, each of which contains various strains. On food labels, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are often abbreviated as L. or B. and then combined with name of a specific strain. So, the strain acidophilus within the Lactobacillus bacteria is written as L. acidophilus.
        Probiotics in yogurt
        This brings us back to yogurt, which often contains L. acidophilus.
        Yogurt is a popular probiotic food because it's widely available, and there are different ways to consume it. Some brands include a Live & Active Cultures (LAC) seal from the International Dairy Foods Association to verify probiotic content. Otherwise, look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label. (Also, many fruit or sweetened varieties have too much sugar, so check labels for that, too.)
        Looking beyond yogurt for probiotics
        What if you are not a yogurt enthusiast, or simply want more options? Luckily, many other foods also serve up a good dose of good bacteria. They come in various flavors and textures, so odds are you will find a few to your liking.
        Kefir. This yogurtlike drink has a tart flavor, with a thinner consistency than yogurt. The beverage is usually made with dairy milk, but also comes in non-dairy alternatives, like coconut water, coconut milk, and rice milk. Kefir also comes in fruit and vegetable flavors, or you can add flavors yourself like cinnamon, vanilla, and pumpkin spice. It is also an excellent base for smoothies.
        Kimchi. Kimchi is a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish made with a mix of garlic, salt, vinegar, and chili peppers. It's often served alone or mixed with rice or noodles. You can also add it to scrambled eggs or on top of potatoes. You can find it at most grocery stores or Asian markets.
        Kombucha. This fermented tea drink has a tangy-tart flavor. Kombucha contains caffeine comparable to some other tea drinks. Some brands have added sugar, so check the label and avoid anything with more than 5 grams of sugar per serving.
        Miso. A popular paste in Japanese cuisine, miso is made from soybeans fermented with brown rice. It has a strong, salty flavor, and a little goes a long way. Use it as a dipping sauce, spread over your toast, or add it to marinades for fish, meats, and vegetables.
        Pickles. Not every type of pickle will do. Look for brands brined in water and sea salt instead of vinegar.
        Sauerkraut. Sauerkraut is pickled cabbage and may be an acquired taste. (I am a fan thanks to my German-born grandmother, who made me Reuben sandwiches as a kid.) Use it as a hot dog topper, mix it into salads, or combine it with your regular side vegetables. Always choose raw or non-pasteurized sauerkraut. It contains more probiotics than commercial sauerkraut, which loses much of its bacteria from pasteurization.
        Tempeh. Tempeh is a cake made from fermented soybeans, with a firmer texture than tofu. It is a popular meat substitute — try it as a veggie burger patty, or add to pasta sauce. Tempeh often comes precooked and ready to eat, but some brands may need cooking.",Matthew Solan,"July 18, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/4-ways-to-tame-tension-headaches,4 ways to tame tension headaches,"If you ever had a tension headache, you know it can put a damper on your day. This kind of headache usually develops in the afternoon, causing mild or moderate pain that may feel like dull tightness or a band of pressure.
        What is a tension headache?
        Tension headaches are also known as ordinary headaches, muscle tension headaches, and stress headaches. Tension in neck, shoulder, and scalp muscles often accompanies the head pain. Some people experience tension headaches from time to time; others get them more often.
        While a tension headache is rarely debilitating, it can certainly make life miserable. The discomfort usually lasts 20 minutes to two hours, but it may be present throughout most of the day.
        Who gets tension headaches?
        Tension headaches are the most common headache, affecting about three of every four adults at some point in their lives. These headaches may occur at any age but are most common in adults and older teens. This type of headache is slightly more common in women and tends to run in families.
        Tension headache causes
        Tension headaches are not caused by a disease but are often brought or made worse by physical or emotional stress. Triggers of tension headaches also include:
        
          
            Alcohol use
          
          Caffeine (too much or withdrawal)

        How to relieve a tension headache: 4 tips
        If you are prone to tension headaches, here are four strategies that can show you how to get rid of a headache:
        Pay attention to the basics
        Get enough sleep, don't skip meals, and be sure to pace yourself to avoid stress and fatigue.
        Relaxation techniques
        Physical and psychological relaxation therapies can help stave off tension headaches, so long as you practice these techniques regularly. Physical approaches include applying a heating pad to your neck and shoulders to relax the muscles. Exercising these muscles also helps by strengthening and stretching them.
        Guided imagery exercises that help you focus your attention on various parts of your body in order to relax them and release tension and stress can also help.
        Biofeedback
        This relaxation technique requires special training but can help people avoid recurrent tension headaches. Typically, a therapist will attach electrodes to your skin to detect electrical signals from your neck and shoulder muscles. You then learn to recognize when you are becoming tense and practice ways to relax the muscles before they tighten so much that you develop a tension headache.
        Medical approaches
        Some people with tension headaches have very sensitive areas, known as trigger points, at the back of the neck or in the shoulders. Injecting a local anesthetic into these areas may eliminate the pain and prevent the headache from occurring again.
        There are also a number of medications that can help keep tension headaches at bay. If nondrug therapies aren't giving you the relief you need, talk with your doctor about the medication options that might be right for you.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/common-causes-of-constipation,Common causes of constipation,"Many factors can dispose a person to constipation. Some can easily be prevented by changing habits and lifestyle, but often the reason(s) are not so obvious.
        Following are the more common causes of constipation:
        Lack of exercise. People who exercise regularly generally don't develop constipation. Basically, the colon responds to activity. Good muscle tone in general is important for regular bowel movements. The abdominal wall muscles and the diaphragm all play a crucial role in the process of defecation. If these muscles are weak, they're not going to be able to do the job as well. But exercise is not a cure-all. Increasing exercise to improve constipation may be more effective in older people, who tend to be more sedentary, than in younger people.
        Opioids. The digestive tract has receptors for opioids, and constipation can occur (or worsen) when people take opioid pain medications. Opioid-induced constipation occurs in roughly 90% of cancer patients taking opioids for pain and 40% of people taking opioids for chronic noncancer pain.
        Other medications. Constipation is a side effect of many prescription and over-the-counter drugs. These include antacids that contain aluminum, antispasmodics, antidepressants, tranquilizers and sedatives, bismuth salts, iron supplements, diuretics, anticholinergics, calcium-channel blockers, and anticonvulsants.
        Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some people who suffer from IBS have sluggish bowel movements, straining during bowel movements, and abdominal discomfort. Constipation may be the predominant symptom, or it may alternate with diarrhea. Cramping, gas, and bloating are also common.
        Over use of laxatives. Laxatives are sometimes used inappropriately, for example, by people suffering from anorexia nervosa or bulimia. But for people with long-term constipation, the extended use of laxatives may be a reasonable solution. In the past, long-term use of some laxatives was thought to damage nerve cells in the colon and interfere with the colon's innate ability to contract. However, newer formulations of laxatives have made this outcome less common.
        Changes in life or routine. Traveling can give some people problems because it disrupts normal diet and daily routines. Aging often affects regularity by reducing intestinal activity and muscle tone. Pregnancy may cause women to become constipated because of hormonal changes or because the enlarged uterus pushes on the intestine.
        Ignoring the urge. If you have to go, go. If you hold in a bowel movement, for whatever reason, you may be inviting a bout of constipation. People who repeatedly ignore the urge to move their bowels may eventually stop feeling the urge.
        Not enough fiber and fluids in the diet. A diet too low in fiber and fluids and too high in fats can con-tribute to constipation. Fiber absorbs water and causes stools to be larger, softer, and easier to pass. Increasing fiber intake helps cure constipation in many people, but those with more severe constipation sometimes find that increasing fiber makes their constipation worse and leads to gassiness and discomfort.
        Other causes. Diseases that can cause constipation include neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, or multiple sclerosis; metabolic and endocrine disorders, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease; bowel cancer; and diverticulitis. A number of systemic conditions, like scleroderma, can also cause constipation. In addition, intestinal obstructions, caused by scar tissue (adhesions) from past surgery or strictures of the colon or rectum, can compress, squeeze, or narrow the intestine and rectum, causing constipation.

          Q.
          My partner just got diagnosed with a hiatal hernia. What is it, and is it dangerous?
        
        A. Hiatal hernias are very common. They occur when part of the stomach pokes through a natural gap (called a hiatus) in the diaphragm, which is a muscle separating your chest from your abdomen. Normally the esophagus connects with the stomach through this hole, but in some cases, the upper part of the stomach slides upward through the hiatus. The most common cause is weakened musculature that surrounds the hiatus, which can be aggravated by straining during bowel movements, intense coughing, pregnancy, or heavy exertion.
        While many people who have a hiatal hernia have no symptoms, acid reflux is common. The hernia can change the position and function of the lower esophageal sphincter — a circular muscle at the base of the esophagus that normally keeps acid inside the stomach. The sphincter does not always close when it should, allowing irritating stomach acid to escape into the esophagus, which can cause heartburn.
        The good news is that most people with a hiatal hernia don't need treatment, and fewer than 5% of people with a hiatal hernia need surgery to fix the problem. If you are experiencing acid reflux symptoms, such as heartburn, it may be helpful to eat smaller meals and avoid eating within two hours of bedtime at night. If your doctor thinks it's necessary, you may also want to take an antacid.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/the-impact-of-stress-on-your-gut,The impact of stress on your gut,"Given how closely the gut and brain interact, it might seem obvious that the pair often influence each other. Some people feel nauseated before giving a presentation; others feel intestinal pain during times of stress. In any case, emotional and psychosocial factors play a role in functional gastrointestinal disorders.
        Treating the whole body
        Stress-related symptoms felt in the gastrointestinal tract vary greatly from one person to the next, and treatment can vary as well. For example, one person with gastroesophageal reflux disease might have an occasional, mild burning sensation in the chest, while another experiences excruciating discomfort night after night. As the severity of symptoms varies, so should the therapies, medications, self-help strategies, or even surgeries used to relieve them.
        Many people have mild symptoms that respond quickly to changes in diet or medications. If your symptoms do not improve, your clinician may ask you more questions about your medical history and perform some diagnostic tests to rule out an underlying cause. For some people, symptoms improve as soon as a serious diagnosis, like cancer, has been ruled out. Your doctor may also recommend symptom-specific medications.
        But sometimes these treatments are not enough. If symptoms persist, it's common to experience psychological distress.
        Some people are reluctant to accept the role of psycho-social factors in their illness. But it's important to know that emotions cause genuine chemical and physical responses in the body that can result in pain and discomfort.
        Cognitive behavioral therapy and stress reduction techniques such as meditation and relaxation therapies can help manage pain and improve other symptoms in ways that are different from how drugs act. The goal of all therapies is to reduce anxiety, encourage healthy behaviors, and help people cope with the pain and discomfort of their condition.

          Q.
          I'm trying to add more probiotics into my diet. Is cheese a good source?
        
        A. Probiotics, good bacteria that can contribute to gut and overall health, can be found in some types of cheese as well as in dietary supplements, fermented foods, and yogurt. Typically, probiotics are in cheeses that have been aged but not heated afterward. This includes both soft and hard cheeses, including Swiss, provolone, Gouda, cheddar, Edam, Gruyère, and cottage cheese.
        Adding probiotics to your diet can potentially improve your health by helping to foster the growth of good bacteria inside your gut. Your gut contains some 100 trillion bacteria, but in some cases, the balance between the helpful and harmful bacteria falls out of balance. When this occurs, experts believe it may be linked to a host of conditions, such as allergies, mood disorders, and arthritis. Eating foods that contain probiotics, such as cheese, can help restore this natural balance. The only caution when it comes to cheese is to not overdo it. Cheese tends to be high in calories, saturated fat, and sodium.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/looking-out-for-diverticulitis-202108162572,Looking out for diverticulitis,"Most people don't have much in common with Pope Francis. But about 200,000 Americans each year can say they share an experience with the head of the Catholic Church: they had surgery for diverticulitis.
        Although Pope Francis recovered well from his procedure in July, it shed light on this potentially serious condition of the colon. If you have questions about why diverticulitis occurs, the most common signs of this condition, and how it is treated, read on.
        What is diverticulitis?
        Diverticulitis arises from a condition called diverticulosis, which occurs when weak areas in the inner wall of the colon bulge outward and form tiny pouches. Many people get diverticulosis as they age. In fact, diverticulosis affects about 58% of US adults over age 60. Getting enough fiber in your diet can help protect against diverticulosis.
        Most people are unaware they even have this condition. Often the diagnosis of diverticulosis is first mentioned in a report when a person has a colonoscopy or had an abdominal CT scan for another reason. Diverticulosis doesn't cause symptoms, but people who have irritable bowel syndrome or who are prone to constipation, bloating, and abdominal discomfort after eating are more likely to have it.
        ""While diverticulosis is very common, only a small percentage of people who have it will ever develop diverticulitis caused by inflammation or infection of one of the pouches,"" says Dr. Matthew Hamilton, a gastroenterologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Know the signs of diverticulitis
        The most common symptoms of diverticulitis are abdominal pain (usually on the lower left side) and fever. The pain is distinct and sharp, and may strike over a few hours. Other symptoms may include a combination of loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating and cramping, and not passing gas or stool.
        A mild case of diverticulitis that causes only minimal pain in the lower abdomen can resolve on its own within a day or two. However, you should seek immediate medical attention if your symptoms are not going away or you are feeling worse, such as having increasing pain, fever, bloody stools, or abdominal bloating with vomiting.
        Treatment depends on whether you have uncomplicated or complicated diverticulitis. Your doctor can determine this by using a combination of blood tests and imaging studies, such as a CT scan.
        How is uncomplicated diverticulitis treated?
        As the name implies, uncomplicated diverticulitis is the less serious of the two. It means that the inflammation or infection is confined to one section of the colon, and that there is no evidence of complicating factors.
        Uncomplicated diverticulitis is typically treated at home with oral antibiotics. You'll also be prescribed ""bowel rest"" for a few days, which often includes a clear liquid diet. This gives your bowel a chance to rest and heal, and may reduce pain. Additionally, you'll follow a low-fiber diet (about 10 to 15 grams of fiber a day) until your symptoms improve.
        Some people may need to be hospitalized to receive intravenous (IV) antibiotics. A hospital stay is more likely if you're 65 or older or have other medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
        People usually begin to feel improvement from treatment after about three days. If you feel well enough and the symptoms have subsided, you can gradually resume your regular diet.
        If symptoms haven't responded to antibiotics after a week, you probably will undergo CT scans and other tests to see if you have complicated diverticulitis.
        How is complicated diverticulitis treated?
        Complicated diverticulitis means you have a specific complication that requires a longer course of IV antibiotics, and possibly surgery.
        Pope Francis had scarring in a segment of colon where he previously had diverticulitis, which had caused a narrowing in the colon called stenosis. In a case like this, the unhealthy part of the colon is removed, and the remaining colon is then reconnected.
        Other types of complications that may occur during an active diverticulitis infection include:
        
          Abscess. A diverticular abscess is a collection of pus (a fluid that can form at the site of infection) outside of the intestinal wall. If the abscess doesn't get better with antibiotics, a doctor will need to drain the pus using a needle, under guidance through images on a CT scan.
          Perforation. Diverticulitis can cause a hole in the colon that allows bowel contents to spill into the abdominal cavity. If you have a perforation, your abdomen may feel tender to touch, hard, or enlarged. Surgery repairs the hole. Sometimes part of the colon around the hole must be removed.
          Fistula. A fistula is an abnormal connection between the inflamed and infected segment of the colon and adjacent organs, such as other parts of the intestine or the bladder. Surgery consists of colon resection and removing the fistula.
        
        Can diverticulitis be prevented?
        Eating a high-fiber diet and managing stress may lower the risk of developing pouches in the colon known as diverticula. So it makes sense that these lifestyle interventions might help make diverticulitis less likely to occur. However, once you have diverticulosis, there is no proven way to prevent one of the diverticula from becoming infected or inflamed.",Matthew Solan,"July 18, 2023"

What does that mean?However, it's also possible that some older people and their families just don't recognize the resulting changes as being caused by a stroke. Sometimes, these strokes cause temporary balance problems or clumsiness in an arm or leg that people attribute to another cause. In addition, people can experience a series of silent strokes, which can manifest as memory lapses or subtle changes in mood. When people experience a number of silent strokes over time, it can lead to a condition called multi-infarct dementia.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-you-should-move-even-just-a-little-throughout-the-day,Why you should move — even just a little — throughout the day,"Sitting for long, uninterrupted periods of time may leave you more prone to cardiovascular problems.
        
        
          
        
        How much time do you spend sitting each day? If you're like most people, more than half of your waking hours are spent parked on a chair or sofa. Even if you dedicate at least 30 minutes a day to structured exercise (such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming), it's still important to get up and move for at least a few minutes, many times throughout the day.
        ""The more you sit, the more your large muscles are not using glucose, the body's main energy source. Uninterrupted sitting can cause blood sugar levels to rise, triggering the release of insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar,"" says Dr. Hicham Skali, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Over time, sedentary habits cause the body to become less sensitive to insulin. The resulting insulin resistance promotes inflammation, a key player in the buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries, he explains.
        Preliminary evidence from studies in rats suggests that sedentary behavior may change the activity of dozens of genes, including the gene responsible for making lipoprotein lipase (LPL). This enzyme helps break down fat so it can be used for energy or stored in the body. When rats were prevented from moving, LPL levels decreased, a change that may also contribute to raising heart disease risk, Dr. Skali explains.
        Don't just sit there
        The evidence about the harms of uninterrupted sitting (and the benefits of breaking it up) has been piling up for years, aided by tools such as fitness trackers that reveal people's typical activity patterns. Here are just a few examples of supportive studies:
        
          More than 2,600 people ages 60 and older reported their typical sitting habits (including a weekday and weekend) and were followed for nine years. Those who sat for an average of about three hours a day were 33% less likely to die of cardiovascular disease during the follow-up period than people who sat for an average of about seven hours a day.
          Among 8,000 people followed for 10 years, those who did light activity instead of sitting for 30 minutes each day had a 17% lower risk of dying in that period, even if they split up that half-hour of activity into periods as brief as a minute each.
          In more than 5,600 women followed for five years, reducing sedentary time by one hour per day was linked to a 26% lower risk of heart disease. Again, the hour of non-sedentary time didn't have to occur all at once. Short, light-intensity interruptions to sitting were just as effective.
        
        Making the moves
        There are many ways you can add short bursts of movement to your daily routine. Whenever you notice you've been sitting for a while, do a short set of exercises — say five to 10 squats or leg lifts, Dr. Skali suggests. You can also keep a stretchy exercise band near your favorite chair to get some arm exercises in as well. Here are some other ideas:
        Set a reminder. Many fitness trackers feature alerts that remind you to get up at least once an hour. But you can also use a smartphone or a regular kitchen timer; use it during periods when you tend to sit for long stretches.
        Take care of your chores less efficiently. Put your groceries or other purchases in small bags and make multiple trips from your car to your home. Stand up while folding laundry, and put just a few items of clothing away at a time to get more steps in.
        Pace or tidy up during phone calls. Whenever you're on the phone, stand up. Try to walk back and forth or in circles while you talk. Or use a hands-free headset and do some light housework while you chat.
        Move a little while you watch TV. The average American watches close to five hours of television a day, and that amount increases as people age. At least once an hour, stand up and march in place, swing your arms, or do some easy stretches.
        Take the long way. Whenever you drive somewhere, park in a spot farther from the door to get in some extra steps. Take the stairs instead of the escalator or elevator, even if you climb only one or two of the total flights.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/extreme-heat-staying-safe-if-you-have-health-issues-202108062563,Extreme heat: Staying safe if you have health issues,"It's only July, yet crushing heat waves have hovered over parts of the US this summer. And dangerous, sometimes deadly heat waves are increasingly common around the globe.
        Heat combined with humidity –– or high temperatures alone –– can make it difficult for your body to cool off sufficiently, especially if you have a chronic health condition such as asthma, heart disease, or diabetes. Here's what you need to know.
        
          Which health conditions require special attention when heat rises?
        
        Most of us know someone who is at risk from too much heat. Older people, and anyone taking medicine that affects the body's ability to hold onto water, such as diuretics, may be more vulnerable to heat illness. If you have any of the following conditions, it's important to be cautious during days when the heat index is high.
        
          Heart disease: Heat may increase the chances of heart attacks, heart arrhythmias, and heart failure.
          Asthma: Anyone with asthma, especially children, may find it more difficult to breathe on hot days. Some evidence suggests that inhalers stored in extreme heat may not work as well, possibly dispensing less than a full dose of medication.
          Lung conditions: Heat can irritate the lungs, causing flare-ups for adults who smoke, or have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — even for those spending most of their time indoors. Heat also increases ozone air pollution and the risk of dehydration, both of which can make breathing more difficult.
          Mental health: There's strong evidence of more instances of suicide, homicide, and violent crime on extremely hot days. Heat may also influence symptom severity in people with mood disorders and schizophrenia.
          Diabetes: People who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes have a harder time regulating body temperature and blood glucose when it gets hot out. Extreme heat can also damage insulin, insulin pumps, and glucose monitors.
          Pregnancy: Higher temperatures and air pollution may increase the risk that a baby is born too early or with a low birthweight.
        
        How else does extreme heat affect the body?
        Anyone can experience an imbalance  of essential minerals in the blood known as electrolytes during periods of extreme heat. But this is especially true for people with diabetes, heart disease or abnormal kidney function. When this occurs, a person may feel fatigue, nausea, or a headache.
        In extreme instances, heart attack, irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmia), or problems with other organs may occur. Data from millions of people enrolled in Medicare show that hospital admissions during heat waves lasting two or more days are most often due to heat stroke, sunstroke, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and acute kidney failure. Among older adults, heightened risk for hospital admission lasted up to five days after the hottest day.
        Put a cooling plan into action
        Keep it simple: learn how to avoid, spot, and treat heat-related illness, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises. Right now, we do not have sufficient evidence to recommend actions like changing medication regimens, or staying indoors at one temperature and not others. Talk to your doctor about your situation, and take steps to take control of your health when it's hot outside.
        
          Have a plan in place for staying cool at home or going to a neighborhood cooling center. Don't wait for a heat alert before taking action if you have a chronic health problem or take multiple medicines. Your personal risk of getting sick from the heat may increase at temperatures below when heat alerts are often called, or sometimes when heat alerts aren't called at all.
          Check a weather forecast first thing in the morning and pay attention to days that are hotter than usual for where you live — and especially to how being outside on those days may affect your health. The New York Times maps dangerous heat zones and offers a heat index forecast for major cities and locales across the US.
          If your symptoms are already flaring on days when it will be hot outside, you'll need to be more cautious about going out. If you do go outside, try to stay in the shade. Stay alert to how you're feeling and find a cool place inside if you feel symptoms arise.
          Stay hydrated by drinking water and drinks that replenish electrolytes. Some sports drinks have electrolytes but may have lots of sugar. That can be a problem for people with diabetes, so read labels carefully.
        
        The bottom line
        Climate change makes it likely we will experience longer and hotter heat waves. If you have existing health conditions, take steps now to protect your health. Talk to your doctor about how heat might affect you, and decide on a plan to help you stay cool. Staying informed and attuned to any symptoms you experience will help.

        mCRPC sets in when the front-line hormonal therapies that doctors use first for treating metastatic prostate cancer stop working. These drugs limit the body's production of testosterone, a hormone that fuels prostate cancer growth. If they are no longer effective, then doctors switch to a different class of drugs known as anti-androgens that further inhibit testosterone by blocking its cell receptor. One of those drugs is called enzalutamide.
        The newly approved treatment combines enzalutamide with a second drug, talazoparib, that was already on the market for female cancer patients who test positive for BRCA mutations. These inherited gene defects boost risks for breast and ovarian cancer, but they can also elevate risks for prostate cancer in men. Indeed, an estimated 10% of men with metastatic prostate cancer are BRCA-positive.
        Talazoparib inhibits a DNA-repair system called PARP that the tumor cells need to keep their own genes in working order. When PARP is blocked by treatment, the cancer cells will eventually die. Other PARP inhibitors, including olaparib and rucaparib, are already approved for advanced prostate cancer in BRCA-positive men.
        During research leading to this latest approval, 399 men with mCRPC were randomly divided into two groups. One group received talazoparib plus enzalutamide; the other group was treated with enzalutamide plus placebo. The men averaged 70 years in age, and most of them had already been treated with chemotherapy and/or a different anti-androgen called abiraterone. All the men were positive for either BRCA mutations or defects affecting other DNA-repair genes.
        What the study showed
        Results from the still-unpublished study were presented at the 2023 American Society of Oncology Annual Meeting in June. After a median follow-up of roughly 17 months, the enzalutamide/talazoparib combination reduced the risk of death or visible signs of tumor progression by 55%.
        Among the specific subgroup of BRCA-positive patients, ""there was an 80% reduction in risk progression or death, which is enormous for these men and obviously very welcome,"" said lead researcher Dr. Karim Fizazi, a professor at the University of Paris-Saclay in France.
        Scientists had hoped that combining PARP inhibitors with anti-androgens would similarly benefit prostate cancer patients with no DNA-repair defects, but evidence from a different study by Dr. Fizazi and his colleagues shows they do not.
        For that reason, the FDA approved the new combination only for mCRPC patients who test positive for mutations affecting DNA-repair genes. Dr. Fizazi and his colleagues are continuing to monitor the enrolled patients for improvements in other areas, such as overall survival, quality of life, and subsequent need for chemotherapy.
        Dr. David Einstein, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a medical oncologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, says the evidence helps to confirm that PARP inhibitors have a role to play in genetically-selected men with mCRPC. Additional research is needed to assess if the observed benefits are ""specific to the combination or just because access to PARP inhibition was provided at some point in the disease course,"" he says.
        ""Genetic testing for BRCA, which originally targeted females, is now becoming mainstream for men with a family history of breast and ovarian cancers, as well as men with mCRPC regardless of family history,"" says Dr. Marc B. Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""This is important, as it has implications for other family members and treatment choices alike. Also important to note is that where this study enrolled men who had already been treated with chemotherapy and/or abiraterone, future research will likely move the enzalutamide/talazoparib combination — or components of it — to earlier disease stages.""",Charlie Schmidt,"July 12, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-warning-signs-of-early-heart-failure,5 warning signs and symptoms of early heart failure,"It's an unfortunate truth that your body slows down in your sixth and seventh decades. Climbing a flight of stairs that you once took two at a time can now feel as daunting as scaling Mount Everest. While some degree of vitality loss can be attributed to natural aging, fatigue and breathlessness may also be signals that your heart is not functioning as well as it should.
        Causes of heart failure
        Heart failure occurs when something damages the heart muscle or reduces the heart's ability to pump effectively. Most often, the damage stems from coronary artery disease or heart attack. But faulty heart valves, longstanding high blood pressure, or genetic disease may also be to blame. No matter what the cause, the failing heart can no longer pump well enough to keep up with the body's demand for oxygen-rich blood.
        Early heart failure symptoms
        ""There is a general tendency for people to ignore heart failure symptoms and attribute them to just getting older. Therefore, it was very important for us to create an easy way to identify those symptoms,"" says Dr. Mandeep R. Mehra, medical director of the Heart and Vascular Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        FACES of heart failure
        To help both doctors and patients quickly spot a possible combination of heart failure symptoms, the Heart Failure Society of America developed a handy tool that goes by the acronym FACES.
        F = Fatigue. When the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the body's energy needs, a general feeling of tiredness or fatigue sets in.
        A = Activity limitation. People with heart failure are often unable to do their normal activities because they become easily tired and short of breath.
        C = Congestion. Fluid buildup in the lungs can result in coughing, wheezing, and breathing difficulty.
        E = Edema or ankle swelling. When the heart doesn't have enough pumping power to force used blood back up from the lower extremities, fluid can collect in the ankles, legs, thighs, and abdomen. Excess fluid can also cause rapid weight gain.
        S = Shortness of breath. Fluid in the lungs makes it more difficult for carbon dioxide in used blood to be exchanged for fresh oxygen. It may also be harder to breathe when lying down, because gravity allows fluid from below the lungs to travel up the torso.
        By themselves, these five warning signs do not confirm a diagnosis of heart failure, but they do convey a sense of urgency to seek medical advice, says Dr. Mehra.
        Heart failure testing
        In addition to the physical exam, doctors have two other important tools to spot the presence of heart failure. The first is an echocardiogram (often called an echo), which is a simple, noninvasive test that uses ultrasound to create images of your heart while it beats. If the echo shows a lower-than-normal percentage of blood leaving the heart when the left ventricle contracts, there is a strong possibility of heart muscle damage.
        Other findings that point to heart failure include abnormal thickening and ballooning of the heart wall and malfunctioning heart valves.
        The next step in identifying early-onset heart failure is to look for biomarkers in the blood, such as B-type natriuretic peptide, which is released when the heart is under stress. ""I call these compounds 'tears from the heart' because they show that the heart is crying for help,"" says Dr. Mehra. Once the initial diagnosis is confirmed, further testing may be needed to figure out what's causing the heart's dysfunction and determine the best treatment approach.
        Heart failure treatment options
        Heart failure caused by damage to the heart that has developed over time can't be cured. But it can be treated, often with strategies to improve symptoms. Your doctor will work with you to develop a treatment plan which may include lifestyle changes, medications, devices and surgical procedures, as well as ongoing care.
        
          
            
              
                Drugs to avoid when you have heart failure
                People with heart failure often take multiple medications. However, several commonly used prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, and supplements can interact dangerously to intensify heart failure symptoms. To be on the safe side, make sure all of your medical providers have a complete list of all the medicines you take. Particular compounds to watch out for include these:
                
                  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This class of widely used painkillers, which includes ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), can worsen heart failure symptoms by causing the body to retain sodium and fluid.
                  Heartburn medicines and cold remedies. These over-the-counter aids often contain high amounts of sodium, which can trigger fluid overload.
                  Herbal remedies. Many so-called natural supplements contain substances such as ephedra, St. John's wort, ginseng, hawthorn, black cohosh, and green tea. All can react badly with several common heart medications.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/salty-diet-linked-to-narrowed-arteries-in-the-heart-and-neck,Salty diet linked to narrowed arteries in the heart and neck,"The more salt people eat, the greater their risk of clogged heart and neck arteries, a new study suggests. Arteries narrowed by plaque (atherosclerosis) can lead to heart attacks and strokes.
        The study, published in March 2023 in the European Heart Journal Open, included 10,788 people ages 50 to 64. Researchers estimated each participant's salt intake by measuring levels of sodium (the main component of salt) in 24-hour urine collections. The study volunteers all received heart imaging tests and ultrasounds of their neck arteries to look for signs of atherosclerosis.
        The higher the participant's urinary sodium, the greater the amount of artery-narrowing plaque in their necks and hearts. A high-salt diet is closely linked to high blood pressure, an important cause of atherosclerosis. However, the findings were consistent even among people with only mildly elevated blood pressure (below 140/90 mm Hg). This suggests that even people without high blood pressure should watch their salt intake, said the authors.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/covid-19s-cardiac-legacy-an-update,COVID-19's cardiac legacy: An update,"More than three years into the COVD-19 pandemic, most Americans have been infected with the coronavirus at least once. It's now clear that these infections can have lingering effects on the cardiovascular system, including among people with no previous evidence of heart disease. Even a mild infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) may increase your risk of a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure up to a year after you recover from the infection, as reported in the July 2022 Heart Letter.
        Now, a new study reveals a higher risk of additional heart complications in people with post-COVID conditions (PCC), commonly known as long COVID (see ""Long COVID: Lingering effects throughout the body""). Published March 3, 2023, in JAMA Health Forum, the study relied on health insurance claims data from more than 40,000 people throughout the United States during the first year of the pandemic.
        Compared with people without a diagnosis of PCC, those with PCC were more than 3.5 times as likely to later have a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) and more than twice as likely to develop a heart rhythm problem such as atrial fibrillation. In addition, the risk of stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure were approximately twice as common in people with PCC.
        
          
            
              
                Long COVID: Lingering effects throughout the body
                An estimated 10% to 13% of people infected with COVID-19 have lingering, debilitating symptoms, known as post-COVID conditions (PCC). Also called long COVID, PCC is defined as new, returning, or ongoing health problems that occur or persist for four or more weeks after a COVID infection.
                Symptoms might include fatigue, cough, pain (joint, throat, chest), loss of taste or smell, shortness of breath, brain fog, and depression. The CDC has a more detailed list; see health.harvard.edu/loncov.
                The COVID Recovery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital treats people with long COVID, many of whom are young, previously healthy athletic women who now have many of the classic symptoms of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, or POTS, which is described in detail in the October 2021 Heart Letter.
              
            
          
        
        Vaccine victory
        However, this evidence was gleaned before COVID vaccines were widely available, starting in early 2021. ""New research shows that being vaccinated against COVID can significantly lower the risk of serious heart problems, including heart attack, stroke, and death from heart disease, in people who get COVID,"" says cardiologist Dr. C. Michael Gibson, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The benefits of vaccination are most pronounced in older people, who face the highest risk of heart problems, he adds.
        The finding comes from more than 1.9 million people in the United States ages 18 to 90 who had a COVID-19 infection between March 2020 and February 2022. Even partial vaccination was linked to a lower risk of heart problems, note the authors, whose results appeared March 7, 2023, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
        What about myocarditis?
        Myocarditis — inflammation of the heart muscle — is a rare condition that can arise after a viral infection, including stomach ""flu,"" the common cold, or COVID-19. Although mild myocarditis may go unnoticed, more serious cases can cause severe heart failure and rhythm disturbances.
        Starting in 2021, reports from around the world, including the CDC, noted a possible increased risk of myocarditis after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (made by either Pfizer or Moderna). However, the risk of developing myocarditis is substantially higher immediately following a COVID infection than during the weeks after getting a COVID vaccine. That's according to an analysis of nearly 43 million people in England published Sept. 6, 2022, in Circulation.
        ""Getting just one dose of a COVID vaccine cut the risk of myocarditis in half,"" says Dr. Gibson. But it's worth noting that severe myocarditis is very rare. In this yearlong study, just one in 15,000 people was hospitalized for or died of myocarditis.
        Because COVID vaccines also reduce the risk of other serious heart complications, the risk-benefit calculation is vastly in favor of getting vaccinated, says Dr. Gibson. Vaccines also appear to lower the risk of developing long COVID, so be sure to stay up to date with current CDC vaccination recommendations.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/statins-may-have-no-effect-on-exercise-pain,Statins may have no effect on exercise pain,"A common complaint among statin users is that the cholesterol-lowering drugs increase pain during and after exercise. A study published April 11, 2023, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology counters this perceived connection. Researchers recruited 100 people (average age 65). Two-thirds were taking statins, mostly simvastatin (Zocor) or atorvastatin (Lipitor). The group participated in a walking event in which they trekked either 18, 25, or 31 miles on each of four consecutive days. Muscle pain, fatigue scores, and levels of enzymes associated with muscle injury were measured before and after the event. The researchers found that pain, fatigue, and enzyme levels increased similarly for all participants whether or not they took statins or had existing muscle pain.
        According to the researchers, the new findings suggest that the drugs won't exacerbate usual pain symptoms from moderate-intensity exercise.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/older-men-continue-to-have-excessive-psa-testing,Older men continue to have excessive PSA testing,"The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in men ages 70 and older. Even so, men in this age group still have too many PSA tests, according to two recent studies.
        In the first study, published in April 2023 in Urology, researchers identified 3 million men who had regular PSA tests between 2003 and 2019. Men ages 70 and older were more likely than younger men to have high-frequency PSA testing, defined as having tests more than once every nine months.
        The results also showed that the older men with high-frequency testing were significantly more likely to have prostate biopsies and receive prostate cancer diagnoses compared to older men screened less frequently. However, there was no difference in rates of immediate cancer treatment. According to the researchers, this was an indication that having prostate biopsies, even ones that showed cancer, did not lead to significant differences in recommendations.
        The second study, published online April 11, 2023, by JAMA Network Open, surveyed more than 32,000 men ages 70 and older. Among this group, 55.3% of men ages 70 to 74 had recent PSA screenings. The rate dropped with age, to 52.1% for those ages 75 to 79, and to 39.4% in those 80 and older. Still, the survey found that many men who would not benefit from routine PSA testing were still receiving screening at ages greater than those recommended by the USPSTF. The results also suggested that older men tend to perceive PSA screening as having more advantages than disadvantages. No matter what a man's age, his decision to continue PSA testing should be based on a balanced discussion with his doctor.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/taming-travelers-tummy,Taming traveler's tummy,"Travel is meant to transport you far from the same-old, same-old. But when you're not eating the same foods and sleeping on the same schedule (or even in the same time zone), the ripple effects on digestion can be fierce.
        With more nerve cells than many parts of the central nervous system, including the spinal cord, our gut knows when we're off our routine, says Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Our bodies, including our gastrointestinal tract, respond to circadian rhythms — day-and-night cues,"" he says. ""Your colon will sleep when you sleep and wake up when you do. If those times are shifted by travel and changing time zones, digestion can get thrown off.""
        Factor in heavy meals, too much alcohol, or dehydration from flying, and ""it's sort of a perfect storm to cause digestive problems,"" Dr. Staller says. ""Even the stress of travel itself can trigger them."" The result? Diarrhea, constipation, and indigestion — the trifecta of travelers' tummy troubles — can potentially derail your trip.
        Foodborne dangers
        Travel took a hiatus during the pandemic, but today's packed airplanes, rental car shortages, and booked-solid hotels signal a turnaround. According to U.S. Travel Association predictions, pent-up demand will fuel a surge over the next few years in all types of travel, including to destinations across the globe.
        Far-off locales, however — especially in developing countries — pose the biggest threat of delivering an unpleasant souvenir dubbed traveler's diarrhea. Its abdominal cramps and loose stools stem from eating or drinking germ-laden foods and beverages. Traveler's diarrhea affects an estimated 30% to 70% of travelers, according to the CDC. It can occur anywhere, but the highest-risk destinations are in most of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America.
        The condition typically results from poor hygienic practices in food handling and preparation or a lack of refrigeration. You're also more likely to get it if you're an older adult or — as with traveler's tummy in general — if you already have a digestive problem, such as irritable bowel syndrome, that changes how you eat or eliminate food.
        Microbes aren't the only culprit. ""Some people get so-called adjustment diarrhea, when they haven't ingested anything that's infectious but they're adjusting to new foods or spices,"" Dr. Staller says.
        Keep digestion humming
        The first step in warding off traveler's tummy is to learn from past mistakes, especially if you're prone to digestive upsets. ""The tendency is to arrive somewhere new and embrace it in all aspects,"" Dr. Staller says. ""Instead, keep your food choices more in line with things you eat at home, drink plenty of water, and eat moderate portions.""
        Beyond that, Dr. Staller offers additional strategies to keep indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation at bay:
        Plan ahead. Scope out restaurants and menus beforehand to make sure at least one item seems both palatable and easy to digest. ""This is more difficult, though, if you're more of a spontaneous traveler or staying in someone's home,"" he says.
        Assemble a ""control kit."" Rather than scrambling to purchase remedies in unfamiliar locations, bring along a variety of over-the-counter products to counteract digestive woes on the road. Good choices include antacids (such as Tums) for heartburn; bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate) for indigestion or diarrhea; docusate sodium (Colace, Surfak), psyllium (Metamucil), or bisacodyl (Dulcolax) for constipation; and loperamide (Imodium) for diarrhea. But don't use loperamide if you also have signs of infection such as fever or blood in your stool, Dr. Staller says. Instead, see a doctor.
        Pack familiar snacks. Whether that's granola bars, nuts, trail mix, or dried fruit, these items should be filling. ""There's no one-size-fits-all recommendation, but pick things you might eat at home as a quick snack or even a meal substitute in case you notice that everything at your location is going to disagree with you,"" he says.
        Eat street food with caution. Local delicacies or food truck cuisine are more apt to contain harmful bacteria, especially in developing regions. ""This isn't fun, because some of the tastiest food is street food,"" Dr. Staller says. ""But if you indulge, know you're taking that risk. If you're easily derailed by digestive issues, street food is a no-go.""
        Skip local water and ice. ""In the developing world, assume the water isn't safe unless it's from a bottle,"" he says. Instead, drink only what comes in cans or bottles.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-mouth-taping-help-my-snoring,Can mouth taping help my snoring?,"Q.
          My daughter heard on social media that taping our mouths closed during sleep could improve snoring and lessen bad breath. Is this true?
        
        A. Unfortunately, social media is rife with so-called medical advice that has no basis in science, and this sounds like yet another example. While intentional nose breathing during waking hours can offer many benefits — including slowing breathing, filtering allergens, and easing anxiety — taping your mouth while sleeping to achieve this can prove risky, leading to hampered breathing, disrupted sleep, or skin irritation. There's no research to support the measure, which, in certain cases, could significantly reduce a person's oxygen levels while sleeping.
        If you find you consistently can't breathe through your nose while sleeping, you may have some type of nasal obstruction, such as a deviated septum or a nasal polyp. (Research has linked nasal obstruction with snoring.) You may also have allergies, asthma, or sleep apnea (meaning you briefly and repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping). Talk to your doctor, who may suggest tests to pinpoint the problem's cause.

Many of the devices measure the electrical activity of your heart, similar to an electrocardiogram (ECG) that you'd get in a doctor's office. Those tests in clinical settings measure electrical activity from different points on your chest and limbs for about 15 seconds. But smart watches measure activity from just one spot (your wrist). Is that enough to detect heart problems? Possibly, suggests an analysis published online Feb. 3, 2023, by the European Heart Journal: Digital Health. Scientists asked 83,000 healthy people (ages 50 to 70) to undergo one-lead, 15-second ECGs that mimicked a smart watch ECG, and then followed their health for up to 11 years. After analyzing the recordings, scientists found that people whose ECGs showed a type of extra heartbeats called premature ventricular contractions were more likely to later develop heart failure; people with another type, called premature atrial contractions, were more likely to develop atrial fibrillation. Smart watches are expected to become increasingly useful in spotting early signs of heart problems.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/harvard-study-ditching-sugary-drinks-tied-to-reduced-diabetes-complications,Harvard study: Ditching sugary drinks tied to reduced diabetes complications,"People with diabetes are generally advised to avoid sugary drinks to help control their blood sugar. A Harvard study published online April 19, 2023, by The BMJ shows that avoiding sugary drinks also is linked to dramatically lower risks for cardiovascular disease and early death. Researchers evaluated an average of 18.5 years of health data from more than 15,000 middle-age and older adults with diabetes who reported what they drank. Compared with people who drank coffee, tea, low-fat milk, or water, people who drank sugary drinks — like sugary soda, fruit punch, or lemonade — had much higher health risks: up to 20% higher for early death, 25% higher for developing cardiovascular disease, and 29% higher for cardiovascular-related death. Fortunately, replacing just one daily sugar-sweetened drink with a non-sugary one was tied to as much as an 18% reduced risk of early death and 24% reduced risk of cardiovascular-related death. Even drinking artificially sweetened beverages (like zero-sugar sodas) in lieu of sugary drinks was associated with an 8% lower risk of death from all causes and a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular-related death. This study was observational and therefore can't prove conclusively that avoiding sugary drinks will bring these health benefits in people with diabetes. But it builds on extensive evidence linking sugary drink consumption to chronic disease and early death in people without diabetes, so it's plausible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/time-for-a-new-knee-ask-these-questions-first,Time for a new knee? Ask these questions first,"When a worn knee starts to give you trouble, nonsurgical treatments are the first line of defense. Weight loss, physical therapy, or injections may help reduce your pain. If your knee doesn't respond to those approaches, it's time to consider a joint replacement. And you'll need information to make a decision about the surgery, which is a big commitment.
        Here are some questions to ask, and a sneak peek at what your doctor might say, courtesy of Dr. Antonia Chen, an orthopedic surgeon and director of research for the Division of Adult Reconstruction and Total Joint Arthroplasty at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Q: What should I look for in a knee replacement surgeon?
        Dr. Chen: Ideally your surgeon would be someone who is board-certified in orthopedic surgery, fellowship-trained, and a specialist in knee replacement. But that type of expert might not be available in your community. If not, look for an orthopedic surgeon who's been performing knee replacements for at least two years and make sure the surgeon you choose performs at least two knee replacements a month.
        Q: What type of prosthetic is best?
        Dr. Chen: The gold standard knee replacement is made of cobalt chromium with polyethylene (plastic) in between the metal pieces. Sometimes, the bone behind the kneecap will be replaced with polyethylene (see ""Anatomy of a knee replacement""). There are additional materials, such as titanium or zirconium, that can be used in knee replacements. The best prosthetic will be the one your surgeon is comfortable implanting, unless you have a metal allergy, which you should discuss with your doctor.
        
          
            
              
                Anatomy of a knee replacement
                The knee is a hinge formed by the bottom of the thighbone (femur) and the top of the shin bone (tibia). In front of them is the kneecap (patella). The ends of the bones are cushioned by cartilage. As cartilage wears out over time, the bones rub against each other, causing pain.
                In a knee replacement, the surgeon removes the damaged ends of the thigh and shin bones and replaces them with artificial parts. The prosthetic on the thighbone is made of metal (typically cobalt chromium). The prosthetic on the shin bone is made of metal (typically cobalt chromium or titanium) and has a plastic piece on top. The plastic is polyethylene, a strong, slippery material that acts as cartilage.
                The kneecap may also need to be lined with plastic to glide over the other two bones.

        Q: How should I prepare physically for a knee replacement?
        Dr. Chen: Pre-surgery physical ability predicts your post-surgery physical ability. So work on bending, straightening, and strengthening the knee as much as possible before surgery. Physical therapy can help, and so can exercises that you can do at home.
        Q: How should I prepare my home for recovery?
        Dr. Chen: Remove anything that might cause you to slip and fall, such as throw rugs, floor clutter, and furniture that blocks your path. It will help to have certain types of equipment at home, including a walker and a cane. You can also consider getting a raised toilet seat and a bedside commode, but not every patient will need these.
        Q: Which surgical approach will you take?
        Dr. Chen: There are three main approa­ches. One goes around the kneecap, one goes through the middle of the quadriceps muscles, and one goes underneath the quads. There are pluses and minuses for each one, and it mostly depends on the approach your surgeon is most experienced with.
        Q: Will you use robotic tools?
        Dr. Chen: Some studies have shown that robotic surgery is more precise than traditional surgery. I personally use robotic tools, but robotics are not available at every hospital.
        Q: What are potential surgery complications and what will you do to reduce them?
        Dr. Chen: Knee replacement risks include bleeding, blood clots, and infection. We use devices to stop bleeding at the time of surgery and we may apply a tourniquet. You will likely get an antibiotic before surgery to prevent infection and a blood thinner after surgery to prevent clots.
        Q: Will I have to stay overnight in the hospital?
        Dr. Chen: Most people go home on the day of their surgery or stay overnight in the hospital for one night. Home health services can provide visiting nurses or physical therapists who go to a patient's home after surgery.
        Q: How much pain will I have and how will you treat it?
        Dr. Chen: The first two to six weeks after surgery will be very painful, and we have an extensive plan to treat it. We start right before surgery, giving the patient painkillers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and celecoxib (Celebrex), as well as spinal anesthesia. During surgery, I'll inject a number of different analgesics and anti-inflammatory medicines into the knee. After surgery, we use narcotics such as oxycodone (OxyContin) only sparingly. If necessary, we can prescribe low-level narcotics such as tramadol (Ultram). But we prefer that you use acetaminophen around the clock. It may not work well on its own, but adding a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as naproxen (Aleve) or a nerve medication called gabapentin (Neurontin) can improve pain relief.
        Q: What do you do to ward off stiffness and swelling?
        Dr. Chen: These side effects can happen right after knee surgery. It's important to get right into physical rehabilitation to prevent stiffness. To reduce inflammation, I like my patients to use ice or an ice machine that circulates cold fluid around the leg.
        Q: What will rehab look like?
        Dr. Chen: If you are deconditioned or undergo surgery in both knees at the same time, you might need to go to an in-house rehab facility after surgery and stay for a week or two. If you're stronger, you can go home and have a physical therapist visit the home, or go to an outpatient facility for physical therapy. The rehab process can last up to three months. And it's a year for a full recovery.
        Q: When will I be active again?
        Dr. Chen: You might have to walk with a walker or crutches for one or two weeks, and then walk with a cane or one crutch for another two to four weeks. It can take three to six months to get you back to brisk walking, six to nine months for activities such as tennis or golf, and nine months to one year for skiing.
        Q: How long will the prosthetic last?
        Dr. Chen: The plastic part of the prosthetic knee will wear out in about 15 to 20 years, and you might need surgery to replace it.
        Q: What if I want to wait before considering surgery?
        Dr. Chen: It's your choice: you'll be limited by your pain, and the pain is unlikely to improve. The good news is that waiting won't make your knee much worse. So if you don't want to go through a major surgery and a long recovery, don't do it. Wait until you're ready.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/tips-for-getting-used-to-over-the-counter-hearing-aids,Tips for getting used to over-the-counter hearing aids,"Hearing aids are more accessible and affordable than ever, thanks to a new category of FDA-approved devices. If you (or your family members) think you have mild to moderate hearing loss, you can buy over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids without seeing a doctor, going through hearing tests, or getting a prescription.
        Scoring a pair of OTC devices is just the first step toward better hearing, however. It takes time to learn how to use, wear, and adjust them.
        Know your devices
        There are two types of OTC hearing aids. One comes with a few predetermined settings. The other (called self-fitting) enables you to customize settings, based on a hearing test you take on an app or a manufacturer's website. Both types have volume controls. And both allow you to toggle between settings as needed.
        Prepare for an adjustment period
        The first two weeks you wear hearing aids can be a little bumpy. Your voice may sound different to you, like it has a different volume or quality (an echo or tinny sound) when you speak. And soft sounds, such as running water or shoes brushing along carpet, may sound louder than normal and even a little irritating.
        ""The brain has to adjust. It's like being in a dark room and turning on the light. The room seems too bright until your eyes get used to it,"" says Sarah Hesseltine, an audiologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        To cope during the adjustment period, Hesseltine recommends wearing the hearing aids at home (where there are a lot of soft sounds) for at least a few hours per day, and longer if possible. Also, try not to fiddle with the volume too much. Hesseltine suggests allowing soft sounds to be louder than normal, so the brain will get used to them faster.
        Once soft sounds don't seem as loud, try wearing the hearing aids in other environments, such as the grocery store, the car, or a noisy restaurant.
        
          
            
              
                When to take out your hearing aids
                Hearing aids are vulnerable. They can be easily damaged by heat or moisture, and easily lost if they fall out of your ears while you sleep. So always take out the devices when you go to bed, shower, swim, blow-dry your hair, or go to a salon. And if your hearing aids get wet from perspiration during exercise, give them a break from moisture and let them dry out.
              
            
          
        
        Learn to switch device settings
        Unlike many prescription hearing aids that adjust the volume automatically when there's a significant change in noise around you, OTC hearing aids must be adjusted manually. For example, you might need one setting for watching TV, another for doing yard work, and one for being in a noisy environment, like a restaurant.
        Some situations can be particularly difficult for hearing aid use.
        At a restaurant or party. ""Because of background noise, you probably won't get 100% clarity understanding speech. Even prescription hearing aids have this limitation. The trick is setting the hearing aid to pick up sounds in front of you, and then putting the background noise behind you. So don't sit with a wall behind you at a restaurant; sit with the loud tables behind you,"" Hesseltine says. ""Another option for a conversation at a restaurant is having the person you're chatting with use a remote microphone. It can be placed on the table or worn on the person's lapel. The microphone will send the sound directly to your hearing aids.""
        On a windy day. Wind blowing over the hearing aid microphones creates excessive noise. Hesseltine suggests wearing a hood or a hat to help block the wind and reduce noise.
        During a phone call. Many hearing aids have a microphone that's worn over the ear, which is easy to forget when you're on a phone call. ""If you can't hear someone during a call, try shifting the phone higher, toward the hearing aid microphone,"" Hesseltine suggests. ""If doing that creates loud feedback, such as a whistling or squealing sound, that means the ear piece doesn't fit well and isn't all the way in the ear. Try putting a different-sized tip on the part of the hearing aid that goes into your ear."" (The devices should come with tips in a few sizes.)
        It may take a little trial and error to learn what works best for you, so brace yourself for a learning curve. Most people (and their families) find that the improvement to their hearing is well worth the effort.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/understanding-statin-intensity,Understanding statin intensity,"Q.
          I'm 71 and have taken 20 milligrams (mg) of atorva­statin (Lipitor) since 2010, after an angiogram showed a 90% blockage of a small coronary artery. But I've never had angina or a heart attack. My LDL is 70 mg/dL. Should I switch to 20 mg of rosuvastatin (Crestor), which I understand is a higher-intensity statin?
        
        A. You're correct — a 20-mg dose of rosuvastatin is considered high-intensity statin therapy. Before getting into my advice, let me first explain what we mean by statin intensity.
        Currently, there are eight different cholesterol-lowering statins on the market, each available in different dosages. In general, the higher the dosage, the more they lower your LDL cholesterol. However, some statins (especially rosuvastatin) lower LDL cholesterol better than others. So experts have classified statin therapy into three categories (low, moderate, or high intensity) based on how much they can lower LDL. As you can see by the table below, a statin can fall into more than one intensity category, depending on the dosage. For example, 10 or 20 mg of atorvastatin daily is considered moderate intensity, while 40 to 80 mg is high intensity.
        The choice of a statin depends on a person's risk. For someone with high LDL but no other risk factors or evidence of coronary artery disease, moderate-intensity therapy makes sense. But for someone like you, with known coronary artery disease, the guidelines recommended high-intensity therapy, as several trials have documented a lower risk of heart attack and stroke for people on high-intensity therapy compared with moderate-intensity therapy.
        The guidelines also recommended lowering LDL by 50% or aiming for an LDL of less than 70 mg/dl. Since you are close to that goal and have not had a heart attack, stroke, or other major cardiovascular problem, switching to rosuvastatin is not essential. However, all trials of cholesterol-lowering medications have found that lower is better for LDL. Because rosuvastatin is the most potent statin, switching could provide more protection for you.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/cannabis-a-cardiovascular-concern,Cannabis: A cardiovascular concern?,"Smoking marijuana was once a shady, secretive practice. But the stigma surrounding the drug (also known as cannabis) has started to fade, now that medical and recreational use is legal in many states. Cannabis use is on the rise — including among people in their 60s, 70s, and beyond.
        ""Doctors are trained to ask their patients about marijuana use. But we're still somewhat in the dark about how to educate them about using it safely,"" says Dr. Zara Latif, a third-year internal medicine resident at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. That's mainly because cannabis remains illegal at the federal level, which has restricted research on the drug. But change is afoot: the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act, which seeks to support research on the health effects of cannabis, was signed into law in December 2022.
        Research uncertainties
        For now, most of what we know about cannabis and health comes from observational and case studies that rely on people to report their marijuana use. But frequency and dosage levels are hard to assess with any accuracy, especially among people who use the drug recreationally. Accordingly, much about marijuana's effects — including its impact on the heart — remains unclear, says Dr. Latif, who co-authored a 2020 review in the Journal of Clinical Medicine about cardiovascular problems linked to marijuana use.
        Levels of active components vary widely among different strains of marijuana, and the plant can be as much as 10 times more potent today than it was in the past. In addition, cannabis is now available in a wide array of forms, which are mainly smoked or consumed as foods (called edibles).
        It's also important to recognize that cannabis contains more than 500 chemicals. Some may affect the enzymes in your liver that help metabolize your medications, thereby either raising or lowering the blood levels of any or all of your prescribed drugs, including those you take for heart disease, Dr. Latif adds.
        Cannabis and your heart
        Cannabis is known to increase heart rate and blood pressure, although high doses can have the opposite effect. Marijuana use has been implicated in causing heart attacks, especially in young men with no other risks for heart disease.
        There are also case studies of marijuana use triggering heart rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation, as well as stress cardiomyopathy, in which a sudden surge of adrenalin causes heart muscle damage, leading to chest pain and breathlessness. Arteritis (inflammation of the walls of an artery that limits blood flow) also has been reported following high-dose cannabis use.
        Daily marijuana users were about 34% more likely to develop coronary artery disease compared with people who've never used the drug, according to a study presented at the American College of Cardiology's annual conference, in March 2023. (The findings have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, however.) And cannabis users had between 17% and 24% more strokes than people who did not use the drug, according to a 2022 statement on brain health from the American Heart Association (AHA).
        Emergency department evidence
        In 2021, a Canadian study found higher rates of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for serious cardiovascular problems (including heart attacks and strokes) among people who were authorized to use cannabis for a medical condition. Likewise, hospitalizations and emergency department visits for heart attacks have risen in states where cannabis is legal, the AHA says. In a 2023 study, nearly half of the people who showed up in an Amsterdam emergency department with self-reported cannabis intoxication had heart-related problems, including palpitations, chest pain, and fainting.
        The bottom line
        Given the uncertainties about how the dose, frequency, and formulation of cannabis may affect a specific person, it's hard to give blanket advice about safe cannabis use, says Dr. Latif. ""But I tell my patients about the potential heart dangers so they can make an informed choice,"" she says.
        The AHA's advice? Anyone who's using cannabis or considering it should ""proceed with extreme caution.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/5-unusual-types-of-headaches-202103022954,5 unusual types of headaches,"Headaches come in lots of varieties, and some are easily recognizable. In most cases, headaches are little more than short-term nuisances that go away with an over-the-counter pain reliever, food, caffeine, or rest. Some headaches, however. cause more severe symptoms and require a doctor's care. Others may be completely unfamiliar to you.
        Common types of headaches
        Most headaches fall into four main types: migraine, tension, cluster, and sinus.
        
          A migraine classically causes throbbing, pounding pain that lasts for hours — sometimes even days — on one side of the head.
          A tension headache usually feels like a tight band squeezing around your noggin.
          A cluster headache is an uncommon condition. The pain strikes one side of the head, starting abruptly and lasting for about 30 minutes to three hours. As the name suggests, these headaches will recur in clusters, sometimes during the same day or daily over a few weeks.
          And a sinus headache shows up as pressure on one side of the face, behind the nose, or above one eye when you have a sinus infection.
        
        Unusual types of headaches
        Some headaches, however, aren't as well-known. When less familiar headache pain strikes, the symptoms or patterns may be puzzling, or even frightening. Here are five other unusual headaches that you should know:
        
          Orgasmic headache. Some people experience the sudden onset of a severe head pain similar to that of a thunderclap headache just before or at the time of sexual orgasm. Although usually no underlying problem is found, it should prompt a call to your doctor to be sure.
          Ice-pick headache. The vivid image of this headache identifies its main characteristic: sudden, brief, and severe stabs of pain to the head. Ice-pick headaches are so fleeting that they're over long before any medication could take effect. This type of headache generally affects people who already suffer from migraines or cluster headaches.
          New daily persistent headache. Doctors call this headache ""new"" because it develops in a person who has not had problems with headaches before. The onset is sudden enough that you'll often remember exactly when it began. It is ""daily"" and ""persistent"" because it then lingers indefinitely, and can mimic either a migraine or tension headache.
          Paroxysmal hemicrania. Like cluster headaches, paroxysmal hemicranias last for a while. But the periods are shorter (10 to 30 minutes) and more frequent (five to 15 times per day). The condition is considered different from cluster headache, as each headache type responds differently to various medications.
          Weekend headache. These are often caused by caffeine withdrawal, which leads to the dilation of blood vessels. This type of headache often begins 12 to 24 hours after your last sip of coffee and is likely to develop on weekends, when you delay your first cup of the day or skip coffee entirely. You can easily identify this type of headache by comparing your weekend caffeine intake with your weekday consumption.
        
        What you should do about sudden or intense headaches
        Take note of your symptoms when a headache occurs. If it's sudden and intense, like a thunderclap headache (also called ""the worst headache of your life""), it could signal bleeding inside the head. Seek emergency medical attention.
        If a headache is less severe, an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be enough to ease your pain.
        But if headaches recur or you need to take pain relievers frequently, talk to your doctor. You may not be familiar with the particular pattern of pain, but your doctor likely will be, or can refer you to a headache specialist.",Heidi Godman,"June 30, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/dont-bomb-the-bowel-with-laxatives,Laxatives: What to know about choosing the right one,"Occasional irregularity is a fact of life, but you can minimize it with some basic steps. You should be sure you are eating a fiber-rich diet, drinking adequate fluids, and staying physically active.
        But when you have constipation, the best laxative is the gentlest and safest option, like a bulk-forming laxative. If laxatives don't work, ask for help. You should see your doctor and discuss it if you are constantly needing to take laxatives.
        How do stool softeners work?
        Stool softeners work by softening stools to make them easier to pass. They can be in capsule, tablet, liquid, and syrup form and are usually taken at bedtime. Be sure to take stool softeners exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
        First choice: bulk-forming laxatives
        Bulk-forming laxatives draw water into stool, making it softer and easier to pass. But don't expect instant gratification: these can take a half-day to several days to provide relief. They are safe to use daily. They contain various ingredients, and you may have to try more than one to find the product that helps you with minimal side effects, such as flatulence and bloating. They may be marketed as laxatives or as fiber supplements.
        For stuck stools...
        Stool softeners add moisture to stools to make them softer and easier to pass. Mineral oil, a lubricant, helps stools ""slide on by"" if the stools feel stuck low in your bowels, if you have an internal tear or ""fissure,"" or if you have pain from hemorrhoids during bowel movements.
        Don't take mineral oil at the same time as stool softeners. Take 1 tablespoon at breakfast or lunch. But don't use it for more than a few days, because mineral oil interferes with absorption of some vitamins and if inhaled it can cause pneumonia. Consider wearing a protective pad in your undergarments to absorb any leakage.
        Other laxative options
        If stool softeners aren't providing enough help, the osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX or a generic version) is good next step. These products hold water in stool to soften it and increase bowel movements. Common side effects are gas, bloating, and nausea.
        Another option that works for some people is diet candies containing the sweetener sorbitol. These essentially trigger a mild case of the runs. You may experience bloating and gas along with the laxative effect, however.
        Another option would be a magnesium-based laxative, such as milk of magnesia or magnesium citrate. These are members of a larger class of laxatives called saline osmotics, which draw water into the bowels and trigger bowel movements. The active ingredients include magnesium, sulfate, citrate, and phosphate.
        But don't take more than the recommended amounts of these laxatives, or use them long-term, because they can throw off your chemistry. Combined with an underperforming kidney or heart failure, saline osmotic laxatives can be dangerous.

        Stimulant laxatives
        Stimulant laxatives such as senna and bisacodyl trigger contractions in the bowels that push the stool along. But if you take stimulant laxatives too often, you could become dependent on them to have a bowel movement at all — possibly because the bowel has stopped functioning normally.
        When to talk to a doctor
        If you find yourself trying one laxative after another, see your doctor for an evaluation. Additional testing can lead to better therapy and rule out any possible serious malfunctions. And if it is just constipation, your doctor can offer other medications to you that may be more helpful than over-the-counter laxatives.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ibd-and-lgbtq-how-it-can-affect-sexual-health-202306282949,IBD and LGBTQ+: How it can affect sexual health,"Everyone who lives with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) knows their illness has a major impact on daily life. Many people are diagnosed in their 20s or 30s, a time when we might hope for few health challenges.

Medications, and sometimes surgery, may be used to treat IBD. If you identify as LGBTQ+, you might wonder how all of this may affect you — your physical health, of course, but also your sexual health and pleasure. Below are a few things to understand and consider.

What is inflammatory bowel disease?

IBD is a condition that causes inflammation along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The two main types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis:


	Crohn's disease: inflammation can occur anywhere along the GI tract (from the mouth to the anus)
	Ulcerative colitis: typically affects the large intestine (colon) only.


IBD can cause diarrhea, bloody stool, weight loss, and abdominal pain, and is typically diagnosed with blood and stool tests, imaging, and colonoscopy. A diagnosis of IBD may increase the risk of developing anxiety or depression, and can also have an impact on sexual health. People with IBD may require long-term medical treatment or surgery for their condition.

The starting point: Talking to your doctor

Talking to your medical team about IBD and sexual health may not be easy. This may depend on how comfortable you feel disclosing your LGBTQ+ identity with your health care providers. Ideally, you should feel comfortable discussing sexuality with your medical team, including what types of sexual partners and activities you participate in and how IBD may affect this part of your life.

Be aware that health care providers may not be able to address all LGBTQ+-specific concerns. Optimal care for people with IBD who identify as LGBTQ+ is not fully understood. However, this is an active area of research.

How might medicines for IBD affect sexual health?

Many effective IBD medications subdue the immune system to decrease inflammation. These immunosuppressive medicines may raise your risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV, chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhea.

What you can do: Discuss these concerns with your doctor so you can take appropriate protective measures. This might include:


	ensuring that your vaccinations, such as hepatitis B and HPV, are up to date.
	engaging in sex using barrier protection to prevent STI transmission.
	taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This safe and effective medicine helps prevent the spread of HIV. Ask your primary care doctor or gastroenterologist if PrEP is appropriate for you.


How might surgery for IBD affect sexual health?

For some people with IBD, gut inflammation is severe enough to require surgery to remove part of the intestine. For example:


	Abscesses or fistulas (abnormal connections between two body parts) sometimes form when someone has Crohn's disease around the anus. This may require surgical treatment.
	Active inflammation in the rectum or anus may make sex painful, particularly for people who engage in anal receptive sex.
	We don't yet know whether anal receptive sex is safe for people who have had surgery to remove the colon and create a J-pouch, which is formed from small intestine to create an internal pouch that enables normal bowel movements.


What you can do: Discuss your concerns with your gastroenterologist and colorectal surgeon.

If you engage in anal sex, you may be confused about whether it is safe to do so. While you may feel uncomfortable discussing this concern and others with your doctor, try to be as honest and open as you can. That way, you'll receive the best information on how to engage in safe and enjoyable sex after an IBD diagnosis or surgery.

What else to consider if you are transgender

People with IBD who are transgender may have additional concerns to address.

For example, there may be a risk for sexual side effects from gender-affirming surgery. These procedures may include vaginoplasty (surgical creation of a vagina) for transgender females, or phalloplasty (surgical creation of a penis) for transgender males. The safety of these procedures in people with IBD is not currently well understood.

What you can do: If you identify as transgender, ask your doctor if any gender-affirming surgeries you've had or medicines you take, such as hormones, might affect your IBD, recommended treatments, or sexual health.

If you're considering gender-affirming surgery, discuss your options with your medical team. Be aware that gender-affirming surgery may be more challenging, or may not be advisable, for people with complex or active IBD. It's important to discuss your specific risks with your doctor when pursuing gender-affirming care. Having access to a team of physicians, including a surgeon and a gastroenterologist, may improve outcomes.

The bottom line

Try to talk to your gastroenterologist about how your sexual practices and gender identity may affect — and be affected by — your IBD. A conversation like this may feel uncomfortable, but being candid about your symptoms and concerns will help you receive the best possible care.

Often, a multidisciplinary approach to care is helpful. Your health care providers, including your gastroenterologist and surgeon, may suggest seeing additional specialists.

Much remains unknown about sexual health and practices in LGBTQ+ people with IBD. While more research is needed, open communication on the impact of medications, surgery, and other aspects of living with IBD can do a lot to improve your quality of life.","Andrew Eidelberg, MD","June 28, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/quick-fixes-for-aching-elbows,Quick fixes for aching elbows,"The elbow is a funny joint. It is home to your funny bone — your ulnar nerve — which hurts if it's hit a certain way. And the elbow is often overlooked as an important joint to help us maintain our independence.
        Many adults may not think much about the elbow, because it's not a weight-bearing joint and because it doesn't often develop arthritis or require joint replacement. But elbow pain can keep you from getting dressed, cooking dinner, and anything else that requires the use of your arm. Taking care of this joint helps ensure that you can care for yourself.
        Elbow basics
        The elbow is made up of bones, muscles, ligaments (which connect bones), and tendons (which connect muscles to bone). Three bones come together at the elbow joint: the humerus, which is in the upper arm, and two long bones called the ulna and radius in the lower arm.
        Your elbow has two main motions:
        
          Flexing and straightening. Flexing your arm allows you to bring your hand toward your body (flexion), which you do when bringing food to your mouth or putting your hands on your hips. Straightening your arm (extension) allows such motions as putting your arm in a shirt sleeve or reaching your toes.
          Turning up and down. You can also flip your palms from facing the ceiling (supination) to facing the floor (pronation). These motions are important for many common movements, such as turning a key or a doorknob.
        
        Causes of elbow pain
        The most common cause of elbow pain is inflammation of one or both of the elbow's two tendons. This is called tendinitis, and it is often the result of overuse.
        Repetitive movements from everyday work, household chores, golf, or tennis can affect the muscles above and below the elbow and cause tendinitis. Tendinitis pain travels from the elbow to the upper arm or to the lower arm.
        Other causes of elbow pain are fractures from falling onto an outstretched arm; arthritis; sprains, which stretch or tear elbow ligaments; and bursitis, inflammation of the fluid-filled joint cushions called bursae.
        Elbow pain diagnosis
        If you are unable to make your arm completely straight after an injury, contact your doctor. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, try to identify risk factors, and discuss what activities cause symptoms and where on your arm the symptoms occur.
        Your doctor will also want to know if you have had a previous injury to the elbow or a history of rheumatoid arthritis or nerve disease.
        During the examination, your doctor will use a variety of tests to pinpoint the diagnosis. Your doctor will likely check for a possible fracture and recommend an x-ray. Your doctor may ask you to try to straighten your wrist and fingers against resistance with your arm fully straight to see if this causes pain.
        How to treat common causes of elbow pain
        If your elbow is just sore, you should consider these approaches before contacting your doctor for help.
        
          Rest. Stop overuse of the muscle group you suspect is behind your elbow pain. For example, if you have a hobby or project that requires repetitive wrist flexing or extending, you may be overusing the muscles and tendons of the forearm that connect to the elbow.
          Heat therapy. Heat can bring blood flow and nutrients to the elbow, which can encourage healing. Protect your skin with a thin cloth, then place a heating pad or hot pack around your elbow.
          Stretching.Stretching out the muscles of the forearm can offer some relief. Simply straighten your elbow out with the palm of your hand facing the floor, and gently pull your fingers toward the underside of your wrist. You should feel a stretch along the back of your forearm. Hold it for 30 seconds. Then flip your forearm over, with your palm facing the ceiling, and push your fingers toward the floor. Hold for 30 seconds.
          Bracing. Wearing a brace keeps the muscles and tendons still, allowing them time to heal. You can buy various arm braces at most drugstores. Look for one that immobilizes the muscles that may be causing your pain, such as a wrist or forearm brace if you often flex your wrist. Be sure to take the brace off several times a day and gently stretch elbow and wrist.
        
        Prevention
        Once your elbow has healed, talk to your doctor about physical therapy to strengthen the muscles surrounding the joint. You'll likely perform exercises such as biceps curls that focus on the muscles in your upper arm. Strengthen your muscles every other day, so they have time to repair and replenish energy stores. You can stretch them daily.
        Bicep curl
        
          
        
        
          Exercise the front upper arm muscles.
        
        Strengthening the biceps not only helps protect your elbow, but also helps you perform the activities of daily living, such as lifting a gallon of milk, brushing your teeth, pushing yourself out of a chair, or raising a blow dryer to your hair.
        Stand or sit holding a dumbbell down at your side with your palm facing inward. Slowly bend your elbow, lifting the weight toward your upper chest. Keep your elbow close to your side. As you lift, rotate your palm so it faces your shoulders. Pause. Slowly lower your arm to the starting position. Do eight to 12 repetitions. Rest, then repeat on the other arm.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/how-to-release-a-frozen-shoulder,How to release a frozen shoulder: 5 stretches to use,"Frozen shoulder (also called adhesive capsulitis) is a common disorder that causes pain, stiffness, and loss of normal range of motion in the shoulder. The resulting disability can be serious, and the condition tends to get worse with time if it's not treated. It affects mainly people ages 40 to 60 with women affected more often than men.
        Frozen shoulder symptoms
        With frozen shoulder, the shoulder feels stiff, painful, and has limited motion in all directions. Symptoms of a frozen shoulder include
        
          stiffness that worsens at first, but gradually begins to improve over time
          dull, aching pain that increases as the disease progresses, and may worsen when you move your arm.
        
        A frozen shoulder may take two to nine months to develop. Although the pain may slowly improve, stiffness continues, and range of motion remains limited.
        Anatomy of a frozen shoulder
        The shoulder has a wider and more varied range of motion than any other part of the body. It pivots mainly on a ball-and-socket arrangement called the glenohumeral joint, which joins the top of the humerus (upper arm bone) to a scooped-out part of the scapula (shoulder blade) called the glenoid cavity (see the illustration below).
        The glenohumeral joint helps move the shoulder forward and backward and allows the arm to rotate and extend outward from the body. A flexible capsule filled with a lubricant called synovial fluid protects the joint and helps keep it moving smoothly. The capsule is surrounded by ligaments that connect bones to bones, tendons that fasten muscles to bones, and fluid-filled sacs called bursae that cushion tendons and bones during motion.
        The band of muscles and tendons that stabilizes the shoulder and controls its movements is called the rotator cuff. This elaborate architecture of soft tissues accounts for the shoulder's marvelous flexibility, but also makes it vulnerable to trauma as well as chronic wear and tear.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
                Normally, the head of the humerus moves smoothly in the glenoid cavity, a depression in the scapula. A shoulder is ""frozen"" when the capsule protecting the glenohumeral joint contracts and stiffens. Scar tissue (adhesions) may also form between the joint capsule and the head of the humerus.
              
            
          
        
        Frozen shoulder causes
        We don't fully understand what causes a frozen shoulder, but an inflammatory process is probably involved. Sometimes freezing occurs because the shoulder has been immobilized for a long time by injury, surgery, or illness. In many cases the cause is obscure. Fortunately, the shoulder can usually be unfrozen, though full recovery takes time — and lots of self-help.
        The process usually begins with an injury (such as a fracture) or inflammation of the soft tissues, typically due to overuse injuries such as bursitis or tendinitis of the rotator cuff. Inflammation causes pain that is worse with movement and limits the shoulder's range of motion.
        When the shoulder becomes immobilized in this way, the connective tissue surrounding the glenohumeral joint — the joint capsule — thickens and contracts, losing its normal capacity to stretch. Trying to avoid the pain caused by moving the shoulder leads to further contraction of the capsule. The humerus has less space to move in, and the joint may lose its lubricating synovial fluid. In advanced cases, bands of scar tissue (adhesions) form between the joint capsule and the head of the humerus.
        Who gets frozen shoulder?
        The frozen shoulder risk is increased by the following factors:
        
          lack of exercise therapy after tendinitis or an injury
          wearing a sling for more than a few days without intermittent stretching
          rotator cuff disorders (about 10% of people with these rotator cuff disorders develop frozen shoulder)
          enforced immobility resulting from a stroke, heart condition, or surgery
          other conditions such as thyroid disorders or Parkinson's disease
        
        Frozen shoulder treatment
        If you think you have a frozen shoulder or are already developing one, see your clinician or a shoulder expert for a physical exam. To assess your shoulder's range of motion, the clinician will ask you to perform various movements with your arm. These movements may include reaching across your chest to touch the opposite shoulder or down your back to touch the opposite shoulder blade (the Apley scratch test).
        Your healthcare provider may take x-rays to make sure there's no other underlying problem, such as arthritic changes or a dislocation. An MRI may be ordered to check for a rotator cuff tear.
        The treatment for a frozen shoulder is focused on relieving pain and restoring the shoulder's normal range of motion. Your clinical will develop your treatment plan. Treatment for frozen shoulder may include the following:
        
          anti-inflammatory medication such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, Anaprox)
          an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables applied to the shoulder for 10 to 15 minutes several times a day can also help with pain
          corticosteroid injection into the shoulder joint or soft tissues
          physical therapy is the cornerstone of treatment, especially concentrating first on exercises that stretch the joint capsule, and later, on strengthening exercises. A physical therapist can show you how far to push yourself and can teach you the appropriate exercises. Once you've learned your limitations, you can practice most of your exercises on your own at home.
        
        As you work to stretch the shoulder capsule, you should avoid any activities that require overhead reaching, lifting, or anything else that aggravates your pain. If you diligently follow your regimen of frozen shoulder exercises, it's likely that you'll be able to resume your usual level of activity (more than 90% of people improve with these nonsurgical measures).
        But full recovery from a frozen shoulder takes time — from several months to two or three years. If you don't improve steadily or if you reach a plateau, go back to your clinician or consult a shoulder expert. Rarely, recalcitrant cases require surgery.
        5 frozen shoulder exercises
        Always warm up your shoulder before performing your exercises. The best way to do that is to take a warm shower or bath for 10 to 15 minutes. You can also use a moist heating pad or damp towel heated in the microwave, but it may not be as effective.
        In performing the following exercises, stretch to the point of tension but not pain.
        Pendulum stretch
        
          
        
        (Perform this exercise first.)
        
          Relax your shoulders.
          Stand and lean over slightly, allowing your affected arm to hang down.
          Swing the arm in a small circle — about a foot in diameter.
          Perform 10 revolutions in each direction, once a day.
          As your symptoms improve, increase the diameter of your swing, but never force it.
          When you're ready for more, increase the stretch by holding a light weight (three to five pounds) in the swinging arm.
        
        Towel stretch
        
          
        
        
          Grasp a three-foot-long towel with both hands behind your back, and hold it in a horizontal position.
          Use your good arm to pull the affected arm upward to stretch it.
          You can also perform an advanced version of this exercise with the towel draped over your good shoulder.
          Grasp the bottom of the towel with the affected arm and pull it toward the lower back with the unaffected arm.
          Do this stretch 10 to 20 times a day.
        
        Finger walk
        
          
        
        
          Face a wall three-quarters of an arm's length away.
          Reach out and touch the wall at waist level with the fingertips of the affected arm.
          With your elbow slightly bent, slowly walk your fingers up the wall, spider-like, until you've raised your arm to shoulder level, or as far as you comfortably can. Your fingers should be doing the work, not your shoulder muscles.
          Slowly lower the arm (with the help of the good arm, if necessary) and repeat.
          Perform this exercise 10 to 20 times a day.
        
        Cross-body reach
        
          
        
        
          Sit or stand.
          Use your good arm to lift your affected arm at the elbow, and bring it up and across your body, exerting gentle pressure to stretch the shoulder.
          Hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds.
          Do this stretch 10 to 20 times per day.
        
        Armpit stretch
        
          
        
        
          Using your good arm, lift the affected arm onto a shelf about breast-high.
          Gently bend your knees, opening up the armpit.
          Deepen your knee bend slightly, gently stretching the armpit, and then straighten.
          With each knee bend, stretch a little further, but don't force it.
          Do this stretch 10 to 20 times each day.
        
        Strengthening the rotator cuff
        After your range of motion improves, you can add rotator cuff–strengthening exercises. Be sure to warm up your shoulder and do your stretching exercises before you perform strengthening
        Outward rotation
        
          
        
        
          Hold a rubber exercise band between your hands with your elbows at a 90-degree angle close to your sides.
          Rotate the lower part of the affected arm outward two or three inches and hold for five seconds.
          Repeat 10 to 15 times, once a day.
        
        Inward rotation
        
          
        
        
          Stand next to a closed door, and hook one end of a rubber exercise band around the doorknob.
          Grasp the other end with the hand of the affected arm, holding the elbow at a 90-degree angle.
          Pull the band toward your body two or three inches and hold for five seconds.
          Repeat 10 to 15 times, once a day.",Unknown,"June 26, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-a-smart-watch-diagnose-a-heart-attack,Can a smart watch diagnose a heart attack?,"This technology isn't ready for prime time yet. But detecting various heart problems with a smart watch could become a reality within the decade.
        
        
          
        
        To diagnose a heart attack, doctors look for a distinctive pattern on a tracing of the heart's electrical activity, using a test known as a 12-lead electrocardiogram, or ECG. Now, a small study suggests that ECG readings taken with a smart watch may be just as accurate as a traditional ECG done in a medical setting.
        While these new findings show potential, the real-world applicability is still years away. ""This study is more a proof-of-principle rather than something that's clinically useful,"" says Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Peter Libby, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        ECG recording challenges
        One main reason: Obtaining an ECG with a smart watch requires carefully holding the back of the watch on the wrist and at eight specific locations on the chest and abdomen. In the study, physicians—not the study participants — placed the watch in those positions. In a few people, other health problems (including Parkinson's disease and a previous stroke) made it impossible to get a clear signal, Dr. Libby notes.
        The smart watch, like other popular smartphone–linked ECG devices, can have a wavy baseline if not applied carefully. Also, even if someone with a suspected heart attack was able to capture successfully all nine ECG readings, the results would still need to be interpreted by a physician. So for now, the advice for the general public remains the same: ""If you have chest pain or discomfort, don't mess around with your smart watch — call 911,"" says Dr. Libby.
        For the study, researchers obtained both standard and smart watch ECGs on 81 people who sought care for a likely heart attack at one Italian clinic from April 2019 to January 2020. Two-thirds were men, and their average age was 61. For comparison purposes, both types of ECGs were also done on 19 healthy people.
        The smart watch–generated ECGs were 93% to 95% accurate at correctly identifying and distinguishing between different types of heart attacks. Among the healthy people, the watch's accuracy was 90% for correctly noting the absence of a heart attack. The findings were published online Aug. 31, 2020, by JAMA Cardiology.
        Researchers used an Apple Watch Series 4 to record the ECGs, which were then uploaded to an iPhone 11 Pro — the latest available versions of those products at the time. But as Dr. Libby points out, the innovations that enabled the first recordings of the heart's weak electrical currents date back to the early 1900s. Dutch physician Willem Einthoven was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for inventing the first practical ECG in 1924.
        Current status, future directions
        The FDA has already approved the Apple Watch's built-in ECG tool for detecting atrial fibrillation (afib), a rapid, irregular heart rhythm that raises the risk of stroke. If your watch detects this arrhythmia, your doctor can use a simple formula that takes into account your age, sex, and other health problems to estimate your risk of stroke, says Dr. Libby. If your stroke risk is high enough and you aren't at high risk for bleeding, your doctor might recommend anti-clotting medications to lower your stroke risk.
        So far, however, it's not clear whether finding afib with a smartwatch app translates to better outcomes (that is, fewer strokes). Physicians also worry about being inundated with ECG tracings sent from concerned patients who get alerts about possible afib on their Apple Watches, Dr. Libby says.
        As for detecting heart attacks, an editorial accompanying the new study conjures an image of a ""smart watch–toting cardiologist"" evaluating chest pain out in public — at a restaurant or on an airplane, for example. But home-based ECGs for patients are on the horizon, according to the article.
        Dr. Libby agrees. ""This is a technology with a great future. Coupling wearable devices with artificial intelligence will transform our ability to monitor and predict heart disease,"" he says. In this capacity, artificial intelligence would use machine learning to parse massive amounts of data from regular ECGs. The resulting algorithms may one day be able to predict atrial fibrillation, heart attacks, and heart failure, perhaps years in advance. Quality control and regulatory issues will dictate the timeline. But Dr. Libby expects these improved smart watches will be on the market in less than 10 years.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/how-to-soothe-a-sore-neck,"Neck pain: Symptoms, causes, & how to relieve it","Neck pain is a common condition. Problems in any of the parts of the neck, such as the muscles, nerves, bones (vertebrae), joints, and the discs between the bones, can cause it. When the pain or soreness makes it difficult to move the neck, the condition is usually called a stiff neck.
        Causes and types of neck pain
        Most people get neck pain for many of the same reasons they suffer low back pain. ""In the vast majority of people, it's routine muscle aches and pains,"" says Dr. Robert Shmerling, Senior Faculty Editor at Harvard Health Publishing and Corresponding Member of the Faculty of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""The neck has to support that heavy bowling ball on top.""
        Here are the most common causes and types of neck pain.
        
          Muscle pain. Aching or sore neck and shoulder muscles may occur in response to overexertion or prolonged physical or emotional stress. The neck muscles may develop hard knots that are tender to the touch, sometimes called trigger points.
          Muscle spasm. This is a sudden, powerful tightening of neck muscles. Your neck may hurt and feel tight or knotted, and it may be impossible to turn your head. When you wake up with a painful, stiff neck, that's likely a muscle spasm. Muscle spasm can result from a muscle injury, but it may also occur in response to a spinal disc or nerve problem, or even emotional stress. However, there is often no clear cause.
          Headache. Neck-related headache is most often felt in the back of the head and upper neck and is usually the result of muscle tension or spasm. Neck-related headache pain is usually dull or aching, rather than sharp; the neck might also feel stiff or tender. Moving your neck makes it worse.
          Facet joint pain. Often described as deep, sharp, or aching, pain in the facet joints (part of the vertebrae of the neck) typically worsens if you lean your head toward the affected side and may radiate to your shoulder or upper back. Arthritis in the facet joints, as in other locations, may feel worse in the morning or after a period of inactivity.
          Nerve pain. Irritation or pinching of the roots of the spinal nerves causes pain that may be sharp, fleeting, severe, or accompanied by pins and needles. Depending on the nerve involved, the pain may shoot down the arm or even into the hand.
          Referred pain. Referred pain is pain in one part of the body that is triggered by a problem in another part of the body. For example, neck pain that worsens with exertion may indicate a heart problem, while neck pain that occurs when you eat may stem from a problem in the esophagus.
          Bone pain. Pain and tenderness in the cervical vertebrae are far less common than neck pain from the soft tissues. Bone pain needs medical attention because it may signal a more serious health problem.
        
        How to relieve neck pain
        The remedies for neck and low back pain also have some things in common. First, ease the early intense pain with rest, ice, and heat; then move on to gentle stretching and strengthening exercises. Later, avoid bad posture and other habits that could trigger another neck pain crisis.
        The causes of routine strain-and-sprain neck pain vary. If you wake up with a crick in your neck, it's probably the sharp muscle contractions known as spasms, caused by a muscle strain. A sprain, in contrast, happens in ligaments — the tough tissues that connect bones together. Alternatively, a tendon — the tissue that attaches muscles to bones — may become inflamed, causing tendinitis. Basic self-help takes care of most routine neck pain flare-ups:
        
          Use cold to numb the early acute pain and reduce inflammation.
          Take over-the-counter pain relievers to control mild to moderate pain. These include acetaminophen (Tylenol, generic brands) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), or aspirin.
          Use a neck collar for short periods to rest the painful muscles and tissues and ease your discomfort. ""Collars have a bad reputation from people overusing them and getting weak muscles, but used a few hours here and there they can be very useful,"" Dr. Shmerling says.
          Apply heat — either with a heating pad or by using a warm whirlpool bath if one is available — after a day or two, once the acute pain calms down.
        
        Should you go to a chiropractor to get your neck ""cracked""? Dr. Shmerling counsels against sudden, strenuous manipulation of the neck. ""It may be fine for low back pain, but I have concerns about its safety for neck pain,"" he says.
        Stretches and exercises for neck pain
        Exercises to stretch and strengthen the neck, shoulder, and upper back muscles can speed recovery from a painful neck condition and possibly reduce flare-ups, although the evidence for this is not ironclad. Dr. Shmerling encourages his patients to see a physical therapist for guided therapeutic exercise. Here is what the therapist can offer:
        
          Therapy will likely combine isometric and range-of-motion exercises. In isometric exercise, you tighten the neck muscles against an opposing force — such as your own hand, which you ""push against"" with your neck muscles. Range-of-motion stretches attempt to progressively relax and lengthen the neck muscles.
          Physical therapists can offer other therapies that, while not proven in research trials, seem to offer some people ease and comfort. One option is ultrasound treatment of the sore tissues with high-frequency sound waves.
          A physical therapist can also perform traction, using the hands or special equipment to gently stretch the neck muscles. You can also get equipment by prescription to perform neck traction at home, but follow the therapist's instructions carefully.
        
        How to prevent neck pain
        To ward off neck pain, it is helpful to take inventory of your posture or daily habits that could trigger neck pain, like sitting for extended periods in positions that strain the neck during reading, TV watching, computer work, or sleeping. Attending to the cause may stop some flare-ups of neck pain at the source.
        When to see a doctor
        If neck pain is severe, lasts for weeks or months, drastically limits your ability to move your head, radiates into the shoulders, or feels worse in the morning, consider seeing a doctor. Fever, weakness, or numbness in the arms are other red flags that warrant immediate evaluation. In some cases, an underlying physical problem, such as arthritis, an infection, or a compressed nerve, may be the cause. Depending on the diagnosis, you may need additional treatments or even surgery to relieve the pain and get back to your normal activities.

        High temperatures stress the body, leading to thousands of heat-related illnesses and deaths every year in the US. Creating a personal heat plan can help you stay safe when the heat index soars.
        Caleb Dresser, MD, MPH, is the health care solutions lead for C-CHANGE, the Center for Climate Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and an emergency medicine doctor at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Below we interview him about who, how, and why heat harms. Then we'll help you create your personal heat safety plan.
        
          Interview edited for clarity
        
        Who is especially vulnerable during hot weather?
        High temperatures can affect anyone. But some people — children, outdoor workers, people who are pregnant or have health problems or disabilities, and older people — are more likely to experience harm when temperatures rise. For example:
        
          Young children, especially babies, have less physical capacity to deal with very high temperatures.
          People working outdoors may not have access to shade and could be performing physically intensive labor. They need adequate hydration, adequate breaks, and access to a cool space during break time, as OSHA guidelines spell out.
          People with chronic medical conditions, such as kidney disease or heart disease, may have difficulty adapting physiologically to hot weather, or may be more susceptible to its health impacts.
          And some people living with disabilities or certain neurological conditions may have difficulty with thermoregulation — that is, controlling the temperature of their bodies — or may not be able to take actions that keep them safe, such as taking off layers or moving to a cool area.
        
        Which weather patterns create dangerous levels of heat?
        Dangerous heat is the result of both high temperatures and high humidity, which interfere with our ability to cool off by sweating. In dry areas, extremely hot temperatures can be dangerous on their own.
        Danger zones vary across the United States and around the world. But hospital use and deaths rise once we get above threshold temperatures. The threshold varies in different places depending on whether bodies, cultures, and architecture are adapted to heat.
        For example, here in New England, where some people (particularly those of limited means) may not have access to air conditioning, we see increases in healthcare use and deaths at a lower temperature than in the American South, where people and organizations may be more used to dealing with hot weather.
        When does hot weather become dangerous to our health?
        Risk goes up the longer hot weather sticks around.
        One hot day can put some people at risk. A stretch of several hot days in a row during a heat wave is particularly dangerous because it can overwhelm people's ability to adapt. Eventually people run out of physiological reserves, leading to greater health harms and greater need for medical care.
        Surprisingly, spring and early summer are particularly dangerous times because people and organizations aren't as prepared for hot weather.
        How to create your personal heat safety plan
        Five key points to help you create a personal heat plan are below. Americares offers further information through heat tip sheets developed with the Harvard C-CHANGE team that are tailored to people in different health circumstances.
        Planning is important because intense heat is occurring more often: a Climate Central analysis found 21 additional risky heat days, on average, for 232 out of 249 locations between 1970 and 2022.
        
          Stay ahead of hot weather. Check apps, websites, TV, or radio for updates on weather today and in coming days. If local weather alerts are available by phone or text, sign up.
          Have a cooling plan. When temperatures soar, you need to spend as much time as possible in cool spaces. Plan options if your home is likely to be too hot and unsafe to stay in. You may be able to stay with a neighbor or family member who has air conditioning until a heat wave passes. Many cities and towns have neighborhood splash pads for children, and open cooling centers or air-conditioned libraries, public buildings, or community centers to everyone — sometimes even overnight. Spending time in air-conditioned businesses or malls, or in a shady green space like a park, may help too.
          Sip plenty of fluids. Water is the best choice. Skip sugary drinks and avoid caffeine or alcohol.
          Use fans correctly. Fans help if surrounding air is relatively cool. If air temperatures are very high, it's important to dampen your clothes or skin to help keep your body from overheating, and move to a cooler location, if possible.
          Know your personal risks and the signs of heat-related illness. If you have health problems or disabilities, or take certain medicines such as diuretics, talk to your doctor about the best ways for you to cope with heat. It's also essential to know the signs of heat-related illnesses, which range from heat rash and sunburn to heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. This chart from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes the signs to look for and what you can do, particularly when heat becomes an emergency.",Francesca Coltrera,"June 14, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/takotsubo-cardiomyopathy-broken-heart-syndrome,Broken-heart syndrome (takotsubo cardiomyopathy),"Years of gender-based research have shown that in matters of the heart, sex differences abound. One striking example is the temporary heart condition known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken-heart syndrome.
        What is broken heart syndrome?
        First described in 1990 in Japan, takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a weakening of the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber.
        The condition is usually the result of severe emotional or physical stress, such as a sudden illness, the loss of a loved one, a serious accident, or a natural disaster such as an earthquake. That's why the condition is also called stress-induced cardiomyopathy, or broken-heart syndrome.
        Broken heart syndrome symptoms
        Classic heart attack symptoms — severe pressure, heaviness, or pain in the chest — most often arise from a blockage in a coronary artery that prevents blood from reaching the heart muscle. But takotsubo cardiomyopathy can produce the same sudden heart symptoms even when the coronary arteries are clear. Sometimes people with broken heart syndrome experience less dramatic chest pain. Instead, they may have shortness of breath, sudden onset of marked fatigue, cold sweats, or lightheadedness.
        Who gets broken-heart syndrome?
        More than 90% of reported cases are in women ages 58 to 75. Research suggests that up to 5% of women suspected of having a heart attack actually have this disorder. Most people recover with no long-term heart damage.
        
          
            
              
                What causes broken heart syndrome?
                The precise cause of broken heart syndrome isn't known, but experts think that surging stress hormones (for example, adrenaline) essentially ""stun"" the heart, triggering changes in heart muscle cells or coronary blood vessels (or both) that prevent the left ventricle from contracting effectively.
                Some causes of broken heart syndrome include:
                
                  sudden drop in blood pressure
                  serious illness, surgery, or medical procedure (e.g., cardiac stress test)
                  severe pain
                  domestic violence
                  asthma attack
                  receiving bad news (such as a diagnosis of cancer)
                  car or other accident
                  unexpected loss, illness, or injury of a close relative, friend, or pet
                  fierce argument

        Broken heart syndrome and heart attack
        Takotsubo symptoms are indistinguishable from those of a heart attack. And an electrocardiogram (ECG) may show abnormalities similar to those found in some heart attacks — in particular, changes known as ST-segment elevation. Consequently, imaging studies and other measures are needed to rule out a heart attack. To get a definitive diagnosis, clinicians look for the following:
        
          No evidence on an angiogram of blockages in the coronary arteries — the most common cause of heart attacks.
          An echocardiogram (ultrasound image) or other imaging technique that shows abnormal movements in the walls of the left ventricle. The most common abnormality in takotsubo cardiomyopathy — the one that gives the disorder its name — is ballooning of the lower part of the left ventricle (apex). During contraction (systole), this bulging ventricle resembles a tako-tsubo, a pot used by Japanese fishermen to trap octopuses. Another term for the disorder is apical ballooning syndrome.

                An x-ray of the left ventricle (A) shows apical ballooning, a reversible abnormality characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. During systole (cardiac contraction) the midsection and tip (apex) of the left ventricle balloon out, while the area above, called the base, contracts normally. The shape is similar to that of a tako-tsubo (B), a round-bottomed, narrow-necked vessel used to catch octopuses.

        Can you die from broken-heart syndrome?
        Most of the abnormalities in systolic function and ventricle wall movement seen in broken-heart syndrome clear up in one to four weeks. Most individuals who experience it recover fully within two months and are at low risk for it happening again.
        However, some people continue to have persistent signs consistent with heart failure. In rare cases, broken heart syndrome can be fatal.
        Broken-heart syndrome treatment
        There is no specific treatment for broken-heart syndrome. It depends on the severity of symptoms, and whether the person has low blood pressure or evidence of fluid backing up into the lungs. Clinicians often recommend standard heart failure medications such as beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics (water pills). They may give aspirin to patients who also have atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in the arterial walls).
        Although there's little evidence on long-term therapy, beta blockers (or combined alpha and beta blockers) may be continued indefinitely to help prevent recurrence by reducing the effects of adrenaline and other stress hormones. It's also important to work on reducing any stress that may have played a role in triggering the disorder.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/young-men-with-prostate-cancer-socioeconomic-factors-affect-lifespan-202306122946,Young men with prostate cancer: Socioeconomic factors affect lifespan,"Prostate cancer is generally viewed as a disease of older men. Yet about 10% of new diagnoses occur in men age 55 or younger, and these early-onset cancers often have a worse prognosis. Biological differences partially explain the discrepancy. For instance, early-onset prostate cancers contain certain genetic abnormalities that don't appear as often in older men with the disease.
        But socioeconomic factors also play an important role, according to new research by investigators at Jacksonville College of Medicine (JCM) in Florida. The fact that poverty, educational status, and other factors governing socioeconomic status (SES) influence cancer survival is well established.
        This is the first study to investigate how SES affects survival in early-onset prostate cancer specifically. The findings show that men with lower SES don't live as long as the higher-SES patients do. ""They're more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages,"" says Dr. Carlos Riveros, a physician and research associate at JCM and the paper's first author.
        What the research found
        During the investigation, Dr. Riveros and his colleagues evaluated data from the National Cancer Database (NCD), which is sponsored by the American College of Surgeons and the National Cancer Institute. The NCD captures data from over 1,500 hospitals in the United States. Dr. Riveros's team focused specifically on long-term outcome data for 112,563 men diagnosed with early-onset prostate cancer between 2004 and 2018.
        The researchers were able to determine the zip codes where each of these patients lived. Then they looked at per-capita income for those zip codes, as well as the percentage of people living within them who had not yet earned a high school diploma. Taken together, the income and educational data served as a composite SES measure for each zip code's population. In a final step, the team looked at how the survival of early-onset prostate cancer patients across the zip codes compares.
        The results were remarkable: Compared to high-SES patients, the low-SES men were far more likely to be African American, and less likely to have health insurance. More of the low-SES men lived in rural neighborhoods and had stage IV prostate cancer at diagnosis. Fewer low-SES patients were treated at state-of-the-art cancer centers, and less of them had surgical treatment.
        After adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, cancer stage, treatment, and other variables, the lower-SES men were 1.5 times more likely than the higher SES men to have died over a median follow-up of 79 months.
        Observations and comments
        According to Dr. Riveros, the findings are consistent with evidence showing that social determinants of health — the conditions in places where people work and spend their lives — have broad impacts on cancer risk. ""Many people in lower-SES areas have had poor diets since birth,"" he says.
        Lower-SES individuals may be limited in their ability to find, understand, or use health-related information, and therefore ""might not know what advanced prostate cancer feels like, or when it's time to go to a doctor,"" Dr. Riveros says. He and his co-authors concluded that SES should be considered when implementing programs to improve the management of patients with early-onset prostate cancer.
        ""This paper underscores the importance of addressing issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion when it comes to optimizing outcomes for men with prostate cancer,"" says Dr. Marc B. Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Dr. Heidi Rayala, a urologist affiliated with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, and a member of the Harvard Medical School Annual Report on Prostate Diseases editorial board, agrees, but adds that evaluating individual sociodemographic factors is challenging because many of them are coupled with disparities in insurance coverage. ""What remains to be answered is whether there are unique underlying SES factors that would benefit from targeted cancer prevention strategies, or whether this all boils down to the 10% of the US population that remains uninsured,"" she says.",Charlie Schmidt,"June 12, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/what-could-cause-my-neck-pain,What could cause my persistent neck pain?,"Q.
          After I fell, I developed right neck pain radiating to the right shoulder. It's been six months, and the pain persists. What could cause this type of pain?
        
        A. Scientists, researchers, and pain experts continue to explore what causes acute pain from an injury to turn into chronic pain. But first, what is the difference between acute and chronic pain?
        Many doctors, including me, have used time frames to define both types of pain, with acute pain lasting two to three weeks and chronic pain lasting two to three months or longer and sometimes becoming permanent. The source of pain is also different. Most acute pain is related to tissue injury and is called nociceptive pain. Chronic pain is referred to as neuropathic pain, which might have started with a damaged or irritated nerve, but the pain signals now originate in the brain. (See ""Stopping pain before it turns chronic"" for more information.)
        So, let's consider your situation through a different lens rather than how long the pain has lasted. I will make some assumptions about your fall to provide a context for understanding this common scenario. The first question is whether your chronic pain relates to persistent tissue injury from your fall. Most cases of tissue damage resolve over weeks, but sometimes there is an element of persistent unrecognized nociceptive pain. But in your case, there appears not to be an ongoing neck or shoulder injury. Yet, in situations like yours, treatment too often remains focused only on the peripheral pain source.
        For example, your doctor may recommend a local anesthetic injection, which could temporarily relieve the pain. However, it would probably come back because the chronic pain now originates in the central nervous system. So, the approach to chronic pain is often better served by primarily addressing the neuropathic origin (primarily the brain).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/irregular-sleep-patterns-linked-to-atherosclerosis,Irregular sleep patterns linked to atherosclerosis,"Go to sleep at 11 p.m. one night, and 2 a.m. the next? You may want to rethink that pattern. A study published online Feb. 15, 2023, by the Journal of the American Heart Association suggests that sleep irregularity — night-to-night variations in sleep duration and timing (when you sleep) — are linked to atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in the arteries). Researchers from Harvard and other institutions asked a diverse group of more than 2,000 people (average age 69), without any known atherosclerosis, to wear sleep trackers and keep sleep diaries for one week. Participants also underwent assessments of artery plaque and one night of sleep testing. Scientists found that people with the most variation in sleep duration (more than two hours a night in a week) and sleep timing (more than 90 minutes in a week) were more likely to have atherosclerosis, compared with people whose sleep was the most consistent. This is an observational study, and we can't make definitive conclusions about cause and effect. But we already know that other sleep problems, such as interrupted sleep and poor sleep quality, are associated with cardiovascular disease. So the connection is plausible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-best-sun-protective-clothing,The best sun-protective clothing,"Summer officially starts this month, and in addition to using a strong sunscreen when you go outside, it's a good idea to wear sun-protective clothing. That's not just any hat or long-sleeved shirt in your closet; sun-protective clothes are made of materials that effectively shield your skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays.
        Protective fabrics
        Loosely woven fabrics of summer (such as gauze and linen) do very little to keep UV radiation from reaching your skin. The best defense comes from tightly woven fabrics with high thread counts, in dark or bright colors (which absorb light). Examples include polyester, nylon, lightweight wool, or canvas.
        Many clothing manufacturers now use high-tech fabrics for sun-protective garments. High-tech fabrics offer at least as much protection as regular densely woven fabrics, and maybe more. Often these fabrics wick away moisture and dry quickly. Some are even embedded with chemicals used in sunscreens (such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide). Note, however, that such chemical protection may last for only a limited amount of wash cycles, such as 20 to 40.
        UPF protection
        You'll know for sure if clothes are sun-protective if they have an Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) rating on the label. That's a measure of how much UV radiation penetrates the fabric.
        ""Look for a UPF rating of 50, which should block about 98% of the sun's rays. It's comparable to sunscreen with a sun protection factor [SPF] of 30, so wearing the clothes is consistent with actually putting sunscreen on,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Can you skip sunscreen if you're wearing UPF-rated clothes? ""Yes, but only for areas covered by the clothes,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""Any exposed skin still needs sunscreen, such as your neck, ears, hands, and feet.""
        And keep in mind that all clothes, UPF-rated or not, provide less UV protection when they get wet or if they're stretched and light can peek between the fibers. ""So make sure clothing fits loosely. And it's not a bad idea to wear a waterproof sunscreen beneath sun-protective clothes if you know you'll be perspiring a lot or going into water,"" Dr. Waldman says.
        Options and costs
        If you're looking to buy UPF-rated clothing, you'll find a wide range of options to shield every inch of your skin, including hats, scarves, gloves, face masks, neck gaiters, shirts, hoodies, dresses, skirts, shorts, pants, leggings, shawls, swimwear, unitards, and more.
        Which items do you really need? ""The more skin you cover, the better, especially if you're doing yard work or going to the beach,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""A hat, long-sleeved shirt, and pants are preferable. That can be a challenge on a really hot day, so make sure the fabric feels breathable and has moisture-wicking properties.""
        UPF-rated clothing can be pricey. A man's long-sleeved tee from some of the largest retailers (such as Coolibar Sun Protective Clothing, Columbia Sportswear Company, Lands' End, or L.L. Bean) goes for about $50. Brimmed hats for men and women also start at about $50.
        To save some money, Dr. Waldman recommends using a laundry aid that adds sun-protective chemicals to densely woven clothes you already own (dry-fit nylon or polyester-blend tees are good candidates). The laundry aid is called Rit SunGuard, and it can give clothes a UPF of 30. ""It's a powder. You just throw it in with normal washing, and it lasts for 20 washes. The clothes look the same,"" Dr. Waldman says.
        A word about hats
        You need a hat that protects more than just the crown of your head from UV rays, and that means you need a wide brim. ""A lot of people fall short by using a baseball cap. But it doesn't cover the ears, the chin, or the back of the neck. So get as wide a brim as possible, at least three inches,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""If you're not wearing a hat with a wide brim, apply sunscreen on exposed areas. And that goes for when you wear bike helmets, too. They have slits that allow for sunburns.""
        A hat's materials and construction are also important considerations. ""You don't want a lot of mesh or large holes in the hat, because UV rays can reach your skin. The best material would be canvas, polyester, or nylon. They'll provide more protection than a straw hat,"" Dr. Waldman says.
        Remember why you're doing this
        Taking the time to wear protective clothes outside has a big payoff for your skin. ""Even one sunburn can result in skin cancer in a few years,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""If you can cover up and avoid burning now, you'll be better off later.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-to-recognize-and-respond-to-a-warning-stroke,"How to recognize and respond to a ""warning"" stroke","A temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain, known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), can cause a range of unsettling symptoms, including slurred speech or arm weakness. The symptoms appear suddenly but usually last less than five minutes, which is why TIAs are often ignored or missed.
        Although TIAs are often referred to as ""ministrokes,"" the term ""warning stroke"" is actually more accurate. A TIA can be a harbinger of a future stroke, which has similar symptoms (see ""Spot a stroke"") but can leave you permanently disabled.
        Nearly one in five people who have a suspected TIA will experience a full-blown stroke within three months, according to a scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) in the March 2023 issue of the journal Stroke. And the risk of a stroke is highest during the 48 hours following the TIA, says Dr. Erica Camargo Faye, a stroke neurologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Sometimes, what appears to be a TIA is more serious than it seems. ""Even symptoms that go away may actually be a stroke,"" says Dr. Camargo Faye. As the AHA statement points out, two of every five people with a suspected TIA who get an appropriate brain imaging test find out that they actually had a stroke. That's why it's so important to be aware of the symptoms and seek emergency care right away.
        Symptoms of a TIA or stroke
        Different areas of the brain have different tasks, so the symptoms that occur during a TIA or stroke depend on the part of the brain in which blood flow is disrupted. A decade ago, the American Stroke Association unveiled a stroke awareness campaign based on the mnemonic FAST. The first three letters (which stand for Face, Arm, and Speech) cover the most typical symptoms people experience. But growing evidence suggests that adding two more letters (B for balance and E for eyes) may help people better recognize either a TIA or an actual stroke. Here are some additional details about each symptom.
        Balance. This symptom can be tricky because many other things can cause dizziness or balance issues, including low blood sugar or inner ear problems. Balance problems caused by a TIA often make it difficult to stand up, and you may fall to one side, says Dr. Camargo Faye. This symptom is often accompanied by other symptoms, including slurred speech or vision problems, she adds.
        Eyes. Vision problems can manifest in different ways, although the most common is not being able to see from one or both eyes. Often, people describe the experience as seeing a dark gray shade that blocks half or all their vision. Blurred or double vision can also occur. ""Sometimes, people mistakenly go to an eye doctor first instead of going to the emergency room,"" says Dr. Camargo Faye.
        Face. The face can droop on one or both sides during a TIA or stroke. Usually, the corner of the mouth appears pulled down, and the person isn't able to smile. Drooping of the eyes and forehead is less common.
        Arm or leg weakness. This symptom tends to affect arms more often than legs and usually occurs on only one side. People may describe the feeling as numbness or tingling rather than weakness. Sometimes the entire side of the body is affected.
        Speech difficulty. Slurred or garbled speech is the most common presentation. But in some cases, people struggle to find words or aren't able to understand what other people are saying. This deficit also extends to writing and typing — including texting on a smartphone. ""The problem isn't related to physical function but rather to a deficit caused by a lack of blood flow in the language areas of the brain,"" Dr. Camargo Faye explains.
        Timing is crucial
        The final letter (T for time) underscores the importance of getting to an emergency room for an assessment as soon as possible, even if your symptoms have disappeared. The new AHA guidelines call for imaging of the blood vessels in the brain and neck, along with blood tests to rule out things that sometimes mimic a TIA, such as low blood sugar or an infection. People diagnosed with a TIA should then get additional testing that can guide treatments to prevent a future stroke.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-device-to-prevent-strokes-in-afib,A device to prevent strokes in afib,"Q.
          I have occasional atrial fibrillation and take anti-clotting medication. My doctor suggested that I consider getting a Watchman device. What exactly is this, and are there any drawbacks?
        
        A. The Watchman device is a tiny, basket-like device that's implanted inside the heart (see illustration). It's designed to help prevent clots from traveling from the heart to the brain, where they might block a blood vessel and cause a stroke. Blood clots tend to form during bouts of atrial fibrillation (afib) because the heart's upper chambers (atria) quiver instead of beating normally. As a result, blood tends to stagnate and form clots, most of which form in a tiny pouch that hangs off the upper left side of the heart called the left atrial appendage (LAA).
        Some people with afib take warfarin (Coumadin) to prevent blood clots. But most take direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban (Eliquis) or rivaroxaban (Xarelto). While these medications all help lower stroke risk, they increase the risk of bleeding, which is usually minor but sometimes serious.
        The Watchman device can be a good alternative for people with afib who have already experienced serious bleeding in the brain, gastrointestinal tract, or elsewhere, according to Dr. Jeremy Ruskin, founder of the arrhythmia service at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Older people who face a high risk for bleeding or experiencing a fall may also be good candidates for the device, as are those who cannot tolerate anti-clotting medications.
        After receiving a Watchman device, people need to take anti-clotting drugs for about six weeks until a layer of cells grows over the device. After that, they can stop the medications. As with any medical procedure, there are risks associated with implanting the device. As Dr. Ruskin explains, the Watchman resembles a tiny, inverted umbrella, and the small prongs that grip the opening of the LAA as the device expands can perforate the heart. As a result, fluid can accumulate around the heart. This problem, known as pericardial effusion, occurs in only about 1% of cases, although the risk of any major complication is around 4%.
        For unknown reasons, women are more likely than men to have complications. But the FDA maintains that for women who are appropriate candidates, the benefits of a Watchman still outweigh the risks. The risk of dangerous bleeding is almost completely eliminated, and for people with afib and a history of brain bleeds on anti-clotting drugs, the Watchman can be a godsend, Dr. Ruskin says. Ask your cardiologist whether he or she thinks you would be a candidate — and to explain whether your age and any other health conditions you have could affect your decision, he advises.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/putting-your-best-feet-forward,Putting your best feet forward,"A person who lives to age 80 may walk an estimated 110,000 miles, equivalent to more than four times around the Earth at the equator. That long journey can take a toll on your feet.
        ""Aging can affect all areas of the body, but the foot is particularly vulnerable, as it's home to so many bones, muscles, and joints,"" says orthopedic foot and ankle surgeon Dr. Chris Chiodo, who, with podiatrist Dr. Joseph Hartigan, served as medical co-editor of the Harvard Special Health Report Healthy Feet: Preventing and treating common foot problems.
        In addition, older adults also are subject to natural foot changes, as feet widen and arches collapse. ""All of this can increase the risks for foot problems that prevent many older adults from staying active and healthy,"" says Dr. Chiodo.
        Proper foot care and maintenance can help avoid everyday problems and keep your feet strong and healthy as you age (see ""Check your feet""). However, some foot ailments common among older adults require special attention.
        
          
            
              
                Check your feet
                Do a thorough foot check every week. Examine the tops and soles of your feet, the spaces between the toes, and the toenails. Newly formed calluses, blisters, and wounds suggest you may need updated footwear. (Get a professional fitting from a specialty running store to ensure proper shoe size and arch support.) Thick, discolored, or spotty toenails could indicate a fungus that may be treated with an over-the-counter remedy or, in severe cases, a prescription drug. Foot swelling or color changes could indicate poor circulation or even a fracture that requires immediate medical attention.
              
            
          
        
        Plantar fasciitis
        The plantar fascia (the ligament on the bottom of the foot) can become inflamed, leading to sharp heel pain called plantar fasciitis. It tends to occur if you overdo high-impact exercise or wear poor-fitting or poorly padded shoes. The pain is often most intense when you first get out of bed in the morning.
        Plantar fasciitis often goes away on its own, although it can last for many weeks. To ease symptoms, apply ice to the painful area and take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain reliever, such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve), as needed. Also, use a gel insert that supports the arch and cushions the heel.
        Gentle stretches also can help. Sit in a chair with one foot on the floor and the other ankle on your knee. Grasp the toes of the raised foot with your hand and gently pull them back until you feel a stretch in the foot's sole. At the same time, gently massage the stretched plantar fascia with your other hand. Hold for 10 seconds. Do this 10 times on each foot, three times per day. If you continue to have pain or discomfort after six weeks, see your primary care clinician or a podiatrist.
        Flat feet
        Flat feet occur when tendons, ligaments, and soft tissues that support the arches lose their elasticity, weakening the arch until the sole of the foot comes in contact with the ground or close to it. While this is often the result of many years on your feet, it also may run in your family.
        Flat feet can make your feet tire easily and cause painful arches. The inner sides and bottoms of your feet can become swollen or develop bony prominences. You also may have back or leg pain as your body compensates for the pain of standing or walking
        To see if you have flat feet, wet your feet, stand on a flat surface that shows your footprint (like concrete), and examine your footprint. Flat feet typically reveal an outline of the entire bottom of the foot. Flat feet are not preventable, particularly when there's a family history. If the problem is caused by aging, there are ways to support your arches and keep the problem from worsening.
        ""Using over-the-counter or custom orthotic inserts and good supportive shoes, or even molded braces, can provide extra arch support,"" says Dr. Hartigan. You may also reduce the pressure and load on your arches by performing calf muscle stretches. In addition, monitor your activities to determine when you most often experience arch pain. You may have to limit higher-impact or repetitive movements and switch to lower-impact exercise, like walking or cycling instead of running or hiking.
        Osteoarthritis
        Osteoarthritis is one of the most common diseases affecting adults ages 65 and older. Although the hips, knees, hands, and spine are more common sites for arthritis, your ankles and feet are also vulnerable due to their many bones and joints. ""While age can increase the risk of osteoarthritis, people who have had repeated ankle sprains also may develop arthritis in their feet as they get older,"" says Dr. Chiodo.
        Osteoarthritis can't be reversed, so the best approach is to manage the condition. Topical pain relievers (such as lidocaine-containing products) and anti-inflammatory agents like diclofenac (Voltaren gel) are effective. Or you might get more relief with an oral over-the-counter or prescription drug. Using orthotic inserts and arch supports also can help.
        For more severe flare-ups, your doctor may suggest a corticosteroid injection to reduce inflammation and pain. Injections sometimes provide months of pain relief, even though they do not work for everyone. If these treatment options don't help and the pain becomes severe enough to cause disability, surgery may be offered. Depending on the location and type of osteoarthritis, the surgery may involve removing loose cartilage and inflamed tissues around the diseased joint(s) or even realigning, fusing, or replacing the joints in certain circumstances.",Matthew Solan,"June 1, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/one-in-five-people-at-risk-of-heart-disease-shuns-statins,One in five people at risk of heart disease shuns statins,"Cholesterol-lowering statins can reduce the odds of having a heart attack by about 25% to 35%, especially in people at high risk for these common, life-threatening events. A new study by Harvard researchers suggests that one in five people with cardiovascular disease or diabetes declines to take a recommended statin drug.
        The study, which spanned 19 years, included more than 24,000 people who had suffered a stroke or had heart disease, vascular disease, diabetes, or very high cholesterol. Over all, about two-thirds of people advised to take statins eventually started them, but the other third never did. Over the entire course of the study, women were more likely than men to never start a statin.
        Published in the February 2023 issue of JAMA Network Open, the study also found harmful LDL cholesterol levels were higher in people who declined to take statins, thereby further increasing their risk of cardiovascular disease. The study authors are planning additional research to understand the reasons behind ""statin refusal.""

        The Harvard-led study, published online Feb. 6, 2023, by JAMA Internal Medicine, analyzed data from more than 32,000 women in the Nurses' Health Study II. They reported information about their lifestyle in 2015 and 2017 as well as their COVID-19 status from April 2020 through November 2021. More than 1,900 participants were infected with the virus during that time, and 44% of those developed long COVID, with symptoms persisting beyond four weeks after the initial infection.
        Women who practiced five or six of a list of healthy lifestyle habits — including weight control, not smoking, regular exercise, adequate sleep, high-quality diet, and moderate alcohol consumption — were 49% less likely to develop long COVID compared with women who practiced none. Of the six lifestyle factors, healthy body weight and adequate sleep (defined as seven to nine hours nightly) were most strongly linked with lower risk.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/women-with-migraines-more-likely-to-have-pregnancy-complications,Women with migraines more likely to have pregnancy complications,"Women who cope with migraine headaches before becoming pregnant may have higher risks of pregnancy complications that could threaten their health or that of their babies, a new analysis suggests.
        The Harvard-led study, published online Jan. 19, 2023, by Neurology, combed through 20 years' worth of data from the Nurses' Health Study II, which included 30,555 pregnancies among 19,694 nurses in the United States. Researchers evaluated how many women reported they'd been diagnosed with migraine, as well as the type of migraine. Participants also reported if they'd experienced medical problems during pregnancy.
        Compared with women who didn't have migraines, women diagnosed with the headache disorder before pregnancy were 17% more likely to report preterm delivery; 28% more likely to have high blood pressure during pregnancy; and 40% more likely to have pre-eclampsia, a serious complication involving high blood pressure and potential organ damage.
        The findings suggest women with migraine might benefit from greater monitoring during pregnancy to avoid complications, study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/the-pain-gap,The pain gap,"When you're hurting, you want to know why — especially when pain returns day after day. So the frustration is real when a diagnosis is elusive, piling on to a cryptic but persistent gender gap in chronic pain.
        The lopsided prevalence of chronic pain between the sexes has long been recognized. Women deal with the problem at rates 6% higher than in men. That's true for back, hip, and knee pain; migraine headaches; arthritis; lupus; and fibromyalgia, among other problems. And some chronic pain conditions strike only women, such as endometriosis; the bladder condition interstitial cystitis; vulvodynia (which affects the vulva); and pelvic girdle syndrome, which involves pain around the pelvic joints and lower back.
        What's still not clear is why. ""We know this disparity exists, but the question is what drives it,"" says Dr. Christopher Gilligan, chief of the Division of Pain Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Estrogen's role
        Evidence suggests that hormones are one contributing factor. A new study found that women who got their first period (a time known as menarche) at a younger age are more likely to have chronic pain in adulthood. The analysis, published in September 2022 in the journal Pain, evaluated data on more than 12,000 women (average age 55). Across the full range of reported ages at menarche — 9 through 18 — the risk of chronic pain dropped 2% for each one-year delay in menstruation.
        The findings add to earlier evidence suggesting exposure to increased estrogen levels from early menstruation may contribute to pain — and to overall sex differences in pain, the study authors said. Even so, genes and other biological factors may also be responsible.
        Paths to pain relief
        Adding to the burden of chronic pain is the difficulty many women have getting a firm diagnosis. This can delay effective treatment. Dr. Gilligan offers these strategies to get the help you may need:
        Be persistent. If your primary care doctor can't pinpoint a cause for your pain, ask for a recommendation or referral to another medical professional. ""Also, if you feel you're not being listened to, seek a second or third opinion until you find a provider who does,"" he adds.
        Stay flexible. Before turning to medications, be open to trying different treatment approaches, including physical or occupational therapy.
        Consider CBT. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help alter your perception of pain and teach you coping skills.
        Seek support. Online and in-person support groups can link you to others who share their pain relief strategies. Additionally, some hospitals offer so-called functional restoration programs — rehabilitation programs for chronic pain sufferers — that involve group support.

          As expected, my heart rate rises when I exercise. But sometimes it seems elevated for no apparent reason. Why might this happen?
        
        A. When at rest, the average adult's heart beats between 60 and 100 times each minute. Your heart can speed up for many different reasons — including, as you've noted, physical activity. Other triggers are also temporary, such as stress, smoking, or caffeine or alcohol use. Certain medications, including those that treat colds, asthma, mood disorders, and high blood pressure, can also elevate your heart rate.
        But a higher-than-normal heart rate can also result from a serious health condition such as anemia, overactive thyroid, or heart disease. Seek immediate medical care if your heart rate seems high and you're also short of breath, dizzy, lightheaded, or weak, or if you have chest pain. In the absence of urgent symptoms, make an appointment to talk to your doctor about what else might be contributing to a higher heart rate.

While natural aging and genetics are part of the equation, lifestyle factors can play a significant role. Two recent studies further explored this connection by looking at how stress and diet might affect cognitive function and protect against Alzheimer's disease.
        One study found that perceived stress — the degree of stress people feel about their life — was linked to poor cognitive health among older adults. Researchers recruited more than 24,000 people (average age 64). They measured stress and cognitive function with the Perceived Stress Scale and the Mini-Mental State Examination. The results showed that people who scored highest on the stress level scale were more likely to have low cognitive test scores. The reverse was also true — lower stress levels went hand in hand with higher test scores. The results were published online March 7, 2023, by JAMA Network Open.
        In another study, published online March 8, 2023, by Neurology, researchers explored whether certain dietary habits may lower the risk of Alzheimer's. The researchers analyzed data on 581 people from the Rush Memory and Aging Project cohort, a prospective study of older adults who agreed to undergo annual evaluations and to donate their brain at death. Participants reported on their dietary habits and completed annual food questionnaires.
        The researchers found that people who regularly followed plant-based diets had lower amounts of beta-amyloid buildup in their brains, a marker for Alzheimer's. Among this group, people with the highest intake of green leafy vegetables — seven or more weekly servings — had less buildup than those who ate only one or two servings a week.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/exercise-an-effective-prescription-for-joint-pain,Exercise: An effective prescription for joint pain,"Joint pain can rob you of life's simple pleasures—you may no longer look forward to walking your dog, gardening, or chasing a tennis ball across the court. Even the basics of getting through your day, like getting into the car or carrying laundry to the basement, can become sharp reminders of your limitations.
        Keep on moving
        It is tempting to avoid the motions that cause you pain. But limiting your movements can weaken muscles and make compound joint trouble worse.
        And actually movement— in the form of the right exercises performed properly —can be a long-lasting way to subdue ankle, knee, hip, or shoulder pain. For some people, the right exercise routine can even help delay or sidestep surgery.
        Your goal should be to pair gentle, targeted joint workouts with a simple walking routine. Your doctor should advise you before you begin a new exercise program.
        Simple stretching tips
        If you start targeted joint exercises, these simple stretching tips are important to any workout:
        
          Warm up first. Muscles stretch more easily when warm. Try doing warm-ups before a workout, or take a warm shower or bath first.
          Feel no pain. Stretch only to the point of mild tension, never to the point of pain. If a stretch hurts, stop doing it. Reset your position carefully and try again. With time and practice, your flexibility will improve.
          Breathe. Breathe comfortably when stretching.
          Practice often. You'll see the best gains if you do gentle stretching frequently—several times a day on as many days of the week as possible.

        High triglycerides
        Your body needs some triglycerides. However, high triglycerides in your blood is linked to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke.
        Until recently, triglycerides tended to get less attention when looking at cardiovascular risk compared to LDL and HDL cholesterol levels. There's no question that extremely high levels (1,000 mg/dL or more) spell trouble and can lead to acute pancreatitis.
        What level of triglycerides is dangerous?
        But what about treating lower levels of triglycerides? Recent evidence suggests you should work to reduce triglyceride levels if they are higher than normal, especially if you have heart disease or have other risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure or smoking.

        Triglycerides can be one of the signs of metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk for having a heart attack or stroke.
        People with metabolic syndrome are several times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. The risk of eventually developing diabetes is even greater.
        A syndrome is, by definition, a group of signs and symptoms that occur together because of an underlying condition. For metabolic syndrome, that group includes abdominal obesity (as measured by waistline), high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low HDL cholesterol — and, yes, high triglyceride levels.
        Triglycerides and HDL
        Triglycerides and HDL are metabolically connected and are often inversely related: As triglycerides go up, HDL tends to go down — and vice versa. But that isn't always so. People can have ""isolated"" high triglycerides without low HDL levels, and research is now showing that high triglycerides are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, no matter what the HDL is.
        What causes high triglyceride levels?
        Factors that can raise your triglyceride level include:
        
          Being overweight or having obesity
          Diabetes
          Cigarette smoking
          Excessive alcohol use
          Certain medicines
          An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
          Some genetic disorders
        
        How to lower high triglyceride levels
        Many of the steps you should take to lower triglycerides are the same ones you should take to protect your heart and health overall. Your doctor will advise you of measures you can take to lower high triglycerides. Some of these steps may include:
        
          Exercise regularly
          Lose weight
          Avoid sugar/refined carbs
          Limit alcohol intake
          Quit smoking
          Get enough sleep
          Manage stress levels.
        
        How to lower triglyceride levels with medication
        If you're taking a statin to lower your LDL, one side benefit may be reduced triglyceride levels. Depending on the dose, statins can lower triglycerides by 20%–40%.
        The omega-3 fats in fish and fish oil capsules are another triglyceride-lowering option. For a very high triglyceride level, your doctor can prescribe a high-dose omega-3 medication.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-cbd-help-with-arthritis-pain-2020041019418,Does CBD help with arthritis pain?,"If you have chronic arthritis pain, you may be wondering about cannabidiol (CBD) as a treatment. CBD, along with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other chemicals, is found in marijuana. But unlike THC, CBD is not psychoactive — that is, it does not cause the intoxication or high associated with marijuana use.
        There's a good chance you've tried it already: according to a 2019 Gallup poll, about 14% of Americans report using CBD products, and the number one reason is pain. The Arthritis Foundation conducted its own poll, and found that 29% reported current use of CBD (mostly in liquid or topical form), and nearly 80% of respondents were either using it, had used it in the past, or were considering it. Of those using it, most reported improvement in physical function, sleep, and well-being; of note, a minority reported improvement in pain or stiffness.
        Perhaps you've been tempted to try it. After all, most types of arthritis are not cured by other treatments, and CBD is considered a less addictive option than opiates. Or maybe it's the marketing that recommends CBD products for everything from arthritis to anxiety to seizures. The ads are pretty hard to miss.
        What's the evidence it works? And what do experts recommend? Until recently, there's been little research and even less guidance for people (or their doctors) interested in CBD products that are now increasingly legal and widely promoted.
        But now, there is.
        A word about arthritis pain
        It's worth emphasizing that there are more than 100 types of arthritis, and while pain is a cardinal feature of all of them, these conditions do not all act alike. And what works for one may not work for another. Treatment is aimed at reducing pain and stiffness and maintaining function for all types of arthritis. But for certain conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, conventional prescription medications are highly recommended, because these drugs help prevent permanent joint damage and worsening disability.
        In addition, individuals experience pain and respond to treatment in different ways. As a result, it's highly unlikely that there is a single CBD-containing product that works for all people with all types of arthritis.
        What's the evidence that CBD is effective for chronic arthritis pain?
        While there are laboratory studies suggesting CBD might be a promising approach, and animal studies showing anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects, well-designed studies demonstrating compelling evidence that CBD is safe and effective for chronic arthritis pain in humans do not exist. A randomized trial of topical CBD for osteoarthritis and psoriatic arthritis found that CBD was no more effective than placebo. Small, short-term or survey-based studies suggest that CBD is potentially helpful for arthritis pain, but these are far from convincing. One of the largest reviews examined the health effects of cannabis and CBD, and concluded that there is ""substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults."" But there was no specific conclusion regarding CBD and arthritis pain, presumably because definitive studies were not available.
        Of course, there is anecdotal evidence and testimonials galore, including reports of dramatic improvement by people who tried CBD in its various forms (including capsule, liquid, topical, and spray) for their pain. But we are still waiting for well-designed, scientifically valid, and rigorous clinical trials that are so badly needed to answer the question of just how helpful CBD may be to people with chronic arthritis pain.
        Are there downsides to CBD treatment?
        As with any treatment, there can be downsides. CBD is generally considered safe; however, it can still cause lightheadedness, sleepiness, dry mouth, and rarely, liver problems. There may be uncertainty about the potency or purity of CBD products (since they are not regulated as prescription medications are), and CBD can interact with other medications. For pregnant women, concern has been raised about a possible link between inhaled cannabis and lower-birthweight babies; it's not clear if this applies to CBD. Some pain specialists have concerns that CBD may upset the body's natural system of pain regulation, leading to tolerance (so that higher doses are needed for the same effect), though the potential for addiction is generally considered to be low.
        There is one definite downside: cost. Prices range widely but CBD products aren't inexpensive, and depending on dose, frequency, and formulation, the cost can be considerable, and health insurance does not usually cover it.
        Are there guidelines about the use of CBD for chronic arthritis pain?
        Until recently, little guidance has been available for people with arthritis pain who were interested in CBD treatment. Depending on availability and interest, patients and their doctors had to decide on their own whether CBD was a reasonable option in each specific case. To a large degree that's still true, but some guidelines have been published. Here's one set of guidelines for people pursuing treatment with CBD that I find quite reasonable:
        
          Dos:
        
        
          If considering a CBD product, choose one that has been independently tested for purity, potency, and safety — for example, look for one that has received a ""Good Manufacturing Practices"" (GMP) certification.
          CBD should be one part of an overall pain management plan that includes nonmedication options (such as exercise) and psychological support.
          Choose an oral treatment (rather than inhaled products) and start with a low dose taken in the evening.
          Establish initial goals of treatment within a realistic period of time — for example, a reduction in knee pain that allows you to walk around the block within two weeks of starting treatment; later, if improved, the goals can be adjusted.
          Tell your doctor(s) about your planned and current CBD treatment; monitor your pain and adjust medications with your medical providers, rather than with nonmedical practitioners (such as those selling CBD products).
        
        
          Don'ts:
        
        
          Don't make CBD your first choice for pain relief; it is more appropriate to consider it if other treatments have not been effective enough.
          Don't have nonmedical practitioners (such as those selling CBD products) managing your chronic pain; pain management should be between you and your healthcare team, even if it includes CBD.
          For people with rheumatoid arthritis or related conditions, do not stop prescribed medications that may be protecting your joints from future damage; discuss any changes to your medication regimen with your doctor.
        
        The bottom line
        If you're interested in CBD treatment for chronic arthritis pain or if you're already taking it, review the pros, cons, and latest news with your healthcare providers, and together you can decide on a reasonable treatment plan. Depending on the type of arthritis you have, it may be quite important to continue your conventional, prescribed medications even if you pursue additional relief with CBD products.
        We may not have all the evidence we'd like, but if CBD can safely improve your symptoms, it may be worth considering.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","May 5, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/lifestyle-changes-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-attacks,Lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of gout attacks,"Lifestyle measures, such as dietary changes, can help lower levels of uric acid, the chemical that causes gout by forming crystals that deposit in joints. However, for most people, changes in diet alone are not enough to prevent gout. To reduce uric acid levels enough to stop attacks, medication is usually needed. Still making changes in what you eat can lead to fewer gouty flares.
        In the past, doctors often handed their patients a list of foods high in purines and instructed them not to eat those foods. By itself, that hasn't been shown to be particularly helpful.
        More recently, experts have begun thinking about diet differently. Instead of trying to figure out which individual foods you should avoid, the focus is on following a healthy diet and trying to lose weight if you're overweight or obese. Just losing weight can lower uric acid levels. Drinking plenty of fluids is also helpful. It's also important to limit sweetened drinks and alcohol, as these can increase uric acid levels.
        In general, a healthy diet emphasizes plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and legumes. Whole grains are preferred over processed grains. Intake of fat, especially saturated fat (found in red meat), should be reduced. Lean sources of protein, including chicken, turkey, fish, and tofu, are better choices than beef or pork.
        Fish, which contains omega-3 fatty acids, is part of a healthy diet. But some seafood also contains high amounts of purines. People with gout don't have to steer completely clear of fish. But try to limit the amount of shellfish, sardines, and anchovies you eat, because they have the highest amounts of purines. A better choice is flaky white fish, such as cod, tilapia, or flounder.
        One pattern of healthy eating is the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. One study found that people following the DASH diet for eight weeks lowered their uric acid levels 0.25 mg/dL on average. The higher the starting uric acid level, the greater the decline.
        There are a few foods people with gout should limit as much as possible or avoid entirely. And some foods may be beneficial. For example, multiple studies have found lower uric acid levels among people who consume low-fat dairy products.
        Studies have found that vitamin C may lower uric acid levels. People with gout may be helped by adding citrus fruits and other foods rich in vitamin C (such as strawberries and peppers) to their diet. Some evidence suggests that eating cherries can reduce gout attacks and improve pain. These findings are not conclusive, but there's no harm in adding cherries to your diet.
        Remember: You aren't to blame for gout because you overdid the steak and lobster dinners or drank too much alcohol. Gout is a chronic form of arthritis caused by the effects of too much uric acid in the bloodstream. Certain factors can raise your risk of gout and contribute to triggering gout attacks. These include certain foods and alcohol. But just eliminating purine-rich foods and alcohol is not enough to prevent attacks for most people with gout. Medications are used to treat an acute attack, and you can take other medications over the long term to prevent further attacks. When it comes to diet, focus on an overall healthy eating pattern, drink plenty of fluids, and try to lose excess weight.

A randomized study published in the January 2023 issue of The Lancet Planetary Health found all of those benefits when participants grew their own produce. The trial involved about 300 people (average age 41) who wore activity monitors and took occasional surveys about their diet and health. None of them had kept a garden for at least two years. Half of the participants were given an introductory gardening course, seeds, and community garden plots to work in for one year. The other participants were told not to do any gardening for a year. Compared with non-gardeners, gardeners ate about two more grams of fiber each day (a 7% increase in their fiber intake), reported greater reductions in stress and anxiety, and did about six more minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per day (about 40 minutes per week). All of those changes are linked to better health, such as lower risks of cancer and other chronic diseases.

But few studies have looked at healthy lifestyle effects on memory in particular, and none have considered the effects on memory in people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. Now a study from China offers insight. The study, published online Jan. 25, 2023, by BMJ, involved more than 29,000 people without dementia (average age 72). Participants initially underwent cognitive testing as well as genetic testing for genes known to raise risk for Alzheimer's, and reported how well they stuck to six healthy lifestyle habits (eating a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking, not drinking alcohol, being socially active, and engaging in brain-challenging activities). Participants were followed for 10 years, periodically reporting their lifestyle habits and undergoing cognitive testing. At the end of the study, people who stuck to at least four healthy habits showed significantly slower memory decline than people who didn't practice any healthy habits. This was true even among people with Alzheimer's-related genes. The habits associated with the biggest effects were diet, cognitive activity, exercise, and social contact. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that a healthy lifestyle protected memory. But a healthy lifestyle has many health benefits, and you'll only win by improving yours.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/appreciating-golfs-cardiovascular-perks,Appreciating golf's cardiovascular perks,"Golf is jokingly described as a good walk spoiled. But that walk is loaded with cardiovascular health benefits — maybe even more than you'd get from an hour of brisk walking or Nordic walking, suggests a small, randomized study published online Feb. 6, 2023, by BMJ Open Sport and Exercise Medicine. Researchers asked 25 healthy, experienced golfers (men and women ages 65 or older) to complete three different types of exercise within a five-day period (just one activity per day). The exercises included one 18-hole round of golf on foot (pulling golf clubs), one hour of brisk walking, and one hour of Nordic walking (which involves the use of poles). On exercise days, participants ate identical breakfasts and snacks; had their blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol measured before and after exercise; and wore activity trackers. All three activities lowered blood pressure and levels of blood sugar and cholesterol. But golf seemed to have slightly more effect on blood sugar and cholesterol, at least in the short term. Scientists speculate it's because of the game's long duration (three to four hours) and the extra energy required to drag heavy clubs around a golf course. In fact, golfing burned more than twice as many calories as the walking activities. Because the study was small, a larger, longer-term study would be needed to confirm the results.

A new study links diets high in free sugar to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
        The study relied on data from diet questionnaires from more than 110,000 people ages 37 to 73. Researchers tracked the participants' health for a median of about nine years. They found that every 5% increase in the share of total calories that came from free sugar was linked to a 6% higher risk of heart disease and a 10% higher risk of stroke.
        The study, described in the Feb. 14, 2023, issue of BMC Medicine, also found that eating more fiber was associated with a lower risk of heart-related problems. The results support a large body of earlier research suggesting that whole-grain, unprocessed carbohydrates are healthier than highly processed carbs — especially free sugar.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-you-be-tested-for-sleep-apnea,Should you be tested for sleep apnea?,"Getting a good night's sleep on a regular basis is essential for cardiovascular health. That means everyone — especially people with heart problems — should address any issues that keep them from getting at least seven hours of restorative sleep every night. One common problem is obstructive sleep apnea, a condition marked by brief pauses in breathing, often triggering loud snoring, grunts, gasps, and choking noises.
        These repeated breathing disruptions cause your heart rate and blood pressure to rise, putting stress on your heart and circulation. ""Somewhere between 40% and 80% of people with cardiovascular disease may have sleep apnea,"" says Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Yet sleep apnea frequently goes undetected and untreated. Why?
        Often, people don't realize they are periodically gasping for air throughout the night unless a bed partner or family member notices. In addition, many people with sleep apnea (particularly those who have cardiovascular disease) don't report excessive daytime sleepiness, one of the most common symptoms of the disorder, says Dr. Javaheri. ""Some people are so accustomed to sleep deprivation that they don't realize they're sleepy,"" she says.
        Causes, risks, and other symptoms
        Sleep apnea occurs when tissue in the tongue or throat temporarily narrows or blocks the airway during sleep, sometimes as many as 100 times an hour. While people of all ages and sizes can develop sleep apnea, it's most common in older people and those who are overweight or obese, as well as people with heart problems, hard-to-control blood pressure, and diabetes.
        One way that doctors assess the likelihood of sleep apnea is with the STOPBANG questionnaire (see box). Other symptoms that may be caused by sleep apnea include nighttime restlessness; trouble with concentration or memory; mood changes; morning headaches; vivid, strange, or threatening dreams; and nighttime waking to urinate.
        
          
            
              
                Test yourself for sleep apnea with STOP-BANG
              
            
            
              
                A ""yes"" answer to three or more of these questions suggests possible sleep apnea. Ask your doctor if you should have a sleep study.

        Diagnosing sleep apnea
        If you think you might have sleep apnea, check with your doctor about an evaluation. If possible, start with a sleep specialist (or ask for a referral to one), as these experts are often better able to navigate insurance issues and recommend appropriate, timely testing and treatment. In the past, diagnosing sleep apnea always required an over-night stay in a sleep lab. Today, home-based tests (which are more convenient and less expensive) are the norm. They're recommended for people whose symptoms suggest they have moderate to severe sleep apnea and who have no other significant medical problems.
        For a home sleep study, you'll get a small, lightweight monitor; a belt you slip around your midsection; a small finger clip; and a sensor to place under your nose. These devices measure your oxygen saturation (the amount of oxygen in your blood), heart rate, and airflow, as well as the movements of your chest and abdomen and your position while you sleep. If you need to use the bathroom, you just take the equipment with you.
        Treating sleep apnea
        Lifestyle changes that can improve sleep apnea include
        
          losing weight if needed
          avoiding alcohol within three hours of bedtime
          not taking medications that relax your muscles in the evening
          treating nasal congestion with medications or home remedies
          sleeping on your side or elevating your head.
        
        People with moderate to severe apnea often need positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, which uses a small machine to deliver pressurized air through a mask covering your nose (and sometimes your mouth) to keep your airway open as you sleep. Even people with mild sleep apnea who feel sleepy during the day may benefit from PAP, which can help people feel more alert and rested and may also improve their mood and quality of life, says Dr. Javaheri.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/hospital-at-home-a-movement-whose-time-has-come,Hospital at home: A movement whose time has come,"Each year, nearly a million Americans find out they have heart failure. This diagnosis isn't as quite as dire as the name sounds (see ""What is heart failure?""). Still, it's one of the top three reasons older people are admitted to a hospital — and about half of these people return within six months. But what if you could receive the same high-level care for this common condition in the comfort of your own home?
        Hospital at home isn't just a dream, but a well-researched concept that's been around for decades and already practiced in Australia and many European countries. Now, it's finally starting to take hold in the United States, thanks to a waiver from the federal government that currently allows Medicare to pay for the program.
        
          
            
              
                What is heart failure?
                Although the term ""heart failure"" implies your heart has stopped working, that's not the case. Instead, the heart doesn't pump well and struggles to supply sufficient blood to meet the body's needs. The resulting fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath tend to wax and wane but slowly worsen over time. Sometime, symptoms worsen suddenly and require hospitalization.
              
            
          
        
        A growing need
        ""The COVID-19 pandemic, along with the rising numbers of aging adults in this country, made it very obvious that we need to increase our capacity for providing hospital-level care,"" says emergency medicine physician Dr. Jared Conley, associate director of the Health Care Transformation Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. Back in 2016, he and colleagues launched hospital-at-home programs there and at Brigham and Women's, another Harvard-affiliated hospital. Their early experience focused on treating people with a variety of medical conditions but especially worsening heart failure, which often accounted for one-third of hospitalizations, he says.
        The hospital-at-home programs at the two Harvard hospitals were found to be just as safe and effective as in-hospital care, with equal or improved survival rates. People also preferred the at-home care and were less likely to require repeat hospitalizations. Another bonus: hospital-at-home care was about 30% to 40% less expensive, says Dr. Conley.
        What is hospital at home?
        Of course, some people are too ill and unstable to receive care at home. But many people who need less-intensive treatment are good candidates for hospital at home, where a doctor oversees your care visits once daily (sometimes via videoconferencing), along with nurses or paramedics who come to your home at least twice a day. If you have heart failure, you may have a video consultation with a cardiologist to fine-tune your treatment. Treating an episode of worsening heart failure usually requires intravenous medications that help remove fluid from the lungs and elsewhere in the body. In addition to setting up the apparatus to deliver those drugs, nurses or other care team members can draw blood and carry out other tests, including portable ultrasounds of the heart and chest x-rays, as needed. Health care team members will check your vital signs daily, but you'll also be constantly monitored via a small patch on your chest that measures your heart rate and rhythm, breathing rate, and activity. (It also features a sensor that determines if you've fallen.) All equipment is provided by the care team, including the tablet used for video visits and, if needed, a separate device to enable a fast, reliable Internet connection. ""Home is a much better environment for healing — you sleep better, are less sedentary, and can have more social interaction with family and friends,"" Conley notes.
        Future directions
        Before the pandemic, there were no more than 20 hospital-at-home programs in the United States. ""But once the Medicare waiver took effect, the care model increased almost exponentially,"" says Dr. Conley. Today, there are 260 hospitals in 37 states in various stages of starting or expanding their programs to provide at-home hospital-level care. In December 2022, Congress approved an extension of the waiver for another two years.
        Heart failure cases are expected to rise significantly in coming years as America ages. ""Instead of building more and more brick-and-mortar hospitals, which often require capital outlays of about $2 billion each, we have a unique opportunity to rethink the way we care for people. Our north star for patient care should be maximizing days spent healing safely in the comfort of our own homes,"" Dr. Conley says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/yoga-a-flexible-way-to-enhance-heart-health,Yoga: A flexible way to enhance heart health,"We tend to think of exercise as movement that either raises your heart rate (aerobic exercise) or builds muscles (strength training). But two other factors — flexibility and balance — are also important for a well-rounded fitness program, especially for older adults. A yoga practice has the potential to target all four factors at the same time. What's more, a recent study suggests that yoga has modest yet positive effects on several factors linked to cardiovascular health (see ""How yoga may help your heart"").
        ""The reason behind these benefits isn't entirely clear, but we believe that multiple, simultaneous mechanisms are probably at play,"" says Dr. Darshan Mehta, medical director of the Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. Yoga is more than simply stretching and moving into poses — it weaves together three interconnected threads: physical postures, controlled breathing, and meditation. Together, they help cultivate the relaxation response, which trains your body to be less reactive during times of stress.
        
          
            
              
                How yoga may help your heart
                To explore how yoga may affect cardiovascular health, a team of researchers pooled data from studies of yoga done over the past few decades. Their findings, reported in the May 2023 Current Problems in Cardiology, are summarized below.
                When: The analysis combined results from 64 randomized controlled trials of yoga published from 1989 to 2022. Most were done in Southeast Asia.
                Who: The analysis included nearly 17,000 people in all, roughly half of whom performed yoga. Those in control groups did other types of gentle exercise, stretching, or no exercise. Their average age was 56.
                Key findings: Compared with those in control groups, people who did yoga had systolic blood pressure values (the first number in a reading) that were 4.5 points lower and levels of harmful LDL cholesterol that were 7.6 points lower, on average. Yoga was also linked to slightly lower HbA1c levels (a measure of average blood sugar over the past few months) and a small drop in body mass index.
              
            
          
        
        How yoga helps
        The relaxation response not only slows the heart rate and lowers blood pressure, it may also tamp down inflammation and promote favorable changes in blood vessel function that protect the heart. As a mind-body practice, yoga encourages people to slow down and be more mindful about heart-healthy behaviors, such as eating well and getting enough sleep, says Dr. Mehta. Those habits — along with positive emotions that some forms of yoga aim to inspire, such as compassion and gratitude — may also help foster cardiovascular health.
        Finding your fit
        Think you can't do yoga because you aren't flexible? ""By practicing yoga, you become more flexible — that's another reason to do it,"" says clinical social worker and yoga teacher Laura Malloy, director of yoga programs at the Benson-Henry Institute. If you're new to yoga, seek out a beginner or ""gentle"" class, especially if you're over 65 or have any medical conditions. Several forms are well suited to beginners, such as Hatha yoga, which features gentle, smooth movements that are integrated with your breathing. Iyengar is similar but places more emphasis on body alignment and balance and uses props such as straps, blankets, and blocks. Yin yoga, which is done mostly sitting or lying down, encourages people to go deeper into poses by holding them longer.
        Another option is chair yoga, practiced sitting in a chair or standing using a chair for support. It's good for older people or anyone who feels less steady or has trouble getting up from the floor, says Malloy. Though gentle, chair yoga still provides results. ""After I teach a 20-minute chair yoga class, I've heard people say ""Wow, that made such a difference in how I feel!'"" says Malloy. (You can try one of her 30-minute instructional videos here: health.harvard.edu/cy.
        You can find classes at dedicated yoga studios as well as at health clubs, community or senior centers, or even hospitals. Costs range from about $15 to $20 per class. Yoga of the Heart, a form of yoga designed for specifically for people with heart disease, is taught by instructors trained and certified by Nischala Joy Devi, who developed the yoga portion of the Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease, an evidence-based, integrated lifestyle program for heart patients.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/which-antidepressants-are-best-for-treating-chronic-pain,Which antidepressants are best for treating chronic pain?,"Antidepressants are sometimes prescribed for chronic pain conditions even in people who do not have depression. But are these medications equally effective? A study published online Feb. 1, 2023, by The BMJ suggests not.
        Antidepressants are thought to help by acting on chemicals in the brain that assist with pain relief, such as serotonin. Here, researchers looked at 156 trials involving more than 25,000 people that compared antidepressant with placebo treatment for any pain condition. Although most antidepressants prescribed for pain treatment are tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline is the most commonly used for pain) the evidence was unclear on how well these drugs work or whether they help treat most pain conditions. In comparison, antidepressants known as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) — particularly duloxetine (Cymbalta) — were found to be the most effective, and proved useful for the largest number of pain conditions, including back pain, knee osteoarthritis, postoperative pain, fibromyalgia, and nerve pain.
        If you have chronic pain, talk to your doctor about whether an antidepressant might be an appropriate choice, and which one may be best for you.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/short-term-stroke-symptoms-still-need-emergency-care,Short-term stroke symptoms still need emergency care,"An episode of stroke symptoms that disappear in less than an hour is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA). After a TIA, it may seem like you're back to normal. Even so, it's still best to seek immediate care to prevent a full-blown stroke, according to a statement from the American Heart Association published online Jan. 19, 2023, by the journal Stroke.
        Each year, about 240,000 people experience a TIA — a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain. While the TIA itself doesn't cause permanent damage, nearly one out of five people who have a TIA will suffer a full-blown stroke within three months.
        Because TIA symptoms go away, people often ignore their seriousness and don't seek immediate care. The statement underscored that it's important for people to be able to identify TIA symptoms so they can take action. It recommended the FAST guideline, which stands for Face drooping or numbness, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call 911.
        The statement also highlighted strategies people can adopt to lower their TIA risk and, if they have had a TIA, to help prevent future strokes. These include behavioral health counseling, increased physical activity, following a plant-based diet, and limiting alcohol intake.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/try-this-roll-with-it,Try this: Roll with it,"Sore legs? Tight back? Using a foam roller may offer some instant and even long-term relief.
        The most common foam rollers are cylinders made of firm, compressed foam. They are usually 6 inches in diameter and range from 12 to 36 inches long. Rollers come in varying levels of firmness, color-coded to reflect whether they are soft (white), medium (red, blue, or green), or hard (black).
        Foam rolling is a myofascial release technique. The fascia is a sheet of fibrous connective tissue made of collagen surrounding muscles. It holds muscles in place and helps them glide through their range of motion. Muscles and fascia can become tight from overuse, underuse, and poor body mechanics.
        Foam rolling is often used on trouble spots like the calves, thighs, buttocks, and back. You slowly roll an area of your body back and forth across the top of the roller. For example, to roll your calf muscle, sit on the floor with your legs in front of you and your hands behind you for support. Place one calf on top of the roller and move that leg back and forth over it for about 30 seconds to a minute.
        If you hit a tender spot, slowly roll over it, or hold the roller in place for several seconds or until you feel relief. Immediately stop if rolling causes any pain. Lingering pain from foam rolling may signal a bigger problem that should be checked out. For a comprehensive rolling routine, consult a personal trainer or physical therapist.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/winning-the-skin-game,Winning the skin game,"The saying goes that the past always comes back to haunt you. Nowhere is this more apparent than with your skin. ""As you get older, the sun damage to your face and neck you experienced when you were younger shows up as dry skin, wrinkles, and age spots,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, a dermatologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        While much of this sun damage occurred in the past, you can take steps now to reverse some of it. ""Adopting a daily skin care routine is the best way to treat existing skin problems, maintain healthy skin, and protect against future harm,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        You don't need to follow an elaborate process. Keep it simple, and focus on three steps: wash, moisturize, and apply sunscreen. Then do it every day.
        Step 1: Wash
        Wash your face and neck twice a day — when you wake up and before bedtime. (You can do this once daily if your skin tends to be dry, and preferably in the evening so you sleep with clean skin.)
        ""Avoid using regular bar soap,"" says Dr. Waldman. ""It strips the skin of its outer layer and makes it harder to keep in moisture, which can lead to dry skin."" Instead, choose an over-the-counter product labeled as a gentle cleanser for sensitive skin. Avoid products that contain sulfates or are labeled ""foaming,"" as they can be drying. Also, don't use facial scrubs with small particles, which can irritate the skin.
        Massage a pea-sized amount of the cleanser onto your damp face and neck for about 20 seconds, or the amount of time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice, and then rinse with warm water. ""If you don't have oily skin, washing only with warm water also can work,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        
          
            
              
                Give your skin an A — and maybe a B
                Another way to help restore aging skin is to use a lotion or cream that contains a retinoid, a compound derived from vitamin A. Retinoids increase collagen (the most abundant protein in the body) and help strengthen skin and restore elasticity. ""Regular application can improve the appearance of wrinkles, sun spots, and overall skin texture,"" says dermatologist Dr. Abigail Waldman with Brigham and Women's Hospital.
                Choose over-the-counter anti-aging creams or lotions with retinol as the active ingredient, or get a prescription for a stronger retinoid from your doctor. Take it slow, as these products can irritate the skin if overused. Dr. Waldman suggests an every-three-day routine at first. Use a pea-sized amount over your entire face before bedtime. Retinoids make skin sensitive to light, so don't use them during the daytime. ""Monitor how your skin reacts, and look for redness, significant peeling, or irritation,"" says Dr. Waldman. ""As your skin builds tolerance, increase applications to every night.""
                Oral nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3, has protective effects against ultraviolet damage caused by sun exposure. Research has shown it can lower the risks of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma — the two most common skin cancers — in people vulnerable to skin cancer. Speak with your doctor or dermatologist about whether you are a candidate.
              
            
          
        
        Step 2: Moisturize
        After washing, while your skin is still damp, apply a moisturizing lotion or cream. (People with oily skin can skip this step.) ""Moisturizing recreates the skin's outer barrier to prevent moisture from escaping and to stop foreign substances from getting in,"" says Dr. Waldman. Use a dollop for your entire face and another for your neck, and massage in until fully absorbed.
        Choose a lotion or cream that contains fewer than 10 ingredients or is labeled for sensitive skin. ""Fewer ingredients mean fewer chemicals or additives, especially fragrances that could irritate skin,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        Key ingredients to look for include hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, glycolic acid, and squalene, which help keep skin hydrated. Vitamin C and azelaic acid can help lighten dark spots.
        Step 3: Apply sunscreen
        Finally, apply sunscreen to your face, especially under the eyes, as well as your entire neck and ears. ""Sunscreen not only guards against skin cancer and the aging effects from sun exposure but also helps to prevent brown spots and to keep existing ones from worsening,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        Use sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Avoid spray sunscreens, which contain alcohol that can burn. For efficiency, a combination moisturizing and sunscreen product also works well.
        ""The best sunscreen is the one you enjoy wearing, so experiment until you find one that has a pleasant smell and texture and is easy to apply,"" says Dr. Waldman. When you're outside for an extended period, make sure to reapply your sunscreen every two hours.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/6-natural-ways-to-lower-blood-pressure,6 natural ways to lower blood pressure,"Taking medication to lower high blood pressure is a proven way to reduce your risk for heart disease. But adopting lifestyle changes may let you maintain healthy readings and perhaps even avoid drug therapy. ""Unless a person's blood pressure is very high, medication most often does not start immediately,"" says Dr. Howard LeWine, editor in chief of Harvard Men's Health Watch. ""For people with elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension, the first order of business is to get serious about modifying their lifestyle.""
        By the numbers
        Normal blood pressure is defined as a reading of less than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Elevated pressure means systolic blood pressure (the first number in a reading) is 120 to 129 mm Hg with a diastolic pressure (the second number) of less than 80 mm Hg. People who have consistent readings of 130 to 139 for systolic pressure or 80 to 89 for diastolic pressure are said to have high blood pressure (stage 1 hypertension).
        ""But your target numbers may differ based on your health and individual goals, as determined in consultation with your doctor,"" says Dr. LeWine.
        Healthy lifestyle habits are the cornerstone of managing blood pressure, whether or not you require medication. A lifestyle approach to management also helps people feel more in control of their health.
        ""Understandable, sometimes people are reluctant to start a drug because they don't want to be dependent on medication,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""And this resistance can provide extra motivation for making the necessary changes."" Still, don't be discouraged if your doctor wants you to begin taking a low dose of medication. Once you reach your blood pressure goals, maintaining a healthy lifestyle may mean you can take a drug holiday (with your doctor's approval). ""And even if you still need medication, your healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent dose increases or additional blood pressure drugs,"" says Dr. LeWine.
        The big six
        Six lifestyle changes have the most significant influence on blood pressure, according to Dr. LeWine. They include the foundation for healthy living — diet, exercise, and weight control — as well as limiting sodium and alcohol and managing stress.
        ""While all of these are important, don't try to change them all at once,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""In consultation with your doctor, you first want to concentrate on the one or two most important modifications, based on what's likely to have the greatest impact.""
        Diet. While most experts advocate plant-based diets to help lower blood pressure numbers, a recent study found that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may have the most significant impact. The researchers found that adopting the DASH diet could prevent an estimated 15,000 annual heart attacks and strokes among men with high blood pressure. DASH emphasizes fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, nuts, seeds, and grains and limits consumption of red meat, sodium, and sugar-sweetened foods and drinks.
        Exercise. Guidelines call for a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. A reasonable starting goal is 20 to 30 minutes every other day. Any kind of exercise is always better than nothing. But if you need motivation, join a walking club or sports league (like golf, bowling, basketball, or pickleball), hire a personal trainer, or sign up for fitness classes at a gym or community center. You can also increase your daily movements, like walking for five minutes every hour, doing two sets of five to 10 push-ups on the floor or against the kitchen counter, or 20 minutes of yoga or stretching.
        Weight. While it's natural for men's weight to increase somewhat with age, even five to 10 pounds over their ideal number can raise blood pressure. ""In fact, for overweight men, every pound lost could lower systolic blood pressure by up to 1 mm Hg,"" says Dr. LeWine. Your doctor can determine your target weight for your age and body type. Investing in a healthy diet and increasing exercise can help reduce weight.
        Sodium. ""People with high blood pressure sometimes have a significant improvement by avoiding sodium,"" says Dr. LeWine. Processed foods account for much of the sodium that people consume. These include foods like canned vegetables and soups, frozen dinners, lunch meats, instant and ready-to-eat cereals, salty chips, and other packaged snacks. Cut back on these items, or select low-sodium options.
        Alcohol. Drinking more than moderate amounts of alcohol can raise blood pressure. Guidelines says men should consume no more than two standard drinks per day, with a single drink defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits. However, cutting back on alcohol as much as possible is ideal.
        Stress. Reducing stress is also a priority. Stress can lead to chronic inflammation that damages artery walls, making them less elastic. In addition, ongoing stress can trigger the adrenal glands to release hormones that raise blood pressure. ""Uncontrolled stress often manifests as poor sleep, overeating, and physical inactivity,"" says Dr. LeWine. To manage stress, practice relaxation breathing and meditation, or perhaps just set aside time every day to do whatever you wish, even if it's nothing at all.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/erectile-dysfunction-drugs-linked-to-lower-risk-of-heart-problems,Erectile dysfunction drugs linked to lower risk of heart problems,"Otherwise healthy men treated with prescription drugs for erectile dysfunction had fewer heart-related problems than men who didn't take the medications, a new study finds.
        Known as PDE-5 inhibitors, the drugs include sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn). They work by relaxing artery walls and improving blood flow. Earlier research suggested these drugs may also reduce heart problems in men with diabetes or heart disease.
        The new study included 72,000 men diagnosed with erectile dysfunction but no heart problems in the previous year. Nearly 24,000 were prescribed a PDE-5 inhibitor and followed for an average of 2.4 years; the others were followed for an average of three years. Compared with men who did not take PDE-5 inhibitors, those who did had a 13% lower rate of heart attacks, strokes, or other serious heart-related events and a 39% lower rate of rate of death related to cardiovascular disease. But these findings would need to be validated in a controlled clinical trial for the drugs to be approved to prevent heart disease. The study appeared in the January 2023 issue of The Journal of Sexual Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sleep-apnea-may-lead-to-weaker-bones-and-teeth,Sleep apnea may lead to weaker bones and teeth,"People with sleep apnea — meaning they briefly and repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping — are more likely to have low bone density, a small new analysis suggests.
        The study, published online Nov. 11, 2022, by The Journal of Craniomandibular and Sleep Practice, used a type of imaging called cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to measure bone density in the head and neck of 38 adults undergoing orthodontic treatment, half of whom had sleep apnea. The researchers found that participants with apnea had significantly lower bone density in the head and neck than those who didn't have the condition.
        Sleep apnea can trigger low oxygen levels and inflammation in the body, which may interfere with the continual cycle of bone breakdown and renewal, researchers said. This could ultimately lower bone density levels, increasing the risk of broken bones and causing teeth to become loose.
        Screening tests for bone density are an important part of routine care for many people, including all women 65 and older.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-humble-gallbladder,The humble gallbladder,"In the hierarchy of digestive organs, you might first list the stomach, liver, or colon. But there's a pear-shaped sac tucked under your liver that barely gets a second thought: the lowly gallbladder.
        This small but mighty organ plays an important role in helping us digest food, but we often don't acknowledge it unless something goes wrong — which happens in about 15% of American adults, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Yet gallbladder disease — which includes stones, inflammation, infection, or blockage — can lead to excruciating pain or even life-threatening complications down the line.
        The gallbladder essentially serves as a storage room for bile, squeezing the fluid into the small intestine to help digest the fats we consume. It makes sense, then, that the organ might struggle when our diet is heavy in fatty or fried foods. We can live without a gallbladder, but it can't stay in peak performance mode without diligent care, says Dr. William Brugge, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        ""I think people generally try to ignore their gallbladder,"" Dr. Brugge says. ""It doesn't have as squeamish a reputation as the colon or rectum, but it's down there on the list.""
        
          
            
              
                Tactics to promote gallbladder health
                Keeping your gallbladder healthy involves a similar approach to keeping the rest of your body in optimal shape. These familiar suggestions include:
                Eat more fruits and vegetables. They're rich in nutrients such as vitamin C, folic acid, and magnesium, which may lower the risk of gallbladder disease. Fiber-filled fruits and vegetables also don't strain the gallbladder, since they contain little or no fat.
                Favor lean proteins. Opting for poultry, lean meat, and fish dishes that are baked or broiled — not fried — can lower your gallstone risk. Limit or avoid full-fat dairy products and red or processed meats.
                Maintain a healthy weight. Overweight or obesity can make you prone to gallstones.
              
            
          
        
        Risk factors
        Aside from a high-fat diet, other risk factors for gallbladder disease include overweight or obesity, a family history of gallbladder issues, Native American or Latino heritage, and being 40 or older. Women are twice as likely as men to develop gallstones, which top the list of gallbladder problems. Extra estrogen, particularly during pregnancy, slows the gallbladder's ability to empty, letting bile pool, Dr. Brugge says.
        Gallstones develop when bile or related fluids form hardened stonelike lumps that can grow and multiply. Attacks of agonizing pain result when gallstones get larger or block bile ducts. Other symptoms include pain between the shoulder blades, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, bloating, indigestion, and sweating. About a quarter of people diagnosed with gallstones each year need treatment, which is usually surgery.
        ""After eating a particularly heavy or fatty meal, you may have severe pain — far more than gas or cramps — that might last for an hour or two,"" Dr. Brugge says.
        Serious complications
        Because bile ducts connect the gallbladder to other digestive organs, these surrounding structures can also suffer complications from gallbladder disease. Problems include cholangitis (bile duct inflammation), cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), and pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
        But the most dangerous complication, Dr. Brugge says, is gallbladder inflammation called cholecystitis. It results from a gallstone getting stuck in the gallbladder, which becomes infected and causes searing pain. ""It's a pretty dramatic illness,"" he says. ""The gallbladder can rupture or leak infected bile, and the infection can spread through the body. It can be fatal.""
        New evidence suggests gallstones may also raise the risk of developing cancers of the liver, bile duct, and pancreas. A study published online June 17, 2022, by the British Journal of Cancer tracked more than 115,000 women and nearly 50,000 men for up to 30 years, asking about their history of gallstones at the study's start and every other year afterward. Compared with people without gallstones, those who got them were 60% more likely to develop liver cancer, more than four times as likely to develop bile duct cancer, and 13% more likely to develop pancreatic cancer.
        Gallbladder cancer itself is relatively rare, diagnosed in about 12,200 Americans each year. ""It's very deadly, but not very common,"" Dr. Brugge says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/supplements-for-three-common-conditions,Supplements for three common conditions,"Certain herbs, vitamins, minerals, and other compounds may help control cholesterol, blood pressure, and anxiety.
        
        
          
        
        High cholesterol, high blood pressure, and anxiety are three common conditions that are often treated with medication. But sometimes people can't tolerate those drugs or are reluctant to use them. In these instances, dietary supplements may be an option.
        Studies have shown that some herbs, vitamins, minerals, and other substances, alone or in combination with traditional treatments, may be effective in treating these conditions, and are largely safe to use — provided your doctor approves.
        High cholesterol
        Vitamin D3. If you cannot tolerate a statin medication and have a low vitamin D level, a vitamin D3 supplement could help. After taking the supplement, some people are then able to tolerate statins when they couldn't in the past.
        Phytosterols. Phytosterols (also called plant stanols or sterols) are derived from the cell membranes of plants and can be taken in pill form. They are also found naturally in foods such as nuts, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Studies show that phytosterol supplements can lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by up to 14% in people taking 2,000 to 3,000 milligrams (mg) a day. When choosing a product, look for a quality seal (see ""Worried about supplement safety? Here's what you should consider""), and also look for a product that contains phytosterol esters.
        Red yeast rice. Red yeast rice supplements are made from a type of yeast that is grown on white rice. Red yeast rice has long been used in Chinese medicine. But a recent study comparing red yeast rice to a low dose statin found the statin was much more effective at lowering LDL cholesterol levels. If you still decide to use it, look for a high-quality product, because red yeast rice can contain a dangerous contaminant, citrinin, which is a toxin produced by fungus that can cause food poisoning, kidney damage, and immune system problems.
        
          
            
              
                Worried about supplement safety? Here's what you should consider
                While some supplements are potentially helpful (or at least harmless), a lack of regulatory oversight of these products means that others might be ineffective or dangerous, or might contain hazardous contaminants. Identifying the safe choices requires a little detective work. Before taking a supplement, always talk to your doctor to make sure that it's safe for any medical conditions you may have and that it won't interact with any medications you are taking.
                Although supplement makers must follow FDA rules for good manufacturing practices, the agency does not require testing the estimated 9,000 products on the market to make sure they do contain the ingredients they claim, and don't contain contaminants, such as dangerous bacteria, arsenic, cadmium, or lead. This means there is no guarantee that any particular product is effective or safe. To add a degree of protection, look for products that have voluntarily gone through quality testing, which is certified by a seal on the packaging. Some good ones to look for are those from U.S. Pharmacopeia, ConsumerLab.com, and NSF International.
              
            
          
        
        High blood pressure
        Magnesium citrate or glycinate. Some people are deficient in the mineral magnesium. But blood tests aren't good at detecting total magnesium levels inside the body, because much of your body's magnesium is stored within cells. Many people find the deficiency only after a nutritionist analyzes their diet. In those individuals, supplements can boost magnesium levels and help reduce high blood pressure when taken along with traditional blood pressure treatments. It typically takes up to six weeks for the supplements to show an effect. However, not everyone should take magnesium, particularly those with kidney disease, so be certain to consult with your doctor before taking it.
        Lycopene. An antioxidant supplement that may also help reduce high blood pressure is lycopene, which gives vegetables like tomatoes their red hue. While tomato-based products, including canned sauces, contain lycopene, those foods often have a lot of sodium. So, it's better in many instances to opt for a supplement. Look for one that also contains tomato extract for an added benefit. Typically, people need to take 15 to 25 mg of lycopene daily to see a reduction in blood pressure.
        Anxiety
        Chamomile extract. This extract, which comes from a flower, has long been used as a therapy for anxiety. Anxiety often goes hand in hand with sleeplessness, so it's no surprise that chamomile is also often recommended as a sleep aid. Many people drink chamomile tea, but taking a supplement may be more convenient (and require fewer late-night trips to the bathroom if taken before bed).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/prostate-cancer-how-does-waiting-on-treatment-affect-survival-202304282929,How does waiting on prostate cancer treatment affect survival?,"Prostate cancer progresses slowly, but for how long is it possible to put off treatment? Most newly diagnosed men have low-risk or favorable types of intermediate-risk prostate cancer that doctors can watch and treat only if the disease is found to be at higher risk of progression. This approach, called active surveillance, allows men to delay — or in some cases, outlive — the need for aggressive treatment, which has challenging side effects.
        In 1999, British researchers launched a clinical trial comparing outcomes among 1,643 men who were either treated immediately for their cancer or followed on active surveillance (then called active monitoring). The men's average age at enrollment was 62, and they all had low- to intermediate risk tumors with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels ranging from 3.0 to 18.9 nanograms per milliliter.
        Long-term results from the study, which were published in March, show that prostate cancer death rates were low regardless of the therapeutic strategy. ""This hugely important study shows quite clearly that there is no urgency to treat men with low- and even favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer,"" says Dr. Anthony Zietman, the Jenot W. and William U. Shipley Professor of Radiation Oncology at Harvard Medical School, anda radiation oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who was involved in the research and is a member of the Harvard Medical School Annual Report on Prostate Diseases editorial board. ""They give up nothing in terms of 15-year survival.""
        What the results showed
        During the study, called the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial, researchers randomized 545 men to active monitoring, 533 men to surgical removal of the prostate, and 545 men to radiation.
        After a median follow-up of 15 years, 356 men had died from any cause, including 45 men who died from prostate cancer specifically: 17 from the active monitoring group, 12 from the surgery group, and 16 from the radiation group. Men in the active surveillance group did have higher rates of cancer progression than the treated men did. More of them were eventually treated with drugs that suppress testosterone, a hormone that fuels prostate cancer growth.
        In all, 51 men from the active surveillance group developed metastatic prostate cancer, which is roughly twice the number of those treated with surgery or radiation. But 133 men in the active surveillance group also avoided any treatment and were still alive when the follow-up concluded.
        Experts weigh in
        In a press release, the study's lead author, Dr. Freddie Hamdy of the University of Oxford, claims that while cancer progression and the need for hormonal therapy were more limited in the treatment groups, ""those reductions did not translate into differences in mortality."" The findings suggest that for some men, aggressive therapy ""results in more harm than good,"" Dr. Hamdy says.
        Dr. Zietman agrees, adding that active surveillance protocols today are even safer than those used when ProtecT was initiated. Unlike in the past, for instance, active surveillance protocols now make more use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that detect cancer progression in the prostate with high resolution.
        Dr. Boris Gershman, a surgeon who specializes in urology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and is also an Annual Report on Prostate Diseases editorial board member, cautions that the twofold higher risk of developing metastasis among men on active surveillance may eventually translate into a mortality difference at 20-plus years.
        ""It's important to not extend the data beyond their meaning,"" says Dr. Gershman, who was not involved in the study. ""These results should not be used to infer that all prostate cancer should not be treated, or that there is no benefit to treatment for men with more aggressive disease."" Still, ProtecT is a landmark study in urology, Dr. Gershman says, that ""serves to reinforce active surveillance as the preferred management strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer and some men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.""
        Dr. Marc B. Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the Annual Report, points out that nearly all the enrolled subjects provided follow-up data for the study's duration, which is highly unusual for large clinical trials with long follow-up. The authors had initially predicted that patients from the active monitoring group who developed metastases at 10 years would have shortened survival at 15 years, ""but this was not the case,"" Dr. Garnick says. ""As with many earlier PSA screening studies, the impact of local therapy on long-term survival for this class of prostate cancer — whether it be radiation or surgery — was again brought into question,"" he says.",Charlie Schmidt,"April 28, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-running-cause-arthritis-202304262930,Does running cause arthritis?,"When I took up running in college, a friend of mine scoffed at the idea. He hated running and was convinced runners were ""wearing out"" their joints. He liked to say he was saving his knees for his old age.
        So, was he onto something? Does running really ruin your joints, as many people believe?
        Runners can get arthritis, but is running the cause?
        You may think the answer is obvious. Surely, years of running (pounding pavements, or even softer surfaces) could wear out your joints, much like tires wear out after you put enough miles on them. And osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, usually affects older adults. In fact, it's often described as age-related and degenerative. That sounds like a wear-and-tear sort of situation, right?
        Maybe not. Sure, it's easy to blame running when a person who runs regularly develops arthritis. But that blame may be misguided. The questions to ask are:
        
          Does running damage the joints and lead to arthritis?
          Does arthritis develop first and become more noticeable while running?
          Is the connection more complicated? Perhaps there's no connection between running and arthritis for most people. But maybe those destined to develop arthritis (due to their genes, for example) get it sooner if they take up running.
        
        Extensive research over the last several decades has investigated these questions. While the answers are still not entirely clear, we're moving closer.
        What is the relationship between running and arthritis?
        Mounting evidence suggests that that running does not cause osteoarthritis, or any other joint disease.
        
          A study published in 2017 found that recreational runners had lower rates of hip and knee osteoarthritis (3.5%) compared with competitive runners (13.3%) and nonrunners (10.2%).
          According to a 2018 study, the rate of hip or knee arthritis among 675 marathon runners was half the rate expected within the US population.
          A 2022 analysis of 24 studies found no evidence of significant harm to the cartilage lining the knee joints on MRIs taken just after running.
        
        These are just a few of the published medical studies on the subject. Overall, research suggests that running is an unlikely cause of arthritis — and might even be protective.
        Why is it hard to study running and arthritis?
        
          Osteoarthritis takes many years to develop. Convincing research would require a long time, perhaps a decade or more.
          It's impossible to perform an ideal study. The most powerful type of research study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Participants in these studies are assigned to a treatment group (perhaps taking a new drug) or a control group (often taking a placebo). Double-blind means neither researchers nor participants know which people are in the treatment group and which people are getting a placebo. When the treatment being studied is running, there's no way to conduct this kind of trial.
          Beware the confounders. A confounder is a factor or variable you can't account for in a study. There may be important differences between people who run and those who don't that have nothing to do with running. For example, runners may follow a healthier diet, maintain a healthier weight, or smoke less than nonrunners. They may differ with respect to how their joints are aligned, the strength of their ligaments, or genes that direct development of the musculoskeletal system. These factors could affect the risk of arthritis and make study results hard to interpret clearly. In fact, they may explain why some studies find that running is protective.
          The effect of running may vary between people. For example, it's possible, though not proven, that people with obesity who run regularly are at increased risk of arthritis due to the stress of excess weight on the joints.
        
        The bottom line
        Trends in recent research suggest that running does not wear out your joints. That should be reassuring for those of us who enjoy running.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/quick-start-guide-to-an-antiinflammation-diet,Quick-start guide to an anti‑inflammation diet,"There are no complicated rules to follow. Just be mindful of general dos and don'ts.
        
        
          
        
        Chronic inflammation — a state of persistent activation of the immune system — is an important part of many diseases, and diet is a big contributor to inflammation. It would make sense, then, to follow what's becoming known as the ""anti-inflammation diet."" Just one problem: ""There isn't 'one' diet, although many people love to throw that term around. The diet in general is almost as much about what you don't eat as what you do eat,"" says Eric Rimm, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        For a quick start, let's boil it down to some dos and don'ts.
        Don't eat these
        Stay away from ""ultra-processed"" foods, which include just about anything that comes in a package — like microwaveable dinners, hot dogs, chicken nuggets, dehydrated soups, baked goods, sugary cereals, processed meats, biscuits, and sauces.
        These foods have little nutritional value. Worse, they're high in salt, added sugars (which can spike your blood sugar), and saturated fat (which can increase your ""bad"" LDL cholesterol). All of these ingredients are associated with promoting inflammation in the body. ""The biggest offender is anything with added sweeteners, whether that means cane sugar or any compounds used to add sweetness,"" Rimm says.
        A report published in December 2019 in Nature Medicine notes that sugars, grains, and extra salt in ultra-processed foods can change the bacteria in your gut, damage the gut's lining, and switch on inflammatory genes in cells. Other studies have linked ultra-processed foods to shorter life spans, cancer, heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes.
        Inflammation-promoting foods include white breads, cereals, white pasta, and other products made with refined flours, as well as white rice. ""White flour leads directly to a pro-inflammatory state,"" Rimm says.
        Other offenders include soda, juices, cookies and other baked goods, butter, cheese, ice cream, coconut products, candy, salad dressings, jarred tomato sauces, and processed and cured meats.
        Do eat these
        To fight inflammation, go for whole, unprocessed foods with no added sugar: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (beans, lentils), fish, poultry, nuts, seeds, a little bit of low-fat dairy, and olive oil. ""To these, many people add herbs and spices like cinnamon, ginger, and turmeric. There are a few studies that suggest modest benefits,"" Rimm says.
        How do they help? ""It's believed that antioxidants in brightly colored fruits and vegetables [cooked tomatoes, carrots, squash, and broccoli] may lessen the effect of free radicals, which damage cells,"" says Liz Moore, a registered dietitian at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Other food components that may help fight inflammation include
        
          fiber found in fruits, vegetables, and especially legumes and whole grains such as barley, oats, and bran
          omega-3 fatty acids found in fish (such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna), vegetable oils (flaxseed and canola), walnuts, flaxseeds, and leafy green vegetables (spinach and kale)
          polyphenols (plant chemicals) found in berries, dark chocolate, tea, apples, citrus, onions, soybeans, and coffee
          unsaturated fats found in almonds, pecans, walnuts, flaxseeds, pumpkin and sesame seeds, and plant oils (olive, peanut, canola).
        
        The evidence that trying to minimize inflammation through dietary changes reduces the risk of diseases ""is strongest for arthritis, gastrointestinal and heart health, and possibly auto­immune diseases,"" Moore says.
        Making the shift
        Don't try to suddenly switch to a new eating style. ""Start by slowly making changes so that these become more of a lifestyle shift rather than 'going on a diet,'"" Moore says. ""Try to eat fewer foods that come from packages and more that come from the ground.""
        Apply that approach to each meal. For breakfast, you might have a fruit smoothie or oatmeal with a few berries; for lunch, a salad of dark leafy greens with colorful vegetables topped with beans, nuts, and seeds; for dinner, a lean protein and more colorful vegetables, with fruit for dessert. The more color and variety you add to a meal, the more natural inflammation-fighting compounds you'll consume.
        If you're more comfortable following a particular diet plan, consider a Mediterranean diet or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet; they follow lots of the dos and don'ts we've outlined.

        If your cholesterol level has crept up over the years, you may wonder whether changing your diet can help. Ideally, your total cholesterol value should be 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or lower. But it's the harmful LDL cholesterol value that experts worry about the most. Excess LDL builds up on artery walls and triggers a release of inflammatory substances that boost heart attack risk.
        ""To prevent heart disease, your LDL should be 100 mg/dL or lower,"" says Dr. Jorge Plutzky, director of preventive cardiology at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. But many Americans have LDL values that are less than optimal (100 to 129 mg/dL) or borderline high (130 to 159 mg/dL).
        If you fall into either of those categories, you may be able to nudge down your LDL to a healthier level by changing what you eat, particularly if your current diet could use some improvement. However, most people with higher LDL values likely will also need to take a cholesterol-lowering drug, such as a statin, says Dr. Plutzky.
        Dietary directives
        Avoiding foods that are high in cholesterol isn't the best way to lower your LDL. Your overall diet — especially the types of fats and carbohydrates you eat — has the most impact on your blood cholesterol values. ""As the American Heart Association has noted, you'll get the biggest bang for your buck by lowering saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fat,"" says registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        That means avoiding meat, cheese, and other high-fat dairy products such as butter, half-and-half, and ice cream. Equally important is replacing those calories with healthy, unsaturated fats (such as those found in vegetable oils, avocados, and fatty fish) rather than refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta, and white rice. Unlike healthy fats, these starchy foods aren't very filling, and they can trigger overeating and weight gain.
        The other big problem with refined carbs? They're woefully low in fiber, which helps flush cholesterol out of the body (see ""The fiber factor"").
        
          
            
              
                The fiber factor
                Your body can't break down fiber, so it passes through your body undigested. It comes in two varieties: insoluble and soluble. Fiber‑containing foods usually feature a mix of the two.
                Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water. While it doesn't directly lower LDL, this form of fiber fills you up, crowding other cholesterol-raising foods out of your diet and helping to promote weight loss.
                Soluble fiber dissolves in water, creating a gel. This gel traps some of the cholesterol in your body, so it's eliminated as waste instead of entering your arteries.
                Soluble fiber also binds to bile acids, which carry fats from your small intestine into the large intestine for excretion. This triggers your liver to create more bile acids — a process that requires cholesterol. If the liver doesn't have enough cholesterol, it draws more from the bloodstream, which in turn lowers your circulating LDL.
                Finally, certain soluble fibers (called oligosaccharides) are fermented into short-chain fatty acids in the gut. These fatty acids may also inhibit cholesterol production.
              
            
          
        
        The ""best"" foods
        The following 11 foods are good sources of fiber or unsaturated fat (or both). But they're not in any particular order and are simply suggestions. Most whole grains, vegetables, and fruits are good sources of fiber. And most nuts and seeds (and the oils made from them) provide monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats.
        1. Oatmeal. This whole grain is one of the best sources of soluble fiber, along with barley (see ""Grain of the month,"" at right). Start your day with a bowl of steel-cut or old-fashioned rolled oats, topped with fresh or dried fruit for a little extra fiber.
        2. White beans. Also called navy beans, this variety ranks highest in fiber content. Try different types of beans as well, such as black beans, garbanzos, or kidney beans, which you can add to salads, soups, or chili. But avoid prepared baked beans, which are canned in sauce that's loaded with added sugar.
        3. Avocado. The creamy, green flesh of an avocado is not only rich in monounsaturated fat, it also contains both soluble and insoluble fiber. Enjoy this fruit sliced in salad, pureed into dip, or mashed and spread on a slice of whole-grain toast.
        4. Eggplant. Although not everyone's favorite, these deep purple vegetables are one of the richest sources of soluble fiber. One idea: oven-roast or grill whole eggplants until soft and use the flesh in a Middle Eastern dip called baba ghanoush.
        5. Carrots. Raw baby carrots are a tasty and convenient snack — and they also give you a decent dose of insoluble fiber.
        6. Almonds. Among nuts, almonds are highest in fiber, although other popular varieties such as pistachios and pecans are close behind. Walnuts have the added advantage of being a good source of polyunsaturated, plant-based omega-3 fatty acids.
        7. Kiwi fruit. Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to peel these fuzzy, brown fruits. But to avoid the skin, slice one in half and scoop out the inside with a spoon for an easy, fiber-rich, sweet snack.
        8. Berries. Because these fruits are packed with tiny seeds, their fiber content is higher than most other fruits. Raspberries and blackberries provide the most, but strawberries and blueberries are also good sources.
        9. Cauliflower. This cruciferous veggie not only provides fiber, it can also serve as a substitute for white rice. Just shred or whirl in a food processor until it resembles rice, then sauté with a little olive oil until tender.
        10. Soy. Eating soybeans and foods made from them, such as soy milk, tofu, and tempeh, was once touted as a powerful way to lower cholesterol. More recent analyses showed the effect is modest, at best. Still, protein-rich, soy-based foods are a far healthier choice than a hamburger or other red meat.
        11. Salmon. Likewise, eating cold-water fish such as salmon twice a week can lower LDL by replacing meat and delivering healthy omega-3 fats. Other good fish options include chunk light canned tuna and tinned sardines.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-heart-healthy-diet-doesnt-need-to-be-low-in-fat,A heart-healthy diet doesn't need to be low in fat,"But the source of the fats you choose — and the rest of what you typically eat — make a big difference.
        
        
          
        
        For the last half of the 20th century, most major health organizations, including the American Heart Association, recommended a low-fat diet. 
        Yes, they did, but the message has changed dramatically. Now, the American Heart Association, the federal dietary guidelines, and other nutrition authorities have shifted away from advising people to limit the total amount of fat in their diets. ""Instead, the focus is on an overall healthy dietary pattern. That means an eating style that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans, along with only modest or small amounts of meat, dairy, eggs, and sweets,"" says Dr. Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        The reality is that eating more whole or minimally processed, plant-based foods will naturally lower your intake of fat, especially saturated fat. Found mainly in meat and dairy products, saturated fat can boost levels of harmful LDL cholesterol, a key contributor to heart disease. But simply cutting back on all types of fat does not necessarily translate into a diet that lowers cardiovascular risk.
        Low-fat diet fails
        Starting in the 1980s, when food manufacturers and consumers cut the fat from their products and diets, they replaced it with refined carbohydrates. People filled up on bread, pasta, low-fat chips and cookies, and low-fat sweetened yogurt. Eating lots of these highly processed carbohydrates floods your bloodstream with sugar, triggering a release of insulin to clear the sugar from your blood. But that can push your blood sugar too low, leaving you hungry again after just a few hours, which encourages overeating and weight gain. What's more, a steady diet of these unhealthy carbs can eventually impair your body's ability to respond to insulin, which can lead to diabetes. Both obesity and diabetes are closely linked to a heightened risk of heart disease.
        But eating too many refined carbs wasn't the only problem. Avoiding unsaturated fats — those found in nuts, seeds, olives, avocados, and fish — isn't necessary. Not only do these foods make your meals more satisfying and tasty, unsaturated fat promotes cardiovascular health.
        What about ultra-low-fat diets?
        Some physicians advocate an ultra-low-fat diet, which includes just 10% of calories from fat. This diet excludes all animal-based products (such as meat, poultry, dairy, and fish), as well as refined carbohydrates (including white flour, white sugar, and even fruit juice). But it also shuns some healthier unsaturated fats, including added oils and high-fat, plant-based foods such as avocados and nuts. Small studies have shown that this eating pattern may actually reverse the buildup of cholesterol-clogged plaque in the arteries.
        At least some of that benefit may stem from the abundant fiber and other nutrients in the diet's copious amounts of vegetables, beans, and whole grains, all of which are fairly scarce in the typical American diet. The only problem with an ultra-low-fat vegan diet is that it's very challenging for most people to stick to over the long term. ""If you are among the 1% of people who can, may the Force be with you,"" says Dr. Rimm.
        For everyone else, a Mediterranean-style diet offers the best of both worlds — a plant-centric diet that's not overly restrictive (see ""Simple steps to a Mediterranean-style eating plan""). ""The Mediterranean diet doesn't require extreme eating habits that make it difficult to socialize with other people,"" he says. What's more, he adds, it tastes good and has the best evidence from long-term clinical studies for lowering a person's risk of heart disease.
        
          
            
              
                Simple steps to a Mediterranean-style eating plan
                To ease into this eating style, look over these suggestions from registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Choose one, try it for a week, then gradually add more changes over time, she advises.
                Switch from whatever fats you use now to extra‑virgin olive oil. Start by using olive oil when cooking, including in salad dressings. Try swapping olive oil for butter on crusty bread.
                Have salad every day. Choose crisp, dark greens and whatever vegetables are in season.
                Go nuts. Instead of a bag of chips or cookies, have a handful of raw nuts as a healthy snack.
                Add more whole grains to your meals. Experiment with bulgur, barley, farro, brown rice, and whole-grain pasta. Select dense, chewy, country-style bread without added sugar or butter.
                Add a variety of vegetables to your menus. Add an extra serving of vegetables to both lunch and dinner, aiming for three to four servings a day. Try a new vegetable every week.
                Eat at least three servings of legumes a week. Options include lentils, chickpeas, pinto beans, and black beans.
                Eat less meat. Choose lean poultry in moderate, 3- to 4-ounce portions. Save red meat for occasional consumption or use meat as a condiment, accompanied by lots of vegetables, as in stews, stir-fries, and soups. Eat more fish, aiming for two servings a week. Both canned and fresh fish are fine.
                Cut out sugary beverages. Replace soda and juices with water.
                Eat fewer high-fat, high-sugar desserts. Fresh fruit or poached fruit is best. Aim for three servings of fresh fruit a day. Save cakes and pastries for special occasions.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-foods-that-fight-high-cholesterol,5 foods that fight high cholesterol,"Your diet clearly plays a role in determining your cho­lesterol levels. In fact, changing what you eat can lower your cholesterol and improve the composition of the armada of fats floating through your bloodstream. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and ""good fats"" are all part of a heart-healthy diet. But some foods are particularly good at helping bring down cholesterol.
        How? Some cholesterol-lowering foods deliver a good dose of soluble fiber, which binds cholesterol and its precursors in the digestive system and drags them out of the body before they get into circulation.
        Others provide polyunsaturated fats, which directly lower LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol. And those with plant sterols and stanols keep the body from absorbing cholesterol. Here are five of those foods:
        
          Oats. An easy way to start lowering cholesterol is to choose oatmeal or an oat-based cold cereal like Cheerios for breakfast. It gives you one to two grams of soluble fiber. Add a banana or some strawberries for another half-gram.
          Beans. Beans are especially rich in soluble fiber. They also take a while for the body to digest, meaning you feel full for longer after a meal. That's one reason beans are a useful food for folks trying to lose weight.
          Nuts. Studies show that eating almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and other nuts is good for the heart. Eating two ounces of nuts a day can slightly lower LDL, on the order of 5%. Nuts also have additional nutrients that protect the heart in other ways.
          Foods fortified with sterols and stanols. Sterols and stanols extracted from plants interfere with the body's ability to absorb cholesterol from food. Companies are now adding them to a wide variety of foods. They're also available as supplements. Getting two grams of plant sterols or stanols a day can lower LDL cholesterol by about 10%.
          Fatty fish. Eating fish two or three times a week can lower LDL in two ways: by replacing meat, which has LDL-boosting saturated fats, and by delivering LDL-lowering omega-3 fats. Omega-3s reduce triglycerides in the bloodstream and protect the heart by helping prevent the onset of abnormal heart rhythms.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/ibs-a-low-fodmap-diet-may-help,IBS? A low-FODMAP diet may help,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that affects at least one out of 10 people in the United States each year. With symptoms like cramping, diarrhea, gas and bloating, it's no surprise that living with IBS can have a significant effect on a person's quality of life.
        Diet is one way people manage IBS symptoms. A common treatment approach is to avoid the foods that trigger symptoms.
        But if you have trouble identifying your trigger foods, you may benefit from adopting an elimination diet. One of the best ones for people with IBS is a low-FODMAP diet.
        FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. These are poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates. They are found in many foods and are associated with IBS problems, like diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and flatulence. The following foods contain FODMAPs:
        
          oligosaccharides, including fructans (in wheat, onions, garlic) and galactans (in beans, lentils, soybeans)
          disaccharides, including lactose (in milk and other dairy products)
          monosaccharides, including fructose (in apples, honey)
          polyols, including sorbitol and mannitol (in some fruits, vegetables, artificial sweeteners).
        
        The Low-FODMAP diet works in two phases. First, you eliminate most dietary FODMAP foods for two to four weeks. Then you replace them with low-FODMAP alternatives. You monitor your symptoms for changes and then reintroduce specific FODMAPs one by one over a six- to eight-week period, according to your tolerance. (Your doctor or nutritionist may advise you to keep a food diary and symptom chart to help identify problem foods as well as track amounts.) The goal is to find which foods trigger your IBS symptoms, so you can limit or eliminate them in your diet.
        Keep in mind that everyone reacts differently to FODMAPs, and some people with IBS can consume small amounts without having symptoms.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sinusitis,Sinusitis,"How to get relief without antibiotics
        More than 20 million Americans will have at least one bout of sinusitis this year. Most will be uncomfortable, and many will miss work or school. Nearly all will recover from their sinus infections, but an unfortunate few may develop complications. If you understand sinusitis, you can reduce your chances of developing the problem and if sinusitis strikes, you'll know how to speed your recovery and lower your risk of complications.
        Your sinuses
        Your sinuses are air-filled chambers located in the bones of your face; because they surround the nose, they are also known as the ""paranasal sinuses."" Each of us has four pairs of sinuses (see figure).
        Each of the sinuses is lined by a membrane that produces mucus. When you're healthy, the mucus is a thin, watery fluid that flows freely from your sinuses into the upper part of your nose. But when your sinuses become inflamed, the mucus gets thick and sticky, so it can't flow through the tiny openings, called ostia, that lead to the nose. Fluid builds up in the sinuses, causing pressure and pain, and just like that, you've got sinusitis.
        
          
            
              
                Your sinuses
                
                  
                
                Your four pairs of sinuses are air-filled chambers located in the bones around your nose. The frontal sinuses are behind the forehead; the maxillary sinuses are behind the cheek bones; the ethmoid sinuses are behind the bridge of the nose; and the sphenoid sinuses are deeper in the skull behind the nose.
              
            
          
        
        What causes sinusitis?
        Sinusitis is an infection most often caused by viruses or bacteria or both. Cold viruses and bacteria that get into our sinuses usually don't cause trouble unless sinus drainage is blocked. Blockage of the narrow sinus draining channels is the main reason we get sinusitis, and restoration of drainage is the key to treatment.
        What triggers sinusitis?
        The common cold is the leading culprit. The average adult gets two to three colds a year, and the average child gets six to 10. Colds are caused by viruses, not bacteria, and antibiotics are useless for treatment. But cold viruses produce swelling of the nasal tissues, which can sometimes block the sinuses. Colds also change the mucus, preventing it from doing its normal job of clearing viruses and bacteria from the sinuses.
        You may get some sinus pressure when you get a cold, but that doesn't mean you have sinusitis or that you need an antibiotic. Only about one cold in 100 leads to sinusitis, and you can make the odds work for you by doing what it takes to keep your sinuses draining (see below). You can also help your cause by blowing your nose gently without pinching it tightly; forceful blowing can force bacteria up into your sinuses.
        Many other things can block your sinuses and lead to infection. The list includes allergies, cigarette smoke and other irritating fumes, changes in barometric pressure during flying or scuba diving, nasal polyps, and a deviated nasal septum.
        Sinus infection symptoms
        Painful pressure is the main symptom of a sinus infection. Depending on which sinus is involved, the pain is in the forehead (frontal sinusitis), over the cheek or in the upper jaw and teeth (maxillary sinusitis), behind the eyes (ethmoid or sphenoid sinusitis), or at the top of the head (sphenoid sinusitis). Sinus pain usually increases when you bend forward.
        Nasal congestion and a thick, dark-colored nasal discharge are also common during a sinus infection. When the mucus drips into your throat from the back of your nose, you'll notice a foul taste, and you may get bad breath or a cough. You may temporarily lose your sense of smell or taste. Finally, you may feel feverish, achy, and tired.
        Sinusitis diagnosis
        In most cases, your doctor can diagnose sinusitis simply by asking about your symptoms. If pressing over your sinuses causes pain, sinusitis is likely. CT scans can be very helpful if your sinusitis is unusually severe or if your doctor suspects complications; plain x-rays are less useful. ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialists can also diagnose sinusitis by looking up your nose with a scope.
        Sinus infection treatment: Promoting drainage
        Many people with sinusitis will recover quickly and completely without taking antibiotics simply by promoting drainage. Here's what you should do:
        
          Drink lots of water. Good hydration helps keep the mucus thin and loose.
          Inhale steam. Linger in a hot shower. Boil a kettle, pour the water into a pan, and bend over the pan with a towel over your head to inhale the steam. Even hot tea or chicken soup will help; the secret ingredient is the steam. One way or another, inhale steam three to four times a day.
          Sleep with your head elevated. If your pain is only on one side, sleep with the pain-free side of your face on the pillow.
          Use decongestants. Tablets containing pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine are very helpful but may sometimes raise your blood pressure, speed your pulse, or make you jittery and keep you up at night. Nasal sprays containing phenylephrine or oxymetazoline don't have these side effects, but if you use them too often or for too long, your nose can become irritated or dependent on them.
          Ask your doctor about prescription nasal sprays containing steroids, particularly if you have allergies or if your sinusitis is stubborn.
          Use a saline (salt water) nasal spray to loosen mucus and rinse your sinuses.
          Use antihistamines wisely. They're great for allergies and when your nose waters from a cold, but they make mucus thick and hard to drain, the last thing you want in sinusitis.
          A warm compress on your face may soothe sinus pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin or acetaminophen will help reduce pain and fever.
        
        Antibiotics for a severe sinus infection
        You may be surprised that antibiotics are not listed as the first step in treatment. While many patients with sinusitis expect antibiotics, they aren't usually needed if good drainage is achieved.
        Antibiotics have potential disadvantages. They can trigger allergic reactions or cause side effects. Widespread use of antibiotics has encouraged the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (""superbugs""). And many of these drugs are expensive.
        Still, if your sinusitis does not improve with two to four days of drainage therapy, or if it's very severe to begin with, it probably needs an antibiotic to help get rid of the trapped bacteria. Antibiotic therapy for just three to seven days is generally as effective as traditional 10- to 14-day treatment for uncomplicated acute sinusitis.
        Many bacteria can cause acute sinusitis; the most common include some with fearsome names like Pneumococcus, Streptococcus, Hemophilus, and Moraxella. Unless you have a sinus puncture (an invasive test that's rarely performed by ENT specialists unless unusual organisms or complications are suspected), there's really no way to know which bacteria are causing your sinusitis. Cultures of your mucus or your nose,  even if they are obtained through a nasal speculum, are not helpful because they are always contaminated by the many bacteria that live in every nose.
        With these considerations in mind, many infectious disease specialists recommend initial sinusitis treatment with one of the old standbys, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (a combination that includes a sulfa drug), amoxicillin (a type of penicillin), or doxycycline (a type of tetracycline). If these fail """" or if the patient is unusually ill to begin with """" doctors may turn to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or a quinolone (such as levofloxacin).
        Complications
        The sinuses are surrounded by critical structures, including the brain, the eyes, and the skull. On rare occasions, sinus infections can spread to one of these areas. Notify your doctor promptly if your sinusitis gets worse with one or more of these warning symptoms:
        
          high fever
          severe headache
          mental confusion or stiff neck
          swelling of the cheek, forehead, or roof of the mouth
          a swollen, red, painful eye
          impaired vision
          difficulty breathing, swallowing, or speaking.
        
        Fortunately, none of these problems is likely. Still, they serve to remind us that sinusitis is not just the sniffles. Patients with weakened immune systems always require careful medical evaluation and treatment for sinusitis.
        Chronic sinusitis
        Sinusitis that lasts more than three weeks or recurs more than three times a year is called chronic sinusitis. The most common cause of chronic sinusitis is inadequately treated acute sinusitis, and since the diagnosis and treatment of acute sinusitis have improved so much, chronic sinusitis is less common than it used to be.
        Most patients with chronic sinusitis will benefit from an ENT evaluation, which usually includes looking inside both nostrils with a scope. The doctor may also order a CT scan. That's because anatomic problems such as nasal polyps or a deviated septum are often responsible. Since allergies are also present in many cases, you may want to pursue formal allergy testing.
        Persistent nasal discharge and congestion are the main symptoms of chronic sinusitis. Unless flares of acute sinusitis develop, headache and fever are minimal.
        In addition to the bacteria that cause acute sinusitis, Staphylococcus, anaerobic bacteria, and fungi may lead to chronic sinusitis. Antibiotics can be helpful, especially for flares, but they are less important than nasal irrigation, decongestants, and prescription nasal spray. If allergies are present, antihistamines can help. In severe cases, oral steroids may be necessary. As with acute sinusitis, the key to successful treatment is drainage. In the case of chronic sinusitis, though, surgery may be needed. Your ENT doctor may remove nasal polyps, straighten a deviated septum, or use endoscopic surgery to open a good drainage channel between the sinus and your nose.
        Living with your sinuses
        It's nice to know that CT scans, endoscopy, and surgery are available to evaluate and treat complicated acute sinusitis and stubborn chronic sinusitis. Fortunately, garden-variety acute sinusitis will respond to much simpler treatments.
        To protect your sinuses, stay well-hydrated. Avoid tobacco smoke and irritating fumes. If you have allergies, try to avoid the things that trigger symptoms. Do your best to prevent catching a cold by washing your hands properly and keeping your distance from cold sufferers. When you catch a cold, blow your nose properly to keep bacteria from flooding into your sinuses. Treat symptoms of sinusitis promptly with steam inhalation, decongestants, and nasal irrigation. If you don't recover as expected, or if you have serious sinusitis or warning symptoms, see your doctor for antibiotics and, possibly, nasal steroids.",Unknown,"April 12, 2023"

What does each type of cough indicate, and how do doctors discern the difference? It depends on the type and duration of the cough.",Unknown,"April 12, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/no-coughing-matter,No coughing matter,"Cough experts say many over-the-counter cough medications probably aren't worth the money.
        The cough is one of our basic defense mechanisms. This reflex and that unceremonious expulsion of air, mucus, and microbes spares us all sorts of infectious and inflammatory pulmonary misadventures.
        But who hasn't had too much of a good thing? When the hacking becomes relentless, it can keep us up, wear us out, and lay us low.
        Most people first seek relief from one of the countless number of over-the-counter cough medicines. But many of these over-the-counter cough medications have little evidence of effectiveness.
        A multitude of cough causes
        While coughing exists to protect us from infections of the respiratory tract, it is commonly found with other conditions, too. We associate asthma with wheezing and difficulty breathing, but for many, its main symptom is a cough. Heartburn is the cardinal symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but the stomach acid irritating the esophagus and the back of the throat can also produce a nasty cough.
        Coughing is also a side effect of several drugs, most notably ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril and enalapril, which are mainstays in the treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure. The ACE inhibitor cough sometimes begins months after you start taking the drug. Fortunately, there are good alternatives for those who have this problem.
        Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bacterial sinusitis, lung cancer — all may announce their presence with a cough. And, of course, there's the infamous smoker's hack.
        But among nonsmokers, the most common cause of a cough is that humdrum malady, the common cold. At least 200 viruses are capable of causing a cold, which is one reason why it's so common. When the viruses take up residence in the moist, dark recesses of the nose and upper respiratory tract, the tissue lining those cavities doesn't take kindly to the intrusion and responds by producing mucus above and beyond the normal output of 1–2 quarts a day. One result is postnasal drip, a trickle of mucus and other secretions that stimulates nerves at the back of the throat and triggers coughing. This ticklish situation becomes even more so because some infections seem to make upper airways more sensitive than normal.
        Several other conditions can also cause postnasal drip and its resulting cough, including sinusitis, exposure to air pollution, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and other allergies that cause nasal congestion.
        
          
            
              
                The trickle-down effect
                
                  
                
                Postnasal drip triggers a cough because mucus and other secretions from nasal membranes flow down the back of the throat and irritate the upper airways.
              
            
          
        
        Choices, choices, choices of cough medications
        OTC cough and cold medicines come in a bewildering number of varieties. We say cough and cold remedies because while there are some products marketed purely as cough remedies — often called tussins — many have additional ingredients that are supposed to control cold symptoms, too.
        It may be a little easier to make a choice if you realize that most of these products contain the same few active ingredients, in a limited number of strengths and combinations. Here's a rundown of the five main types of ingredients:
        Expectorants. These cough medications work chiefly by affecting the production, consistency, and clearance of mucus in various ways. Guaifenesin (pronounced gwy-FEN-e-sin), which thins mucus, is the most common OTC expectorant. The cough guidelines cite studies showing that guaifenesin is effective, but also point to others showing that it's not. Want a free, reliable way of loosening mucus? Just try drinking plenty of water the next time you have a cold.
        Suppressants. These cough medications work by suppressing the cough reflex in the brain. Dextromethorphan (pronounced dex-tro-meth-OR-fan) is one of the most common ingredients in over-the-counter cough medicine products.
        Decongestants. Oral pseudoephedrine (pronounced sue-doe-e-FED-rin), the active ingredient in Sudafed, works by constricting blood vessels, which shrinks swollen membranes and allows more air to pass through nasal passages. As a result, tissues dry out so there is less postnasal drip. It can be wonderfully effective in the short run, but they also present problems. .
        Pseudoephedrine is a key ingredient in the illicit production of the addictive stimulant methamphetamine. You don't need a prescription, but you do need to show ID to purchase it. Pseudoephedrine can potentially make you jittery, interfere with sleep and raise your blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure or heart disease, check with your doctor before using it.
        Nasal decongestants have other active ingredients that can help decrease post nasal drip, a common cause of coughing. However, they should only be used for a few days to avoid rebound nasal congestion.
        Antihistamines. How these work depends on the source of the problem. If hay fever or allergies are the cause of the congestion and cough, antihistamines are true to their name. They block histamine, a natural chemical that makes blood vessels leaky and causes the allergy sufferer's runny nose and watery eyes. But histamine isn't involved in symptoms of the common cold. The older antihistamines like brompheniramine and chlorpheniramine have another effect: They inhibit the activity of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, decreasing the secretion of mucus and widening airways.
        Still, exactly how the older drugs suppress a cough is unclear. Some researchers say they may work by blocking histamine in the central nervous system. In the brain, histamine is a neurotransmitter, one of the many chemicals that enable cell-to-cell communication. Products billed as ""multi-symptom"" solutions often include these older drugs.
        Analgesics or pain relievers. Many OTC cold medications contain acetaminophen. Doses vary, but are all relatively small (less than 400 mg). The danger is that some people may not realize that cold and cough concoctions contain acetaminophen. If they also take higher doses of acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) for pain, it might cause severe liver injury and possibly acute liver failure.
        So what cough medication should you take?
        For your everyday cough from a common cold, a good choice is cough medication that contains an older antihistamine and a decongestant. Older antihistamines include brompheniramine, diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine.
        The studies that have guided these recommendations can't possibly reflect every individual experience. If you think a product is working fine, it probably won't hurt you, although you may be paying for a placebo effect rather than a proven remedy.
        Always keep in mind the other, less common causes of a bad cough, especially GERD and asthma. If you have a cough that you just can't shake, see your doctor and explore the possibility of other sources of your misery.
        
          
            
              
                Get immunized against whooping cough
                Instead of treating your next serious cough, you might prevent it by getting vaccinated against pertussis, or as it's commonly known, whooping cough.
                Health officials estimate that over half a million American adults get whooping cough every year — far more than the reported number, which hovers around 10,000. One reason for the gap is that many people don't realize they have the disease because pertussis produces its signature ""whoop"" of sudden inhalation only in a minority of cases. Often the symptoms are easy to mistake for just another cold, although it may go on to cause a distressing, lingering cough. Pertussis is a bacterial disease, so it's treatable with antibiotics, but only during the first few weeks of an infection.
                Most children are vaccinated against pertussis, but the immunity wears off. Childhood immunization involves five shots over several years, with diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines combined. Fortunately, adults need vaccination for these three diseases only once every 10 years.
                The FDA approved diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis combinations for adults include Boostrix and Adacel. They resemble the pediatric formulations but contain less pertussis antigen (antigens trigger the immune response that protects you against the disease).",Unknown,"April 11, 2023"

        People with troublesome nasal polyps and chronic sinusitis who are not responding to nasal corticosteroids have another option for relief. Dupilumab (Dupixent) is FDA approved to treat resistant nasal polyps and sinusitis. Nasal polyps, which are benign growths in the nasal cavities, affect about 20% of people with chronic sinusitis. Polyps can increase drainage and congestion, cause pain, and diminish smell.
        Previously, the only ways to try to shrink polyps have been the long-term use of corticosteroid nasal sprays, a short-term course of oral steroids, sinus irrigation, antibiotics, or surgery to remove them. But those methods don't work for everyone, and surgery doesn't keep polyps from recurring.
        Dupilumab is an injectable drug that blocks the immune system from overreacting and causing inflammation. ""The polyps just seem to melt away. It's especially helpful for patients whose polyps come back after surgery, who can't have surgery for other reasons, or who have bad asthma,"" says Dr. Alice Maxfield, an ear, nose, and throat specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dupilumab does have potential side effects, including serious allergic reactions or eye problems (such as conjunctivitis). The drug is very expensive. However, Medicare covers most costs.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-do-i-smell-certain-odors-that-arent-real,Why do I smell certain odors that aren’t real?,"On call
        
          
            
          
        
        
          Q.
          What can cause someone to smell something bad, like heavy cigarette smoke or old garbage, when neither is nearby? Could it be caused by a vitamin deficiency? And why does it make some foods taste funny when it happens?
        
        A. Having an altered sense of smell is actually quite common. A survey of American adults found that two-thirds had experienced a problem with smell sometime during their lives. Smell disorders are often classified as one of the following:
        
          anosmia: complete loss of the ability to detect odors
          hyposmia: decreased sense of smell with some ability to detect odors
          dysosmia: distorted sense of smell.
        
        Hyposmia commonly happens as we age. But what you describe falls under the category of dysosmia. With dysosmia, the distorted smell may be dramatically different from what you expect (known as parosmia). Or it could be an odor that isn’t actually present (known as phantosmia). Your symptoms suggest you have periods of phantosmia: your brain registers an odor when none is present in the environment. But at other times, it could be parosmia, meaning you are more sensitive to a smell that doesn’t bother other people. When this occurs, the odor is usually described as unpleasant.
        As to what might cause dysosmia, there are several possibilities. While vitamin or mineral deficiencies can cause an altered sense of smell, this would be unlikely unless you follow a restricted diet or have an intestinal problem that impairs the absorption of nutrients. Here are some other causes of altered smell:
        
          COVID-19 or a cold or sinus infection
          hay fever (allergic rhinitis)
          nasal polyps
          a medication, such as the cholesterol-lowering drug atorvastatin (Lipitor), the blood pressure drug amlodipine (Norvasc), or the antibiotic erythromycin (Erythrocin)
          a side effect of general anesthesia.
        
        Regarding food having a funny taste, our ability to fully enjoy food requires stimulation of many nerve endings in the mouth and nose. The strict definition of taste is the mouth’s ability to identify what is salty, sweet, sour, or bitter. There’s also a fifth, savory taste called umami (from the Japanese for delicious), which is triggered by the amino acid glutamate.
        But what we commonly refer to as taste is actually a food’s flavor. Flavor is determined more by the food’s aroma, which is a function of our sense of smell rather than pure taste. So it makes sense that your dysosmia also interferes with the flavor of certain foods.
        For most people who experience dysosmia, it’s a temporary alteration in sense of smell, often without an identifiable reason. However, if it becomes persistent, speak with your doctor. He or she will likely refer you to an ear, nose, and throat specialist.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-good-side-of-bacteria,The good side of bacteria,"Probiotics may help maintain a healthy and happy gut — but make sure you choose the right sources.
        
        There are many things in life that can be categorized as coming in both good and bad versions. The same applies to bacteria.
        Bad bacteria like salmonella and E. coli can make you sick. Good bacteria like the kind in probiotics play an important role in keeping us healthy.
        These good bacteria interact with the intestinal lining to protect the body from harmful invaders. They help the immune system function properly, which means better ability both to fight infections and to dampen chronic inflammation.
        Know your bacteria
        Some research suggests that certain probiotics help relieve symptoms of gut-related conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.
        ""Many people could probably benefit by increasing their intake of probiotics,"" says Dr. Allan Walker, a professor of nutrition at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""The problem is the unsubstantiated hype that probiotic supplements have far-reaching health potential, which can keep people from choosing the best sources.""
        There are hundreds of bacteria classified as probiotics, but most come from two main species: Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Within each of these are various strains.
        There are two ways to get probiotics: fermented foods and over-the-counter products. According to Dr. Walker, fermented foods are the better choices primarily because over-the-counter supplements and formulas aren’t subject to the necessary oversight. (See ""Take care with supplements."")
        
          
            
              
                Take care with supplements
                Probiotics are also found in over-the-counter probiotic supplements and formulas. Most use Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, or a combination. The bacteria are concentrated and then dried to use as powders or in capsules, tablets, lozenges, and even gums. The issue with these products is that they are sold as dietary supplements and therefore don’t require FDA approval. ""So you can never be sure that the label claims about health benefits or the type and number of bacteria per serving are accurate,"" says Dr. Allan Walker, a professor of nutrition at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He advises you to avoid them unless recommended by your doctor.
              
            
          
        
        Eat more fermented foods
        Foods contain probiotics after going through lactofermentation, a process in which bacteria feed on the food’s sugar and starch to create lactic acid, which helps preserve it.
        Another way to think of lactofermentation is that it transforms one type of food into another kind—for instance, cabbage into sauerkraut, cucumbers into pickles, soybeans into miso, and milk into yogurt.
        The exact amounts and specific strains of bacteria in fermented foods vary depending on how they are made. Besides probiotics, fermented foods may also contain other valuable nutrients like enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids.
        How much fermented food do you need to eat for optimal gut health? Unfortunately, there is no recommended daily allowance for probiotics, so it’s uncertain which fermented foods or what amount is ideal, according to Dr. Walker.
        ""The general recommendation is simply to add more fermented foods to your diet,"" he says.

        Many choices
        There are many fermented foods to choose from. Here are some common ones you can try.
        Kefir. The tart yogurt-like drink is often made with dairy milk, but also comes in nondairy alternatives, like coconut water, coconut milk, and rice milk. Kefir also comes in fruit and vegetable flavors.
        Kimchi. Kimchi is a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish. You can find jars of it at most grocery stores or Asian markets.
        Kombucha. This tangy fermented tea drink is found in many grocery and specialty food stores. Some brands have added sugar, so make sure the label lists no more than 5 grams per serving.
        Miso. The paste is a staple in Japanese cuisine, especially in soup. It’s made from soybeans fermented with brown rice and has a strong, salty flavor.
        Pickles. Choose brands brined in water and sea salt instead of vinegar. Vinegar stops good bacteria from growing.
        Sauerkraut. Select raw or nonpasteurized sauerkraut, which contains more bacteria strains. You can find them in specialty grocery stores.
        Sourdough bread. This kind of bread is baked with fermented flour. Not all store-bought bread labeled ""sourdough"" uses it, so shop at an artisan bakery or specialty grocery store.
        Tempeh. Tempeh is a cake made from fermented soybeans with a firmer texture than tofu. It often comes precooked and ready to eat.
        Yogurt. Some brands include a Live & Active Cultures (LAC) seal from the International Dairy Foods Association. This certifies that the product has been fermented. But not all yogurts have this, so look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label. Also, opt for plain, unflavored brands when possible, as they contain less sugar per serving than most flavored and fruit-based yogurts.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/feed-your-gut,Feed your gut,"Nourish the healthy bacteria in your digestive tract with a mix of probiotics and prebiotics.
        
        
          
        
        If you want a healthy gut, you have to feed it well. This nourishment should include both probiotics and prebiotics — two dietary components that are increasingly being recognized as essential to your intestinal and overall health, says Teresa Fung, adjunct professor in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        There’s been a lot of buzz recently about the need to eat probiotics — ­living microorganisms found in foods such as yogurt and fermented vegetables. Probiotics add to your gut microbiota, the collection of 100 trillion or so bacteria and other critters living in your gut. Having a healthy microbiota may help foster a healthy immune system and reduce damaging inflammation in the body. Eating probiotics regularly may also help to prevent the intestinal environment from being overrun by unhealthy bacteria, which have been linked to everything from mood disorders and obesity to diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases.
        But probiotics are much like pets, says Fung. It’s not enough to just get one; you also have to take care of it, she says. This means feeding the population of microorganisms with prebiotics — foods that will help all of these desirable gut bugs grow and thrive inside your digestive tract.
        Understanding your gut
        To understand how to keep your intestinal environment healthy, it’s important to understand how your microbiota evolves. Everyone has a unique mix of microorganisms living inside them. Some of these come from your mother, conferred during pregnancy, delivery, and, potentially, breastfeeding. Others are introduced by the foods you eat, and your environment.
        Probiotics found in fermented foods and drinks — such as yogurt, cheese, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut — can add desirable organisms to your gut. But not all varieties of these foods have probiotics; it depends on how they are processed. Sometimes foods that naturally contain probiotics are then cooked or heated, killing the microorganisms and any potential health benefits along with them, says Fung.
        Slipping an occasional food with probiotics into your diet won’t do much to help you improve your microbiota, says Fung.
        ""Eating probiotics needs to be a regular thing,"" she says. (Research hasn’t yet determined the ideal frequency.)
        Try adding them into one or more daily meals for the biggest benefit. Sip a yogurt smoothie for breakfast, or put a forkful or two of sauerkraut alongside your sandwich at lunch.
        The need for prebiotics
        Even if you eat a lot of foods that contain probiotics, it won’t do you much good if your intestinal environment doesn’t allow them to prosper, says Fung.
        Research has shown that a traditional Western diet — heavy on fat, sugar, and animal meat — creates a toxic environment for healthy microbes and can even change the proportion of different types of bacteria inside your body, she says. In short, your healthy gut microbes will suffer on a diet of hot dogs and French fries.
        What beneficial bacteria love, says Fung, is fiber. When fiber enters your digestive system, enzymes from the microbiota help to break it down, producing substances called short-chain fatty acids. Experts think that having more of these fatty acids changes the pH inside your colon, making it less hospitable to some damaging types of microorganisms.
        Some good prebiotic options are beans and whole grains.
        ""Whole grains can include everything from oats to wheat,"" says Fung.
        Vegetables and fruits also contain healthy fiber. Other good prebiotic sources include garlic, bananas, onions, asparagus, and seaweed.
        Over all, the goal should be to make sure your diet contains a good balance of probiotics and prebiotics. If you feed your gut well, it may repay you in better health.

In addition to managing stress, paying attention to what you eat can have a big impact on your quality of life.
        There is no single diet that works best for managing UC. In fact, no studies have shown that any specific diet improves symptoms or that any specific foods cause UC flare-ups. The best approach is to avoid or reduce the foods that aggravate your symptoms.
        You should eat a well-balanced, healthy diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, such as a Mediterranean style diet. Avoid preservatives and emulsifiers, such as carrageenan, carboxymethylcellulose, and polysorbate-80.
        Having a nutritionist design a specialized diet plan for you may be helpful. The nutritionist will first want to identify foods that may trigger flare-ups or make your symptoms worse.
        There is no strong evidence that following any particular specialized diet diet—such as low-carb, vegetarian, or paleo—has any effect on keeping UC in remission.
        If you have inflammatory bowel disease and also irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a low-FODMAP diet may be helpful. FODMAP stands for the short-chain carbohydrates known as fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. Some people who eat high-FODMAP foods have an increased risk of problems like diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and flatulence. FODMAPs include the following:
        
          disaccharides, such as lactose (in milk and other dairy products)
          monosaccharides, such as fructose (for example, in apples and honey)
          oligosaccharides, such as fructans (in wheat, onions, and garlic, for example) and galactans (commonly found in beans, lentils, and soybeans)
          polyols, such as sorbitol and mannitol (in some fruits, vegetables, and artificial sweeteners).
        
        A low-FODMAP diet can help reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea and improve stool consistency in people with IBS who also have well-controlled IBD. Consult with your doctor and a nutritionist about how FODMAP reduction may fit into your dietary plan.

        The Harvard-led study, published in the Jan. 15, 2023, issue of The American Journal of Cardiology, analyzed data from 459 adults who participated in the original DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) trial between 1994 and 1996, when they were ages 22 through 75. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three eating plans for eight weeks: a typical ""Western"" diet high in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol; a diet rich in fruits and vegetables; and the DASH diet, which emphasizes whole grains, lean protein, nuts, and low-fat dairy in addition to fruits and vegetables.
        Both the fruit-and-vegetable and DASH diets reduced participants' risk scores for heart problems by 10% over the eight-week period. But those benefits doubled among women and quadrupled among Black people who ate the DASH diet. Since high blood pressure is more strongly associated with heart failure and death in women, researchers said, the findings should help shape our lifestyle choices.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/ibs-in-the-crosshairs,IBS in the crosshairs,"Up to 45 million Americans have a condition that people affected may only reluctantly mention: irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. Despite its prevalence, IBS is still somewhat mysterious when it comes to who gets it — two-thirds of patients are women — and why.
        But scientists are steadily peeling this proverbial onion, with newer treatment approaches targeting pathways that appear to be involved in the cramping, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and/or constipation that disrupt patients' everyday lives.
        Marked by chronic belly pain and altered bowel habits, IBS is categorized into three types according to which symptoms dominate: diarrhea (IBS-D), constipation (IBS-C), or a combination. It's one of the most common gastrointestinal conditions, affecting up to 15% of Americans, according to the International Foundation for Gastrointestinal Disorders.
        IBS is what doctors call a functional bowel disorder, since it affects the way the digestive system works but isn't due to any apparent structural problem. But that label is problematic, Harvard experts say.
        ""To say nothing's wrong is just wrong, because clearly something is different,"" says Dr. Anthony Lembo, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""It's just that our standard clinical testing can't show it.""
        Compelling effects on daily life
        The causes of IBS remain frustratingly unclear, but symptoms are believed to stem from any of a wide range of factors. Among them:
        Changes in the gut microbiome. This array of microbes in the gut is influenced by what we eat and drink as well as by illness. ""About 10% of people who develop a gastrointestinal infection, whether viral, bacterial, or parasitic — even COVID — show a higher rate of IBS,"" Dr. Lembo says.
        Skewed intestinal muscle contractions. Normally rhythmic, these contractions push food through the digestive tract faster or slower than normal in IBS patients.
        Faulty nerve signals. Normal digestion relies on clear communication between the brain, gut, and nervous system. These signals are disrupted in IBS.
        Pelvic floor problems. This is especially true for women whose pelvic muscles don't relax normally, which can lead to chronic constipation.
        Early life stress. This can include traumatic events during childhood.
        Genetics. People with a family history of IBS are more likely to have it as well.
        At best, IBS is inconvenient, forcing people to shape their schedules around their bathroom needs. At worst, it can be incapacitating, causing extreme distress and controlling people's ability to work and travel.
        ""All the data show the suffering is pretty significant,"" Dr. Lembo says. ""It's a disorder we know can really debilitate people.""
        Tailoring treatments
        For the first time, IBS treatment guidelines, updated in June 2022 by the American Gastroenterological Association, steer doctors on how to personalize patients' treatment with a widening assortment of medications.
        Over-the-counter options — including fiber supplements, laxatives (in limited amounts), and anti-diarrheals — can help control symptoms. But recent years have brought an influx of IBS-specific drug options that don't just address symptoms, but instead target specific biochemical or cellular pathways to slow food movement through the bowel or push fluids into the intestine to soften stools and speed their passage. For IBS-D, these drugs include alosetron (Lotronex) and eluxadoline (Viberzi). For IBS-C, they include lubiprostone (Amitiza), linaclotide (Linzess), plecanatide (Trulance), and tenapanor (Ibsrela).
        The antibiotic rifaximin (Xifaxan) appears to benefit the gut microbiome, suppressing ""bad"" organisms that contribute to IBS symptoms, says Dr. Lawrence Friedman, assistant chief of medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital and chair of the Department of Medicine at Newton-Wellesley Hospital. ""It's one of the more exciting newer developments,"" he says.
        Doctors are also tapping older drugs for new purposes. Various antidepressants can alter nerve signal activity in the intestines or lessen pain in IBS, Dr. Lembo says.
        While a variety of medications can help relieve symptoms, effective IBS management depends on diet and life-style changes. For many people, avoiding trigger foods, eating more fiber, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising regularly, and getting sufficient sleep can help control mild symptoms. Symptoms may also worsen depending on the foods you eat. Wheat, dairy products, citrus fruits, beans, cabbage, and carbonated drinks are known culprits. Meanwhile, peppermint oil supplements, taken as coated tablets, can ease bloating and pain.
        ""Many people also figure out that lactose can be a trigger and if they drink a glass of milk or consume other dairy products, their symptoms worsen,"" Dr. Lembo says. ""But sometimes it's more subtle than that. Even drinking a glass of diet soda can cause gas and bloating.""
        For those in whom gas and bloating are severe, a low-FODMAP diet may help. FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols) are foods that increase gas production. They include beans, onions, celery, carrots, raisins, bananas, apricots, prunes, Brussels sprouts, wheat germ, pretzels, and bagels. Dr. Lembo suggests eliminating FODMAPs temporarily and then slowly adding each food back into your diet to pinpoint the worst offenders.
        Over all, Dr. Friedman says, ""the spectrum of treatments has expanded. We have more tools to work with and there's a higher likelihood of success, but there may still be an element of trial and error involved.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/prediabetes-a-window-of-opportunity,Prediabetes: A window of opportunity,"Diabetes gets a lot of attention these days, and for good reason: it can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack, kidney failure, amputation, blindness, and early death. But its precursor, aptly named prediabetes, doesn't get nearly as much airtime, despite affecting three times as many people.
        One in three American adults — an estimated 96 million people — has prediabetes, which is characterized by blood sugar levels that are higher than the normal range but don't quite reach diabetes status. But the vast majority of people don't know when they have it. And this is where the danger — and opportunity — lie, Harvard experts say.
         ""As with every chronic, prevalent disease, it's incredibly important to understand who's at particularly high risk of progressing from prediabetes to diabetes,"" says Dr. Giulio Romeo, associate medical director of the Adult Diabetes Section at Harvard-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center.
        Unlike diabetes, prediabetes is ""largely silent"" and typically doesn't produce blatant symptoms that might clue us in to its presence, Dr. Romeo says. But subtler signs often show up that shouldn't be ignored, offering a valuable window to curb blood sugar levels and halt progression.
        ""Anyone whose blood sugar falls into the prediabetes range is going in only one direction unless changes are made,"" says Emma Samuels Grinblatas, a registered dietitian and practice manager in the Comprehensive Weight Management Center at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""Genetic and lifestyle factors both play a role in the development of diabetes. Whether we like it or not, our bodies will behave in certain ways. We don't get to play with our genes, but we do get to make changes in our eating behaviors and lifestyle choices.""
        Risk factors and clues
        The same factors that play into diabetes development — overweight or obesity, inactivity, and family history — increase the risk of prediabetes. Paying attention to these, along with any persistent fatigue, should alert you that you may be in jeopardy, Dr. Romeo says.
        Also notice if you're getting more infections—especially vaginal yeast infections. This can happen in women with prediabetes whose blood sugar spikes after meals — perhaps several times a day — but whose fasting glucose levels stay within normal limits (see ""Three types of blood sugar tests""). ""Their response to meals can't be categorized as normal,"" Dr. Romeo says.
        After eating larger meals, some people with prediabetes also experience repeated urination or blurry vision. These signs, too, are related to temporarily surging blood sugar levels. They also happen to mirror full-blown diabetes symptoms, but on a smaller scale.
        ""While we like to classify things in buckets, the truth is that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are often on a continuum — it's the same process across different stages,"" Dr. Romeo says. ""Sometimes people are on the brink, so they notice certain signs even if they don't, by the book, have type 2 diabetes.""
        
          
            
              
                Three types of blood sugar tests
                Screening for prediabetes and diabetes relies on tests that measure levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Get tested every two to three years if your prior results are normal and there are no changes in your risk factors, says Dr. Giulio Romeo, associate medical director of the Adult Diabetes Section at Joslin Diabetes Center.
                This trio of tests can reveal blood sugar levels. Ask your doctor which one — or combination — makes sense for you.
                Fasting blood glucose. You stop eating eight or more hours before the test, which shows how well your body is able to process blood sugar overnight. A fasting blood sugar level of 99 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or lower is considered normal, 100 to 125 mg/dL indicates prediabetes, and 126 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes.
                A1c. This reflects your average blood sugar level over the past two or three months. An A1c measurement be-low 5.7% counts as normal, 5.7% to 6.4% indicates prediabetes, and 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes.
                Glucose tolerance test. This test, done after an overnight fast, involves taking several blood samples before and after you drink a sugary liquid. For a blood sugar measurement taken two hours after drinking the liquid, a level of 140 mg/dL or lower is considered normal, 141 to 199 mg/dL indicates prediabetes, and 200 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes. A variation of this test is used to diagnose diabetes during pregnancy.
              
            
          
        
        Frequent movement crucial
        Lifestyle changes are the cornerstone of measures to prevent prediabetes from progressing, Harvard experts say. A new study, published online Sept. 21, 2022, by BMJ, underscores this concept, suggesting that women who've had a temporary form of diabetes during pregnancy can lower their risk of later developing the disease by 90% by adhering to five key lifestyle factors: healthy weight, high-quality diet, regular physical activity, moderate alcohol consumption, and not smoking. The researchers based their conclusions on an analysis of 28 years of health and lifestyle data on 4,275 women who'd had pregnancy-related diabetes; of these, 924 later developed diabetes.
        Frequent movement, in particular, is pivotal in staving off the problem. A new study published online Dec. 2, 2022, by The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism suggests that women who take more steps each day may have a lower risk of developing diabetes. Researchers analyzed diabetes rates along with data from wearable fitness devices from 5,677 people (75% women). Participants whose daily step counts averaged 10,700 at the study's start were 44% less likely to develop diabetes over the following four years compared with those who averaged only 6,000 steps per day.
        ""Regular exercise plays a profound role on blood sugar,"" Grinblatas says. ""The recommendation of 30 minutes of exercise at least five days a week can be broken down into 10-minute increments and include things like walking, yard work, and dancing. Any form of exercise is good for our bodies and brains.""
        And exercise pays off well beyond a shrinking waistline for people at risk of diabetes. ""Exercise alone often won't result in weight loss,"" Dr. Romeo says, ""but it has significant benefits that can't be measured by the scale — not just in terms of preventing progression to diabetes, but on your heart, mood, and many aspects of overall health not captured by a change in your weight.""
        Along with lifestyle changes, the drug metformin can boost diabetes prevention efforts for some people with obesity. Metformin lowers blood sugar levels by improving the way the body shuttles sugar from the blood into the cells of muscles and other tissues, where it's used as fuel. Research shows metformin reduces the odds prediabetes will progress to diabetes by about one-third, Dr. Romeo says, though lifestyle interventions work even better — lowering the chance of progression by about 60%.
        ""For some, maybe the focus is not about losing weight, but how you should exercise at whatever level you can — looking at this not as a sprint but as something you can incorporate into your routine over the years,"" he says.
        
          
            
              
                Diet and diabetes: It's complicated
                Some people believe eating desserts — or foods containing processed sugar — can give them diabetes. But it's not that simple, says Emma Samuels Grinblatas, a registered dietitian at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
                Type 2 diabetes results from a combination of two processes. First, the body becomes resistant to the hormone insulin and can't use it properly to carry glucose (sugar) from the blood into cells. In turn, the pancreas can't keep up with producing more and more insulin. But someone without diabetes who eats a few cookies or a piece of cake shouldn't have a problem, because her pancreas is working normally and can handle the task.
                Grinblatas says many of her patients with diabetes have been ""made to believe sugar is something they cannot have. But that's not the case,"" she says. ""Nothing is inherently bad. It's all about balance.""
                Indeed, glucose is an energy source our body needs. While you should check food labels for sugar content, Grinblatas says it's just as important to monitor carbohydrate consumption — which can also cause blood glucose to rise — if you're concerned about diabetes.
                A new study suggests that a low-carbohydrate diet may quickly bring elevated A1c levels (a measure of blood sugar over the prior several months) back to a healthier range. Published online Oct. 26, 2022, by JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed 150 older adults (75% women) with untreated prediabetes or less-severe diabetes over six months, randomly assigning half to a low-carb diet and frequent dietary counseling and the rest to their usual diet.
                ""Many of my patients work hard to reduce their sugar intake but still have a very high carb load,"" she says. ""If you're having a bagel or breakfast bar in the morning, try having an egg, unsweetened yogurt, or old-fashioned oatmeal and put in some fruit or chopped nuts. A nice balance of carbs, healthy fats, and protein slows down digestion and helps people feel full.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/battling-a-brain-storm,"Battling a ""brain storm""","Official statistics indicate nearly 40 million Americans cope with migraines — throbbing headaches so disruptive that those stricken often retreat to a dark, quiet room. But the real numbers affected by this ""brain storm"" are likely about 50% higher, Harvard experts say, meaning tens of millions haven't formally been diagnosed and aren't benefiting from ever-improving treatments.
        Migraines aren't just bad headaches. Pulsing pain, typically centered behind an eye or ear, can join nausea, vomiting, fatigue, brain fog, and increased sensitivity to light or sound that lasts for hours or days.
        ""We know migraine is under­diagnosed, so that implies it's undertreated,"" says Dr. Paul Rizzoli, clinical director of Graham Headache Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital. ""Those who haven't been diagnosed aren't people with no symptoms—they have active symptoms but aren't seeking care or recognizing they should.""
        Fresh approaches with fewer side effects — including a newer medication targeting migraines' apparent underlying mechanisms — should encourage those delaying a diagnosis to seek help. ""There's no need to continue pushing through without investigating all forms of possible relief,"" Dr. Rizzoli says.
        Hormonal triggers
        Scientists still don't understand all the reasons migraines happen. But it's clear they often run in families and can be triggered by factors such as stress, disrupted sleep patterns, hunger or dehydration, certain foods or medications, and bright lights or loud noise. And for women — affected three times as often as men — hormones appear to play a major role in how and when these headaches start — and cease.
        ""The change in hormone levels that's part of the menstrual cycle is often a trigger, but there may be other reasons why just the presence of hormones increases migraine frequency in women,"" Dr. Rizzoli says.
        Midlife, in particular, is often a tipping point. Some women begin having migraines for the first time, while others with longtime headaches — booming through several days or more every month — notice they worsen, says Dr. Amanda Macone, a neurologist and headache medicine specialist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Treatment advances
        Even among people who help manage their migraines by avoiding triggers, medications are fundamental. Drugs either stop headaches in progress or prevent them from starting.
        Traditional options to abort migraine episodes include triptans such as sumatriptan (Imitrex, Treximent) and ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine mesylate (Trudhesa), which halt migraine attacks by stimulating the brain serotonin receptors. Others include over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve), or acetaminophen (Tylenol).
         For headache prevention, doctors often prescribe certain antiseizure medications, such as topiramate (Topamax) and sodium valproate (Depakote), or beta blockers, such as nadolol (Corgard) metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL). Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections offer a potential option for people with chronic migraine (15 or more headaches per month).
         But recent years have seen the advent of targeted therapies that work better with fewer side effects. ""We need to turn down the headache at its source,"" Dr. Rizzoli says, ""and the usual medications we have don't work for everyone."" Here are the most promising fresh options:
        CGRP blockers. These drugs interfere with a protein called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) that can trigger inflammation and  pain around the covering of the brain. Formulations include atogepant (Qulipta) and Rimegepant (Nurtec), a daily pill; erenumab (Aimovig) or fremanezumab (Ajovy), a shot you give yourself once a month; and eptinezumab (Vyepti) or galcanezumab (Emgality), given at a health care facility as an infusion every three months. ""They all work on the same principle,"" Dr. Rizzoli says. ""CGRP is part of the sequence of events that starts a headache. If we can block CGRP, we can block the development of a headache."" Side effects are rare, he adds, and ""that's a big advance.""
        Nasal sprays. Delivering migraine medications through the nose isn't new. But Trudhesa is available in a new nasal formulation of the well-established ergot alkaloid drug dihydroergotamine mesylate, which is still available in an earlier nasal spray version (Migranal). It stands out for its rapid absorption into the brain, making it a useful therapy to stop a migraine in progress.
        Green light therapy. Exposure to green light — unlike red, blue, or other colors — can shorten or avert a migraine. It's not a standalone approach, but Harvard research has suggested green light is the most soothing on the spectrum, Dr. Rizzoli says. Green light lamps and glasses are commercially available.

For many older people, reaching that goal requires taking medication. To date, it has been unclear whether any particular drug or combination of drugs makes a difference in dementia risk.
        A new study has found that blood pressure drugs that stimulate type 2 and 4 angiotensin II receptors in the brain may offer greater protection against Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. These drugs include angiotensin-receptor blockers, such as valsartan (Diovan) and losartan (Cozaar); dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, like amlodipine (Norvasc); and thiazide diuretics, like hydrochlorothiazide (also known as HCTZ).
        It’s not understood why these particular blood pressure drugs may help maintain brain health. The researchers speculated that stimulating the angiotensin II receptors might enhance brain blood flow or perhaps reduce amyloid plaque, high amounts of which are linked with Alzheimer’s. The study was published online Jan. 4, 2023, by JAMA Network Open.
        A person with good blood pressure control should not change medications based on this one study. But if you’re beginning a new blood pressure drug, or if you need to change your regimen, ask your doctor about these angiotensin II stimulators. All are well-established treatments and are available as inexpensive generics.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/taking-charge-of-prostate-cancer,Taking charge of prostate cancer,"More men with low-risk prostate cancer choose active surveillance over immediate treatment with radiation, hormonal therapy, or surgery. With active surveillance, men monitor their cancer and don’t seek treatment unless it becomes worse.
        ""Active surveillance can help men analyze their situation before deciding to have invasive procedures and treatments, which can lead to side effects that can affect quality of life and may not improve life expectancy,"" says Dr. Frank McGovern, a urologist with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""But it is also an opportunity for men to re-evaluate their lifestyle and make changes that may improve their cancer prognosis and ensure their life is the healthiest it can be.""
        Going by the numbers
        Generally, active surveillance is an option for men with low-grade cancer (cancer confined to the prostate gland and less likely to spread), meaning those with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of less than 10 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) and a Gleason score of 6 or less. High-grade and many intermediate-grade prostate cancers don’t qualify for active surveillance, and treatment for them usually begins immediately.
        Another group who are not good candidates for active surveillance are men with a family history of lethal prostate cancer and those with a BRCA gene mutation, especially BRCA2, which is linked with a higher risk for prostate cancer.
        A blood test measures PSA, a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. The Gleason system involves ranking the two most common types of cancer cells in a man’s biopsied tissue on a 5-point scale. The two rankings are added together to get a Gleason score, with 10 being the highest. The higher the number, the greater the chance the cancer will quickly grow and spread.
        Men on active surveillance get a periodic PSA test and digital rectal exam in which the doctor feels for abnormal areas on the prostate. These are usually scheduled every six months.
        A repeat biopsy is done one year after the initial diagnosis and then three years after that. Further biopsies are done at the guidance of the patient and his doctor. Your doctor may also order a prostate MRI during the monitoring phase.
        ""In general, the higher a man’s PSA level, the greater likelihood he has prostate cancer,"" says Dr. McGovern. ""Also, a significant rise in PSA levels over the course of a year may be a sign of cancer.""
        If PSA levels rise or if a new or enlarging growth is detected during the rectal exam, your doctor will likely recommend a prostate biopsy sooner than normal protocol to check whether the cancer has become more aggressive.
        ""If the biopsy doesn’t show concerning changes, you and your doctor may decide to continue with active surveillance, but if it does, or you have an increase in prostate volume or a higher Gleason score, your doctor may suggest moving forward with surgery, radiation, or hormonal therapy,"" says Dr. McGovern.
        Steps of action
        Like any medical procedure, active surveillance has its risks. ""The most serious of these is underestimating the cancer’s growth until it becomes life-threatening, although this occurs in a small percentage of men,"" says Dr. McGovern.
        Another drawback is psychological — the constant worry, stress, and anxiety that the cancer can worsen because you are not seeking treatment. One way to alleviate these feelings is to embrace a take-charge attitude about your health.
        ""Instead of waiting to see if their prostate cancer worsens, men can take steps to improve their cancer situation and even protect themselves from other health issues, like heart attacks and strokes,"" says Dr. McGovern. ""This can empower men and give them a better sense of control over their condition.""
        He offers these suggestions:
        Increase exercise intensity. A study published Aug. 19, 2021, in JAMA Oncology found that men on active surveillance lowered their PSA levels and cancer cell growth after doing 30 minutes of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on a treadmill three times a week for 12 weeks. In HIIT, you alternate between periods of intense aerobic output and rest. In this study, the men repeated a pattern of two minutes of HIIT followed by two minutes of recovery.
        Other research has found that men with prostate cancer who engaged most frequently in vigorous activity had a 30% lower risk of developing advanced cancer and a 25% lower risk of developing lethal cancer when compared with men who exercised the least. Examples of vigorous activities include running, cycling, swimming, and racquet sports. (Make sure to check with your doctor before embarking on any kind of exercise program.)
        Watch your cholesterol. Studies have found that men who take cholesterol-lowering statins may have a lower risk of advanced prostate cancer. Statin use has also been associated with longer survival among men with prostate cancer. ""Get your cholesterol levels checked, and if they are high, consult your doctor about whether to take statins,"" says Dr. McGovern.
        Manage your weight. Weight gain is linked with more aggressive cancer. ""Even losing five to 10 extra pounds can help lower your risk,"" says Dr. McGovern. A healthier weight also keeps blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control.
        Eat a plant-based diet. Although it’s unclear whether specific dietary habits can influence prostate cancer growth, Dr. McGovern has found his patients do much better when they follow a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean or MIND diet. He recommends consulting a nutritionist who can offer guidance on meal planning.
        Consider therapy. Your anxiety about active surveillance may be associated with something else. ""A therapist can help you explore where your anxiety lies and what may be driving it,"" says Dr. McGovern. ""Addressing any issues can help relieve your uncertainty or hesitation about active surveillance.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/can-cannabis-help-relieve-pain,Can cannabis help relieve pain?,"Statistics show that the use of cannabis among adults ages 65 and older has increased eightfold in recent years, and as many as 80% of these seniors use it to treat and manage pain. But can it really help?
        ""Cannabis has been used for medical purposes for thousands of years,"" says Staci Gruber, director of the Cognitive and Clinical Neuroimaging Core and the Marijuana Investigations for Neuroscientific Discovery (MIND) program at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""Still, there is much we don’t know about how it works and for what conditions. But pain management is an area where both science and personal anecdotes tend to support its use.""
        Cannabis 101
        Cannabis is derived from hemp or marijuana. These plants are two varieties of the same species: Cannabis sativa. The plant contains more than 100 chemical compounds called cannabinoids. The two most prevalent compounds are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — which is what gives people a ""high"" — and cannabidiol (CBD), which doesn’t produce an intoxicating effect.
        One difference between hemp and marijuana is how much THC they contain. Marijuana has more than 0.3% THC by weight, while the amount in hemp is equal to or less than 0.3% THC by weight. Marijuana also contains less CBD than hemp.
        Hemp is used to make the various CBD products that have popped up everywhere. They are available thanks to the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized industrial hemp plants to make various types of merchandise — mostly paper, textiles, and concrete — but it also opened the door for CBD products.
        What the science says
        The thinking is that when ingested or inhaled, THC or CBD binds to specific receptors on the brain and nerve cells, which slows pain impulses and eases discomfort. ""They also may provide anti-inflammatory effects, which may help reduce pain,"" says Gruber.
        People who take cannabis for pain relief vouch for its effectiveness. However, the science behind it has been thin. Part of the problem is the lack of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies — the gold standard for medical research. Still, other types of studies have shown that cannabis can help with certain conditions, including pain.
        In 2017, a committee formed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine reviewed about 10,000 studies related to cannabis use for medical indications. The experts weighed the strength of the evidence for almost two dozen health conditions. They found ""substantial"" or ""conclusive"" proof that cannabis was an effective treatment for only three health problems, one of which was pain. (The other two were spasms related to multiple sclerosis and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.)
        However, it’s also possible that part of cannabis’ healing power represents a placebo effect. People think it will work, so it does. An analysis published Nov. 28, 2022, in JAMA Network Open looked at 20 randomized controlled studies regarding the effect of cannabis products on pain relief and found that placebos were as effective.
        Is it for you?
        Should you try cannabis for your pain? According to Gruber, it depends on the type of pain, the severity, and your expectations. ""While there is evidence that people can find pain relief from  cannabis, this doesn’t mean it works for everyone or every type of pain. Nor does it mean it will treat the overall problem causing your pain,"" she says.
        Doctors can’t prescribe cannabis like conventional medications, but in many states, they can recommend its use for certain conditions, including pain. (Check out your state’s cannabis laws at /mm.)
        Depending on where you live, this recommendation will allow you to legally buy cannabis from licensed dispensaries. However, in states where recreational cannabis is legal, people can purchase cannabis at dispensaries and online without a doctor’s input. Still, always consult your doctor before trying any cannabis product, so you can discuss possible side effects, like dry mouth, impaired mental function, dizziness, and heart and blood pressure problems, or interactions with other medications you are taking.
        Individuals who want to avoid the ""high"" associated with THC can choose cannabis products with more varied cannabinoid profiles, says Gruber. ""These include CBD and other non-intoxicating compounds from the plant that may have therapeutic benefits.""
        However, be careful about using over-the-counter CBD products, as they lack oversight (since the FDA has yet to develop CBD regulations). ""Right now, there is no way to know whether a product contains the amount of CBD indicated on the label or if it contains things it shouldn’t,"" says Gruber.
        Cannabis can be consumed in different ways. You can smoke the leaves via a joint, pipe, or bong; inhale vaporized leaves or oil; consume it through edibles like brownies, cookies, gummies, or tea; take as an oil or tincture under the tongue; or apply it to the skin via topical creams or patches.
        How often people take cannabis for pain also varies. ""Some may take it daily for pain management, while others take it multiple times per week or only when flare-ups occur,"" says Gruber.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-i-take-afternoon-naps,Should I take afternoon naps?,"Q. 
          I retired earlier this year and have begun to enjoy taking afternoon naps. But is regular napping good for my health?
        
        A. The first thing to consider is the possibility that you nap because you have daytime sleepiness. If so, what is the cause? For example:
        
          Do you take any medicine that might make you sleepy? Review your prescriptions with your pharmacist or during your next doctor's visit.
          Have you started having problems sleeping at night? If you sleep well at night and wake up refreshed, don't worry. But if you feel groggy or have early-morning headaches, you may have sleep apnea or some other cause of interrupted sleep.
          Could you be depressed? Ask yourself if you no longer enjoy activities that previously gave you pleasure and whether you feel low.
        
        If you feel your napping may be related to these issues or other health concerns then see your doctor. However, it sounds as if your nap is voluntary and enjoyable. It probably does not reflect an underlying sleep disturbance. If it refreshes your day without making it hard to sleep at night, snooze away.
        For most people, napping in the early afternoon when your body experiences a natural circadian dip, is the best way to catch a few winks without disturbing the sleep-wake cycle. There is no consensus on how long you should nap. Some experts recommend naps should last no more than 30 minutes. The limit is 60 minutes, because longer naps have been linked to a higher risk of health problems like cardiovascular disease.
        Try to schedule your naps and not wait until you get sleepy, which will prevent you from napping too late in the day. Keep your napping space dark, cool, and free from distractions. (But there is nothing wrong with the standard couch nap if that's most comfortable.) Remember to give yourself 10 minutes after napping before engaging in mentally or physically demanding tasks.
        There is still some stigma about naps at work in America because of the lingering notions of decreased productivity and even laziness. But there is solid evidence that an afternoon nap can improve a worker's cognitive performance, especially for complex tasks, and may stimulate creativity.
        When NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration studied the effects of napping on pilots, they found that naps improved mental alertness and performance. Many night shift workers reportedly perked up after taking naps as brief as 15 to 20 minutes.
        So, enjoy your nap. Even if you return to work, maintaining an afternoon nap as part of your daily routine can be beneficial.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/exercising-with-a-flare-up-of-knee-arthritis,Exercising with a flare-up of knee arthritis,"You might know it well by now: the painful bloom of swelling and stiffness that signals a flare-up of knee osteoarthritis. When it strikes, and you muddle through the discomfort, you go easy on your knee and accept the idea that you’ll have to brace for limited activities until the flare settles down.
        While that may be true for some activities, such as kneeling or squatting, it doesn’t mean you have to stop exercising to protect your knee. In fact, exercising is an important way to keep the joint flexible. You’ll just have to go about exercising a little differently while your knee arthritis is acting up.
         For pointers, we turned to Christopher Morin, a physical therapist with ­Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        
          Q. What are the risks of exercising when knee arthritis flares?
        
        A: The most significant risk is causing further irritation of the joint. Osteoarthritis is a long and slow degenerative process that happens when the cartilage or cushioning between knee bones wears out. Activities that irritate the joint shouldn’t worsen this degenerative change or cause structural damage, but they could cause greater discomfort and decreased function.
        
          Q.
          What types of activities might irritate the knee?
        
         A: You should try to reduce pressure and friction on your knee. Pressure would come from activities such as running, tennis, basketball, or walking long distances. Friction would come from activities like deep knee bending or knee lunges that require you to bend and hold a knee position for an extended period. Those activities can make your knee arthritis symptoms worse, and you’ll want to avoid that so the joint can calm down.
        
          Q. What types of activities are safe when arthritis is bothering you?
        
        A: It depends on your symptoms, their severity, and your overall fitness. Sometimes simply decreasing the physical stress of an activity is all it takes to adapt an exercise to a flare-up. So maybe play pickleball instead of tennis, or take brisk walks rather than going for a run.
        But generally we like to encourage activities that relieve pressure and friction on the knee, such as riding a stationary bike, using an elliptical machine, practicing yoga, swimming, walking pain-free distances on flat terrain, or doing upper-body strength training or core strengthening.
        Lower-body strengthening can also be quite useful. For example, stronger leg muscles help relieve knee pain, as they absorb some of the pressure you place on the knees.
        But again, stay away from exercises that might irritate the knee. A general rule of thumb is that exercising shouldn’t increase your pain or swelling during or after the activity.
        
          Q. Is there anything you should do before a workout when you have a knee arthritis flare?
        
        A: Some people will take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) before an activity. However, regular use of those medications is associated with stomach ulcers, internal bleeding, and increased risks of heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure.
        Instead, it’s safer to warm up before activity. It loosens the knee joint and the muscles that act on it. A heating pad or hot shower can be a good start. Spending 10 minutes on a stationary bike is great, too. If your knee is still comfortable after the warm-up, you should be in good shape to work out.
        
          Q. What should you do after a workout when knee arthritis is flaring?
        
        A: Try icing your knee after a workout to decrease inflammation. But if you consistently find that you need to keep icing your knee in order to function for the remainder of the day, consider either taking a bit of time off from exercising or toning down your routine. That could mean changing the type of exercise you do or reducing the amount of time you spend exercising per workout. It may help to do a few 10-minute workouts each day rather than one 30- or 60-minute routine.
        Listen to your body. Let pain be your guide. But avoid long periods of inactivity. Stay as active as you can.
        
          
            
              
                Move of the month: Side-lying clam
                
                  
                
                
                  
                
                Lie on your right side, knees bent so your heels are in line with your buttocks. Rest your head on your right arm on the floor. Keep your feet together, contract your abdominal muscles, and slowly lift your left knee up toward the ceiling. Pause, then slowly return to the starting position. Repeat 10 times, then do the same exercise on the other side.Exercise photos by Michael Carroll

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/was-it-something-you-ate-follow-these-steps-when-food-makes-you-sick,Was it something you ate? Follow these steps when food makes you sick,"Foodborne illness outbreaks occur frequently in the United States. Invisible microbes in food sicken an estimated 48 million people in our country each year, landing 128,000 in the hospital and killing about 3,000, according to the CDC.
        Culprits are usually viruses (such as norovirus), bacteria (such as Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, or Campylobacter), parasites (such as Toxoplasma gondii), or toxins (such as those that can accumulate in shellfish).
        If you ingest them and get sick, you'll need to know how to respond.
        Recognizing symptoms
        Sometimes food-related illness shows up within a few hours of eating contaminated food. But some bugs (such as norovirus and Escherichia coli) don't trigger symptoms for days. Either way, the signs are usually intense: nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, or diarrhea, and possibly a low-grade fever (below 101° F). If you get dehydrated due to fluid loss from vomiting or diarrhea, you may feel lethargic, dizzy, or faint.
        Symptoms typically last for a couple of days. If they continue after a week, it may be less likely that food-related illness is making you sick. You should call your doctor to figure out what the problem is.
        In the throes of symptoms
        If you suspect you have food-related illness, you'll need to rest as much as possible and avoid sugary drinks or alcohol (which can make symptoms worse). Stay away from others (and try not to use the same bathroom), so you don't spread any bugs you're carrying, and keep taking any prescribed medications for chronic illnesses.
        You'll also need to stay hydrated. ""If it's hard to keep fluids down, take small sips. It's challenging, but important. Standing too suddenly when you're dehydrated can lead to fainting and injury. Severe dehydration can cause chemical imbalances in the body and even lead to kidney failure,"" says Dr. Christopher Baugh, an emergency medicine physician at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        If your symptoms don't include a high fever or bloody stool, Dr. Baugh says it's probably okay to take an antidiarrheal medication such as loperamide (Imodium). If you can stand the symptoms, however, it may be wise to avoid medications and let your body expel the invaders. ""If you take the medication, there's a risk that it might improve the symptoms but prolong or worsen the illness,"" Dr. Baugh says.
        
          
            
              
                Avoiding food-related illness
                Many cases of food-related illness result from improper food handling, preparation, and storage. For example, food can become contaminated if the cook doesn't wash his or her hands before preparing it; if fluids from raw meat, seafood, or poultry get onto fresh produce or cooked food; if food isn't cooked at temperatures high enough to kill microbes; or if food has spoiled.
                Avoiding those problems will help you ward off food-related illness. You have a lot of control over this at home. But what if you're eating at a restaurant? It's safest to order cooked foods, ask when stews and soups were initially prepared (if it wasn't that day, skip it), and tell your server that you'll need your food to be piping hot. If food doesn't arrive steaming or sizzling, request that it get a quick nuke in the microwave.
              
            
          
        
        When to seek emergency care
        Sometimes food-related illness requires a trip to the emergency room. ""The biggest warning signs are high fever or bloody stool,"" Dr. Baugh says. ""You should also seek emergency care if you have severe dehydration or abdominal pain, if you're unable to keep medications down, or if you have a weakened immune system.""
        This isn't the time to try to avoid care because you don't want to be a bother to anyone. ""Untreated bacterial food poisoning may progress into a life-threatening condition without antibiotics and intravenous fluids,"" Dr. Baugh says. ""If you're caring for someone with a food-related illness, be on alert for signs and symptoms that suggest they need medical attention.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/are-you-napping-too-much,Are you napping too much?,"A quick catnap can be refreshing and provide just the right reset to keep up your energy and concentration. But what about a lot of little catnaps — or even a great big snooze after every meal? Too much daytime sleeping can indicate a serious health problem.
        How much is too much?
        The optimal amount of sleep we need each night is seven to nine hours. Getting more or less than that is linked to cognitive decline, obesity, heart disease, and premature death. A direct cause hasn’t been established conclusively, but there’s growing evidence to suggest that possibility.
        The same is true of regular napping for long periods. For example, 90-minute daily naps are tied to increased risks for stroke, and two-hour daily naps are associated with an increased risk for dementia. Again, it is unclear whether naps actually cause these problems.
        Causes of daytime sleeping
        Many things can lead to excessive daytime sleeping. ""It could simply be that you’re bored because there isn’t much to do. Or maybe you’re bored because you have hearing loss and you’re avoiding group activities,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, associate chief of gerontology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Here are some other reasons that might lead you to sleep more during the day.
        You’re not sleeping well at night. You may be drowsy in the day if you have insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep) or another condition that keeps you from getting enough rest at night, such as chronic pain, depression, anxiety, an overactive bladder, restless legs syndrome, or sleep apnea (frequent pauses in breathing during sleep).
        You have an underlying condition. Many conditions can make you tired during the day regardless of how well you slept at night. Examples are very low blood pressure (especially after eating), low thyroid activity, vitamin D or B12 deficiency, anemia, low blood sugar, depression, narcolepsy (sudden episodes of deep sleep), and even obesity.
        You have frailty syndrome. Frailty includes a loss of muscle mass, stamina, endurance, weight, and general fitness. ""It affects about 25% of people ages 90 or older, and 50% of those 90 or older in nursing homes. One key symptom is fatigue, caused by lower energy production in cells. Eventually, doing any activity can be really exhausting, and the frail person sleeps more and more,"" says Dr. Dae Hyun Kim, a frailty researcher and geriatrician with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Your medication is making you drowsy. Common offenders include prescription medications to treat allergies, depression, high blood pressure (such as alpha blockers and beta blockers), insomnia, nausea, Parkinson’s disease, or seizures, as well as over-the-counter remedies for insomnia, allergies, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. ""And if you’re taking a lot of medications, there might be a drug interaction that’s making you tired,"" Dr. Salamon says.
        You’re not eating or drinking enough. You need food and fluids to keep up your energy.
        What you should do
        Dr. Salamon says you don’t have to do anything about excessive daytime napping if it isn’t bothering you and you’re unconcerned about potential health effects. But if you (or your family) would like to address it, talk to your doctor about hunting for causes.
        ""It could be that you just need to take your medication at a different time of day,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""For example, if you’re on a diuretic that makes you go to the bathroom a lot at night, you might be able to take it in the morning or afternoon instead of the evening.""
        If your doctor can’t find any medical causes of daytime sleepiness, you might just need a little more nourishment and activity in your life. ""Try to eat three meals and a couple of snacks each day, and drink four to six cups of fluid,"" Dr. Salamon suggests. ""And figure out a way to stay more engaged. Join a club, take an exercise class, go for a daily walk, or get together with friends,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""Even talking on the phone with someone each day can perk you up.""
        It will also help to go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day; keep your room cool and dark at night; and avoid caffeine, alcohol, and electronic screens close to bedtime. ""If you need to nap, try to limit it to up to 30 minutes,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""A little napping is normal as we get older, and quick catnaps can recharge your batteries. It’s a lot of napping that we worry about.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-our-microbes-affect-our-behavior,Do our microbes affect our behavior?,"We've known for almost 200 years that trillions of microbes live on our skin and deep inside us, particularly in our gut. Until recently, we thought they were just freeloaders using our bodies to get food and shelter, causing us no trouble. However, we now know that the genes of these microbes (our microbiome) make many chemicals that affect our body and may influence our vulnerability to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, and several degenerative neurological diseases.
        Recent studies suggest the microbes within us may also influence our behavior. A study published online Dec. 14, 2022, by the journal Nature compared mice that began exercising when given a running wheel to mice that didn't. There were no differences in their genes. However, there were differences in their gut microbiomes. In the exercisers, there were more bacteria that produced a certain chemical. Whenever these mice ran, that chemical sent signals from the gut up to the brain and ignited the brain's reward centers: they got a ""runner's high,"" and took every opportunity to run. Because of their different microbiome, the ""lazy"" mice got no such reward and remained couch potatoes. But when the microbiome of the exercisers was placed inside the lazy mice, they began exercising.
        If the gut microbiome can influence an animal's motivation to exercise, could that be true in humans? If so, could microbes in our body also affect our motivation to do other things — to use or avoid addictive substances, eat healthier foods, or socialize more readily?
        Or consider another microbe within us. When various animals are infected with a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii, they are much more likely to engage in risky behaviors. For example, infected gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park are much more likely than uninfected wolves to strike out on their own or to become dominant in the pack — or to die trying. The same fearlessness is seen in other infected animal species. Infected mice, for example, are less likely to avoid cats.
        Roughly 30% of humans are also infected with this same parasite. Could it possibly affect us the way it affects other animals, turning us into fearless risk takers? Studies have found that infected business school students are considerably more likely to aspire to be entrepreneurs (rather than, say, accountants), and that infected professionals attending events for entrepreneurs are much more likely to have already started their own business.
        So while the idea is still a long way from being proven, it is possible that the microbes within us not only influence our risk of various diseases but also influence our behavior. Scientists now even consider it conceivable that the microbes within us may influence things like intelligence, attitudes, empathy, who we are attracted to — in short, who we are.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/fighting-the-most-common-skin-cancers,Fighting the most common skin cancers,"Heading outside on a sunny day is a bit like going into battle. To protect your skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, you’ll need armor (sunscreen or sunblock, and sun-protective clothing), tactical strategy (avoiding peak sun hours), and a place to retreat (the shade) — especially during the summer months, when UV intensity is highest.

Mind you, we need a little sunshine on our skin to trigger the production of vitamin D, keep bones strong, and possibly help regulate mood and ward off illness. But unprotected UV exposure can cause skin cancers. The most common of these are non-melanoma skin cancers.

What are they?

To put it simply, non-melanoma skin cancers aren’t melanomas — the aggressive skin cancers that account for just 1% of all skin cancer cases, yet cause the majority of skin cancer deaths in the United States.

Extremely aggressive non-melanoma skin cancers are rare. Instead, the most common types, affecting millions of people per year, are slow-growing. They develop in basal cells (basal cell carcinomas, or BCCs) or squamous cells (squamous cell carcinomas, or SCCs).

These cancers don’t usually spread to other parts of the body, and they aren’t usually life-threatening. But they can be quite dangerous. ""Small skin cancers can bleed, hurt, and eat away at your skin. If left untreated, they can erode through important structures like your nose, eyes, bones, or muscles. If they become very large, they can spread, and in rare cases cause death,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

Symptoms

While non-melanoma skin cancers can develop anywhere on the body, they typically show up in areas that have been exposed to the sun, such as the head, face, neck, ears, lips, arms, legs, or hands.

The cancers may look like flat areas that differ only slightly from healthy skin, or they may have distinguishing features. SCCs can be scaly patches, crusty sores, or wart-like bumps. BCCs often have raised edges, a sunken center, and visible blood vessels. They also can look like a pale scar, a sore that won’t heal, a reddish patch, or a bump that might have a number of colors (red, blue, brown, or black).

Melanomas usually have brown, black, or blue pigment of uneven color, jagged edges, and an asymmetrical shape. They can be flat or lumpy. Many people have small brown, black, or blue spots on their skin (lentigos), but their color is even, their edges are smooth, and their shape is symmetrical. Lentigos can turn into melanomas, so pigmented spots that start to change color or shape need to be evaluated.

Diagnosis

BCCs and SCCs are often found early (by you or your doctor), when they are easiest to treat.

To make a diagnosis, your doctor will take a look at a new or changing skin growth under a powerful magnifier. If the area looks suspicious, your doctor might remove a sample of the tissue (a biopsy) and send it to a lab for analysis. If the sample is positive for BCC or SCC, the cancer will need to be removed.

For large tumors, ask your doctor about additional testing. ""For SCCs that are bigger than a quarter, my recommendation is to ask your doctor about getting your lymph nodes checked to make sure the cancer hasn’t spread,"" Dr. Waldman says.

Treatment

Non-melanoma skin cancer treatment depends on a cancer’s specific type and features. ""For instance, an in situ [contained and not spreading] SCC on the cheek may be treated with a prescription cream. But an invasive SCC on the cheek would need to be removed with Mohs surgery,"" Dr. Waldman says.

Mohs micrographic surgery involves removing cancer a little bit at a time, to preserve as much healthy skin as possible. Each piece is checked immediately under a microscope. Once the edges are free of cancer, the surgery is complete.

""Mohs surgery is usually reserved for invasive skin cancers in areas that are cosmetically sensitive — on the face, scalp, neck — or on functional areas like the hands, feet, and genitals, or with very aggressive or large tumors on the trunk or extremities,"" Dr. Waldman says.

If Mohs surgery isn’t necessary, the skin cancer may be cut or scraped out with surgical tools, frozen, or destroyed with radiation. The encouraging news is that most SCCs and BCCs can be cured when they’re treated early.

Develop your battle plan

The best weapon to fight skin cancer is a strict regimen of prevention and detection. It should include the following steps.

Cover up. Apply sunscreen or sunblock with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 to 50 before you go outside. Protect your lips with a sun protection product made for them. If possible, wear a long-sleeved shirt, pants, a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, shoes, and socks.

Avoid direct sunlight. Stay out of the sun when it’s strongest (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), and seek the shade as much as possible.

Be vigilant about detection. Schedule annual skin check-ups with your doctor, and conduct your own exams at home each month. Don’t forget your scalp and all the back surfaces of your body. A mirror (or a loved one) can help you check your back and other areas you can’t see well.

Be proactive. Call your doctor if you find any new skin growth that looks suspicious. ""We need to see you before tumors grow and become a problem,"" Dr. Waldman says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/gene-editing-a-one-time-fix-for-dangerously-high-cholesterol,Gene editing: A one-time fix for dangerously high cholesterol?,"Among your more than 20,000 different genes, one provides instructions for a protein called PCSK9, which helps regulate levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in your bloodstream. About one in 250 people has a variant in this gene that causes LDL cholesterol to skyrocket, sometimes to more than three times the optimal ceiling of 100 mg/dL. This genetic condition, called familial hypercholesterolemia, is the leading cause of premature heart attacks in America.
        But other people have different PCSK9 gene variants that have the exact opposite effect. Their LDL cholesterol is extraordinarily low—and their risk of heart attack is also far below average. This discovery, made by Dallas Heart Study researchers in 2005, spurred industry scientists to develop drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors (see ""How does PCSK9 affect your cholesterol level?"").
        ""From a drug development perspective, it was very exciting, because just 10 years later, there were two FDA-approved medications that could dramatically lower LDL,"" says Dr. Pradeep Natarajan, director of preventive cardiology at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. The drugs, alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha), can slash LDL levels by 50%. Taking one of these drugs with a cholesterol-lowering statin can further de-crease a person’s risk of heart attack and related problems by approximately 15% compared with taking a statin alone.
        
          
            
              
                How does PCSK9 affect your cholesterol level?
                The PCSK9 protein acts like a tag that signals LDL receptors to be broken down in liver cells, which means there are fewer receptors to clear LDL from the bloodstream. As a result, LDL levels rise. High LDL accelerates the buildup of fatty plaque in the heart’s arteries, raising heart attack risk.
                But therapies that either block or prevent the creation of PCSK9 have the opposite effect. More LDL receptors remain active in the liver to remove LDL. Blood levels of LDL plummet, lowering the risk of a heart attack.
              
            
          
        
        From inhibition to suppression
        While taking a statin means swallowing a pill every day, the PCSK9 inhibitors are given by self-injection once or twice a month. But inclisiran (Leqvio), an equally effective drug approved last year, requires an injection just once every six months. Instead of blocking PCSK9 after it’s made, inclisiran prevents the protein from being made in the first place, using a technique called RNA interference.
        Now, a cutting-edge therapy that uses gene editing to permanently shut down PCSK9 production is being tested in people with familial hypercholesterolemia who’ve already had a heart attack. The CEO of Verve Therapeutics, the company leading the trial, is former Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Sek Kathiresan.
        To create the therapy, scientists relied on a modification of the powerful gene editing tool called CRISPR, which Dr. Kathiresan describes as ""a molecular pencil and eraser"" that changes a single letter in the instructions for making PCSK9. The one-time infusion contains tiny lipid particles that contain the editing tools, which travel through the blood to the liver. Once there, the particles release their contents, and the editor goes to work in liver cells. Studies in monkeys show that a single infusion lowered blood levels of PCSK9 by 89%, with a corresponding drop in LDL of 61%. Early data from the first human trial should be available later this year.
        Future possibilities?
        If the therapy proves to be safe and effective, it could also potentially treat people who don’t have familial hypercholesterolemia but who instead have ""garden variety"" high cholesterol, says Dr. Natarajan. ""People with inactivating PCSK9 variants in both gene copies that lead to LDL values as low as 15 mg/dL are alive and well, which suggests such levels are safe,"" he says. And so far, evidence suggests that PCSK9 gene editing is very specific and without identified ""off-target"" effects in other places on the genome.
        Despite the many available treatments to reduce LDL, many people don’t take these drugs consistently over the long term for a variety of reasons, such as insurance and access issues. That makes the ""one and done"" option of gene editing especially appealing, particularly since high LDL is very common and an important contributor to cardio-vascular disease, the leading cause of death in this country, Dr. Natarajan says. As the Verve trial moves forward, investigators at Harvard and elsewhere are developing gene editing therapies for other inherited heart conditions, including cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which currently have only limited treatment options.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-i-get-a-calcium-score,Should I get a calcium score?,"Q.
          I'm wondering if I should get a test to check my calcium score. I'm 52 and in good health. My LDL cholesterol level is normal (97 mg/dL), but my father had a heart attack in his late 40s.
        
        A. The artery-clogging plaque that builds up inside the heart's arteries contains cholesterol, inflammatory cells, scar tissue, and calcium. A coronary artery calcium scan (often called a calcium score) uses a special type of CT scan to look for that calcium, which is then quantified on a scale from zero to over 1,000. A score of zero indicates no calcified plaque. The higher the score, the more plaque is present. Findings from large studies link higher calcium scores to a higher risk of a heart attack or stroke.
        While a calcium score can be informative, the scans don't make sense for everyone. Not all cholesterol plaques have become calcified in younger people, so the scans aren't usually recommended for people under 40. Anyone who already has known heart disease doesn't need a calcium scan. That's because the results likely wouldn't change a doctor's treatment recommendations, which would very likely include a statin.
        However, if you're at risk for heart disease but don't have any symptoms, knowing your calcium score can help you decide whether to start taking a statin. Statins can help lower your risk of heart disease even if your LDL cholesterol is in the normal range. Current guidelines suggest that people estimate their 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease with a calculator from the American College of Cardiology, available at /ascvd. Statins are recommended for people with a score of 7.5% or higher. However, the score doesn't capture other possible situations that may elevate your risk — which include a family history of premature heart disease (defined as coronary artery disease occurring in men younger than 55 or women younger than 65).
        Calcium scans are readily available, quick, and painless. For the test, you simply lie on your back. The scanner then takes multiple pictures of your heart over the course of about five minutes. It involves some radiation exposure, although not as much as a standard CT scan. The cost (around $100) is usually covered by insurance. But keep in mind that the test isn't mandatory. Another option is to skip the test and simply start taking a statin. But for someone like you, who may have inherited a higher-than-normal heart disease risk, a calcium scan can give you a better sense of your risk and inform your doctor's advice.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-trouble-with-new-drugs-2019050216562,The trouble with new drugs,"When a drug is approved by the FDA, it may seem like it's only a matter of time before some unexpected side effects are discovered. Perhaps it seems that way because it's true! A 2017 study of drugs approved within a 10-year period found that the FDA announced alerts, warnings, or recalls on about one-third of them in the years after their approval.
        Some of the side effects were minor and easily managed. For example, there might be a warning to avoid taking a new medication at the same time as another medication. But sometimes the ""side effect"" is death. That was the case when the FDA issued a warning about the gout drug febuxostat (Uloric) in 2019.
        Gout: new treatments, new concerns
        Gout can cause joint pain that's excruciating and debilitating, but it is highly treatable and even preventable. In recent years, a number of new drugs have been approved, including febuxostat. Although it was approved in 2009, some of the early studies raised concerns that people who took febuxostat might have a higher rate of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks. As a result, the FDA required the drug's maker to perform additional research after its approval.
        The additional research confirmed that the safety concerns were justified: when compared with people taking allopurinol, an older gout drug, researchers observed a small but significant increase in the rates of cardiovascular death, and death from all causes, among people taking febuxostat. This led the FDA to issue a ""black box warning"" — the strongest action short of a recall — about the risks of taking this drug and how allopurinol should be tried first.
        If you're taking febuxostat now, talk to your doctor about this new development and whether you should continue it, stop it, or switch to another treatment.
        What's a black box warning, anyway?
        Depending on the level of concern, the FDA has several ways to communicate new warnings regarding the safety of an approved drug:
        
          Medication guides. These are printed reports routinely provided to patients by pharmacists for certain medications, intended to reduce serious side effects.
          Prescription drug labeling. This is the package insert that provides detailed information about an individual drug. These often contain a section for patients using nonmedical terminology, though most of the content is in ""medicalese"" and intended for health professionals.
          Drug Safety Communications. These include Public Health Advisories and other updated drug safety alerts.
          Boxed warning. Often called a black box warning, this information appears at the beginning of the package insert and is intended to call attention to serious or life-threatening side effects. That's what was added to the package insert for febuxostat.
          Drug recalls. Although they may come at the request of the FDA, most drug recalls come from drug makers as a voluntary action. They may be permanent or temporary, depending on the problem.
          Drug withdrawals. Even more rarely, evidence comes to light that convinces the FDA that the risk of taking a drug is simply too high when compared to its potential benefits. In these cases, the drug's approval is essentially reversed, and the FDA requires the drug be taken off the market.
        
        (You can find out more about how the FDA monitors the drug approval and post-approval process here.)
        Why aren't safety problems detected before drugs are approved?
        There are a number of reasons, but the biggest one has to do with the difference between clinical trials required prior to a drug's approval and real world usage. A trial may exclude people with heart disease, or who are elderly, or may include only men or only women — but once the drug is approved, men and women, people with heart disease, and older individuals may start taking the medication. New problems may emerge in this expanded group of people that weren't detected before.
        In addition, there's a numbers issue. Clinical trials may include hundreds or even thousands of study subjects, but to detect a small risk it may take tens of thousands of individuals, or even more. For these reasons, post-marketing surveillance plays a major role in ensuring the safety of medications approved by the FDA.
        While the high rates of alerts and warnings may make it seem like the FDA is doing a lousy job of making sure drugs are safe before approving them, there's another way to look at this. The high rate of alerts and warnings could mean that the post-approval monitoring is working to detect previously underappreciated problems and to publicize them.
        Here's where you come in
        If you develop a side effect from a medication you're taking, let your doctor know. You may need to stop taking the drug to avoid more trouble. But you can also report your experience to the FDA's MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program (here or at 800-332-1088). You could be helping to identify an important and previously unrecognized problem with the medication.
        While new drugs can truly be lifesaving, sometimes the latest breakthrough drug turns out to be worse than older treatments or the disease itself. Despite the years of research required to get a drug approved, important risks can be missed. We have to rely on post-market surveillance to detect these risks. You can help.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/feel-woozy-do-this-first,Feel woozy? Do this first,"Your body is signaling distress. Take it seriously and follow these instructions.
        
        
          
        
        Quick, what do you do if a bout of wooziness strikes? Since the symptom can be a sign of either something minor or a more serious problem, you need a plan of action.
        What is wooziness?
        Wooziness is a tricky word. People use it to describe many symptoms, such as feeling mentally unclear or confused; a little weak; lightheaded, like you might faint; unstable, like the world is bobbing around; or even mildly nauseated. And doctors say wooziness can be all of those things. ""But wooziness is not the world spinning around you. That’s vertigo,"" says Dr. Natalia Rost, a Harvard Medical School professor and chief of Stroke Services at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        
          
            
              
                What happens when you call 911?
                When paramedics respond to a complaint of wooziness, they check your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen levels), do a stroke screening, and ask about your medications. If there’s no good explanation for your symptoms, they’ll take you to the local emergency department.
                There, a nurse will ask about your symptoms, probably obtain an ECG to look for signs of a heart rhythm abnormality or heart attack, and start intravenous fluids to ward off dehydration. Then a doctor will evaluate you. ""We need to consider every function in the body because wooziness could be caused by almost anything. We’ll do a neurological exam, look at your medications, and order blood tests to look at electrolytes and see if your sodium or potassium levels are off. Whatever is causing your symptoms, we’ll get to the bottom of it,"" says Dr. Natalia Rost, chief of Stroke Services at Massachusetts General Hospital.
              
            
          
        
        What causes wooziness?
        Wooziness could be a symptom of many conditions, such as the following.
        A sudden drop in blood pressure. If your blood pressure drops — perhaps because you stood up too quickly, or you are dehydrated, or your blood pressure medications were recently increased — your brain may not get enough blood, causing wooziness.
        Low blood sugar. Your brain needs sugar to operate; too little fuel can cause wooziness. People most at risk for low blood sugar are those with diabetes who are taking medicine to lower blood sugar.
        Neuropathy. ""A loss of sensation in your legs [neuropathy] can make you feel unstable,"" Dr. Rost says. ""This is common in people with diabetes.""
        Urinary tract infection. Confusion is a common sign of urinary tract infections in older adults.
        Low blood counts or poor lung function. An underlying condition affecting your lungs or blood cells could keep the brain from getting enough oxygen.
        An inner ear infection. An ear infection typically causes vertigo, but it also can cause balance problems and make you feel unsteady.
        A heart attack. A heart attack can make you feel like you’re going to faint, as well as usually causing chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, arm pain, back pain, or jaw pain.
        Heart failure. When the heart cannot pump blood around the body effectively enough, the reduced blood flow through the brain can cause a sense of unsteadiness.
        Stroke. In a stroke, blood flow to a part of the brain is blocked, and brain cells die. While this can sometimes cause wooziness, ""it’s almost always accompanied by other symptoms, including sudden facial drooping, difficulty speaking, changes in vision, weakness on one side of the body, or difficulty thinking,"" Dr. Rost says.
        Action steps
        If you suddenly feel woozy and you’ve never felt that way before, don’t panic, but also don’t ignore it. Wooziness can be the result of a new condition that needs to be treated immediately. ""If you’ve never experienced wooziness before and it comes on suddenly or severely, you should call 911, especially if it’s accompanied by other symptoms, Dr. Rost advises.""
        On the other hand, if you’ve experienced wooziness before from a chronic condition, or if you’ve been a little under the weather recently, Dr. Rost recommends that you take these steps:
        
          Sit down. You don’t want to fall and suffer an injury.
          Drink a glass of water or juice.
          Rest. Give your body time to absorb the fluid, about 10 or 15 minutes.
          If you start to feel better, call your doctor’s office to report the symptoms. ""But if the feeling of wooziness persists, you get other symptoms, or you can’t get up without feeling like the world is moving or you may pass out, call 911,"" Dr. Rost says.
        
        Note: Don’t avoid medical care out of fear of catching COVID-19 in a medical setting. As we reported in October 2020, those concerns are believed to have kept thousands of people away from hospitals when the pandemic first struck, sometimes with deadly consequences. ""If you need to be seen, be seen,"" Dr. Rost says. ""Just follow the rules the hospital has in place in terms of COVID screening, masks, and distancing.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/prostate-cancer-in-transgender-women-202303242905,Prostate cancer in transgender women,"The transgender population is steadily increasing. Last year, investigators reported that 1.3% of people between the ages of 18 and 24 in the United States identify as transgender, compared to 0.55% of the country's older adults. This trend has implications for public health, and one issue in particular concerns the risk of prostate cancer in transgender women.
        Because removing the prostate can lead to urinary incontinence and other complications, doctors leave the gland in place when initiating hormonal treatments to induce female sex characteristics in transitioning people. This process, which is called feminizing or gender-affirming hormonal therapy (GAHT), relies on medications and surgery to block testosterone, a male sex hormone. Prostate cancer is fueled by testosterone, and therefore GAHT lowers overall risks for the disease. But transgender women can still develop prostate cancer in ways that remain poorly understood, according to the authors of a new paper.
        ""More individuals are openly identifying as transgender, particularly as advances are made in reducing the discrimination and marginalization that this group has faced,"" says Dr. Farnoosh Nik-Ahd, a urologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and the paper's first author. ""Thus, it's important to understand their health outcomes and how best to care for this population.""
        Dr. Nik-Ahd and her colleagues wanted better insights into prostate cancer incidence and screening rates among transgender women, so they performed a comprehensive review of the literature that generated some notable findings. One is that that the prevalence of GAHT in the transgender population is still unknown. Some studies put the figure at roughly one in every 12,000 to 13,000 people who identify as transgender. But this is likely an underestimate, the authors claim, and it's not broken out by sex.
        Questions over GAHT
        Similarly, little is known about the impact of GAHT on the likelihood of developing prostate cancer, the team reported. Prostate cancer rates do appear to be lower among transgender women than they are among cisgender men (men whose gender identify matches their sex at birth). For instance, one study found just a single case of prostate cancer among 2,306 transgender women receiving routine health care at a clinic in Amsterdam, Holland, between 1975 and 2006. Another study, also from Holland, detected six cases of prostate cancer among 2,281 transgender women over 17 years, which again is less than the comparable rate among cisgender men.
        But the interpretation of these rates is limited by the fact that transgender women often experience barriers to care. Nearly a third of them live in poverty, and many avoid the health system for fear of mistreatment. Some scientists suspect that estrogen given during GAHT may somehow contribute to prostate cancer development when given over long durations. However, more confirmatory evidence is needed. Worryingly, one study found that survival among transgender women with prostate cancer is worse than it is in cisgender men with the disease, yet that research lacked data on GAHT use.
        Interpreting PSA values for specific populations
        Dr. Nik-Ahd's team was especially concerned about the lack of guideline recommendations for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the transgender population. None of the available guidelines worldwide mention transgender women, and the PSA cutoff of 4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood — which raises suspicions for prostate cancer — is specific to cisgender men. PSA levels ordinarily plummet in people taking GAHT, so the limit for what's considered normal in transgender women should be capped at 1.0 ng/mL, the researchers propose. In the absence of more specific guidance, they also recommend that people meeting age criteria for PSA screening get tested before starting on GAHT, in order to obtain a baseline value.
        Many doctors are already familiar with other common drugs that alter PSA values — in this case with screening implications for cisgender men, points out Dr. Heidi Rayala, a urologist affiliated with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, and a member of the Harvard Medical School Annual Report on Prostate Diseases editorial board. For instance, PSA values drop by half in men taking finasteride or dutasteride for hair loss (or to shrink an enlarged prostate). ""Doctors take extra care when interpreting PSA in cisgender men who take these drugs,"" she says. ""The same care needs to be taken in interpreting PSA values in transgender women. And there needs to be broader education on this topic for both primary care doctors as well as the transgender community.
        Dr. Nik-Ahd agrees. ""Future research should aim to understand baseline PSA values for those on gender-affirming hormones, and to understand how to navigate some of the psychosocial barriers around PSA screening so as to not stigmatize transgender patients,"" she says.",Charlie Schmidt,"March 24, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/reactive-arthritis-a-to-z,Reactive arthritis,"What is it?
        Reactive arthritis is an uncommon disease that causes inflammation of the joints and, in many cases, other areas, particularly the urinary tract and eyes. It is triggered by an infection, usually by a sexually transmitted organism or by certain gastrointestinal bacteria.
        The most common infection causing reactive arthritis is the sexually transmitted disease (STD) chlamydia. Reactive arthritis can also be caused by gastrointestinal infection from bacteria such as salmonella, shigella, campylobacter or Yersinia, infections that can cause diarrhea and vomiting. These bacteria often are found in contaminated food or water. While these infections are common, reactive arthritis is not. Scientists believe that people who develop reactive arthritis have a certain genetic makeup. Supporting the theory that genetic makeup is a risk factor, about 50% of people with reactive arthritis carry a gene called HLA-B27, compared with 8% of the general population.
        Reactive arthritis is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. In this case, the immune system is jolted into action by the infection but continues attacking after the infection is gone.
        Reactive arthritis typically includes arthritis, eye inflammation (conjunctivitis or uveitis) and inflammation of the urethra (urethritis). However, some people develop only one or two of these. Reactive arthritis is most common in people between the ages of 20 and 40, with a prevalence of about 0.03% (30 per 100,000).
        Symptoms
        Symptoms usually appear within a few weeks after someone has had chlamydia or a diarrheal infection. Most people feel a little tired and have a slight fever, although a few have high fever, significant fatigue and weight loss. Other early symptoms include muscle aches, joint stiffness, and low back pain radiating into the buttocks or thighs. Back discomfort usually gets worse when you sit or lie still and gets better when you move around. Arthritis begins abruptly and usually affects one or several joints, especially the knees, ankles, feet or wrists. People often have pain at the back of an ankle or tenderness on the bottom of a heel (from inflammation at the spot where a tendon attaches to a bone).
        Symptoms vary depending on what other areas of the body are inflamed:
        
          arthritis — Joint pain; swelling; limited motion, especially of the ankles, knees, feet and less commonly of the wrists, fingers or other joints; tendon pain; low back pain; swelling in a finger or toe
          conjunctivitis — Redness near an eyelid with sticky discharge from the eye, especially in the morning (usually mild and temporary)
          uveitis — Redness near the iris of the eye, pain (especially when exposed to light), blurred vision
          urethritis — Painful urination, a discharge from the penis or vagina
          dermatitis — Painless or painful sores in the mouth, a scaly rash on the soles of the feet, inflammation at the tip of the penis.
        
        Other symptoms are rarer, including inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis), bladder (cystitis) or heart lining (pericarditis) and leaking of the aortic valve.
        Diagnosis
        A doctor may suspect you have reactive arthritis when the typical symptoms develop after you had an infection. Your doctor will examine you and will order imaging tests, such as X-rays of the pelvis or lower spine. Your doctor may remove fluid from a painful joint with a needle so it can be examined in a laboratory. Fluid from an inflamed joint will contain a high number of white blood cells but there is no detectable infection in the joint.
        There is no single test that can confirm the diagnosis. Your doctor will diagnose reactive arthritis based on your history of infection, your symptoms and the physical exam. Tests may be done to check for other conditions that can cause joint inflammation, such as an infection or gout.
        Expected duration
        For reasons that are not yet known, reactive arthritis sometimes gets better on its own over a number of months or years. However, it is often chronic (long-lasting) and treatment may be needed long-term, even for a lifetime.
        Prevention
        There is no way to prevent reactive arthritis, but the infections that may trigger it can be prevented. You can help to prevent gastrointestinal infections by properly cooking food and washing your hands thoroughly after contact with animals and before preparing food. You can reduce the risk of STDs by practicing safe sex.
        Treatment
        The choice of treatment for reactive arthritis depends on your specific symptoms. If you still have the infection, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics, usually for seven to 10 days. Some physicians treat chlamydia infections with antibiotics for as long as three months. A limited number of studies have shown that this longer treatment helps to prevent reactive arthritis, but prolonged antibiotic treatment remains controversial. The sexual partners of a person with newly diagnosed chlamydia should also be treated.
        For mild arthritis, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with or without a pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brand names), may be enough. For more severe arthritis, injections of corticosteroids into the inflamed joint can relieve pain, although the relief is often temporary. Other medications that may be helpful include those used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, such as corticosteroids, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine or methotrexate (all available as generics). Injectable medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis may also be used, including adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi), or infliximab (Remicade). Surgery to replace a joint may help severe arthritis that does not respond to medications.
        It's important to balance rest and exercise. Biking and swimming, for example, can help to reduce stiffness and keep the joint moving. Your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist, occupational therapist or podiatrist. Splints, shoe inserts or braces can provide relief in ways that medications cannot.
        For the other manifestations of disease, treatment options include:
        
          corticosteroid cream or ointment for rash; supervision by a dermatologist is important, especially if the rash involves the penis or face
          corticosteroid eye drops, injections, or pills for uveitis
          NSAIDs or other pain relievers for urinary tract inflammation (urethritis).
        
        The care of people with reactive arthritis should be coordinated by their primary care physician with regular monitoring by appropriate specialists, which may include a dermatologist, ophthalmologist, rheumatologist or urologist.
        When to call a professional
        Call your doctor if you have symptoms of reactive arthritis such as joint pain, swelling, limited motion, red or painful eyes, or painful urination. If you notice pain or burning with urination, or a discharge from the penis or vagina, call your doctor right away. Let your doctor know if you have diarrhea that is persistent, bloody or associated with pain.
        Prognosis
        With therapy, the outlook for reactive arthritis is good, although the condition is quite variable. Severe cases may be associated with significant joint damage, vision problems and other disabling manifestations, whereas other cases are much milder and only intermittently bothersome. Risk factors for more severe disease include one or more of the following:
        
          male gender
          venereal infection (rather than intestinal infection)
          sacroiliac or hip joint involvement
          swelling of a finger or toe
          blood tests showing evidence of marked body-wide inflammation
          presence of gene marker, HLA-B27
          poor response to initial therapy.

        Infectious arthritis is joint pain, soreness, stiffness, and swelling caused by an infectious agent such as bacteria, viruses or fungi.
        These infections can enter a joint various ways:
        
          after spreading through the bloodstream from another part of the body, such as the lungs during pneumonia
          through a nearby wound
          after surgery, an injection, or trauma.
        
        Once the infection reaches the joint, it can cause symptoms of joint inflammation that is often accompanied by joint swelling, fever, and chills. Depending on the type of infection, one or more joints may be affected.
        The most common joint affected by bacterial infection is the knee. Small joints, such as those in fingers and toes, are more likely to become infected after a viral infection or after direct injury, such as a bite. In people who use intravenous drugs, joints in the spine or breastbone (sternum) may be involved. People who already have rheumatoid arthritis or another joint disease are more likely to develop infectious arthritis.
        Certain bacteria can cause a form of infectious arthritis called reactive arthritis, which appears to be caused by the immune system reacting to bacteria, rather than by the infection itself. In reactive arthritis, joint inflammation develops weeks or months after the infection. Reactive arthritis happens most commonly after infections of the genital and gastrointestinal tracts.
        Symptoms
        Symptoms of infectious arthritis include:
        
          joint pain and stiffness, typically in the knee, shoulder, ankle, finger, wrist or hip
          warmth and redness around the joint
          fever and shaking chills
          skin rash.
        
        Other symptoms vary, depending on the cause. Some more common causes of infectious arthritis include:
        Lyme disease
        Lyme disease is caused by bacteria that live in deer ticks and are transmitted through a tick bite into a person's bloodstream.
        Because the tick bite often goes unnoticed and the rash may be overlooked, Lyme disease is not always diagnosed immediately. When the infection is not treated, further symptoms may develop, including joint inflammation (most commonly in the knee). Arthritis typically develops in the later stages of Lyme disease.
        Gonorrhea
        Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection that can cause pain in one or more joints or tendons and sometimes a rash and fever. About one-third of people with gonorrhea report joint pain.
        Staphylococcus infection
        Staphylococcus bacteria are common bacteria that can cause infections through cuts or other breaks in the skin, or through contaminated food. The bacteria can be released in the bloodstream and spread to the knee or other joints, causing intense and sudden pain, swelling and immobility of the joint. This is a serious condition because joint damage can develop within days if the infection is not found and treated quickly.
        Tuberculosis
        Tuberculosis is an infection caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium. It usually affects the lungs, but it can affect other parts of the body, including the gastrointestinal tract, nerves, lymph system and skin, as well as bones and joints. Arthritis caused by tuberculosis usually affects either the spine or large joints, such as the hips or knees. The joint inflammation caused by tuberculosis tends to be less dramatic than inflammation caused by some other bacterial infections, and it develops slowly.
        Viruses
        Arthritis can be caused from infection by many viruses, including those that cause colds, upper respiratory infections, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, parvovirus, rubella and mumps. Many joints can be affected at the same time, and the symptoms of viral infectious arthritis can be similar to the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. However, viral arthritis symptoms usually disappear within days or weeks if the disease causing the problem goes away. HIV and some forms of viral hepatitis may cause chronic (long-lasting) infection and longer-lasting joint symptoms.
        Diagnosis
        If your doctor suspects that your joint symptoms are related to a bacterial infection, he or she probably will remove fluid from the affected joint with a needle and will have it analyzed in a lab. You may have blood and urine tests. If your doctor thinks a sexually transmitted disease may be causing the problem, he or she will recommend testing with a vaginal or cervical swab or urine testing if you are a woman, and a swab of the penis or a urine test if you are a man. The urine and swabbed material are sent to be tested in a laboratory. Tests are not available to diagnose most viral diseases. However, some of the more common viral causes of arthritis, such as parvovirus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, can usually be diagnosed with blood tests.
        Expected duration
        How long symptoms last depends on the cause and how soon treatment is started. Symptoms can improve as soon as 24 hours after treatment starts. However, they may continue for weeks or months when related to Lyme disease, many bacterial strains or tuberculosis. If infection damages joints, symptoms may last a lifetime.
        Prevention
        The best way to prevent infectious arthritis varies depending on the type of infection:
        
          Staphylococcal arthritis – If you have a staphylococcal infection, antibiotics can be used to prevent this type of arthritis (for example, prior to surgery). However, for many people, joint pain and swelling are the first signs of the infection.
          Gonococcal arthritis – You can prevent this type of arthritis by preventing gonorrhea. Practice safe sex or don't have sex.
          Lyme disease arthritis – The best way to prevent arthritis from a Lyme infection is to avoid Lyme disease. Wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts, use tick repellent, and avoid woods, brush and other areas where ticks live. If you live in an area where Lyme disease is common, you can prevent Lyme infection by removing an attached tick and taking antibiotics soon after finding an attached or engorged deer tick. Similarly, you can prevent Lyme arthritis by taking antibiotics when the rash of Lyme disease is first observed.
          Tuberculosis-related arthritis – A tuberculosis vaccine may help to prevent tuberculosis and any associated arthritis. However, vaccination for tuberculosis is not routine in many parts of the world, including the United States, and the vaccine is only moderately effective. If you have tuberculosis, antibiotics may prevent joint infection and arthritis. If a blood or skin test shows evidence of exposure to tuberculosis, or if a chest X-ray suggests active tuberculosis, antibiotics may stop the infection from spreading into joints.
          Viral arthritis – The best way to avoid arthritis caused by a viral infection is to avoid getting the infection. Wash your hands after you have been around sick children or other people with a viral infection. Ways to prevent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV include avoiding use of injected drugs, not sharing needles and not having unprotected sex with a person who may be infected.
        
        Treatment
        Because many bacterial infections can quickly and permanently destroy cartilage around joints, a joint infected with bacteria needs to be treated immediately with antibiotics.
        If you have a bacterial infection, you probably will be hospitalized so the infected joint can be drained, you can receive antibiotics intravenously (into a vein) and you can rest the joint.
        In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged tissue from the joint. If serious damage already has occurred, surgery may be needed to reconstruct the joint. Surgery is rarely necessary for arthritis associated with gonorrhea or viral infection.
        Viral infections do not respond to antibiotics and most will go away on their own. However, antiviral therapies are available for some viral infections, such as hepatitis C and HIV. Aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and other brand names) can be taken to alleviate pain and swelling during the time it takes for the infection to go away. Viral infections usually do not cause joint damage.
        Reactive arthritis may be treated with other medicines, but only after the infection has been cured. These medicines include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, methotrexate (Folex, Methotrexate LPF, Rheumatrex) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine).
        While the joint is recovering from the infection, it may need to be immobilized briefly with a brace or splint. As soon as possible, however, exercise and physical therapy are recommended to restore strength and mobility.
        When to call a professional
        If you experience any of the symptoms of infectious arthritis for more than a few days, contact your doctor.
        Prognosis
        If infectious arthritis is detected and treated promptly, joint damage is unlikely. However, joint damage is possible with many types of infections, especially when a bacterial infection is not diagnosed and treated promptly.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/juvenile-arthritis-a-to-z,Juvenile arthritis,"What is it?
        Arthritis involves inflammation of the joints that causes pain and swelling. Although many people believe arthritis is a disease of old age, various forms of arthritis can affect just about anyone at any age. When arthritis occurs in children younger than age 16, it is called juvenile arthritis. According to the Arthritis Foundation, about 300,000 children in the United States have some form of the disease.
        The most common forms of juvenile arthritis are:
        
          Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (formerly called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) – This is the most common form of juvenile arthritis. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is thought to be an autoimmune disease, which means that, for unknown reasons, the body's immune system attacks some of its own tissue the same way it would react against a foreign invader such as a virus or bacteria. In juvenile idiopathic arthritis, the lining of the joint (called synovial membrane) becomes inflamed and enlarged, limiting movement and causing pain and tenderness. Enzymes released by the inflamed membranes cause further damage by eroding the bone and cartilage. This type of joint and bone damage can cause problems in a growing child. If the growth areas of the bones are affected, the bones may grow at different rates so that one bone may develop abnormally in shape or size. The result could be, for example, that one leg might be permanently shorter than the other.
        
        There are several subcategories of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, including:
        
          Systemic arthritis, which begins with a whole-body (systemic) reaction, including high fevers; skin rash on the legs, arms and trunk; joint inflammation; and signs of inflammation of other body organs, such as enlarged lymph nodes or lining of the lungs (pleurisy). A child may have one or more episodes of arthritis that eventually disappears, or the condition may persist into adulthood.
          Oligoarthritis, in which fewer than five joints are affected, is the most common form of juvenile arthritis. The large joints – such as knees, elbows, and ankles – are often affected, but usually not the same joints on both sides of the body. For example, the knee on one side may be affected and the ankle on the other. Symptoms include pain, swelling, stiffness, redness and warmth at the affected joint. Children with this type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are particularly susceptible to an eye inflammation called iridocyclitis. These children need to be evaluated often by an ophthalmologist, perhaps as often as every three months, because there may not be any symptoms and permanent eye damage can occur even if other symptoms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are under control. Treatment for iridocyclitis is highly effective. Many or even most children with pauciarticular onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis will notice that the disease subsides over time.
          Polyarthritis, in which five or more joints are affected, usually involves the small joints, such as those in fingers and toes, although large joints can also be affected. Symptoms include the same inflammatory symptoms as other types of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, along with low-grade fever and bumps called rheumatoid nodules near the affected joints. Typically, the same joints on both sides of the body are affected. Polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is more common in girls than in boys, is usually more severe than the other two types, and often leads to long-term joint problems. In 5% to 10% of cases, the antibody called rheumatoid factor can be detected in a blood test, which further classifies the polyarthritis type of onset as seropositive. Seropositive juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is most like adult rheumatoid arthritis, and often continues into adulthood.  When the rheumatoid factor is negative, it is called seronegative.
          Juvenile psoriatic arthritis – This type of chronic arthritis strikes some children who have psoriasis, and seems to have a genetic component. Along with joint pain and inflammation, key symptoms are pitted fingernails, psoriasis and a raised, scaly rash behind the ears, in the area of the navel, along the scalp or other body areas.
          Enthesitis related arthritis–Often called ""juvenile spondyloarthritis,"" this condition causes inflammation where the tendon joints attaches to the bone, in the joints or in both.   Common sites of inflammation include the sacroiliac joints, Achilles tendons, soles of the feet (plantar fasciitis), knees and shoulders. Morning stiffness and improvement with exercise are typical.   Eye inflammation (uveitis or conjunctivitis) is also common.
          Undifferentiated arthritis –This diagnosis is used when children with arthritis do not fit typical features of the types noted above.
          Reactive arthritis (formerly called Reiter's syndrome) – This type of arthritis can develop weeks to months after exposure to certain bacteria, in particular shigella, salmonella or yersinia associated with diarrhea or genitourinary chlamydial infection, a sexually transmitted disease. The disease usually starts suddenly. Key symptoms are fever along with pain and inflammation in several joints, conjunctivitis (eye inflammation) and painful urination.
          Juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) – Although lupus usually does not appear before adolescence, when it occurs in children it is very similar to lupus in adults. This disease can cause inflammation and tissue damage in many areas of the body, especially the skin, joints, blood vessels, brain, heart, muscles or kidneys. The disease often appears in episodes that come and go without a clear explanation. Key symptoms include a rash on the cheeks, sensitivity to sunlight, mouth or nose sores, joint pain, seizures or other signs of neurological problems, and chest pain.
        
        Symptoms
        Symptoms vary depending on the child and the specific disorder. Common symptoms include:
        
          one or more joints that are persistently swollen and tender, or possibly red and warm to the touch
          pain when moving joints, although many young children never complain of pain
          stiffness or decreased ability to move joints, especially when waking
          limping
          joints that look knobby or deformed
          bent posture or limbs.
        
        Other symptoms can include:
        
          uneven (asymmetric) growth patterns (one leg longer than the other, for example)
          blurry vision, eye pain or redness
          low-grade fever
          skin rash
          fatigue
          irritability
          chest pain
          general complaints of pain.
        
        Diagnosis
        Juvenile arthritis is difficult to diagnose because many diseases have similar symptoms, and there is no single test that pinpoints the diagnosis. If your child shows signs of juvenile arthritis, you likely will be referred to a pediatric rheumatologist. The rheumatologist will look at your child's medical history to find clues. For example, one of the primary diagnostic criteria for juvenile idiopathic arthritis is joint inflammation that has lasted for at least six weeks.
        Your doctor may order blood tests to look for antibodies that commonly form in people with some types of arthritis, although these antibodies are often absent in children. X-rays may be performed to look for damage to cartilage or, in severe cases, bone. Other tests may also be done to look for other conditions that could explain the symptoms, such as tests for infection. Lyme disease is an infectious cause of arthritis that may affect children and mimic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
        Expected duration
        Juvenile arthritis usually is a lifelong condition. However, for many people, symptoms gradually lessen or disappear as they enter adulthood.
        Prevention
        Because no one knows what causes juvenile arthritis, there is no way to prevent it.
        Treatment
        The main goal of treatment is to control inflammation to stop further damage to the joints, and to control symptoms so that the child can function well. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually the first medications tried to relieve joint inflammation. They work by decreasing the amount of an enzyme found in affected joints that promotes inflammation. This same enzyme, however, helps to protect the stomach, so NSAIDs often cause stomach irritation and ulcers. Low doses of NSAIDs are available over-the-counter, including ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and other brand names) and naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve and others). Celecoxib (Celebrex) is a newer prescription drug, called a COX-2 inhibitor that is thought to be safer for the stomach because it does not have as much of an effect on the enzyme that protects the stomach.
        In moderate to severe cases, children with juvenile arthritis may be treated with more powerful medications or a combination of medicines. Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) are fast-acting, anti-inflammatory agents that may be used to stop dangerous inflammation, such as when the lining of the heart has become inflamed (pericarditis) or to stabilize a child in an acute stage of the disease. However, these drugs can have very serious side effects, including weight gain, weakened bones, an increased susceptibility to infections and interference with growth. They usually are prescribed for only a short time. They must be taken exactly as directed.
        Other drugs, called disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) — such as methotrexate (Rheumatrex and others) — act more slowly, but often provide relief if other medications have failed. These drugs can cause liver damage or other complications, so doctors will carefully monitor blood tests in children taking DMARDs. Other medications may be effective, including hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), leflunomide (Arava), azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune). Thalidomide may be effective for certain children with JRA, but care must be taken to avoid pregnancy while taking this drug and it can cause nerve damage.
        Newer, injectable treatments, including adalimumab (Humira), etanercept (Enbrel), abatacept (Orencia) and tocilizumab (Actemra) may be effective for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Infliximab (Remicade), anakinra (Kineret), canakinumab (Ilaris) and rituximab (Rituxan) can also be highly effective for some children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Surgery sometimes is required if joint damage is severe or joint deformity has developed.
        Children with juvenile arthritis should be encouraged to maintain as normal a life as possible. Although there may be pain, exercise is important to help the joints keep moving and functioning well. Once symptoms are under control, it's good for your child to engage in usual play and sports activities. In severe cases, physical therapy may be recommended to keep the joints moving as freely as possible.
        Tutoring or special attention from teachers may be needed if the child misses many weeks of school due to illness. Also, counseling might be recommended to help the child deal with the emotional aspects of having a long-lasting (chronic) illness.
        When to call a professional
        Call a health care professional if a child develops fever or rash along with symptoms of arthritis, such as persistent joint pain, swollen joints, limping and limited motion.
        Prognosis
        Because the symptoms and damage caused by juvenile arthritis can vary greatly, the outlook also varies significantly. Some types of arthritis have periods of flaring up and periods when symptoms subside. Treatment can control symptoms for most people, and some children ""outgrow"" the illness. However, severe forms of the disease can cause growth problems if the growth plates in the long bones are damaged. Children who are very ill also can miss long periods of school, and joint damage can cause long-term joint problems. In addition, the medications used to treat juvenile arthritis can cause other problems, including stomach ulcers, weakened bones and liver damage.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/mindfulness-meditation-to-control-pain,Mindfulness meditation to control pain,"Dealing with pain day in and day out can create a lot of stress on our bodies and minds. Stress reduction expert Jon Kabat-Zinn recommends the body scan mindfulness exercise as the best form of mindfulness meditation for pain conditions.
        Kabat-Zinn advises practicing the exercise every day for 45 minutes, even if it seems boring or doesn't seem to be helping. ""You don't have to like it, you just have to do it,"" he explains in his book, Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness. ""Whether you find the body scan to be very relaxing and interesting or difficult and uncomfortable or exasperating is irrelevant to whether it will serve you well.""
        The goal of the body scan is not to relieve the pain completely, but to get to know it and learn from it so you can manage it.
        You can try the body scan technique by following these simple steps:
        
          Lie on your back or in any comfortable, outstretched position.
          Close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Feel your belly expanding gently when you inhale and receding when you exhale.
          Focus on your left foot. Feel any and all sensations in this area, including pain. Try to recede a little more into the floor every time you exhale.
          When your mind wanders, observe where it has gone and gently return your focus to the foot without judging yourself.
          If you notice pain, acknowledge it and any thoughts or emotions that accompany it, and gently breathe through it. See if by carefully observing the discomfort, you can help your body to relax. Don't expect the pain to abate; just watch it with a mindful but non-judging mind.
          Gradually, let go of the focus on your left foot completely—even if any pain there hasn't gone away or has intensified—and move on to the left ankle and repeat the process.
          Slowly and patiently, proceed this way throughout the body.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-long-covid-affect-the-gut-202303202903,Can long COVID affect the gut?,"Low energy, brain fog, and lung problems are a few of the lingering aftereffects reported by some people who have had COVID-19. Could gut troubles also fall among the constellation of chronic symptoms that people with long-haul COVID experience? And if so, what do experts suggest to help ease this?
        What happens to the gut during a COVID infection?
        As we head into the fourth year since COVID-19 became a global health emergency, hundreds of millions of people around the globe have been infected with the virus that causes it. Since 2020, we've known that the virus particles that cause lung illness also infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract: the esophagus, stomach, small intestines, and colon. This can trigger abdominal pain and diarrhea, which often — but not always — clear up as people recover.
        We know chronic gut problems such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) sometimes occur even after illness caused by microorganisms like Campylobacter and Salmonella are cured. Could this happen with COVID-19?
        What is long COVID?
        While most people who get COVID-19 will survive, medical science is becoming aware of a group of people suffering from lasting declines in health. Well-reported long COVID aftereffects include tiredness, breathing difficulty, heart rhythm changes, and muscle pain. But few people, even in the medical field, are aware that long COVID symptoms may include chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain.
        Why might the gut be involved in long COVID?
        It is not clear why chronic gut symptoms might occur after a COVID-19 infection. One possible insight is a well-known syndrome called post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that may occur after a stomach flu (gastroenteritis).
        Long after the bug causing the illness is gone, a change in gut-brain signaling may occur. A complex network of nerves connects the gut and the brain, and controls communication between different parts of the gut. These nerves tell body organs to produce digestive juices, alert you to the need to go to the bathroom, or prevent you from having another serving of stuffing at the Thanksgiving table.
        The nerve network of the gut is so complicated that it is sometimes called the second brain. When the nerves are working well, you won't notice a thing: you eat without pain, you move your bowels with ease, you have no GI worries. But what if the nerves are not working well? Then, even if the process of digestion remains normal, you may frequently have symptoms like pain or a distressing change in your bowel movements, such as diarrhea or constipation.
        Once known as functional GI disorders, these health problems are now called disordered gut-brain interactions (DGBIs). When viruses and bacteria infect the gut, experts believe they may prompt a change in gut-brain signaling that can cause a DGBI like IBS to develop.
        What to do if you're noticing long-lasting gut problems after COVID-19 infection
        We still do not know conclusively if COVID-19 can cause a long-term change in gut-brain messaging that leads to IBS or other disordered gut-brain interactions. But increasing evidence suggests that GI distress lasting six months or longer might be a symptom of long COVID. While we wait for more evidence, some GI specialists, including myself, recommend trying approaches that help relieve irritable bowel syndrome and other DGBIs.
        If you are suffering from chronic abdominal pain and a change in your bowel movements after having had COVID-19, talk to your primary care doctor. Many health conditions have similar symptoms, including viral or bacterial infections, inflammation, or even cancers. A thorough exam can help to rule out certain conditions.
        If the problem persists, do not suffer alone or feel embarrassed to act! Seek help if severe pain or changes in bowel movements are harming your quality of life or affecting daily activities. Talk with your doctor about the possibility that your chronic gut symptoms might be a form of long COVID. Find out if they can recommend helpful treatments or suggest a referral to a GI specialist. As research continues, new information may be available.","Christopher D. Vélez, MD","March 20, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/back-x-rays-spine-x-rays-a-to-z,Back x-rays (spine x-rays),"What is the test?
        Doctors have used x-rays for over a century to see inside the body in order to diagnose a variety of problems, including cancer, fractures, and pneumonia. During this test, you usually stand in front of a photographic plate while a machine sends x-rays, a type of radiation, through your body. Originally, a photograph of internal structures was produced on film; nowadays, the image created by the x-rays goes directly into a computer. Dense structures, such as bone, appear white on the x-ray films because they absorb many of the x-ray beams and block them from reaching the plate. Hollow body parts, such as lungs, appear dark because x-rays pass through them.
        Doctors use back x-rays to examine the vertebrae in the spine for fractures, arthritis, or spine deformities such as scoliosis, as well as for signs of infection or cancer. X-rays can be taken separately for the three areas of the spine: the cervical spine (neck), thoracic spine (middle back), and lumbar spine (lower back). Occasionally, doctors x-ray the pelvis to help diagnose the cause of back pain.
        How do I prepare for the test?
        You have to remove all clothing, undergarments, and jewelry from your upper body. You may be asked to wear a hospital gown.
        What happens when the test is performed?
        You either stand or lie down while a technician takes the x-rays. He or she positions you against the photographic plate (which looks like a large board) to get the clearest pictures. A front view and a side view are usually taken.
        For cervical spine x-rays, the technician tells you to open your mouth as wide as you can before taking some of the pictures; this is done to avoid having your teeth block the view of the bones at the top of your spine.
        The technician leaves the room or stands behind a screen while controlling the x-ray camera. To avoid a blurred image, he or she tells you to remain as still as possible, including holding your breath, before taking each picture.
        What risks are there from the test?
        The amount of radiation from x-ray tests is too small to be likely to cause any harm. However, if you're pregnant, talk to your doctor. Radiation may be harmful to a developing fetus.
        Must I do anything special after the test is over?
        No.
        How long is it before the result of the test is known?
        Although digital images are often available immediately, it may take additional time for a doctor to examine them. You'll probably get the results later in the day.",Unknown,"March 20, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/slowing-down-racing-thoughts-202303132901,Slowing down racing thoughts,"Everyone has moments when their brain suddenly goes haywire. They repeatedly fixate on the same thought, like being stuck on a hamster wheel. Or their thoughts aimlessly bounce from one random topic to the next like a pinball.
        People often refer to these thought patterns as racing thoughts, and the most common cause is anxiety, says Fairlee Fabrett, PhD, a psychologist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        ""People who struggle with racing thoughts are constantly worried about what needs to be done, what hasn't been done, and what is next,"" says Fabrett. ""Or they obsess about past, present, or future situations."" For example, you replay a conversation with different versions of dialogue, ruminate about an upcoming meeting with your boss or medical appointment, or worry about an unlikely doomsday scenario.
        ""When racing thoughts take over your mind you can't stay focused, and you feel trapped, which makes you even more anxious and stressed, and the cycle continues,"" says Fabrett.
        Breaking the cycle of anxiety and racing thoughts
        How can you break this cycle and keep racing thoughts from controlling you? Here are five strategies to try.
        Give yourself permission
        Racing thoughts are often made worse by the anxiety over having racing thoughts. To escape this, give yourself permission to experience them. ""Acknowledge that racing thoughts are just noise, it is what our minds sometimes do, and that's okay,"" says Fabrett. ""This gives you a sense of control so you don't feel helpless. When you put racing thoughts in their proper context, they feel less threatening and easier to manage.""
        Get mindful
        Practicing mindfulness can help change your thought patterns. For instance, try counting your breaths. Close your eyes and count to yourself as you take slow, steady breaths: count one on the inhale, two on the exhale, etc. When you reach 10, start over and repeat the process until you calm down. ""This is also a great remedy before sleep when most people's minds begin to ruminate,"" says Fabrett. Also, practice this breath work at times when your thoughts are not racing, so you will have the skill when you need it.
        Distract yourself
        You can sometimes break the cycle by distracting your mind. ""As soon as you notice yourself worrying again or thinking about things over and over, make an internal comment to yourself, like 'here I go again, with my list of thoughts that never ends,"" says Fabrett. Then make a conscious decision to do something else, like reading, listening to music, or calling a friend.
        Get moving
        It sounds like token health advice — exercise more — but movement is helpful for defusing anxiety. For instance, when an episode of racing thoughts strikes, do a set of push-ups, 10 jumping jacks, take a five-minute walk, or do household chores. ""These not only help break the cycle of racing thoughts but give your mind something else to focus on,"" says Fabrett. Also, try to build regular exercise into your life as well as these short bursts of activity. That can help relieve anxiety and stress.
        Schedule worry time
        Sometimes it's best to let racing thoughts run their course; otherwise, they may linger indefinitely. To do this, schedule worry time. When anxious racing thoughts occur, recognize them, but tell yourself that now is not worry time and you will deal with them later. Then at a fixed time of your choosing, do nothing but explore those thoughts and work through them. For example, write down the thoughts that come to mind without editing, including all the worst-case scenarios you can think of.
        ""You can also talk about them aloud and ask what makes you nervous and why,"" says Fabrett. ""This allows you to confront your anxiety head-on, but on your schedule without taking away from other activities,"" says Fabrett. Set a limit to worry time, like 10 to 20 minutes. When the time is up, you move on.
        If racing thoughts regularly affect your life or interfere with sleep, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. ""Frequent racing thoughts may be related to anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), trauma, or other mental health issues that need exploring,"" says Fabrett.",Matthew Solan,"March 13, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-electrical-brain-stimulation-boost-attention-memory-and-more-202303032898,"Can electrical brain stimulation boost attention, memory, and more?","Imagine this as a morning routine that replaces your first cup of coffee:
        You wake up feeling a bit foggy, so you slip on a wearable device that looks like an extra-thick headband. You turn on the power source and settle in while electrical current flows into your brain. Twenty minutes later, feeling more focused and energized, you start your busy day feeling grateful for this new technology.
        If this scenario sounds strange to you, I'm with you. And yet, hype around transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is growing for an expanding list of conditions such as depression, ADHD, and even Alzheimer's disease. A recent ad for one tDCS device urges you to ""elevate your performance."" But before you give this a try, read on.
        What is transcranial direct current stimulation?
        Brain stimulation therapies aim to activate or inhibit parts of the brain. tDCS has been around for years, but its popularity has spiked over the last decade.
        tDCS devices use headgear that may look like a swim cap or headband to position electrodes against the scalp. When a power source is switched on, the electrodes deliver low levels of electrical current to the brain. A typical session lasts 20 to 30 minutes and may be repeated over days or weeks.
        Three better-known brain stimulation therapies are:
        
          Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): A device worn over the forehead stimulates specific areas of the brain by changing nearby magnetic fields. TMS is cleared by the FDA to treat depression that hasn't responded to standard medicines, and for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
          Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): An electric current flowing through electrodes placed at specific locations on the scalp causes a brief seizure while a patient is under anesthesia. In use since the late 1930s, ECT can be highly effective for severe depression that hasn't responded to standard therapies. It uses higher levels of electrical current than tDCS. That's why it requires close medical supervision and is generally administered in a hospital or specialized clinic.
          Deep brain stimulation (DBS): Electrodes surgically implanted in specific areas of the brain generate electrical pulses. DBS is used to treat conditions such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, or tremors that don't improve with medicines.
        
        What claims are made for tDCS?
        The brain normally functions by sending and receiving tiny electrical signals between nerve cells. Stimulating specific regions of the brain with low levels of electricity might improve focus or memory, mood, or even dementia, according to tDCS advocates.
        Some claims say tDCS can
        
          improve mental clarity, focus, and memory
          increase energy and motivation
          relieve so-called brain fog following COVID-19, Lyme disease, or other conditions
          reduce depression or anxiety
          reduce cravings among smokers or people with drug addiction
          improve symptoms of ADHD or Alzheimer's disease.
        
        Does tDCS work?
        The jury is still out. Research suggests that tDCS holds promise for certain conditions, but techniques tested through research may differ from devices sold commercially for at-home use. For example, electrodes may be positioned more precisely over an area of the brain, and how current is delivered, session length, or number of sessions may differ.
        Currently, small, short-term studies show that tDCS may benefit people with:
        
          Depression: An analysis of 10 randomized trials found some participants were more likely to report fewer symptoms of depression, or remission of depression, after a course of tDCS treatment compared with sham treatment.
          Alzheimer's disease: A review of seven studies found that tDCS lasting 20 to 40 minutes improved memory and other cognitive measures in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
          ADHD: One randomized trial of 64 adults with ADHD found improved attention after 30 minutes of tDCS daily for a month.
        
        The FDA has not cleared tDCS for any health condition, and it is considered investigational. More research with positive results and reassuring safety data are needed before tDCS gets a thumbs-up from regulators.
        That's probably why some ads for tDCS note in fine print that it is not a medical device and is only for recreational use.
        Does tDCS have downsides?
        While the FDA assesses tDCS as safe for adults, there are downsides to consider. For example, treatment may cause itching, irritation, or small burns at the sites of the electrodes. Some users complain of fatigue or headache.
        There are no large, long-term studies of tDCS, so overall safety is uncertain. Some experts believe at-home use raises many questions, such as how much of the brain beyond targeted areas is affected, what inconsistent approaches to tDCS use might do, and how long changes in the brain — intended or not — could last.
        Very limited research has been done in children. So, the consequences for a child's developing brain aren't clear.
        Finally, tDCS devices can be expensive (several hundred dollars or more), and generally are not covered by health insurance.
        The bottom line
        It's not yet clear how tDCS should be used, or who is most likely to benefit from it. If you're interested in pursuing tDCS, understand that there's still a lot we don't know.
        If you're more skeptical and risk-averse (like me), you may want to wait for more definitive research regarding its benefits and risks — and for now, stick with your morning coffee to clear your mind.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/shingles-linked-with-higher-risk-for-heart-disease-and-stroke,Shingles linked with higher risk for heart disease and stroke,"People who've had shingles have a higher long-term risk of developing a major cardiovascular problem, a large new analysis suggests.
        The Harvard-led study, published online Nov. 16, 2022, by the Journal of the American Heart Association, tracked more than 200,000 American adults — none of whom had ever had a stroke or coronary artery disease — for up to 16 years. Using questionnaires, researchers collected information on shingles, stroke, and heart disease among participants every two years, confirming any diagnoses with medical records. Those who'd had shingles (a reactivation of the same virus that causes chickenpox) had a higher risk of a stroke or coronary artery disease compared with participants who had not had shingles. The elevated risk for stroke persisted for 12 years or longer after the shingles episode.
        Much of the study's data was collected before shingles vaccines became widely available. But even after that point, many people eligible for the vaccine — who include adults 50 and older — do not receive it, study authors said. They recommended getting vaccinated against shingles to lower the chances of developing not just the painful rash, but also the possible long-term cardiovascular effects.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/short-on-slumber,Short on slumber,"If you use an alarm clock to wake up, it's a good bet you're sleep deprived. But what if you feel fine when that buzzer, bell, or blast of music rouses you? You're probably still not getting all the sleep you need — the fundamental definition of sleep deprivation — or you wouldn't have required the jolt. You would have woken up by yourself already.
        ""You can keep eating when you're not hungry, but you can't keep sleeping if you're not tired,"" says Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night, according to the National Sleep Foundation, but more than 35% of American adults report consistently sleeping less than seven hours. Moreover, nearly half of Americans say they feel sleepy during the day between three and seven days a week — meaning they're likely not getting enough nighttime rest. Women have particular problems with getting sufficient sleep, regardless of how much time we spend in bed; our lifetime risk of insomnia (difficulty falling or staying asleep) is up to 40% higher than that of men.
        And things are only getting worse. ""When we examine the data that tell us how much people have been sleeping over the last century, it's clear we're sleeping less and less,"" says Dr. Ina Djonlagic, a neurologist at the Sleep Disorders Center at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Being short on slumber can make us dopey, sluggish, cranky, and forgetful. But consistently getting less sleep than we need can lead to serious health problems that go far beyond a day's bad mood. ""Sleep deprivation affects basically everything,"" Dr. Klerman says.
        Reasons for poor sleep
        Why aren't many of us sleeping enough? Some reasons are habit-based and therefore controllable. Often, Harvard experts say, we simply don't set aside enough time for sleep and allow work or other commitments to intrude.
        ""For some parents, bedtime is finally their 'me' time when they start to watch movies and do things they enjoy at the expense of sleep,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. ""And it's not just bedtime procrastination; some people get up really early to go to the gym to have time for themselves.""
        Some also carry a misguided sense of pride in not ""needing"" sleep, boasting about how little they get — as if it's a virtue. ""It's almost like a competition, and there's certainly this idea that if you sleep a lot you're a bit lazy and less productive,"" Dr. Djonlagic says.
        But some contributors to a lack of shuteye are indeed out of our control, making sound sleep an unattainable dream. They include
        
          pregnancy
          menopause-related night sweats
          certain medications
          sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome
          ailments such as chronic pain, cancer, depression, or dementia.
        
        Threats to health and safety
        Whatever the cause, skipping shut-eye can be disastrous. ""The immediate effect of sleep deprivation is a lack of alertness that can translate into more accidents in cars and other situations,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. About one in 25 adults falls asleep at the wheel each month, according to the CDC, while 6,000 fatal car crashes per year are due to drowsy driving.
        And a new analysis provides eye-popping insight into how our health can suffer for decades to come. Published online Oct. 18, 2022, by the journal PLOS Medicine, the study showed that healthy 50-year-olds who sleep five hours or less each weeknight have a 30% higher risk of developing two or more chronic health conditions over the next 25 years compared with peers who sleep seven hours. By age 70, that risk climbs to 40% in those with the same scanty sleep pattern.
        The study tracked nearly 8,000 British people from 1985 to 2016, none of whom had multiple chronic diseases at the start. A quarter-century later, researchers observed far higher risks of multiple conditions such as diabetes, cancer, coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney or liver disease, depression, dementia, Parkinson's disease, and arthritis in those who logged five hours of sleep or less.
        Other recent research has zeroed in on sleep deprivation's effects on specific conditions. A study published online Nov. 2, 2022, by The Science of Diabetes Self-Management and Care suggests that people who report trouble sleeping are likelier to have markers—including higher cholesterol, greater body weight, and more inflammation—that contribute to diabetes. The study involved more than 1,000 Australian adults (average age 45).
        There's also a higher risk of obesity among people averaging less than seven hours of sleep each night, according to a 2018 study in the journal BMJ Open Sport and Exercise Medicine. ""Hunger hormones are involved, but when we're tired or sleepy we gravitate more to foods that give us energy, such as carbohydrates,"" Dr. Djonlagic says.
        Our brains suffer, too. A study published in the November 2022 issue of Sleep that tracked more than 26,000 people ages 45 through 85 over three years showed those with insomnia faced greater risks of memory decline and dementia. ""We know there's a link between sleep and our ability to flush out brain toxins, such as amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. ""Sleep deprivation may also speed up the process for those destined to develop the disease.""
        Don't despair if you tend to operate on a sleep deficit. It might not be too late to turn around any deprivation-driven health trends, Dr. Klerman says. ""I want to believe if you start getting more sleep now, your body will begin repairing all the things that happened when you didn't sleep enough,"" she says.
        Tactics for sounder sleep
        Sleep feels good, so deciding to get more should theoretically be easy. But many of us don't cultivate the environment and set of habits known as sleep hygiene that promote sounder slumber. To accomplish that, Harvard experts offer these tips.
        Keep a consistent schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. But if there are nights you haven't slept enough before rising for school or work, it's okay to allow yourself to sleep longer on mornings when that's possible, Dr. Klerman says.
        Exercise earlier in the day. For some, exercising too close to bedtime can keep them up or fuel insomnia.
        Ease into sleep. ""We're good at helping little children do this by reading books and taking warm baths, but it's helpful for adults too,"" says Dr. Djonlagic. ""Light and stimulation are the biggest enemies to getting to sleep on time. Put everything aside and read a book in dim light or do something relaxing.""
        Use your bed for only two things. ""You should associate your bed with sleep or sex, not paying the bills,"" Dr. Klerman says.
        Ramp down caffeine use. This stimulant has a half-life of five hours in most adults, meaning your body will eliminate about half the caffeine you've consumed in that time, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. It's wise to avoid it after lunchtime.
        
          
            
              
                Why do we sleep?
                If sleep isn't a biological necessity, it's the biggest mistake evolution ever made. So said Allan Rechtschaffen, a pioneer of modern sleep research. His musings make sense, since by sleeping we spend about one-third of our lives inert, not reproducing or being productive in any other way.
                So why do we sleep? Scientists don't yet fully know the answer. But they do know that while we lie quiet, our brain and body are busy. Research has shown that this period of seeming inactivity serves to fine-tune physiological fundamentals such as metabolism, immune function, and more. We also process memories and wake feeling ready to focus on the day ahead.
                ""We think sleep serves multiple purposes,"" says Dr. Ina Djonlagic, a neurologist at the Sleep Disorders Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""It's almost like your body is processing things on a deeper level.""
              
            
          
        
        Skip the nightcap. Alcohol's sedative effects help us fall asleep quickly — but that effect wears off later in the night, making us more likely to toss and turn. More than one alcoholic drink each day lowers sleep quality in women by nearly 40%, according to the National Sleep Foundation.
        Put away devices. Blue light from cellphones, tablets, and computers can interfere with our circadian rhythm, the internal body clock that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Blue light–filtering glasses can help stem these effects, as can built-in filters available on some devices. Better yet, avoid using electronic devices for an hour or longer before bedtime.
        Let natural light in. Don't use blackout shades in your bedroom, Dr. Klerman advises. ""If you want to stay in sync with the world, you want the morning light to help you wake up,"" she says. Room-darkening shades can be helpful for people with chronic insomnia, however.
        Avoid using sleep aids for more than a night or two. It's tempting to take sleeping pills, but they carry major risks—especially as we age and are more prone to falls. They should only be used for a specific short-term reason (such as problems sleeping after a stressful event). Taken for longer, sleep aids tend to lose effectiveness within a few weeks and can backfire, disrupting sleep. People with chronic sleep problems can try a form of cognitive behavioral therapy that's geared toward insomnia (called CBT-i), ""which has been shown to work better than drugs,"" Dr. Klerman says.
        Another proactive step: try tracking your vacation sleep habits — the amount of shut-eye you log when you're not working for a week or two and are unencumbered by normal routines. ""That's usually how much sleep you actually need,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. ""Unfortunately, few people will make it a priority to get that amount during normal times.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/anxiety-overload,Anxiety overload,"The emotional signs of anxiety — nervousness, restlessness, distraction, a clenched jaw — almost always occur in tandem with physical symptoms such as dry mouth, nausea, or sweaty hands, which can then magnify our anxious feelings. When anxiety crosses a line, however — unique to each individual — everyday stressors can translate into disruptive physical symptoms that make it difficult to live normally.
        Profound anxiety can provoke everything from dizziness and diarrhea to heart-pounding panic that leaves you gasping for breath. ""If you're feeling lightheaded, your heart racing and chest tightening, it really contributes to a sense that something terrible is going to happen,"" says Jacqueline Bullis, an assistant psychologist in the Division of Depression and Anxiety Disorders at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        ""But physical symptoms themselves aren't the problem,"" Bullis says. ""It's really the way we respond to them. We want people to learn that these distressing physical sensations aren't dangerous and they can learn ways to tolerate them.""
        Hitting the panic button
        Anxiety in itself can prove useful under the right circumstances — spurring us, for example, to make sure we're prepared for that big presentation at work. ""When it's at that Goldilocks spot where it's not too intense or too suppressed, anxiety motivates us,"" Bullis says. ""If we were never anxious, we wouldn't get anything done.""
        Extreme physical sensations, however, stem from the body's fight-or-flight response. In those moments, we might react the same way to a perceived threat — like public speaking — as we would to real danger, such as a home intruder. During an anxiety attack, symptoms can turn so dramatic that people believe they're having a heart attack or stroke.
        ""People having severe anxiety attacks almost universally feel they're about to die,"" says Dr. Arthur Barsky, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""They experience it as an impending medical emergency rather than anxiety, which is going to worry them even more. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.""
        You should always seek a doctor's advice for any potentially dangerous symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, to make sure anxiety is indeed the root cause. But once that's established, your next task is learning how to respond in situations you know will hit your panic button. Many people will avoid common scenarios and retreat from potentially unpleasant interactions to stop anxiety before it starts — but limit their lives in the process. This is the wrong approach, Harvard experts say.
        CBT: The gold standard
        What's the best path to overcome severe anxiety? Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered the gold standard, effective in many cases. Often, people wait too long — even decades — only to be astonished how quickly they can gain control of symptoms using CBT, Bullis says. Results typically take four to six months.
        A form of CBT called exposure therapy engages you in activities designed to provoke uncomfortable physical sensations, causing you to become breathless or feel momentarily panicked. ""We're going to be confronting things you've gotten good at avoiding,"" Bullis says. ""The more you do it, the more used to it you get. It's kind of like a vaccine — by repeatedly and deliberately exposing yourself to these scary physical sensations, you can reduce the impact they have on you in the real world.""
        Short-acting medications, such as beta blockers or benzodiazepines, can be used for situational anxiety to calm extreme physical reactions. But ""the problem with these medications is they may reinforce the idea that these symptoms are dangerous,"" Bullis says. ""And many people don't like being reliant on something to help them cope.""
        A combination of therapies may be needed for severe cases. Bullis recommends seeking a therapist trained in CBT and asking what approaches he or she would use in your treatment. For help locating a skilled therapist, use online search tools provided by the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (www.abct.org; look for the ""Find a CBT therapist"" button) and the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (www.adaa.org, under the ""Find help"" tab).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-wont-my-hives-go-away,Why won't my hives go away?,"Q.
          I've gotten hives from time to time when I've been overly stressed. But now I have a case that won't quit after six weeks. What's going on?
        
        A. No one welcomes these red, itchy welts that crop up on our skin. Many things can lead to a temporary case of hives, including allergic reactions to food, medications, bug bites, pollen, latex, or animal dander. Like you, some people also develop them when they're stressed, or in response to ultraviolet light or excess skin pressure. Hives are more common in women than men, especially from our 30s to 50s.
        Most cases of hives go away within several days to a couple of weeks. If they last six weeks or longer, you may have autoimmune hives. This happens when your immune system mistakenly targets healthy tissue — in this case, triggering a skin reaction. Autoimmune hives are more common in people with other autoimmune conditions, such as lupus, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or celiac disease. Anyone whose hives last longer than a few weeks should see a doctor.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/try-this-take-a-seat,Try this: Take a seat,"Meditation can lower blood pressure, reduce stress, and improve concentration. But where to begin? Here is a simple meditation to get you going. Try it every other day for five to 10 minutes. and build toward a daily practice:
        
          Sit quietly in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take a full, deep breath, hold it briefly, and then exhale completely. Repeat several times until you reach a steady, calm breathing pattern.
          Relax all your muscles in sequence, beginning with your feet, lower legs, and thighs. Shrug your shoulders and roll your neck to the left and then right.
          Then on each exhalation, say to yourself or out loud the word ""peace,"" ""love,"" or any other short, positive mantra.
          Don't get discouraged when your thoughts wander (they will). Go back to the pattern of repeating the mantra each time you exhale.
        
        You can also practice brief meditation throughout your day. For example:
        Be mindful during chores. Focus your complete attention on doing routine tasks.
        Do walking meditation. Match your footsteps to your inhalations and exhalations. For example, take four steps as you inhale and four steps as you exhale.
        Take a moment. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths before starting your car or heading into a store.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/a-closer-look-at-good-cholesterol,A closer look at good cholesterol,"Managing blood cholesterol levels is one way to avoid cardiovascular disease and protect against heart attacks and strokes. Doctors concentrate on helping men lower their blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol. Too much LDL in the bloodstream can create plaque buildup inside arteries. If this buildup blocks blood flow to the heart or brain, the result is a heart attack or stroke.
        Your goal level for LDL depends on your risk factor profile. In general, the lower the number, the better. If you already have cardiovascular disease or are at high risk for it, you should aim for an LDL of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). For people at average risk, achieving a level of less than 100 mg/dL with lifestyle changes is excellent. You and your doctor can decide if you need a statin or other medication to lower your LDL further.
        But what about LDL's cholesterol counterpart, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the ""good"" cholesterol?
        ""HDL tends to get lost in the cholesterol conversation, but it plays a vital role in heart health, so it's important to also monitor HDL while you manage LDL,"" says Dr. Frank Sacks, professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        When is good HDL too good?
        HDL is considered ""good"" because it does the good work. It patrols blood vessels, collects excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and artery walls, and delivers it to the liver, where it's removed from the body. This ongoing action prevents dangerous plaque buildup. Guidelines recommend an HDL level of 40 mg/dL to 60 mg/dL for adult men. ""A level below 40 mg/dL could mean that there is not enough HDL to do its job properly,"" says Dr. Sacks.
        Since HDL is deemed ""good,"" it would make sense that higher amounts equal extra protection. But research has found that this is not necessarily true, and that HDL levels beyond 80 mg/dL don't offer additional benefits.
        Higher HDL might not always be effective because it needs help to do its job. Research suggests that HDL's protective role depends partly on the levels of LDL and triglycerides (a type of blood fat that helps make up your lipid profile). One study that looked at people with both low and high HDL levels and those with normal and high levels of LDL and triglycerides discovered that for optimal protection against cardiovascular disease, there needs to be healthy levels for all three.
        
          
            
              
                Do you need advanced lipid testing?
                Doctors use lipid panels to measure cholesterol levels, screen people for cardiovascular disease risk, and monitor treatments. Yet, sometimes more detailed cholesterol information is needed. This requires advanced lipid testing to measure apolipoprotein B (apoB), the main protein in LDL. Research has suggested that higher amounts of apoB can signal greater risk.
                But not everyone needs this test. ""For the average person with high LDL or total cholesterol, the additional details won't materially alter their diagnosis or treatment,"" says Dr. Frank Sacks, professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. However, specific individuals may benefit, he adds. These include people who've had a recent stroke or heart attack without any apparent risk factors, such as high LDL, high blood pressure, diabetes, or smoking, and men diagnosed with cardiovascular disease before age 55.
              
            
          
        
        On the rise
        A standard blood test called a lipid panel measures a person's total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. Specific individuals may benefit from advanced lipid testing (see ""Do you need advanced lipid testing?""). The results help assess cardiovascular disease risk and dictate if treatment is needed.
        Addressing high LDL is always the first priority, but if you have concerningly low HDL levels — less than 40 mg/dL — your doctor likely will recommend lifestyle changes, according to Dr. Sacks. ""While a person's HDL level is predominantly determined by genetics, certain habits can cause HDL levels to drop,"" he says. Here are some strategies that people with low HDL should adopt.
        Exercise more. Moderate-intensity exercise, like brisk walking for at least 30 minutes three times a week, can help boost HDL. High-intensity interval training also can help.
        Lose weight. If overweight, aim to lose 5% to 10% of your current weight.
        Cut back on refined carbohydrates. Switch from refined carbohydrates (white bread, white pasta) to whole grains (oats, whole-wheat pasta, brown rice) and add lean protein to your diet, like poultry, tofu, beans, and lentils.
        Limit alcohol. Keep your intake, if any, to one to two drinks daily.
        Stop smoking. If needed, seek out medical assistance to quit.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-dark-side-of-daylight-saving-time,The dark side of daylight saving time,"On March 12, most Americans will observe the start of daylight saving time (DST) and ""spring forward"" by setting their clocks one hour ahead. (The exceptions are people living in Arizona and Hawaii.)
        DST lasts from mid-March until early November when the clocks turn back an hour and return to standard time. During DST, people can enjoy more time in the sunlight in the evenings. But that convenience comes at a price.
        ""That one-hour change may not seem like much, but it can wreak havoc on people's mental and physical well-being in the short term,"" says Dr. Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School's Division of Sleep Medicine.
        Go toward the light
        Research suggests that changing our clocks twice a year can have various health consequences. Of the two, springing ahead one hour tends to be more disruptive. That hour change can upset our circadian rhythms, the body's natural 24-hour cycles regulating key functions like appetite, mood, and sleep.
        Circadian rhythms largely depend on light exposure. The hour transition in the spring initially causes darker mornings and lighter evenings. Less morning light can decrease levels of the mood-boosting hormone serotonin. In contrast, exposure to light later in the evening can delay the production of melatonin, the hormone that helps you fall asleep.
        Many people also have trouble adjusting their sleep schedule to the new time. For the first few days or even a week, they may go to bed later or wake up earlier than usual, which can cause sleep deprivation. One study found that the average person gets 40 minutes less sleep on the Monday after DST begins compared with other nights of the year.
        ""Disrupted sleep can cause people to feel fatigued, groggy, and less focused,"" says Dr. Czeisler. This may explain, in part, the 6% rise in car accidents following the spring time change, according to a 2020 study in the journal Current Biology. Poor sleep caused by DST also can exacerbate existing problems like depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder.
        
          
            
              
                Is the end of daylight saving near?
                Present-day daylight saving time (DST) was officially adopted in 1966. Proponents believe the semiannual time change means people can enjoy outdoor activities longer, save energy by using less electricity for lighting, and perhaps have a positive economic impact.
                But DST has its critics. A 2022 poll found that 61% of Americans favored ending DST. Also, many sleep experts say evidence strongly suggests that staying on standard time all year is healthier. A bill to eliminate the time change has been introduced in the past three Congressional sessions but has not yet made it into law. It remains to be seen whether legislators will reintroduce it.
              
            
          
        
        Prepare for the switch
        People can take steps to make the hour change less daunting to their bodies and mind. Dr. Czeisler offers several different approaches:
        Alter your bedtime. About three days before the time change, go to bed and wake up 10 to 15 minutes earlier than usual. The next night, aim for 20 to 30 minutes, and then 30 to 45 minutes on the third night. ""By the end of this period, your body would have adjusted to that lost hour, and you won't have the stress of trying to quickly catch up on sleep,"" says Dr. Czeisler.
        Take afternoon naps. If you feel tired in the afternoons after DST starts, take scheduled midday naps for 20 to 30 minutes (napping longer than that can make you feel even more groggy).
        Get more light. During the first week after the time change, try to get about 15 minutes of exposure to morning light, which can help maintain your circadian rhythms. Another option is to use a light box that produces a bright white light. Choose a light box with 10,000 lux exposure (lux is a measure of light intensity). Sit about 12 inches away for up to 30 minutes. Keep your eyes open, but don't look directly at the light. Spend the time reading, writing, or just being present.
        Delay your day. For several days after the time change, postpone beginning your daily routine for an hour. For example, if you go for your morning walk at 8 a.m., wait until 9 a.m. ""Your internal clock is still running an hour behind, so you give it a chance to adjust,"" says Dr. Czeisler. Gradually shorten your start time by 10 or 15 minutes; within a week, your body's clock should be reset to the new time.
        Curb the alcohol and caffeine. Cut back on drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages several days before and after the time change, as they can disrupt your sleep.

A large analysis published online Dec. 5, 2022, by JAMA Neurology suggests the devices might play a role in protecting your thinking abilities. Scientists reviewed dozens of randomized controlled trials and observational studies that looked at the cognitive effects of hearing aids or cochlear implants (implanted devices that translate sounds into electrical signals and transmit them to the brain). The research involved more than 137,000 people who were followed from two to 25 years, depending on the study. Compared with people who didn't use the devices, people who did use them had a 19% lower risk of cognitive decline. Using the devices was also tied to a 3% improvement in cognitive test scores. Scientists say there could be many reasons for the associations. For example, it could be that hearing aids help people take part in conversations, staving off social isolation, which is associated with dementia. And since hearing aids are more accessible and affordable than ever, it might be time to consider getting a device if you notice a change in your hearing.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/watch-out-for-bogus-supplement-claims,Watch out for bogus supplement claims,"When it comes to supplements, it's crucial to keep your guard up, especially if a manufacturer claims the product can cure, treat, or prevent a chronic health condition. The FDA regularly polices such statements. In November 2022, for example, the FDA called out seven supplement companies for illegally claiming their products could treat or prevent cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis or heart failure. Warning letters were issued to Essential Elements (Scale Media Inc.); Calroy Health Sciences; Iwi; BergaMet North America; Healthy Trends Worldwide (Golden After 50); Chambers' Apothecary; and Anabolic Laboratories. The companies then had two weeks to respond to the FDA and begin correcting legal violations or fight the accusations. Unlike with conventional pharmaceutical drugs, the FDA does not evaluate supplements for safety or effectiveness, nor monitor how they are manufactured. So you can't be sure about a supplement's ingredients or strength, like you can with a conventional drug. Also, supplements can interact with medications you're taking and cause side effects. That's why it's important to talk to your doctor before taking any supplement: call the office or bring supplement information to your next visit.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/harvard-study-shingles-linked-to-a-spike-in-risks-for-heart-attack-and-stroke,Harvard study: Shingles linked to a spike in risks for heart attack and stroke,"If you had chickenpox as a kid — and most people in the United States over age 50 did — then you're at risk for shingles. It's a painful reactivation of the chickenpox bug (the varicella-zoster virus) that has been dormant and hiding in your nerve cells. It can move through the nerves to the surface of the skin, causing painful blisters and potentially long-lasting pain. And here's something else that shingles might leave you with, according to a Harvard study: greater risks for heart attack and stroke. The research, published Dec. 6, 2022, in the Journal of the American Heart Association, came from three large studies involving more than 200,000 men and women who answered questions about their health. Researchers combed through the information and compared it to participants' medical records over 16 years. People who'd had shingles at some point had a 30% higher long-term risk for a major cardiovascular event, compared with people who didn't have shingles. The study was observational and doesn't prove that having shingles causes heart attack or stroke. But it's a good reminder to get the shingles vaccine (Shingrix) if you haven't already. It's given in two doses, two to six months apart, and it's 90% effective. It's recommended for adults ages 50 or older.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/tips-to-cope-with-medical-test-anxiety,Tips to cope with medical test anxiety,"It's normal to be apprehensive about having a medical test, particularly one that can cause discomfort or pose some other risk. Even a simple blood test involves a moment of discomfort. Some people faint at the sight of the approaching needle; this intense fear of needles is called trypanophobia, and it leads some people to avoid blood tests, medication infusions, or vaccinations.
        Some people worry about getting other medical tests, such as x-rays and CT scans, because they involve exposure to radiation. And being moved into the cramped confines of an MRI machine can spark panic for someone with claustrophobia (fear of being inside an enclosed space).
        People with a different phobia, called latrophobia, are afraid to see a doctor, even a doctor they know and like. For others, a medical exam can feel like an invasion of your privacy, and some parts of the physical examination may be uncomfortable. Perhaps most of all, people fear the visit to the doctor will bring bad news.
        Fortunately, there are ways to cope with these anxieties, and important reasons why you should.
        Sources of anxiety
        The source of medical test anxiety depends on the test and what you think you'll experience. Here are examples.
        Pain and discomfort. ""Needles hurt, and a lot of procedures are uncomfortable or unpleasant. Past experience with the procedure can also activate traumatic memories,"" says Justin Gillis, a clinical therapist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        Bad news revealed in a test. Even if we're not worried about discomfort from a test, we can be very worried about the test result bringing bad news. So we can be tempted to avoid having the test: no test, no bad news.
        Test complications. Exposure to harmful levels of radiation, reactions to contrast dye in imaging tests, or a punctured colon during a colonoscopy are real risks; they're just very small. In ordering these tests, doctors have weighed the benefit from the information provided by the test against the very small risks.
        Consequences
        Avoiding medical tests or doctor visits can have serious repercussions. ""If you put off testing, you might not find out about problems that we can catch early and get under control. If you wait, the condition can worsen to the point where it's hard to treat,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, associate chief of gerontology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""For example, problems with memory are not always signs of impending dementia that you can do little about. Sometimes, they're signs of an easily curable condition such as B12 deficiency or a low thyroid. But the only way to know is to get the tests,"" Dr. Salamon says.
        In some cases, putting off tests can be a matter of life or death. ""I had a patient who was at increased risk of breast cancer who would not get regular mammograms, despite my urging. Then we discovered a very large lump in her breast. She died late last year,"" Dr. Salamon says.
        What you can do
        To decide if skipping a test is a bigger problem than getting it, talk it over with a loved one or doctor, and try the following.
        Change your perspective. ""Avoiding a test won't change the possibility that there might be a health problem. And if there is a problem, knowing that as soon as possible will give you more treatment options, and possibly a cure,"" Gillis says.
        Arm yourself with information. Talk to your doctor to get more information about a test and its risks. Or do some research on trusted websites such as Harvard Health Publishing or the National Library of Medicine.
        Make the test more comfortable. Tell your provider about your concerns. ""We can prescribe medication to numb the skin before a shot,"" Dr. Salamon says, ""or we can prescribe a tranquilizer to ease the fear of an imaging test such as a mammogram."" If you're claustrophobic, ask for an ""open"" MRI, which takes place in a machine that is open on the sides (unlike a standard MRI).
        Coping in the moment
        To better cope when you're getting a test, use these strategies.
        Bring a buddy with you. The buddy can hold your hand and comfort you during the experience.
        Try relaxation exercises. Do some deep breathing. Or focus on a happy experience: How did things look, taste, smell, or sound?
        Look away from the needle. You'll focus on pain if you watch the needle go into your arm. Instead, look away and try to distract yourself.
        Focus on something fun. ""Have something arranged that you can look forward to after the test, like watching a new movie,"" Gillis says. ""It will help you get through the experience and provide a nice reward afterward.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/over-the-counter-hearing-aids-what-we-know-so-far,Over-the-counter hearing aids: What we know so far,"After years of anticipation, FDA-regulated over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids are finally showing up online and in stores. About a dozen of the gadgets have made it to market, and more are expected. Here's what we know about OTC hearing aids at this point, and what to keep in mind if you're interested in buying a pair.
        They're hassle-free
        Unlike the process of getting prescription hearing aids, you don't have to go to a doctor or an audiologist for OTC hearing aids. That means you don't need a formal hearing evaluation, fittings, or a prescription for the devices. You can just buy a pair at your convenience and use them as soon as you open the package.
        There are two types of OTC hearing aids
        Some OTC hearing aids are ""self-fitting,"" meaning that device settings can be programmed to suit the user's hearing needs. ""You'll know it's self-fitting if the product description talks about putting the device in your ear and completing a hearing test, either online at the manufacturer's website or on an app, so you can adjust the controls and fine-tune the devices,"" says Meaghan Reed, director of Clinical Audiology at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        Other OTC hearing aids are not self-fitting. They come with volume control and a few predetermined settings.
        The FDA regulates them
        The new OTC hearing aid category requires manufacturers to register the devices with the FDA and follow specific regulations.
        For self-fitting devices, manufacturers must demonstrate to the FDA that the hearing aids have been tested and shown to be safe (with volume control and output limits, for example) and effective for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. Packaging must explain who might benefit from the devices and when it makes sense to see a doctor for hearing loss. These hearing aids can use the words ""FDA cleared"" on packaging and ads.
        Non-self-fitting OTC hearing aids must be registered with the FDA, but device makers are not required to demonstrate that the devices are safe. The registration is essentially a claim that the device meets FDA standards.
        They're still pricey
        ""OTC hearing aids start at about $500 to $1,000 per pair. Self-fitting devices are more expensive. Both types cost less than the bundled price of prescription hearing aids, which start at $4,000 per pair and include the services of an audiologist for a few years,"" Reed says. ""But $500 is still costly. It's our hope that we'll see more technology emerge and drive down prices.""
        They're not right for everyone
        OTC hearing aids are meant for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. ""It's someone who typically does well in a one-on-one conversation in a quiet environment, but can't hear well with background noise, at a distance, or in a lecture hall,"" Reed says. ""They need amplification, and the ability to tune out unwanted noises. If you have more challenging hearing loss issues, you should see your doctor.""
        Their styles and features vary
        OTC hearing aids have different styles and features, depending on the particular model you buy. For example, some OTC hearing aids look like wireless earbuds. Others look like prescription hearing aids, with a piece that sits behind the ear and a little wire and speaker that sits in the ear canal.
        Some OTC devices have directional microphones and noise canceling features. Some are Bluetooth compatible and can stream to your smartphone.
        Buying them requires homework
        Although it's easier to obtain OTC hearing aids than prescription hearing aids, it's still a sizable investment. You'll want to do research before buying them. Some organizations, such as the National Council on Aging (/ncoa-hear), compare device models for consumers.
        Get a model with the fit, features, and price you want. If you're not sure, you may be able to talk to the seller about it. If it's a drugstore, for example, ask the pharmacist for guidance. If it's an online dealer, there may be a customer service line you can call. You can even make an appointment with a local audiologist to get advice.
        One important consideration is your ability to operate the hearing aids. Are you good with technology? Would you like to make all of the adjustments? Would you prefer having preset functions that make it easier to operate?
        Whatever model you're considering, make sure it has two particular features. ""One is a customer service department, so you can talk to someone if you're having trouble fitting the devices or if they aren't working at some point. The other is a trial period. You need to be able to try them out and return them if they're not right,"" Reed advises. ""Remember, we're still in the early stages of OTC hearing aids. We don't know yet which devices will work best and which companies will be around the longest. But if you have the means and you'd like to give the devices a try now, they do have benefits.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/spot-the-warning-signs-of-4-dangerous-conditions,Spot the warning signs of 4 dangerous conditions,"We rarely think life-threatening conditions, like a heart attack, can happen to us. And we tend to miss signs that such conditions are brewing. ""You think, 'I'm too young' or 'too healthy' for it to be true, and you can ignore important symptoms,"" says Dr. Emily Lau, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Protect yourself by learning the warning signs of the following conditions, and taking action if you recognize them.
        1. Heart attack
        A heart attack occurs when something blocks blood flow to a part of the heart muscle. It can be fatal. The typical symptom is extreme pain or pressure in the middle of the chest. Chest pain that comes and goes, especially with exertion, is one early warning sign. But other symptoms also can be warning signs, such as new shortness of breath; fatigue; nausea or vomiting; or sudden pain in the abdomen, back, jaw, or shoulder, even without chest pain. ""Women are more likely to have these other symptoms in addition to chest pain, but men can also have them,"" Dr. Lau says.
        How can you tell it's a heart attack and not something else? Ask yourself two questions: is the symptom new, and is it recurring or not going away? ""For example, if you could walk up a flight of stairs yesterday without any issues, and now the same level of activity is very hard for you, then something is wrong,"" Dr. Lau says. Or if you experience a pain in your abdomen, back, jaw, or shoulder when you exert yourself, especially if it recurs or isn't going away, contact your doctor promptly.
        2. Stroke
        A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked or a blood vessel in the brain bursts. It can be fatal. A major stroke can cause sudden difficulty speaking or understanding someone, numbness or weakness on one side of the body, blurry vision, dizziness, or a severe headache. Any one of those warrants an immediate call to 911.
        In some cases, the first warning of an impending major stroke might be a ministroke (transient ischemic attack, or TIA). It has the same symptoms as a major stroke, but they last only briefly and are easy to brush off. For example, you might lose vision in one eye for a minute, and maybe think it's because you were looking at your smartphone screen too long. But a TIA is often the harbinger of a bigger stroke. The symptom may go away, but the next episode could cause permanent damage. ""If a stroke symptom of any kind occurs suddenly, even if it goes away, call your doctor's office immediately,"" Dr. Lau says.
        3. Atrial fibrillation
        Atrial fibrillation (afib) is the name for rapid, abnormal contractions of the heart's upper chambers (the atria). Instead of squeezing in concert, the atria quiver, which can make the blood inside them pool and form clots. The clots then can travel to the brain, heart, or other parts of the body and cause life-threatening damage.
        Many people with afib don't have any symptoms. ""But you might detect afib if you experience palpitations — a feeling that your heart is beating unusually rapidly or irregularly, even when you're resting. You might also feel faint or experience sudden fatigue,"" Dr. Lau says. ""And some people recognize it by wearing smart watches that track heart rhythms. The technology isn't perfect, but it is pretty good at recognizing afib.""
        If you suspect you're having afib symptoms, write down how often they occur, and when, and see your doctor as soon as possible.
        4. Pulmonary embolism
        A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot forms in a leg, then travels upward and lodges in a lung. The clot can reduce your body's supply of oxygen-rich blood and damage the lung. Sometimes it's fatal: ""It can cause blood to back up in the heart, and even cause your heart to stop,"" Dr. Lau says.
        The main symptoms of a pulmonary embolism — extreme fatigue and shortness of breath, chest pain, or passing out — will probably get your attention. But you might not connect other symptoms to a pulmonary embolism. For example, it can cause flu-like symptoms such as a cough, fever, dizziness, wheezing, or heart palpitations. If you have blood clots in the deep leg veins (called deep-vein thrombosis, or DVT), you might have pain, swelling, or redness in one leg. ""If you're not sure if you have symptoms, think of your risk factors. Have you been sitting for long periods? Are you on a medication that can cause clotting? Do you have a family history of DVT? All of these can cause blood clots in the legs. If you have both suspicious symptoms and these risk factors, call your doctor promptly,"" Dr. Lau says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/stopping-unneeded-aspirin-may-prevent-dangerous-bleeding,Stopping unneeded aspirin may prevent dangerous bleeding,"Many people who take the clot-preventing drug warfarin (Coumadin) may also take aspirin, despite not having a clear reason to do so. A new study suggests that if doctors identify these people and take them off aspirin, it may prevent dangerous bleeding.
        The study included more than 6,700 people who were taking warfarin to treat blood clots in the veins (venous thromboembolism) or prevent clots from atrial fibrillation, along with low-dose aspirin. Researchers then asked the participants' primary care doctors to review whether their patients had a specific reason for taking aspirin and if not, to discuss stopping it. Aspirin raises the risk of bleeding, especially when taken with warfarin. So current guidelines recommend low-dose aspirin for only certain people — mainly those who've already had a heart attack.
        Among the people who didn't need it, aspirin use dropped by about 47%. During the two-year study, the risk of bleeding complications went down by about 32% among those who stopped aspirin. The findings, published Sept. 1, 2022, in JAMA Network Open, reinforce the importance of talking with your doctor about whether you should start or stop taking low-dose aspirin.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heavy-metals-found-in-popular-brands-of-dark-chocolate,Heavy metals found in popular brands of dark chocolate,"Because dark chocolate is a rich source of beneficial plant compounds called flavanols, it's often touted as a heart-healthy treat. However, many popular brands of dark chocolate contain potentially worrisome levels of lead and cadmium, according to a study by Consumer Reports published in December 2022.
        Consistent, long-term exposure to even low levels of either of these heavy metals has been linked to various health problems, including cardiovascular disease. Researchers used California's maximum allowable dose levels for lead (0.5 micrograms, or mcg) and cadmium (4.1 mcg) to gauge the risk posed by dark chocolate. For 23 of the 28 chocolate bars they tested, eating just an ounce per day would put an adult over the maximum dose for at least one of the heavy metals. Five bars contained levels over the limit for both lead and cadmium.
        Chocolate, which is made from seeds of the cacao tree, can be contaminated with cadmium and lead by polluted soil — not only as the crop grows but also during harvesting and processing. You can limit your exposure by choosing dark chocolate brands that Consumer Reports deemed as safer options (see /darkchoc) or simply enjoy it occasionally rather than frequently.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/telehealth-for-your-heart,Telehealth for your heart,"Seeing and speaking with a doctor via smartphone, tablet, or computer from the comfort of your own home became commonplace during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past year or so, in-person health care visits have rebounded. But video visits and other forms of telehealth can still be a good option for treating people with heart disease, according to a scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA), published Dec. 20, 2022, in Circulation.
        ""What we're seeing now is an increase of blended care that includes a combination of in-person and virtual visits,"" says cardiologist Dr. Ami Bhatt, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief innovation officer for the American College of Cardiology. Health care systems that established infrastructure to integrate virtual health care into their practices have had the most success with a hybrid model. For both patients and clinicians, it's important to pay attention to specific needs, preferences, and comfort level with different types of care, she says.
        Types of telehealth
        Telehealth can be delivered in any of three ways:
        
          synchronous — when the doctor communicates with the patient in real time via phone or an Internet-connected device
          asynchronous — when information is exchanged between doctors and patients but not in real time, similar to e-mail communication
          remote monitoring — when measurements such as weight, blood pressure, or a simple electrocardiogram (ECG) are sent to the clinician through wirelessly connected devices.
        
        Even before the pandemic, most medical practices already had Internet-based portals that people used to make appointments and receive test results. These portals often serve as the gateway to synchronous visits, which are ideally suited for much of the care needed by people who have or are at risk for heart disease.
        For example, doctors often review information from various measurements or tests you've done at home (such as weight, blood pressure, and blood sugar readings) or from a lab (a cholesterol test) and then discuss any lifestyle or medication changes you can make to better manage your condition. Many studies have shown that telehealth care can lead to significant improvements in heart-related risk factors, especially lowering blood pressure, as the AHA statement notes.
        Currently, async=""async""hronous communication between doctors and patients tends to originate from the medical practice and usually includes things like questionnaires or reminders about screenings or tests. But if people shared information through a portal prior to a virtual visit, that would leave more time for discussion, Dr. Bhatt says.
        Remote monitoring
        For people with heart failure, a smart scale that wirelessly transmits data can flag small weight increases that may signal the need for medication adjustments. Other options for monitoring include smart watches or other devices that track your heart rate and check for heart rhythm abnormalities with a simple ECG, which you can then pass on to your physician. But while doctors are becoming comfortable prescribing these digital tools, they're not a smart choice for everyone. ""These days, there's a lot of health-related anxiety, and overmeasuring can contribute to this problem,"" says Dr. Bhatt. Make sure you understand when, why, and how often self-monitoring makes sense for you, she advises.
        
          
            
              
                Make the most of your virtual health care visit
                Your doctor's office will give you instructions about the software program you need for your computer, tablet, or smartphone. You'll also need a reliable Internet connection. Here are some additional tips:
                
                  Make sure your device is charged or plugged in.
                  Set up your device in a private, quiet room, ideally with a light source that illuminates your face.
                  Angle the camera so the doctor can see you well. If you're using a smartphone, prop it up so you're not holding it in your hand.
                  Log on to your appointment five to 10 minutes early to leave time to troubleshoot any connection issues.
                  Have a phone available as a backup in case the video doesn't work.
                  Otherwise, prepare as you would for an in-person visit, including having a list of questions and a pen and paper to take notes.
                
              
            
          
        
        The right blend
        People with heart disease who need routine check-ins often appreciate the convenience of virtual visits, which eliminate travel and waiting time. ""But there are times that sitting together in the same room is best, even when you don't need a physical exam,"" says Dr. Bhatt. Finding the right blend of telehealth and in-person care is the future we're slowly moving toward, she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/addressing-language-challenges-after-a-stroke,Addressing language challenges after a stroke,"Last November, John Fetterman won the election for the open U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania just six months after experiencing a stroke that left him with auditory processing issues. During interviews and debates, Fetterman used closed captioning, one of several technologies that can help people cope with language-based disorders, known collectively as aphasia.
        Aphasia — which can range from mild to severe — may affect just one or several aspects of language processing, including speaking, understanding, reading, and writing (see ""Types of aphasia""). Although different types of brain injuries and conditions can cause aphasia, stroke is the most common. Of the nearly 800,000 people in the United States who have a stroke each year, around 30% will experience aphasia.
        But through a process called neuroplasticity, the brain has the ability to rewire brain cells (neurons) and recover lost function, says Dr. Randie Black-Schaffer, chief of the Division of Stroke and Neurology in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of Harvard Medical School. ""Neuroplasticity is greatest in the first several months after a stroke. But people who've had a stroke who keep working on their language processing problems can continue to improve for years,"" she says.
        
          
            
              
                Types of aphasia
                
                  
                
                Aphasia results from injury to specific parts of the brain responsible for expressing and understanding language. Most often, an ischemic stroke (the type caused by a blood clot) in the left side of the brain is to blame. The location of the clot and the extent of the resulting damage dictates the type and severity of aphasia a person has. There are three main types:
                Expressive aphasia (A). Also known as Broca's aphasia, this comes from damage in a part of the frontal lobe. This area is in charge of arranging words in sentences and translating meaning into sounds. People understand what others are saying and know what they want to say, but they struggle to get the words out.
                Receptive aphasia (B). Also called Wernicke's aphasia, this results from damage in part of the temporal lobe that connects information about word meanings with the speech output centers in Broca's area. People can often speak fluently but don't always make sense, and they also have difficulty understanding what others are saying.
                Global aphasia. This type of aphasia occurs when a stroke causes extensive damage in both the front and back regions of the left half of the brain.
              
            
          
        
        Speech and language therapy
        Many rehabilitation centers have comprehensive aphasia programs that are designed to treat people a year or more after a stroke. In one-on-one sessions with a speech-language pathologist, people practice repeating words, naming things and people, and reading and writing. A framework known as the life participation approach to aphasia uses a variety of methods, techniques, and tools to help people more fully engage in their lives, says speech-language pathologist Lynne Brady Wagner, associate director of the Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Stroke Wellness Institute. ""One example is having a note, either on a wallet card or your smartphone, that includes basic information about your specific limitations and ways people can help — for example, speaking slowly and using gestures,"" says Brady Wagner. The closed captioning Fetterman used can help with forms of receptive aphasia, while people with expressive aphasia might use a speech-generating device.
        Telerehabilitation and other resources
        Health insurance usually covers only a limited number of post-stroke language rehabilitation sessions, so people pay out-of-pocket for extended therapy. During the COVID-19 epidemic, many sessions shifted to virtual visits, says Dr. Black-Schaffer. If these online visits can continue, it would be a huge boon, especially for people who don't live close to a rehabilitation center or whose strokes have left them with mobility problems, she adds.
        People with aphasia may also be able to take advantage of other options, such as local in-person or online community support groups. Many colleges and universities have accredited speech and language programs. ""Those with on-site graduate student clinics can provide continued interactive therapy for people with aphasia, which are provided either pro bono or on a sliding fee scale,"" says Brady Wagner. Finally, people can also use specialized apps designed to help people practice language skills. The National Aphasia Association (www.aphasia.org) provides a list of these apps (look under the ""Resources"" tab) in addition to other useful information.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-new-diabetes-drugs-your-best-shot-for-weight-loss,The new diabetes drugs: Your best shot for weight loss?,"A weekly injection that leads to dramatic weight loss without serious side effects almost sounds too good to be true. But several drugs originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes can help people shed as much as 20% of their body weight — far more than other anti-obesity drugs. Known as incretin mimetics, they also improve blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
        Not surprisingly, these medications are in high demand, especially semaglutide (for a list of these drugs and their brand names, see ""Diabetes and anti-obesity drugs""). This has led to shortages of certain formulations. That's just one of the issues faced by people hoping to take these drugs, which are costly — around $1,000 to $1,500 per month — and not covered by Medicare for obesity (although some private insurers cover them). Who's a good candidate for these medications, and what else should people know about them?
        
          
            
              
                Diabetes and anti-obesity drugs
                Poisonous lizards known as Gila monsters have a unique ability to maintain steady blood sugar levels even after long stretches of not eating. Venom from this colorful creature inspired the development of exenatide (Byetta), the first in a class of drugs known as incretin mimetics.
                Today, there are more effective drugs that mimic an incretin called GLP-1. These injectable drugs include dulaglutide (Trulicity), liraglutide (Victoza), and semaglutide (Ozempic); the latter is also available as a pill called Rybelsus. Liraglutide and semaglutide are also approved for weight loss, in formulations marketed respectively as Saxenda and Wegovy.
                The newest addition to this drug family combines GLP-1 and another incretin mimic, GIP. Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) was approved for treating type 2 diabetes in May 2022 and tagged for accelerated review for approval to treat obesity, which is anticipated sometime in 2023.
              
            
          
        
        Overlapping risks
        Up to half of all new-onset diabetes cases in this country are linked to obesity, a disease that now affects more than 40% of Americans. Both conditions are closely linked to cardiovascular disease. ""Many cardiologists now recognize that treating obesity is the best way to treat heart disease,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, who co-directs the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Other anti-obesity drugs help people lose only about 5% to 8% of their body weight. But the incretin mimics, which are similar to hormones made naturally by the gut and brain, have multiple effects. They prod the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar rises too high, slow down the emptying of the stomach, and target brain receptors involved in reducing appetite.
        The newest ones, tirzepatide and semaglutide, can lead to remarkable weight loss and also lower HbA1c levels (a three-month average measure of blood sugar) by as much as two percentage points. ""Studies also show that semaglutide and liraglutide, an older drug, can lower the risk of serious cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack and stroke, in people with obesity and diabetes,"" says Dr. Apovian. A large trial to see whether semaglutide lowers heart-related risks in people without diabetes who are overweight or obese is currently under way, she adds.
        Who might consider these drugs?
        People with diabetes who are carrying excess weight are good candidates for semaglutide or tirzepatide, especially those at high risk for heart disease, Dr. Apovian says. For people without diabetes, the official criteria for prescribing the drugs are the same as for all other anti-obesity drugs: a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, or a BMI of 27 or higher and at least one weight-related health problem, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. (See the calculator at /bmi-calculator to estimate your BMI.)
        Taking these drugs involves injecting yourself in the abdomen or thigh using a penlike device with a tiny needle the size of a human hair. Side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, and constipation are common. But they rarely last longer than a week or so, especially if you start low and increase the dosage slowly while guided by an experienced physician, says Dr. Apovian.
        If you stop taking the drug, you'll likely regain weight. But that's similar to what would happen if you were taking blood pressure medication and stopped — your blood pressure would rise. ""Obesity is a disease, and we need to treat it like one,"" says Dr. Apovian.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/exercising-when-you-have-a-heart-condition,Exercising when you have a heart condition,"You just discovered you need surgery to replace a faulty heart valve. Or maybe you've had a heart attack, or were recently diagnosed with mild heart failure. Learning that you have heart disease is understandably upsetting. But don't let fear or worry keep you from taking steps to heal and strengthen your heart.
        ""For a lot of people, a heart attack is a wake-up call. But for others, it's more like a red light,"" says Dr. Hicham Skali, associate director of the cardiac rehabilitation program at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Instead of starting or renewing efforts to exercise, they stop or avoid physical activity. ""Some people believe that a heart condition means they should be careful and rest, but that's a major misconception,"" says Dr. Skali.
        Exercise is one of the most important things you can do to prevent all types of heart disease from getting worse — not to mention avoiding heart problems in the first place. ""As long as you're exercising safely, there's far more benefit than risk,"" says Dr. Skali. Your age, current fitness level, and diagnosis will influence what makes the most sense for you. But everyone can exercise, and even small amounts can make a difference, he adds.
        Cardiac rehab
        Many people with heart disease qualify for cardiac rehabilitation. The initial evaluation includes an exercise stress test, a closely monitored workout done on a treadmill or stationary bike that shows how your heart and body respond to exertion. The results can help your rehab team offer safe, effective suggestions for physical activity.
        Unfortunately, not everyone who qualifies for cardiac rehab has easy access to such a program, which typically requires you to attend a few times a week for several months. However, a hybrid program that includes some online sessions may be available (see ""A virtual approach to healing the heart"" in the October 2022 Heart Letter).
        Another option is to ask your cardiac surgeon, cardiologist, or primary care doctor to prescribe an exercise stress test, which can be reassuring for people who are worried about exercising, says Dr. Skali. If you're generally healthy, your doctor might decide that you don't need a stress test and can go ahead and start exercising on your own.
        After a procedure
        After any procedure, wait until your doctor gives you the green light to start exercising. After an angioplasty (a minimally invasive procedure to widen a narrowed or blocked heart artery), you can usually resume your normal activities after two days. If you had the procedure to treat a heart attack, you might need to take it easy for a bit longer. People often need a month or more to fully recover from open heart surgery, which requires sawing through the breastbone. But that doesn't mean avoiding exercise as you heal. In fact, a small study found that starting cardiac rehab just two weeks after surgery was just as effective and likely as safe as waiting for six weeks, says Dr. Skali.
        The good news is that people often have more energy and endurance after their heart is repaired. Take it easy at first, starting ""low and slow,"" especially if exercise hasn't been part of your regular routine, says Dr. Skali. Walking outside or on a treadmill for just five minutes at a time several times a day is a good way to start. Keep adding a few minutes to your walks every week or so, until you're up to at least 20 minutes a day. Pay attention to how you're feeling, and add intensity by walking briskly (or even jogging) for short bouts if that feels okay.
        Rest as needed
        Even people who've never exercised and have several serious health problems can still exercise. ""I have patients with heart failure and obesity who tell me they can't walk for more than one minute,"" Dr. Skali says.
        His advice: Put a chair at each end of your driveway or whatever short distance you can manage. Walk back and forth between the chairs, sitting down to rest when needed to catch your breath. Try to do four laps in the morning, and then another four laps in the afternoon. ""Even just 30 seconds at a time is enough to make progress,"" he says. And no matter what your fitness level, always stop or slow down if you feel dizzy, weak, or breathless.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/shift-work-can-harm-sleep-and-health-what-helps-202302282896,Shift work can harm sleep and health: What helps?,"We can feel groggy when our sleep schedule is thrown off even just a little. So what happens when shift work requires people to regularly stay awake through the night and sleep during the day — and how can they protect their health and well-being?
        What is shift work disorder?
        Mounting evidence, including several new studies, paints a worrisome picture of the potential health fallout of nontraditional shift work schedules that affect 15% to 30% of workers in the US and Europe, including factory and warehouse workers, police officers, nurses, and other first responders.
        So-called shift work disorder mainly strikes people who work the overnight or early morning shift, or who rotate their shifts, says Eric Zhou, an assistant professor in the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. It is characterized by significant problems falling and staying asleep, or sleeping when desired. That's because shift work disrupts the body's normal alignment with the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle called the circadian rhythm.
        ""People who work 9-to-5 shifts are typically awake when the sun is up, which is aligned with their body's internal circadian clock. But for shift workers, their work hours and sleep hours are misaligned with the natural cues to be awake or asleep,"" Zhou says. ""They're working against the universe's natural inclinations — not just their body's.""
        What's the connection between shift work and health?
        A 2022 research review in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine links shift work to higher risks for serious health problems, such as heart attack and diabetes. This research suggests adverse effects can include metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that raises the risks for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke), accidents, and certain types of cancer.
        ""The research is consistent and powerful,"" Zhou says. ""Working and sleeping during hours misaligned with natural light for extended periods of time is not likely to be healthy for you.""
        How do new studies on shift work boost our understanding?
        New research continues to add to and strengthen earlier findings, teasing out specific health effects that could stem from shift work.
        
          Shift workers on rotating schedules eat more erratically and frequently than day workers, snack more at night, and consume fewer healthier foods with potentially more calories, a study published online in Advances in Nutrition suggests. This analysis reviewed 31 prior studies involving more than 18,000 participants, comparing workers' average food intake over 24 hours.
          Disrupting the circadian rhythm through shift work appears to increase the odds of colorectal cancer, a malignancy with strong ties to lifestyle factors, according to a 2023 review of multiple studies published online in the Journal of Investigative Medicine. Contributors to this higher risk may include exposure to artificial light at night, along with complex genetic and hormonal interactions, study authors said.
        
        ""Cancer understandably scares people, and the World Health Organization recognizes that shift work is a probable carcinogen,"" Zhou says. ""The combination of chronically insufficient and poor-quality sleep is likely to get under the skin. That said, we don't fully understand how this happens.""
        How can you protect your sleep — and your health?
        If you work overnight or early morning shifts, how can you ensure you sleep more soundly and restfully? Zhou offers these evidence-based tips.
        Time your exposure to bright and dim light. Graveyard shift workers whose work schedule runs from midnight through 8 a.m., for example, should reduce their light exposure as much as possible after leaving work if they intend to go right to sleep once they return home. ""These measures could take the form of wearing blue light–blocking glasses or using blackout shades in your bedroom,"" he says.
        Make enough time for sleep on days off. ""This is often harder than it sounds, because you'll want to see your family and friends during nonwork hours,"" Zhou says. ""You need to truly protect your opportunity for sleep.""
        Maintain a consistent shift work schedule. ""Also, try to minimize the consecutive number of days you spend working challenging shifts,"" he says.
        Talk to your employer. Perhaps your boss can schedule you for fewer overnight shifts. ""You can also ask your doctor to make a case for you to be moved off these shifts or have more flexibility,"" Zhou says.
        Look for practical solutions that allow you to get more restful sleep. ""People engaged in shift work usually have responsibilities to their job as well as their family members, who often operate under a more typical 9-to-5 schedule,"" he notes. ""The goal is to preserve as strong a circadian rhythm as possible under the abnormal schedule shift work requires.""",Maureen Salamon,"February 28, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/parents-dont-always-realize-that-their-teen-is-suicidal-201902132897,Parents don't always realize that their teen is suicidal,"Parents like to think that they know what is going on with their children — and that they would know if their teen was suicidal. However, research shows that this is not always the case.
        Teens may consider suicide more often than parents realize
        In a study published a few years ago in the journal Pediatrics, researchers interviewed more than 5,000 adolescents ages 11 to 17. In those interviews, they asked them if they had ever thought about killing themselves — or if they had ever thought a lot about death or dying. The teens' parents were asked if they believed that their teens had ever thought about killing themselves, or had thought a lot about death or dying.
        There wasn't a whole lot of match-up. Half of the parents of the adolescents who thought of killing themselves were unaware — as were three-quarters of the parents of adolescents who thought often about death.
        This disconnect looms larger as research shows mental health problems are on the rise in youth. According to the 2021 Youth Risk Behavioral Survey, 42% of high school students reported persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness; 22% seriously considered suicide, and 10% attempted it.
        The numbers were higher for girls and youth who identify as LGBTQ+:
        
          Almost 60% of girls experienced persistent sadness and hopelessness; 30% seriously considered attempting suicide, and 13% attempted it.
          Among LGBTQ+ youth, 70% experienced persistent sadness and hopelessness; 45% seriously considered attempting suicide, and 22% attempted it.
        
        Many factors contribute to this. Stress and isolation caused by the pandemic clearly played a role. While teens are back in school, re-entry has been difficult for many. Social media clearly plays a role, inviting unrealistic comparisons, reinforcing negative thoughts and ideas, and encouraging doomscrolling. It is also a source of bullying: in the report, 16% of high school students reported being bullied electronically, including 20% of girls and 27% of those who identify as LGBTQ+.
        Why the disconnect between teens and parents?
        It's not that surprising that parents don't always know that their teens are considering suicide. Teens may not always realize how bad they are feeling, and may not want to tell their parents when they do — both for fear of worrying them, and also because of uncertainty about how their parents might react.
        Parents may miss signs of depression in their teens, or quite genuinely misinterpret them or attribute them to something innocent; after all, it's natural to want to believe that your child is fine, rather than thinking that they might be suicidal. And given how much drama can be intrinsic to the life of a teen, it's understandable that parents could misinterpret statements about death or dying as, well, just teen drama.
        What can parents do?
        
          Be aware of signs of depression in teens, and never ignore them. Acting sad is one of them, but there are many others:

	dropping gradesbeing irritable or angry oftenacting bored all the time, and/or dropping out of activitiesdifficulty with relationships, including changing peer groups or becoming more isolateddangerous or risky behaviorpersistent physical complaints such as headaches or stomachachesfatigue.
          Listen to your teen, and never assume that statements like ""nobody cares if I live or die"" are just drama. Instead of saying, ""You don't mean that,"" ask them if they do mean it. Often parents worry that asking about suicide might ""give them ideas,"" but asking may be the only way to know — and the best way to show your teen that you are taking them seriously.
          Learn how to have tough conversations about mental health and suicide. The American Academy of Pediatrics has many tips and resources for parents.
          Get help. Call your doctor, call a mental health professional, call the new nationwide number 988 that can link you to local help like a suicide hotline, or take your child to a local emergency room. This is crucial. If counseling is recommended, do your best to schedule it, letting your doctor know if you are having trouble finding a provider. Make sure your teen sticks with it.
          If you suspect your teen may be depressed or suicidal, take precautions. If you have a gun in your house, make sure it is locked up with the ammunition locked separately. Take stock of prescription medications and alcohol in your house that could be used for self-harm, and either get rid of them or be sure they are stored safely.
        
        Sometimes it is just drama — or short-term blues after a breakup or another one of life's inevitable disappointments. And in the study, half of the teens whose parents thought they were suicidal, and two-thirds of those whose parents believed their teens thought about death, said they were fine. But when it comes to suicide, it's always better to be safe than sorry. So ask the questions — and ask for help.","Claire McCarthy, MD","February 28, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/seeing-a-surgeon-202302272895,Seeing a surgeon?,"A visit with a surgeon can be overwhelming. You may feel anxious about your planned surgery. Many questions could be swirling in your head during a rushed visit. While surgeons have a reputation as technical specialists, bedside manner may be lacking at times.
        It sounds simple, but setting the right expectations — on both sides — can ease your anxiety and help you feel more comfortable during a visit with your surgeon. So what exactly does this mean? And how can you accomplish it?
        Tell your story
        Tell your story to help set clear goals. Beyond simply stating what hurts or what is not working, be sure to include details such as
        
          how your current condition limits what you enjoy doing
          your daily activities
          how your condition affects your relationship with your social circle and family
          upcoming plans or goals such as travel, or life events like vacations or weddings.
        
        Sharing details like these helps you collaborate to define a successful outcome for surgery.
        Listen with your goals in mind
        When explaining surgical options, surgeons are obligated to discuss key information, including risks, potential complications, and likely outcomes. Encourage your surgeon to put these facts into context based on what is important to you.
        
          Ask questions about how surgery will affect things you enjoy doing, such as playing pickleball, taking walks, cooking, reading, or listening to music.
          Ask what you should realistically expect during recovery and once you have recovered. For example, if you have a vacation or travel planned, be sure to discuss how surgery will affect your plans.
        
        Define success before your surgery
        Once you are confident that you have told your story and feel like you and your surgeon have set appropriate expectations, take the next step. Ask whether this discussion affects your surgeon's approach to surgery, and explore how you each define surgical success.
        Often, both surgeon and patient agree on a definition of success: for example, remove the entire tumor. But this simple definition may leave room for misalignment. Let's say a surgeon is able to entirely remove a thyroid tumor, but now the patient speaks in a hoarse voice. While technically successful, this surgery may feel like a failure unless the person understood and accepted the risk that it could affect how they speak.
        This highlights the importance of setting expectations. In this example, clear speech after surgery might be your expectation as a patient. Your surgeon must balance explaining how surgical risks might affect that expectation with the reality of treating the condition. Surgery is more likely to feel successful if both sides discuss and align their expectations.
        Give yourself time when possible
        Processing information about surgery can take time. A surgeon may have to provide realistic expectations that do not align with your initial expectations and hopes.
        Some surgeries are urgent, others are not. If you do not need to make an immediate decision, be open with your surgeon. Let them know that you need time to consider the surgeon's definition of success and your own. Reflecting on the discussion can reduce the stress and anxiety you're likely to feel during an initial visit.
        The bottom line: Making the most of your appointment
        Communication goes two ways during a good pre-surgery visit. Do your best to tell your story and emphasize details of your life that are important. When listening, ensure that your surgeon acknowledges these details and describes how surgery may affect your life, as opposed to simply stating technical facts about the surgery. Setting expectations together will help you achieve a common goal and establish a strong surgeon-patient relationship that is essential for a positive surgical outcome.","James Naples, MD","February 27, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-happens-when-a-drug-goes-viral-202302212892,What happens when a drug goes viral?,"The current shortage of semaglutide (Ozempic), an important diabetes drug, has an unusual origin: too many people without diabetes are taking it. Here's how that happened, and how we might course-correct to help ensure that those with the greatest need for this medicine can get it.
        A diabetes drug with an important side effect: Weight loss
        Semaglutide (Ozempic) was first approved by the FDA in 2017 to help people with type 2 diabetes keep blood sugar under control. But during pre-approval studies, researchers noticed a remarkable side effect: people lost weight. For example, in one pivotal study, average losses for those receiving one milligram a week of semaglutide were:
        
          nearly 10 pounds lost over 30 weeks
          nearly 5% overall body weight lost
          waist size shrank 1.6 inches.
        
        This side effect helped people with type 2 diabetes because excess weight is a major risk factor for the condition. Among other health benefits, weight loss can lower blood sugar and blood pressure, and reduce the need for other diabetes medications.
        Turning a side effect into a selling point
        Unintended weight loss would usually be listed as a side effect for a study medication. But ads for Ozempic didn't list it with the other possible side effects; instead, it was featured as a benefit. The Ozempic ""Tri-Zone"" (a phrase concocted by marketers, not medical experts) promised improved blood sugar control, lower cardiovascular risk, and weight loss.
        At the bottom of the ad, fine print that's easy to miss states: ""Ozempic is not a weight loss drug."" Talk about mixed messages!
        The makers of Ozempic saw the potential of semaglutide as a weight loss drug for people without diabetes. Sure enough, clinical trials confirmed that overweight and obese people taking semaglutide also lost substantial weight. Semaglutide received FDA approval in 2021 for people with obesity (BMI of 30 or greater), or who were overweight (with a BMI of 27 to 29.9) and had a medical problem related to excess weight, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. As a weight loss drug, it was rebranded as Wegovy.
        The only difference between the two drugs? The maximum approved dose of semaglutide is a bit higher with Wegovy than Ozempic.
        How social media fueled the Ozempic shortage
        Soon after the approval of Wegovy, celebrities and social media influencers began taking it and sharing glowing weight loss experiences. What's more, medicines approved for specific uses in the US can be prescribed off-label for any use: up to 38% of all prescriptions written in the US are off-label (note: automatic PDF download). So, it's likely some of the viral run on Wegovy was fueled by people who wanted to lose weight but had no medical reason to take it.
        After high demand put Wegovy in short supply, many turned to Ozempic to lose weight. And that contributed to a shortage of Ozempic, threatening the health of people with type 2 diabetes who rely on the drug.
        Readjust priorities and limit irresponsible prescribing
        This situation couldn't have happened without physicians or other health care professionals willing to write Ozempic prescriptions for people who did not have diabetes or another medical reason to use semaglutide. And that suggests an obvious solution: limit prescriptions for Ozempic to people with diabetes. For many drugs, a prior authorization process requires certain conditions be met before a prescription can be filled. This could be done for Ozempic.
        And of course, we should encourage people who don't have diabetes not to request a prescription for Ozempic. While that message is unlikely to show up in a drug ad, public service announcements could do the trick.
        The bottom line
        Drug ads often urge you to ask your doctor if a treatment is right for you. But we already know a key piece of the answer for Ozempic: if you don't have diabetes, don't ask for a diabetes medicine to help with weight loss. There are better ways to get the help you need to reach a healthy weight if you are overweight or obese. Talk to your doctor about a full range of treatment options. And if your weight is already in a healthy range, it's not a good idea to take a medication to become thinner.
        Finally, to keep vitally important medicines available for those who need them most, health care professionals must prescribe them responsibly. Responsible requests by their patients could help.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","February 21, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/want-to-reduce-your-risk-of-dementia-get-your-hearing-checked-today-202302162891,Want to reduce your risk of dementia? Get your hearing checked today,"Are you having a little trouble hearing conversations? If so, you're not alone. An estimated 23% of Americans ages 12 and older have hearing loss. Although most of those people have mild hearing loss, for people ages 80 years and older, it's more common for hearing loss to be moderate to severe than mild.
        But not only is moderate to severe hearing loss disruptive to one's life, it also makes you more likely to develop dementia. A new study helps explain why — and what you can do about it.
        What did the new study look at and find?
        A study published in JAMA focused on a sample of adults in the United States from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which follows Medicare beneficiaries. The participants sampled were 70 or older.
        The researchers found that about 33% of participants had normal hearing, 37% had mild hearing loss, and 30% had moderate to severe hearing loss. Dementia occurred least often among those with normal hearing (6%), more often among those with mild hearing loss (9%), and most often among those with moderate to severe hearing loss (17%). That's a large increase in risk, particularly for those whose hearing loss is moderate to severe.
        What else to know about this study
        The study sample was selected to make it possible to analyze subgroups by age and apply findings to a diverse population. The sample included additional participants ages 90 years and older, and additional participants who identified as Black. Of the 2,413 total participants, 53% were ages 80 years and older, 56% were female, 19% were non-Hispanic Black, 4.5% were Hispanic, and 74% were non-Hispanic white.
        Also, unlike previous research, this study looked objectively at hearing loss and dementia. Prior research had shown that hearing loss is thought to account for about 8% of all dementia cases worldwide. Exactly why the connection exists is not known.
        It's important to note that most large studies that found this link were based on questionnaires that people fill out. In other words, no one actually measured the hearing of those participating in the study to make sure that they had hearing loss — or that their hearing was really normal.
        In this new study, however, the investigative team used an electronic tablet-based audiometer to evaluate participants' hearing for four pure tone frequencies that are most important for understanding speech. So, for the first time in a large study, there was objective measurement of hearing loss.
        How do hearing aids reduce the risk of dementia?
        If you have hearing loss, does that mean you're doomed to develop dementia? Not at all. This study found that those with moderate to severe hearing loss could significantly reduce their risk of dementia simply by using hearing aids.
        This research helps us understand why hearing loss causes dementia. Here's the connection:
        There is increasing evidence that the more the brain is stimulated, the less likely it is that dementia will develop. When there is hearing loss, auditory stimulation is reduced. This, by itself, likely increases dementia risk. But even more important is that when an individual suffers from moderate to severe hearing loss, they are less likely to participate in social activities. Perhaps they are embarrassed about their hearing loss. Or they may simply find it unrewarding to attend a social event when they cannot hear what is going on.
        It turns out that social activities are one of the best ways to stimulate the brain, as there is evidence that our brains evolved to facilitate social behavior. Given all this information, you won't be surprised to learn that reduced social activity has been linked to cognitive decline. Thus, this new study provides additional evidence that the reason hearing loss increases the risk of dementia is because hearing loss reduces brain stimulation — both directly and through reduced social interaction.
        What to do if you have hearing loss
        Don't let hearing loss raise your risk of dementia.
        
          Keep your ears clean. (But remember, never put anything in your ears smaller than your elbow. Ask your doctor if you're not sure how to clean your ears.)
          If you can't hear and you don't have hearing aids, get them. Hearing aids now available over the counter can help many people with mild to moderate hearing loss.
          If you have hearing aids, wear them.
          If your hearing aids aren't working, get them fixed.
          Don't be passive — ramp up your social life and other activities.
        
        All these things will help to reduce your risk of dementia. And you might just find that, despite some hearing loss, you're enjoying life more.","Andrew E. Budson, MD","February 16, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/prostate-cancer-how-often-should-men-on-active-surveillance-be-evaluated-202302152890,Prostate cancer: How often should men on active surveillance be evaluated?,"It used to be that doctors would automatically recommend treating all men with prostate cancer, even if their initial biopsies suggested the disease would grow slowly (or at all). But during the last several decades, the pendulum on treatment has swung the other way.
        Doctors are now likely to advise active surveillance for low- to intermediate-risk cancers that may never turn deadly over the course of a man's life. Active surveillance involves routine PSA checks, follow-up biopsies, and more recently, magnetic resonance imaging of a patient's tumor. Treatment is initiated only when — or if — the disease shows signs of progression.
        Recent evidence from Johns Hopkins University shows that the long-term risks of metastasis and death from low-grade prostate cancer among men on active surveillance averages just 0.1%. But doctors who care for such men also face a nagging question: which of their patients might have more aggressive cancer that should require closer monitoring? New findings published by the Johns Hopkins team in January provide useful insights.
        The researchers' approach
        The researchers in this case zeroed in on the prognostic value of so-called perineural invasion, or PNI, on tumor biopsy samples. PNI simply means that cancer cells are moving into the perineural space between nerves in the prostate and their surrounding tissues. A finding of PNI raises red flags because the perineural space ""provides a conduit by which tumor cells can potentially escape the prostate and grow elsewhere in the body,"" says Dr. Christian Pavlovich, a urologic oncologist at Johns Hopkins who led the research.
        Dr. Pavlovich's team wanted to know if PNI detected on initial or follow-up biopsies would be associated with higher risks for cancer progression. So they analyzed long-term follow-up data from 1,969 men who had enrolled in an active surveillance research protocol at Johns Hopkins between 1995 and 2021. All the men were diagnosed initially with Grade Group 1 prostate cancer (the least risky form of the disease) and had undergone at least one follow-up biopsy since then.
        What did the results show?
        Among the 198 men with PNI, 44% of them (87 men in all) eventually progressed to Grade Group 2 prostate cancer, which is a more advanced form of the disease with an intermediate risk of further spread. Conversely, just 26% of the remaining 1,771 men without PNI (461 men) had progressed to Grade Group 2.
        Pavlovich emphasizes that despite the new findings, PNI ""does not make patients ineligible for active surveillance."" Importantly, the research showed that PNI was not associated with high-risk features, such as cancer in the lymph nodes of patients who wound up having surgery, or post-surgical elevations in PSA that show cancer still lurks in the body.
        ""What we've really shown here is that PNI puts men at a slightly higher risk of extraprostatic extension (cancer cells located just beyond the confines of the prostate),"" Pavlovich says. ""This is not necessarily a new finding. But PNI only occurs in about 10% of Grade Group 1 patients, and this is the boldest statement yet from the largest study conducted so far."" Pavlovich and his colleagues concluded that PNI provides an inexpensive and readily available indicator for identifying which men on active surveillance will benefit from more intensive monitoring protocols, including MRI and genetic tests.
        Dr. Marc B. Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, agrees, while pointing out that PNI evaluations aren't performed often enough. A PNI analysis of pathology specimens, he says, ""along with emerging and sophisticated genetic testing of the tissue samples, may lead to more certainty in our recommendations to patients.""",Charlie Schmidt,"February 15, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-inflammation-contribute-to-infertility-202302102888,Does inflammation contribute to infertility?,"Infertility is a remarkably common problem. It affects up to one in five people in the US who are trying to become pregnant, and 186 million people worldwide. A thorough medical evaluation can spot key contributing issues in many cases — whether in a woman, a man, or both partners — that might respond to treatment, or call for assisted reproductive tools like in vitro fertilization (IVF).
        But in a substantial number of cases, no cause is found for infertility. Could inflammation be to blame for some of those cases, as recent research suggests? And if so, will an anti-inflammatory diet or lifestyle boost fertility?
        Exploring the connection between inflammation and infertility
        Chronic inflammation has been linked to many health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer.
        While its importance in infertility is far from clear, some evidence supports a connection:
        
          The risk of infertility is higher in conditions marked by inflammation, including infection, endometriosis, and polycystic ovary syndrome.
          Bodywide (systemic) inflammation may affect the uterus, cervix, and placenta, thus impairing fertility.
          Women with infertility who had IVF and followed an anti-inflammatory diet tended to have higher rates of successful pregnancy than women who did not follow the diet.
        
        Could an anti-inflammatory diet improve fertility?
        It's a real possibility. Decades ago, researchers observed that women following a prescribed fertility diet ovulated more regularly and were more likely to get pregnant. Now a 2022 review of multiple studies in Nutrients suggests that following an anti-inflammatory diet holds promise for people experiencing infertility. The research was done years apart, but the diets in these two studies share many elements.
        The 2022 review found that an anti-inflammatory diet may help
        
          improve pregnancy rates (though exactly how is uncertain)
          increase success rates of assisted reproductive measures, such as IVF
          improve sperm quality in men.
        
        The authors add that improving diet might even reduce the need for invasive, prolonged, and costly fertility treatments. However, the quality of studies and consistency of findings varied, so more high-quality research is needed to support this.
        Will adopting an anti-inflammatory lifestyle improve fertility?
        While recent research is intriguing, there's not enough evidence to show that an anti-inflammation action plan will improve fertility. A plant-based diet such as the Mediterranean diet, and other measures considered part of an anti-inflammatory lifestyle, improve heart health and have many other benefits.
        It's not clear if this is directly due to reducing inflammation. But this approach comes with little to no risk. And abundant convincing evidence suggests it can improve health and even fight disease.
        What is an anti-inflammatory lifestyle?
        Health experts have not agreed on a single definition. Here are some common recommendations:
        
          Adopt a diet that encourages plant-based foods, whole grains, and healthy fats like olive oil while discouraging red meat, highly processed food, and saturated fats.
          Stop smoking or vaping.
          Lose excess weight.
          Be physically active.
          Get enough sleep.
          Treat inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or allergies.
          Avoid excessive alcohol consumption.
          Control stress.
        
        Anti-inflammatory medicines may help in certain situations — for example, treatments for autoimmune disease. However, they are not warranted for everyone. And for people trying to conceive, it's far from clear that any potential benefit would exceed the risk of side effects for parent and child.
        The bottom line
        It's possible that inflammation plays an important and underappreciated role in infertility and that an anti-inflammatory diet or lifestyle could help. But we need more evidence to confirm this. Until we know more, taking measures to improve your overall health and possibly reduce chronic inflammation makes sense.","Robert H.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-mindful-way-to-help-manage-type-2-diabetes-202302062885,A mindful way to help manage type 2 diabetes?,"Lifestyle changes like regular exercise, a healthy diet, and sufficient sleep are cornerstones of self-care for people with type 2 diabetes.
        But what about mind-body practices? Can they also help people manage or even treat type 2 diabetes? An analysis of multiple studies, published in the Journal of Integrative and Complementary Medicine, suggests they might.
        Which mindfulness practices did the study look at?
        Researchers analyzed 28 studies that explored the effect of mind-body practices on people with type 2 diabetes. Those participating in the studies did not need insulin to control their diabetes, or have certain health conditions such as heart or kidney disease. The mind-body activities used in the research were:
        
          
            yoga
          
          qigong, a slow-moving martial art similar to tai chi
          mindfulness-based stress reduction, a training program designed to help people manage stress and anxiety
          
            meditation
          
          guided imagery, visualizing positive images to relax the mind.
        
        How often and over what time period people engaged in the activities varied, ranging from daily to several times a week, and from four weeks to six months.
        What did the study find about people with diabetes who practiced mindfulness?
        Those who participated in any of the mind-body activities for any length of time lowered their levels of hemoglobin A1C, a key marker for diabetes. On average, A1C levels dropped by 0.84%. This is similar to the effect of taking metformin (Glucophage), a first-line medication for treating type 2 diabetes, according to the researchers.
        A1C levels are determined by a blood test that shows a person's average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. Levels below 5.7% are deemed normal, levels from 5.7% to less than 6.5% are considered prediabetes, and levels 6.5% and higher are in the diabetes range.
        How can mind-body practices help control blood sugar?
        Their ability to reduce stress may play a big part. ""Yoga and other mindfulness practices elicit a relaxation response — the opposite of the stress response,"" says Dr. Shalu Ramchandani, a health coach and internist at the Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""A relaxation response can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. This improves insulin resistance and keeps blood sugar levels in check, thus lowering A1C levels.""
        A relaxation response can help people with diabetes in other ways, such as by improving blood flow and lowering blood pressure, which protects against heart attacks and strokes.
        What else should you know about this study?
        The results of studies like this suggest a link between various mind-body practices and lower A1C levels, but do not offer firm proof of it. Levels of participation varied widely. But because all mindfulness practices studied had a modest positive effect, the researchers suggested that these types of activities could become part of diabetes therapy along with standard lifestyle treatments.
        Could mind-body practices protect people against developing type 2 diabetes, especially for those at high risk? While this study wasn't designed to look at this, Dr. Ramchandani again points to the long-range benefits of the relaxation response.
        ""Reducing and managing stress leads to improved moods, and greater self-awareness and self-regulation,"" she says. ""This can lead to more mindful eating, such as fighting cravings for unhealthy foods, adhering to a good diet, and committing to regular exercise, all of which can help reduce one's risk for type 2 diabetes.""
        Trying mind-body practices
        There are many ways to adopt mind-body practices that can create relaxation responses. Here are some suggestions from Dr. Ramchandani:
        
          Do a daily 10-minute or longer meditation using an app like Insight Timer, Calm, or Headspace.
          Attend a gentle yoga, qigong, or tai chi class at a local yoga studio or community center.
          Try videos and exercises to help reduce stress and initiate relaxation responses.
          Practice slow controlled breathing. Lie on your back with one or both of your hands on your abdomen. Inhale slowly and deeply, drawing air into the lowest part of your lungs so your hand rises. Your belly should expand and rise as you inhale, then contract and lower as you exhale. Repeat for several minutes.",Matthew Solan,"February 6, 2023"
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/take-arms-against-perplexing-pain,Take arms against perplexing pain,"Brushing your hair, turning a steering wheel, or lifting a bag of groceries are simple tasks that feel a lot harder when your shoulder, elbow, or wrist hurts. But when this pain seemingly strikes from nowhere — without injury from a mishap or accident — confusion may join discomfort.
        For doctors, however, the scenario is often not at all mysterious. Our arms are constantly in use, so they're vulnerable to a variety of short-term or chronic problems that produce pain, says Dr. Tamara Rozental, chief of Hand and Upper Extremity Surgery at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        ""The vast majority of people we see don't have an obvious injury,"" says Dr. Rozental. ""It's not an unusual situation.""
        Pain ""buckets""
        Pain that arrives without trauma falls into many different ""buckets"" — some more common in women — depending on whether it affects the shoulder, elbow, wrist, or a combination of arm joints, Dr. Rozental says.
        To some extent, we're prone to this pain simply by aging. Other risk factors include prior overuse injuries; conditions such as diabetes, which can thicken tendons and connective tissues surrounding joints; and occupations that involve vigorous use of the hands and arms or vibrating tools.
        Dr. Rozental highlights these common causes:
        Arthritis. The wear-and-tear version called osteoarthritis — which affects half of adults 65 and older — is a highly likely culprit in shoulder, elbow, or wrist pain as cartilage breaks down with age and use. Less-common rheumatoid arthritis stems from an overactive immune system attacking joint linings. Both arthritis types are more prevalent in women, according to the CDC.
        Bursitis. Frequently propping your elbow on a desk or other hard surfaces makes this joint more susceptible to bursitis, inflammation of the small, fluid-filled sacs called bursae that protect and lubricate bones, tendons, and muscles. But the condition can occur in just about any joint, as bursae are located throughout the body.
        Frozen shoulder. Most common in women 40 and older, frozen shoulder (known medically as adhesive capsulitis) can literally develop overnight. It happens when connective tissue surrounding the shoulder capsule thickens and tightens, triggering shooting pain with various arm movements. Over time, your shoulder can stiffen and ""freeze"" for months or longer.
        Rotator cuff tear. Aging or doing tasks that require overhead arm motion — such as painting or yard work — raise the odds of a tear in the rotator cuff, a group of four muscles that stabilize the shoulder joint. Tears can start small and worsen over time, leading to throbbing pain that can even make it difficult to sleep.
        Tendinitis. ""Tennis elbow"" and ""swimmer's shoulder"" are apt nicknames for tendinitis, irritation in tendons attaching muscle to bone near these joints. That's because these repetitive activities can stress the tendons bit by bit, leading to pain and tenderness.
        Carpal tunnel syndrome. This nerve compression syndrome, which is three times as common in women as in men, produces pain or tingling in the arm or hand. It stems from pinching of the median nerve where it passes through the carpal tunnel, a narrow passage of ligament and bones in the wrist.
        Cubital tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel's cousin, this type of nerve compression occurs at the elbow. It may be triggered by pressure from long periods of bending your elbow. The space around the nerve may also narrow over time.
        Spectrum of treatments
        With careful listening, a doctor can often readily diagnose many of the causes of shoulder, elbow, or wrist pain. ""We can usually tell what's wrong just by hearing a patient's story and understanding which activities are causing pain,"" Dr. Rozental says. However, ""repetitive stress injuries are much harder to diagnose — there's no clear underlying problem you can identify.""
        First, Dr. Rozental recommends at-home measures such as the RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) approach; over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve); or a splint or brace that allows the arm to rest until pain eases. If a few weeks of these remedies don't spell relief, Dr. Rozental advises a visit with your primary care doctor.
        Ultrasound is a common diagnostic tool, allowing doctors to inexpensively visualize painful areas. Next steps may include physical therapy or steroid injections (using ultrasound guidance when needed) into affected areas to reduce inflammation and pain.
        Surgery is typically a last resort if conservative treatments fail. The procedure would aim to repair the specific problem, whether it's a torn rotator cuff, a narrowed carpal tunnel, or damaged cartilage.
        ""It's hard to talk about arm pain as a big bucket,"" Dr. Rozental says. ""But most of the time, my advice is to try more invasive treatments only after you've tried all the home measures and still are experiencing persistent discomfort.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/a-pain-in-the-rear,A pain in the rear,"We're all born with eyes, ears, arms, legs… and the makings of hemorrhoids. While they're not what we think of as a body part, the blood vessels that pad the anus and rectum are nonetheless part of all of us — and one that few mention in polite company.
        These blood vessels only become problematic when they enlarge. Before that, they ""actually contribute to some of our continence — they hold things in place,"" says Dr. Anne Fabrizio, a proctologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        But when symptoms emerge — ranging from barely noticeable to excruciating — they can disrupt our days. About half of adults have experienced some degree of hemorrhoidal symptoms by age 50. Pain, itching, swelling, and bleeding can progress to a point where hemorrhoids bulge dramatically and develop blood clots that prove agonizing, Dr. Fabrizio says.
        ""It's an incredibly common problem that can have a huge impact on quality of life,"" she says. ""But a lot of people try to ignore it for a long time, partly because it can be embarrassing, so they hesitate to bring it up.""
        Serious complications
        Hemorrhoids are classified into two types depending on where they're found. External hemorrhoids are visible at the anus, while internal ones are inside the rectum. The latter tend to produce painless, bright red bleeding with bowel movements, but not much pain, Dr. Fabrizio says.
        Because any rectal bleeding is concerning — possibly signaling colorectal cancer — you should see a doctor, even if you're unbothered and convinced internal hemorrhoids are the cause.
        Pregnancy is one of the top risk factors for hemorrhoids because it intensifies pressure in the rectum. Others include aging, chronic constipation or diarrhea, and obesity. But women are likely to delay hemorrhoid treatment in the years after childbirth — when the problem can flare — as they juggle family with other priorities.
        This is a mistake, Dr. Fabrizio says. Putting off care can lead to potentially serious complications as well as needless suffering for anyone with hemorrhoids. ""They may be uncomfortable all the time, in pain, and thinking of their hemorrhoids when they're supposed to be focused on other things,"" she says.
        When hemorrhoids get extremely large, mucus can seep out. So can blood. ""A worst-case scenario is that people can get really anemic,"" Dr. Fabrizio adds. ""They can have significant blood loss that harms their overall health.""
        Treatment strategies
        Drugstore hemorrhoid remedies are often the first thing people try when symptoms are mild. These include pain relievers, along with witch hazel pads and topical creams and ointments to reduce itching and discomfort. Shallow sitz baths and cold compresses can also bring relief.
        But while these tactics are ""great for symptom management,"" Dr. Fabrizio says, ""they don't tackle the underlying problem. They don't really make a hemorrhoid go away. That's why you should see a doctor.""
        Seeking care early also widens your treatment choices before the problem worsens to a point of needing more extreme — and potentially painful — options. One tool is prescription hydrocortisone suppositories, which can be used for short-term hemorrhoid inflammation.
        Most patients who see a doctor early and take steps toward having easy, regular bowel movements can often sidestep the worst symptoms of hemorrhoids — or even prevent symptoms from arising at all, she says.
        For internal hemorrhoids, the doctor may recommend a procedure to eliminate the hemorrhoid by cutting off its blood flow. One option is sclerotherapy, which involves a chemical injection into the hemorrhoid. Another is banding, in which the doctor places a small rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid. In both cases, the bulging vessel eventually withers away.
        For large, bulging external hemorrhoids, surgery called hemorrhoidectomy is the only permanent removal option. Dr. Fabrizio acknowledges the procedure is painful, but often worth it. ""I tell patients that hemorrhoidectomy brings short-term, guaranteed pain, but offers long-term symptom improvement.""
        Preventing hemorrhoids from enlarging in the first place is the ideal, of course. Dr. Fabrizio recommends preventing constipation by eating fiber-rich foods and drinking plenty of water. Also, avoid straining for long periods on the toilet and aggressive wiping, which can lead to more irritation.
        ""Hemorrhoids are something we've been dealing with for centuries,"" she says. ""Talking about them more would make people more comfortable seeing a doctor earlier, which would be a win-win.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/dont-buy-into-dietary-supplements-for-heart-health,Don't buy into dietary supplements for heart health,"For people without heart disease, low-dose statin therapy can lower LDL (bad) cholesterol better than six dietary supplements promoted to improve heart health, according to a study published online Nov. 6, 2022, by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
        Researchers examined 190 adults ages 40 to 75 who did not have cardiovascular disease. Participants had LDL levels that ranged from optimal to high and a 5% to 20% risk of developing cardiovascular disease within 10 years. Everyone was randomly put into one of eight groups. One group took 5 milligrams of the statin drug rosuvastatin (Crestor), another group took a daily placebo, and the rest took one of six dietary supplements, each with a dominant ingredient: fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast rice. (These ingredients have been touted to have heart health benefits, including helping to lower cholesterol.)
        After 28 days, people in the statin group lowered their LDL by an average of almost 38%, while changes in most of the supplement groups were comparable to those who took a placebo. (The garlic supplement group actually saw their LDL levels increase.) The statin group also had an average 24% decrease in total cholesterol.
        The researchers noted that more than 28 days may be needed for these dietary supplements to affect cholesterol levels. Still, the findings support statins as the best medicine for lowering cholesterol.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/know-your-pain-relievers,Know your pain relievers,"Low back pain? Achy joints? Overdo it when you were working out or doing outside work? One of the easiest remedies is to pop an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever. Most of the time, this does the trick. But what if the ache or pain is more frequent and you take these pills on a regular basis? How do you know when you have overused them?
        ""OTC pain relievers can be fairly potent medicine and help reduce most inflammation and pain,"" says Dr. Christopher Gilligan, a pain medicine physician with the Division of Pain Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""But people may not think of them as real medicine and so don't always use them as directed. This can lead to serious problems.""
        
          
            
              
                Are nonprescription pain relievers as good as opioids?
                For years, opioids were usually prescribed to treat pain after a medical procedure or surgery, or for pain management. But with the increasingly recognized risk of addiction and opioid side effects, over-the-counter (OTC) pain medication may be a safer option, and perhaps even a better one.
                One study found that taking acetaminophen and ibuprofen together provided greater pain relief than opioids after a tooth extraction. Other research showed that OTC pain relievers were as effective as opioids for treating sciatica pain.
                ""OTC pain relievers could be a viable and effective treatment in most circumstances,"" says pain specialist Dr. Christopher Gilligan with Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Check with your doctor about first trying OTC medications to see if they work. Don't think you automatically need a strong prescription pain reliever.""
              
            
          
        
        Two categories
        The two main categories of commonly used pain relievers (also known as analgesics) are acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
        Acetaminophen (Tylenol) controls pain and fever but doesn't help with inflammation. It's an active ingredient in many drugstore headache and cold remedies. NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). These ease pain and lower fever like acetaminophen, and also work as anti-inflammatories. NSAIDs are popular pain relievers for inflammation-related conditions like arthritis and injuries. ""While people are more familiar with OTC brand names, generic versions work just as well and are less expensive,"" says Dr. Gilligan.
        Potential side effects
        According to Dr. Gilligan, the ideal approach to taking these medications is to use the lowest effective dose over the shortest period of time. ""If you need OTC medication for pain relief daily for at least two weeks or longer, or if the maximum recommended dose on the label no longer helps, you should see your doctor.""
        Further, some individuals should never take an NSAID without first checking with their doctor. These include anyone taking an anticoagulant or antiplatelet drug (blood thinner) and those with a history of a peptic ulcer, impaired kidney function, or heart disease. Like any drug, OTC pain relievers can have side effects if overused. For example:
        Acetaminophen. High doses can damage the liver. The maximum recommended per day is usually 4,000 milligrams (mg), equivalent to 12 regular-strength or eight extra-strength Tylenol tablets. It's also possible to develop liver problems after taking small to moderate amounts if done so over an extended period.
        To be safe, take no more than 3,250 mg of acetaminophen a day. The FDA recommends using products containing no more than 325 mg per pill or capsule to avoid excessive dosages. Also, be cautious when mixing multiple products containing acetaminophen, such as a pain reliever, a cold medication, or a prescribed narcotic. ""And do not take acetaminophen if you drink alcohol more than moderately on a regular basis or if you have liver disease,"" says Dr. Gilligan.
        NSAIDs. The most common side effect is stomach irritation which may cause pain, bloating, or heartburn. These medications also may cause ulcers, which can lead to internal bleeding. Excessive use of NSAIDs increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure. The most common daily limits are 1,200 mg for ibuprofen and 660 mg for naproxen.
        All NSAIDs (except aspirin) tend to boost blood pressure. While the effect is most potent in people who already have high blood pressure, anyone taking an NSAID may see an increase in readings.
        People who are concerned about possible side effects can try topical pain relievers, such as products containing diclofenac (Voltaren gel) or lidocaine. ""They are a safe choice for pain due to soft tissue injury or osteoarthritis as smaller amounts are absorbed by the body,"" says Dr. Gilligan.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-gut-healthy-heart,"Healthy gut, healthy heart","The gut is known as the ""second brain,"" as it produces many of the same neurotransmitters, chemicals released by nerves needed for communication with other nerves and tissues. The gut and brain are also connected through a joint partnership called the gut-brain axis that links biochemical signals both to and from the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system.
        But what about the gut and the heart? Do they have a similar connection?
        Research suggests there might be a link, but that it travels in one direction — from the gut to the heart — and that keeping your gut healthy can be another means to protect against heart disease.
        The gut-heart connection
        The gut is the primary home to trillions of microbes, collectively known as the human microbiota. These microbes help with digestion, manufacture certain nutrients, and release substances that have wide-ranging health effects.
        ""There's a complex interplay between the microbes in our intestines and most of the systems in our bodies, including the vascular, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, all of which are linked with cardiovascular health,"" says Dr. Stanley Shaw, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Since diet plays a significant role in the composition of gut microbiota, what you feed your gut can therefore affect heart health — for better and for worse.
        One way the gut does this is with metabolites, substances the gut microbiota creates when breaking down food. One particular gut metabolite, trimethylamine (TMA), forms when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a substance strongly connected with forming artery-clogging plaque.
        Research has shown that people with high TMAO levels in their blood are more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those with lower levels. Since red meat is a main source of TMA, cutting back can stop the gut from making too much TMAO.
        In fact, a study in the September 2022 issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found that among nearly 4,000 people ages 65 and older, those who ate an average of 1.1 servings of red meat per day had a 22% higher risk of heart disease compared with those who ate less.
        The researchers pointed out that about 10% of this added risk could be attributed to increased levels of TMAO as well as two other metabolites — gamma-butyrobetaine and crotonobetaine — which also are made by gut bacteria from components in red meat.
        Fiber at work
        Fiber also helps support the gut and thus the heart. According to some estimates, fiber-rich diets can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as 30%. Fiber in the small intestine binds fat and cholesterol, decreasing absorption and lowering blood cholesterol levels.
        But the gut's microbiota also helps out. Fiber gets broken down by bacteria in the colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds interact with specific receptors on cells that regulate blood pressure, better control blood sugar and body weight in people with diabetes, and dampen inflammation — all of which can improve heart health.
        Other supporting foods
        It's unclear whether eating other foods that improve gut microbiota — for example, probiotics (beneficial bacteria) found in yogurt and fermented foods (sauerkraut, miso, tempeh) — can also support heart health.
        The best advice for helping your gut help your heart is to follow a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean diet or similar eating patterns. These involve limiting red meat and eating plenty of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, all of which can have favorable effects on the gut,"" says Dr. Shaw. ""And if your gut is healthy, there is a greater chance your heart is healthy, too.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/do-you-pass-the-hearing-test,Do you pass the hearing test?,"Approximately one in three people ages 65 to 74 has hearing loss. Nearly half of those older than 75 have difficulty hearing.
        While many people can function with some degree of hearing loss, especially if they have a spouse or family member who can repeat any information they may miss, ignoring hearing decline can profoundly affect one's health.
        Growing evidence shows that age-related hearing loss is associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline. Research suggests that hearing loss impairs new nerve cell creation in the hippocampus, the brain's memory region. Hearing loss also is linked with increased risks for depression, social isolation, and being less active.
        ""It is often challenging to differentiate the cause of one's hearing loss and its severity without an evaluation,"" says Dr. James Naples, assistant professor of otolaryngology–head and neck surgery at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""This is why older men need to get their hearing checked by a certified audiologist before any potential hearing loss worsens.""
        Hearing about problems
        There is no single cause of age-related hearing loss, also known as presbycusis. The most common reason is changes in the inner ear, which can alter nerve pathways from the ear to the brain.
        Over time, the cells in the inner ear grow old, die, and are not replaced. When these cells — called hair cells — die, the electrical messages of sound waves don't travel to the brain as well as they should. This causes many people to eventually experience some degree of presbycusis, although the severity varies. Another contributor to hearing loss is long-term noise exposure, like from power tools, loud music, gunfire, or careers in loud environments, such as construction and manufacturing.
        Getting tested
        Hearing tests measure how loud a sound needs to be before you clearly hear it. People with normal hearing can identify sounds of less than 25 decibels (dB). Mild hearing loss means you require sounds to be in the 26 to 40 dB range, and moderate hearing loss, your minimum hearing in the 41 to 55 dB range. Ranges higher than this are considered moderately severe to severe and profound.
        According to the CDC, a person with mild hearing loss may hear most speech sounds, but soft sounds don't get through. Someone with moderate hearing loss may hear almost no speech at normal levels.
        Age-related hearing loss and noise-induced hearing loss tend to affect both ears equally. If hearing loss occurs in one ear but not the other, or is accompanied by ear pain, vertigo, or ringing in the ear, it could signal any of a variety of conditions that require further medical evaluation.
        You may be fitted for a hearing aid based on your hearing test results. An audiologist configures hearing aids to a person's specific hearing loss, similar to the way prescription glasses are fitted. Despite their name, hearing aids don't directly improve hearing, but instead work as amplifiers. Still, hearing aids can be literal life-changers. Research has shown that people with age-related hearing loss who wear hearing aids improve their working memory, concentration, processing speed, and attention.
        Other studies have found that wearing hearing aids can lower the risk of being diagnosed with dementia and protect against fall-related injuries. ""On a personal level, hearing aids can also improve your relationships with your partner, friends, and family,"" says Dr. Naples.
        Less expensive options
        The main downside to hearing aids has always been cost. The average price of one hearing aid is about $2,000 (although this can vary), and most people need one for each ear. Hearing aids are not usually covered by Medicare, although some Medicare Advantage plans and other commercial health insurance plans do cover them.
        Why are hearing aids traditionally so expensive? Only a handful of companies produce most of the country's hearing aids, which are sold through audiology practices. This lack of competition drives up prices and keep them high.
        However, in October 2022 the FDA approved the over-the-counter sale of hearing aids suitable for mild to moderate hearing loss. This new category means more competition among manufacturers that, in turn, should lower average prices. Some estimates suggest that a pair of over-the-counter hearing aids could drop to less than $1,000 (although the exact savings is unknown).
        It's still being determined which styles will be available over the counter, according to Dr. Naples. He speculates they will range from traditional behind-the-ear devices to ones that fit into the ear canal.
        Be mindful that there are some limitations to the over-the-counter devices. For instance, they are only for mild to moderate hearing loss (people with severe hearing loss would likely need a prescription hearing aid). Also, whereas a prescription hearing aid can be individually fine-tuned and fitted, over-the-counter aids come in generic sizes that can't be altered. It also still needs to be clarified how repairs, warranties, and replacements will work.
        Also, don't confuse over-the-counter hearing aids with personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) sold at most drugstores. ""PSAPs are not specifically intended for people with hearing loss,"" says Dr. Naples. They are a great alternative for people who only experience some hearing difficulties in specific situations, like listening to the TV.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-to-identify-anxiety-disorders,How to identify anxiety disorders,"Everyone experiences anxiety symptoms — a thumping heart, rapid breathing, and feelings of apprehension and fear — from time to time. You might have felt anxious before an important event, a major medical procedure, or a social situation.
        Some degree of anxiety is normal and signals that something is awry or needs our focused attention. ""However, you don't want this response to become exaggerated or to dominate your life,"" says Dr. Stephanie Collier, director of education for the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""If you often feel anxious without an apparent cause, you may have an anxiety disorder.""
        Types of anxiety disorders
        People who regularly struggle with anxiety not associated with a specific target have what is known as generalized anxiety disorder, where they worry excessively about various things on most days.
        Many people have symptoms only related to specific situations, like a fear of heights, crowds, and social situations. Another variation is panic disorder, marked by recurring attacks of anxiety, apprehension, fearfulness, or terror.
        Anxiety that lasts for up to a month following a traumatic experience is described as acute stress disorder — ""acute"" meaning it is an immediate but short-term response. By contrast, anxiety rooted in a trauma that lasts for months or years may indicate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
        While each anxiety disorder has its own set of symptoms, many overlap. The most common symptoms are
        
          exaggerated feelings of fear, dread, or danger
          trouble concentrating or remembering
          difficulty falling or staying asleep
          fatigue
          irritation or agitation
          procrastinating or having trouble making decisions.
        
        Physical symptoms may include a rapid heartbeat and shallow or rapid breathing, sweating, chest pains, upset stomach (cramps, nausea, or diarrhea), headaches, and general pains. It's also common for people with an anxiety disorder to suffer from depression. They are more likely to abuse alcohol or other drugs. In addition, people with an anxiety disorder may struggle with low self-esteem or insecurity.
        Getting help
        If you experience signs of anxiety or have a troubling sense of uneasiness for at least a month, consult your doctor.
        The first step to dealing with an anxiety disorder is identifying the underlying cause and possible stressors. Anxiety disorders can sometimes be attributed to a medical condition or medication side effect, which your doctor can address.
        However, in many cases, a recent life experience — such as the death of a loved one or a sudden change in living situation or finances — triggers an anxiety disorder. ""Sometimes a recent reminder of a past traumatic experience can cause anxiety,"" says Dr. Collier. In these cases, you may be referred to a mental health professional like a psychiatrist or therapist for further evaluation and treatment. Treatment for an anxiety disorder often includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy.
        Depending on the person's situation, doctors may prescribe a short-term or long-term medication, or both.
        Short-term drugs. Benzodiazepines start to work immediately, but usually are prescribed for only two to four weeks because of their addiction potential. They affect a chemical messenger in the brain's fear response system. Examples of benzodiazepines are clonazepam (Klonopin), lorazepam (Ativan), diazepam (Valium), and alprazolam (Xanax). A different type of short-term drug sometimes used is buspirone.
        Long-term drugs. Despite their name and primary use, antidepressants also are used for long-term anxiety treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), or escitalopram (Lexapro), are often prescribed. Another option is duloxetine (Cymbalta), a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).
        Many psychotherapy techniques address personal issues that may contribute to your anxiety. For example:
        
          Cognitive behavioral therapy helps you recognize and change undesirable thinking and behavior patterns.
          Psychodynamic or insight-oriented psychotherapy helps you understand the history behind your symptoms.
          Interpersonal psychotherapy can help you sort out anxiety-provoking conflicts in meaningful relationships and resolve them more effectively.
          Exposure and desensitization therapy is a behavioral technique that supports you in confronting a specific fear and overcoming it.
        
        Relaxation techniques also might be offered, like diaphragmatic breathing and meditation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/a-pill-free-way-to-treat-anxiety,A pill-free way to treat anxiety,"For people with an anxiety disorder — chronic, intense worry that makes it hard to concentrate or sleep — first-line treatments are often medications called antidepressants. They can have side effects such nausea, fatigue, headache, or sexual dysfunction. But a randomized trial published online Nov. 9, 2022, by JAMA Psychiatry found that a pill-free approach might be just as effective for reducing anxiety symptoms. Scientists randomly assigned almost 300 people to either take an antidepressant called escitalopram (Lexapro) every day or participate in a mindfulness-based stress reduction program. The program included 45 minutes of daily meditation at home and a weekly 2.5-hour in-person class with an instructor. Participants learned a number of mindfulness techniques, such as breath awareness and stretching designed to bring awareness to the body. After eight weeks, both groups had similar results, reducing anxiety symptoms by about 30% over that period.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/dont-count-on-a-supplement-to-fix-high-cholesterol,Don't count on a supplement to fix high cholesterol,"Six types of supplements touted to reduce high cholesterol don't do the job, according to a randomized trial published online Oct. 19, 2022, by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Researchers (including Harvard experts) randomly assigned 190 people (ages 40 to 75) with high levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol to take either 5 milligrams of the cholesterol-lowering statin drug rosuvastatin; a supplement containing fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast rice; or a placebo (inactive pill). After four weeks, people in the statin group showed a 37% drop in LDL cholesterol, a 24% drop in total cholesterol, and a 19% drop in blood triglycerides. Meanwhile, people in the supplement and placebo groups didn't have any significant decreases in these measures. In fact, there were some adverse effects: LDL cholesterol went up for people taking the garlic supplement, and ""good"" HDL cholesterol dropped for people taking the plant sterols, compared with people taking a placebo. The study was brief, and researchers say it's possible it wasn't long enough to give some supplements a chance to work. But they also point out that the contents of dietary supplements vary and don't produce consistent results. They warn that supplements that are marketed for cholesterol or heart health are unlikely to be effective.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/poor-sleep-linked-to-a-common-cause-of-blindness,Poor sleep linked to a common cause of blindness,"Poor sleep is tied to many health problems, such as weight gain, mood disorders, and even dementia. Now, a large study published online Nov. 1, 2022, by BMJ Open suggests that poor sleep is also linked to higher risk for developing glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The study involved more than 400,000 people without glaucoma (ages 40 to 69) who were followed for 10 years. Researchers evaluated participants' medical records and self-reported sleep habits. People who had unhealthy sleep patterns (those who snored, experienced daytime sleepiness, had insomnia, slept less than seven hours per night, or slept more than nine hours per night) were more likely to develop glaucoma than people who had healthy sleep patterns. People who had insomnia or slept too much or too little had the highest risks for glaucoma — 13% higher than people without these problems. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that unhealthy sleep behaviors caused glaucoma. So what's the possible link? Study authors say eye pressure increases when you lie down and when your sleep hormones are out of kilter (which occurs in insomnia). That might be a plausible explanation for glaucoma risks, since the condition is caused by increased pressure on the optic nerves, which connect the eyes to the brain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/reduce-or-avoid-back-pain-during-these-everyday-activities,Reduce or avoid back pain during these everyday activities,"There's never a good time for back pain to strike. But there are good strategies for coping with it. If you're among the millions of people struggling with back pain — eight out of 10 people experience it at some point in their lives, especially low back pain — you'll want to know what to do.
        What causes back pain?
        The spine is a strong and complex tower of bones (vertebrae) with many parts that are prone to irritation, injury, or wear and tear. For example, joints that connect one vertebra to another can deteriorate (spondylosis); discs that act as cushions between vertebrae can become deformed (herniated), irritating nearby nerve roots; and the bones themselves can sprout little growths or spurs that jab into nerves (stenosis).
        
          
            
              
                Move of the month: Cat-cow
                Strengthen and stretch the back with a ""cat-cow"" exercise.
                
                  
                
                Get down on all fours, with your hands directly beneath your shoulders and your knees beneath your hips. Inhale and lift your chest and tailbone toward the ceiling like a cow.
                
                  
                
                As you exhale, round your back, bringing your chin toward your chest and tucking your tailbone under like a cat. Repeat the exercise 10 times.

        Common scenarios and quick fixes
        You may already know that you have a back problem, or you may discover it when you suddenly experience pain. What should you do in the moment? Consider the following scenarios and responses.
        Driving a car. Sitting for long periods or in awkward positions puts pressure on your back.
        Quick fixes: ""Use a lumbar pillow to support your lower back. If you don't have a pillow, try using a water bottle wrapped in towel. And if you're sitting too far from the steering wheel, try moving it closer and see how you feel,"" says Mason Gray, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Other ways to relieve pain while driving: ""If your vehicle has heated seats, turn them on as heat therapy, to reduce pain and relax muscles. Or pull over and take pressure off your back by walking around for a few minutes,"" Gray suggests.
        Sitting at a desk. Like sitting in a car for a long time, sitting at a desk for prolonged periods can lead to back pain.
        Quick fixes: ""Try to move every hour,"" Gray says. ""Go get a drink of water or stand up and stretch."" He also recommends using a lumbar pillow to support your lower back, using heat or cold, or switching to a standing desk for a little while (or simply working at a bar-height countertop — again, just for a little while, to get you out of a seated position).
        Shopping. You might think walking around a mall is mostly hard on your feet, but it can also cause a sore back.
        Quick fixes: ""It could be that you're carrying a heavy shopping bag or handbag on one side of your body, which puts an uneven load on that side for long periods,"" Gray says. He recommends carrying bags on both sides of your body, not just one, to distribute the weight. If you carry a handbag, remove some of its contents before you go out, so you'll lighten the load.
        Exercising. Lifting weights is a great way to build a strong and healthy back, but if you aren't mindful of your form and technique, you can set yourself up for back pain.
        Quick fixes: If you experience pain while exercising, Gray says you shouldn't push through the discomfort. ""Stop what you're doing and evaluate what's causing your back pain,"" he says. ""Are you using more weight than you can handle? Consider reducing the weight. If you can't modify your way out of pain with an exercise, your best move may be skipping it for that day.""
        Lifting something heavy. When lifting a heavy load — whether it's a grocery bag, a laundry basket, or a precious grandchild who runs into your arms — the sudden increase in pressure on your back can irritate the back's joints, discs, muscles, and nerves.
        Quick fixes: Put down your heavy load immediately, so you don't injure your back. Try lifting the load again with the right technique: get as close to the object as you can, and bend your knees a little. Wrap your arms around the object, push down with your legs, and stand up straight. To carry the object, keep it close to your chest.
        Lying in bed. Sometimes back pain occurs while you're simply lying in bed.
        Quick fixes: Maybe your sleep position is putting pressure on your back. ""If you're a back sleeper, try putting a pillow under your knees to distribute pressure a little better,"" Gray suggests. ""If you're a side sleeper, put a pillow between your knees or use a very long, narrow 'body' pillow and put your arm over it.""
        
          
            
              
                Will TENS therapy ease your back pain?
                Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy uses low-level electrical current (tiny shocks) on the skin to interrupt pain signals. While some people swear by it, it doesn't work for everyone, and studies about its effectiveness for low back pain have produced mixed results. Some medical organizations, such as the American Academy of Neurology and the American College of Physicians, do not endorse TENS for chronic back pain. Still, TENS therapy is a low-risk option that doctors often recommend. You can see a physical therapist for TENS therapy, or you can get a home TENS unit (ask your doctor or physical therapist about the voltage that's safe for your condition). Prices for a home TENS unit start at about $25.
              
            
          
        
        Long-term fixes
        Easing back pain when it strikes is important, but it's not a permanent solution. If back pain lasts more than a week, see your doctor for an evaluation. If you need treatment, the first line of defense will most likely be exercise and strengthening regimens — two keys to staving off an aching back.
        Other long-term fixes include always using a lumbar pillow when sitting (not just when you're in pain); getting a new bed topper or a new mattress if you feel your bed is contributing to back problems; and sitting up straighter at your desk, with your knees at a 90° angle.
        Managing chronic stress may also help ease your discomfort. ""People who have a lot of stress are more likely to have back pain,"" Gray says. ""Managing stress with exercise, meditation, a healthy diet, and better sleep may be one of your secret weapons to keep your back from bothering you.""
