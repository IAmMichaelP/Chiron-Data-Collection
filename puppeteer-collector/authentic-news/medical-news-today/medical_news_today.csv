https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/health-misinformation-and-disinformation-how-to-avoid-it,Health misinformation and disinformation: How to avoid it,"In the age of viral content and fast and furious social media communication, disinformation and misinformation, including about health matters, are spreading more widely than ever. Why is this the case exactly, and how can we learn to spot inaccurate and even malicious health information? Why do we fall so easily for false health info, and how can we update our mistaken beliefs? These are some of the questions this episode aims to answer. Nowadays, thanks to the widespread availability of internet access, almost any piece of information we may want is just one click away. While this is generally a positive development, it can also mean that we become exposed to untrustworthy, unchecked information on any topic, including health. According to a report issued by the International Panel on the Information Environment (IPIE) in 2024, communication experts are currently most concerned “about the threats to the information environment posed by the owners of social media platforms.” Such platforms regularly circulate a varied array of videos, articles, and posts on topics including health. However, in the absence of strict rules and regulations around the information shared on social media, there is a clear danger that at least some of what we see being shared online amounts to misinformation or even disinformation. BetterHelp is an online service created to help you with your mental health. Sign up and find support for your mental health from a licensed therapist. Misinformation occurs when communication is laden with inaccuracies, either because the original information was misinterpreted or misunderstood or because someone picked up a piece of erroneous information by mistake and kept sharing it. Disinformation is an even more concerning phenomenon. It occurs when a bad actor disseminates fake information on purpose, manipulating their audience to support a hidden agenda. In this episode of In Conversation, we look at why health misinformation and disinformation spread, how we can identify mis- and disinformation, and what it takes for people to update their views after they have assimilated incorrect information. Our special guest is Prof. Stephan Lewandowsky, PhD, Chair in Cognitive Psychology at the School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, United Kingdom, and Project Lead of PRODEMINFO (Protecting the Democratic Information Space in Europe) at Potsdam University in Germany. Prof. Lewandowsky is a cognitive scientist with an interest in computational modeling who has extensively studied decision-making processes, the persistence of misinformation in society, the ways in which myths and misinformation can spread, and how people update their memories if the notions they believe in turn out to be false. We also hear from our trusted expert, Jenny Yu, MD, FACS, Chief Health Officer at RVO Health, the parent company of Medical News Today and Healthline.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/brain-health-sleep-diet-3-health-resolutions-for-2025,"Brain health, sleep, diet: 3 health resolutions for 2025","Taking care of oneself requires a multi-faceted approach: brain, heart, and metabolic health. What research in 2024 has shown us is that improving our health in these areas comes down to three main factors: sleep, diet, and exercise. But how does one start taking action with this intention? And how can we break down such lifestyle changes into manageable steps? In this podcast episode, Medical News Today shares three actionable resolutions that can help improve your health in the new year. As humans, we are all capable of growth and change. And perhaps, one of the most influential times of the year for transformation and setting the stage for change is New Year’s. When it comes to making resolutions for health or any other area of life, we may set unrealistic or very large goals that set us up for failure from the start. The key, according to experts, is to start small and be as specific as possible—whether that be via setting a time frame or measurable results. In our August 2023 podcast episode, we had touched on how human behavior inherently resists change unless the optimal conditions are present. One such factor was whether it would be beneficial. Medical News Today has covered many important pieces of research this year that showed how certain habits and practices could improve overall health. The top areas of research in this regard were brain and heart health, nutrition, exercise, and sleep. So, what did the most significant studies from 2024 find? Based on research earlier this year, researchers found that experiencing disrupted sleep in ages 30–40 may lead to memory problems later in life. They also linked a lack of quality sleep to accelerated brain aging. On the topic of exercise, scientists found that any form of exercise could help rejuvenate the brain, and a particular type of activity could even prolong life span. Another study also found increased heart failure and death risk from being sedentary for a certain number of hours a day. To ensure a healthy and balanced diet, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) also published a new report this year, listing the food groups people should consume more and others to avoid for optimal health. It also touched on how many carbs and what types of fats to include in one’s diet. In our final podcast episode of 2024, we discussed all this and more. We also included tips on getting better sleep at night, following a healthful diet, and incorporating more exercise into one’s daily life.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/5-things-everyone-should-know-about-menopause,5 things everyone should know about menopause,"Despite the fact that around half of the world’s population goes through menopause, misconceptions about this key stage in people’s reproductive lives still abound. This is often due to social and educational barriers to accessing relevant information. What are some key things that everyone should know about menopause? In Conversation, our expert guest helps us answer this question. Menopause affects everyone with a uterus. Still, while awareness of the symptoms of menopause and the stage that precedes it, called “perimenopause,” is on the rise, misconceptions and disinformation about these key life stages still abound. A survey conducted in 2021 that included over 800 postmenopausal participants in the United Kingdom found that over 90% of them had never learned anything about menopause at school. When asked how they experienced menopause, many replied that it was a “nightmare” — and the lack of preparedness for the symptoms and how to manage them may have contributed to this assessment. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us Perimenopause can take a person by surprise and be confusing, as its symptoms may appear like, or exacerbate those of many other health conditions. And menopause symptoms — such as hot flashes and chronic insomnia — can affect a person’s quality of life in unexpected and sometimes severe ways. So what is there to know about this stage of life, and how can a person find the best support and tools for their unique individual needs? In this episode of In Conversation, we answer these and other questions with Prof. Kate Clancy, PhD,professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois, a human reproductive ecologist who specializes in uterine health and the health of people who menstruate.

 with some lifestyle changes. But how exactly does type 2 diabetes contribute to accelerated brain aging? And how can we offset brain aging accelerated by diabetes? In this episode, we examine findings from two recent studies that offer insights into possible ways to slow diabetes-induced brain aging. For this episode, Medical News Today editors and co-hosts Yasemin Nicola Sakay and Maria Cohut spoke to Thomas (Tom) Barber, MD, associate professor at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom and honorary consultant endocrinologist to answer these questions and more.

However, not all of these metals are innocuous, and some are quite toxic to human health. In this podcast episode, we dissect what these findings mean and whether or not people should be worried about heavy metal contamination in menstrual products. The average person who menstruates uses over 11,000 pads
Trusted Source
 throughout their lifetime. Some estimates suggest that this number may be closer to 15,000
Trusted Source
 for tampons and pads. Considering that people use pads and tampons almost every month, and that the latter is inserted into a very sensitive area of the body that absorbs foreign substances really easily, it is natural to be concerned about being exposed to harmful chemicals. Recently, a study found trace quantities of 16 heavy metals, including lead, arsenic, and cadmium, in 14 tampon brands available across the U.S. and the U.K. These findings have fueled anxiety about the safety of menstrual products — especially in the long-term.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/can-tattoos-cause-blood-or-skin-cancer,Can tattoos cause blood or skin cancer?,"Some research has found a link between tattoos and an increased risk of cancer, and recent evidence appears to suggest that tattoos could heighten the risk of blood cancer, in particular. What biological mechanisms might explain this link, and should people really worry about the health implications of getting a tattoo? This podcast episode takes a deep dive into the latest evidence. Tattoos can be strikingly beautiful forms of art, and they are increasingly popular. According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2023, 32% of Americans have at least one tattoo, and 22% have several. Beyond adorning the body on a permanent basis, tattoos can also provide a meaningful way of commemorating important life events, or they can be symbols of mental and emotional healing. However, some questions remain around the potential health implications of getting a tattoo, and recently, researchers have been homing in on the ways in which tattooing could affect a person’s physical health in the long run. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us One study, published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology at the start of July 2024, tested samples of 75 tattoo and permanent makeup inks commonly used in the United States, and found that 26 of these were contaminated with infection-causing bacteria. These included Staphylococcus epidermidis
Trusted Source
, an infection that can cause severe health complications, and Cutibacterium acnes
Trusted Source
, which causes acne. More worryingly, a study from Lund University, in Sweden, which appeared in the journal eClinical Medicine the previous month, found that any-size tattoo was linked to a 21% higher link of lymphoma, a type of blood cancer. To identify this link, the Lund researchers looked at data from the Swedish National Cancer Register, focusing on people who were 20–60 years old, when they received a lymphoma diagnosis, between 2007 and 2017. But what does this link mean? How come tattoos may increase the risk of blood cancer? Are some types of tattoos riskier than others, and if so why? Finally, how worried should people be about getting cancer if they have tattoos, and what should they keep in mind when considering whether or not to get a tattoo? To explore these and other questions, Medical News Today editors and co-hosts Maria Cohut and Yasemin Nikola Sakay invited Milena Foerster, PhD, a researcher who specializes in the link between tattoos and cancer, on this latest In Conversation podcast episode. Foerster conducts her research at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO), in Lyon, France.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323586,"BMI calculator, charts, and categories","BMI uses a person’s height and weight to estimate their body fat level and gauge their risk of body fat-related diseases. BMI charts also display the ranges for the categories of underweight, overweight, and obesity. Carrying too much or too little weight can increase a person’s risk of health problems, either in the present or the future. A person’s body mass index (BMI) is not the only factor that affects this risk. Other tools for assessing whether or not a person has a moderate weight or body composition include the waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, and body fat percentage. However, BMI may be a helpful starting point. This article provides some tools for people to work out their BMI. BMI is a calculation of a person’s body fat based on their height and weight. However, studies suggest it is a poor indicator of a person’s body fat percentage. It can be misleading because the measure does not account for overall body composition or capture information on the mass of fat in different body sites. The latter relates to both health and social issues. BMI cutoff points were generated mostly from the white population, but body fat distribution differs by race and ethnicity. For additional information, talk with your doctor about other body fat assessment methods.  These calculators and charts can indicate whether a person’s weight may affect their risk of health problems. This article publishes the calculators courtesy of The Calculator Site. Two calculation options are available: metric and imperial. Learn more about BMI.

Your privacy is important to us The charts below allow a person to find their weight in pounds (lb) along the top and their height in feet (ft) and inches (in) down the side. They can then look across to find their BMI. There are two charts. If a person weighs 245 lb or less, they can use the first chart. If their weight is over 250 lb, they can look at the second one. The shaded areas correspond to BMI values that indicate either a moderate weight, overweight, or obesity. In addition, researchers and doctors divide obesity into three categories
Trusted Source
: The charts are an adaptation of the adult BMI chart created by the University of Vermont in Burlington. These figures are only a guide. The BMI tools do not determine whether or not a person has an ideal body weight, but they can help show if an individual’s weight may increase their risk of disease. A very fit person, such as an Olympic athlete, may have a high BMI. However, this does not necessarily mean they are overweight due to excess body fat. In that case, the excess weight may be due to increased muscle mass. The following table shows the standard weight status categories associated with BMI ranges for adults:  A BMI of under 18.5 indicates that a person has insufficient weight, so they may need to put on some weight. They should ask a doctor or dietitian for advice.   A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 indicates that a person has a moderate weight for their height. By maintaining a moderate weight, they can lower their risk of developing serious health problems.   A BMI of 25 to 29.9 indicates that a person is slightly overweight. A doctor may advise them to lose some weight for health reasons. They should talk with a doctor or dietitian for advice.   A BMI of over 30 indicates that a person has obesity. Their health may be at risk if they do not lose weight. They should talk with a doctor or dietitian for advice.  Maintaining a moderate weight can help prevent a range of health conditions. People who are overweight may have a higher risk

 than others of conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, and colorectal cancer. Some of these can be life threatening. Having insufficient weight can increase the risk of malnutrition, osteoporosis, anemia, and a range of problems that can result from various nutrient deficiencies. It can also be a symptom of a hormonal, digestive, or other problem. Some evidence suggests that the associations between BMI, body fat percentage, and body fat distribution may differ across populations due to variations in sex, race, and ethnicity. A Brazilian study
Trusted Source
 from 2017 looked at the correlation between BMI and body fat percentage in 856 adult males and females. They concluded that the standard BMI threshold of 29.9 kilograms per square meter (kg/m2) was appropriate for males to predict obesity-type body fat percentage, but a more suitable cutoff point for females appeared to be 24.9 kg/m2. In 2017, Korean researchers
Trusted Source
 pointed out that people in the Asia-Pacific region often have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease at a BMI below the existing World Health Organization (WHO) cutoff point of 25 kg/m2. They added that in Korea, there is evidence to suggest that almost twice as many people have features of metabolic obesity but a moderate weight compared with the United States.

A moderate BMI/rating score for women is 18.5 up to 24.9. BMI is a useful tool that gives a general idea about whether or not a person’s weight is healthy for them. However, it is a simple tool that does not tell the whole story about people’s weight and health risks. Anyone with concerns about their weight could speak with a healthcare professional.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/316898,Breast cancer: How to do a self-examination,"Early detection and treatment can increase the chance of surviving breast cancer. Knowing how to detect changes in the breast and spot the symptoms can play an essential role in treating the condition. Practicing monthly breast self-examination can help detect irregularities or changes that may indicate cancer. However, there are currently no standard guidelines
Trusted Source
 on when or how to perform these self-exams. The American Cancer Society (ACS)
Trusted Source
 does not recommend regular clinical breast exams or breast self-exams as part of a routine breast cancer screening schedule. This is due to the risk of receiving a false-positive result, which could lead to unnecessary treatment or anxiety. In addition, physical self-exams cannot detect every kind of breast cancer. However, the ACS acknowledges that people should be familiar with how their breasts usually look and feel. One way of doing this is through regular self-exams. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls this breast self-awareness. A person who is familiar with the features of their breasts has a better chance of spotting any changes that do occur, and this can increase the likelihood of early detection and effective treatment. This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to perform a self-exam of the breasts. Apart from a lump, what are some other early symptoms of breast cancer? Find out here. The National Breast Cancer Foundation suggests three steps for an effective breast self-exam: People should pay attention to: The following sections explain how to carry out the exam in more detail. A person can do a visual exam in front of a mirror. With the arms down, check for changes in: Repeat these steps with the arms above the head and the body bending slightly forward.

People should speak with a doctor about their screening plan if they have any concerns. It is also worth noting that not all breast lumps are breast cancer, and not every case of breast cancer involves a lump. For these reasons, people should attend regular screening as a doctor recommends. What else can a breast lump indicate? Find out here. Breast changes that may indicate cancer include: Some changes to look for in the nipples and areolae include: Breast cancer can cause changes in the lymph nodes in the early stages. To check the lymph nodes, look for: Lymph node involvement can also result in a rash on the breast in people with inflammatory breast cancer. A person should contact a doctor about these or any other unexplained changes, especially if they only seem to affect one breast. Learn more about the early symptoms of breast cancer here. It is worth noting that breast cancer is not the only reason for lymph node swelling under the arm. The lymph nodes play a role in the body’s immune response, and swelling can occur as they fight unwanted intruders, such as infections. The lymph nodes under the arm can also swell in response to a vaccine, such as the COVID-19 vaccine. This could contribute to a false diagnosis of breast cancer. For this reason, experts suggest scheduling any routine mammograms at least 4–6 weeks

 after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. However, if a person has concerns about possible symptoms of breast cancer, they should not hesitate to contact a doctor. They should also not delay having a COVID-19 vaccine. This is because if cancer is present, they may benefit from the extra protection a vaccine offers. How might COVID-19 affect people with breast cancer? Find out here. Although the ACS
Trusted Source
 does not currently recommend regular breast self-exams as part of breast cancer screening, BreastCancer.org recommends checking the breasts once per month at the same time each month. Before menopause, it is best to do the self-exam a few days after menstruation ends. At this time, the breasts are least likely to be swollen or sore. After menopause, a person might decide to check, for example, on the first day of each month. The normal texture and appearance of breasts can vary among individuals. Certain areas might feel sandy or grainy, and others might have small lumps. Not all breast lumps are cancerous.

Your privacy is important to us The ACS no longer recommends breast self-exams or physical exams by a doctor as a diagnostic tool, as there is a risk of false positives. Many breast lumps are not cancerous, and finding them can lead to unnecessary anxiety. However, if a person is familiar with how their breasts usually look and feel, they are more likely to be able to spot changes at an early stage.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/science-fact-or-fiction-separating-ra-myths-from-facts#1,Everything you need to know about rheumatoid arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, autoimmune disease. It causes inflammation, swelling, and pain in and around the joints and can affect other parts of the body. Various treatment options can help manage it. RA usually affects the hands and feet first, but it can occur in any joint. It usually involves the same joints on both sides of the body. Common symptoms include stiff joints, especially when getting up after sleeping or after sitting down for a while. Some people experience fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell. The Rheumatoid Arthritis Support Network estimates that RA affects up to 1% of the world’s population and over 1.3 million Americans. The incidence of RA has increased
Trusted Source
 globally over the past decades and will continue to increase in the coming years. RA is an autoimmune disease, which means that a person’s immune system mistakes the body’s healthy tissues for foreign invaders. It is also a systemic disease that can affect the whole body. As the immune system responds, inflammation occurs in the target tissue or organ. This can include the joints, lungs, eyes, and heart in RA. Signs and symptoms of RA usually occur in the wrists, hands, or feet and include: The following images show how RA can present physically: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Trusted Source
, people most often experience the onset of RA in their 60s. Symptoms may start slowly and often worsen gradually with time. People with RA usually experience periods when their symptoms get worse, known as flares. RA symptoms may flare up due to stress, overactivity, or stopping medications. Sometimes, a person with RA can go into remission if their symptoms go away or are mild. Most people continue to experience flares and remissions throughout their lives. RA usually affects the same joints on both sides of the body. Pain and stiffness tend to worsen after periods of inactivity. Severe RA can lead to other complications throughout the body and cause joint damage that may lead to disability. Treatment can help manage the severity of symptoms and may reduce the likelihood of experiencing complications. How does RA affect different parts of the body? Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us Nobody knows exactly what causes the immune system to malfunction, which leads to RA. It’s thought to be a combination of genetics and environmental factors. In RA, the immune system attacks the synovium, the membrane lining of joints. When this happens, the synovial cells proliferate, which leads to
Trusted Source
 synovial thickening. Pain and inflammation result. Eventually, if left untreated, the inflammation can invade and destroy cartilage — the connective tissue that cushions the ends of the bones. The tendons and ligaments that hold the joint together can also weaken and stretch. The joint can eventually lose its shape and configuration, and the damage can be severe. Learn more about genetic and hereditary RA here. RA is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and swelling. Osteoarthritis leads to many of the same symptoms as RA but is due to the typical wear and tear of the joints. While RA usually affects the same joints on both sides of the body, osteoarthritis may only affect one side. Although other symptoms can help a person figure out if they are experiencing RA or osteoarthritis, only a doctor can diagnose these conditions. The CDC
Trusted Source
 notes that people with a higher risk of developing RA may include those who: Learn more about the risk factors for RA here. It may be difficult for a doctor to diagnose RA in its early stages, as it can resemble other conditions such as lupus (SLE) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The CDC
Trusted Source
 recommends getting a diagnosis within six months of the onset of symptoms so that treatment can begin as soon as possible. A doctor will look at the person’s clinical signs of inflammation and ask how long the person has experienced them and how severe their symptoms are. They will also perform a physical examination to check for swelling, functional limitations, or other unusual presentations. They also may recommend some tests, including: Several blood tests can help diagnose RA and rule out other conditions. They include: An X-ray or MRI of a joint can help

 a doctor identify what type of arthritis is present and monitor the progress of a person’s RA over time. Learn what arthritis looks like on an MRI. Guidelines
Trusted Source
 recommend the following criteria for diagnosing RA: If a person has a diagnosis of RA, a doctor may refer them to a specialist known as a rheumatologist, who will advise on treatment options. Treatment will aim
Trusted Source
 to: Options include medications, physical therapy, occupational therapy, counseling, and surgery. Some drugs can help relieve symptoms and slow the disease’s progression. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are available from pharmacies over the counter (OTC). Examples include Motrin, Advil, and Aleve. Long-term use and high doses can lead to side effects, including: Corticosteroids reduce pain and inflammation and may help slow joint damage, but they cannot cure RA. If NSAIDs do not work, a doctor may inject a steroid into the joint. Relief is usually rapid, but the effect is variable. It can last a few weeks or months, depending on the severity of the symptoms. This can help with acute symptoms or short-term flare-ups. However, a doctor will limit steroid injections to no more than three times per year because of their impact on the soft tissue structures around the joints. More frequent injections can potentially damage these structures or cause them to tear off from where they attach to bone. DMARDs affect how the immune system works. They can slow the progression of RA and prevent permanent damage to joints and other tissues by interfering with an overactive immune system. A person usually takes DMARDs for life. These types of medications are most effective if a person uses them in the early stages of RA, but it can take several weeks to a couple of months to fully experience their benefits. Some people may have to try different types of DMARDs before finding the most suitable one. Side effects can include: Biologic treatments, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, also change how the immune system works. When the human body faces an infection or other threat, it produces TNF-alpha, an inflammatory substance. TNF-alpha inhibitors suppress this substance and help prevent inflammation. TNF-alpha inhibitors can reduce pain, morning stiffness, and swollen or tender joints. People usually notice an improvement two weeks after starting treatment. Examples include: Possible side effects include
Trusted Source
: Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are a newer subtype of DMARD medications. These include: While traditional DMARDs stop the immune system from producing immune cells that cause RA to develop, JAK inhibitors target specific signaling molecules. This helps prevent the cellular process that causes RA to progress. For the 20–30%
Trusted Source
 of people living with rheumatoid arthritis who do not respond to traditional DMARDs or biologics, JAK inhibitors have proven to be an effective option. An occupational therapist can help a person learn new and effective ways of carrying out daily tasks. This can minimize stress on painful joints. For example, a person with painful fingers might learn to use a specially devised gripping and grabbing tool. A physical therapist can advise people about using assistive devices, such as a cane, and help individuals develop a suitable exercise plan. Which exercises can help people with RA? In some cases, a doctor may recommend surgery to: The following procedures are possible: Learn why RA affects the hand joints. Finding time to practice self-care can help a person cope with the day-to-day challenges that RA brings. Several strategies that may help a person manage their condition include. RA generally develops
Trusted Source
 in four stages: Stage 1: An X-ray will not show any bone or joint destruction. Stage 2: An X-ray will show the impact on the bone. Stage 3: An X-ray will show a particular kind of erosion of the cartilage and bone that a doctor can recognize as resulting from RA and deformities in the affected joints. Stage 4: The person will experience ankylosis, which is when a joint becomes stiff and fuses with the bone. Learn more about the four stages of RA here. Research
Trusted Source
 has determined that there are genes that make developing RA more likely. One theory is that bacteria or viruses trigger RA in people who have these genes. One of the genes that may be responsible is HLA-DR4, and it is common in people of European ancestry. However, this may not fully explain why some people get RA and others do not. There are likely environmental triggers also. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cannot be completely prevented, as its exact cause is not fully understood and involves a combination of genetic, environmental, and possibly hormonal factors. However, a person can reduce their risk
Trusted Source
 and potentially delay the onset of RA by taking several steps that include but are not limited to: Learn more about smoking and RA here. According to a 2015 study, people with RA might have a 54% higher
Trusted Source
 risk of mortality compared with people who do not have the condition. RA patients often face additional chronic medical conditions and complications, severely impacting their health outcomes. Notably, there is a strong association between RA and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, leading to
Trusted Source
 accelerated coronary artery disease. However, it is difficult to predict a person’s life expectancy as the course of the disease differs significantly among individuals. With the right treatment, many people can live past the age of 80 or even 90 years while experiencing relatively mild symptoms and only minor limitations in day-to-day life. Rheumatoid arthritis is a painful chronic autoimmune condition that can cause joint damage and make it difficult for a person to carry out their daily tasks.

Kennedy Jr. has also instructed the CDC to “supply pharmacies and Texas-run clinics with needed MMR vaccines and other medicines and medical supplies.” Typically, if following recommendations, children will receive two doses

 of the MMR vaccine — one at 12–15 months old and another at 4–6 years old — which confer 97% protection against measles. Receiving a single dose of the vaccine confers 93% protection against measles. People who have had MMR vaccination are protected for life. However, the current vaccine, developed in 1971
Trusted Source
, is an improved formula compared to previous vaccinations. This raises the question: Should people who have already received a measles vaccine at any point receive a booster to ensure continued immunity? Medical News Today has asked David Cutler, MD, a board certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, to help answer these and other related questions. Cutler pointed out that “there will remain some uncertainty about the risk posed by measles to any one individual due to several factors.” These include: First of all, what is a vaccine booster, exactly, and what does it do? “A booster vaccine, just like an initial vaccine, will initiate or augment a person’s immune protection against measles,” Cutler explained. It acts as a “reminder” to the body’s immune system to “watch out” for a specific pathogen that it has already become “trained” to fight against through the initial vaccination.

Trusted Source
 but, compared to current versions of the vaccine, it had a “weaker” formulation. So, if you are an adult who was vaccinated in childhood when exactly you got the measles vaccine may determine whether or not you would benefit from a booster. Other factors are at play, too, as Cutler noted. “Adults born before 1957 are considered immune to measles because they almost certainly had the disease during childhood,” the physician explained. He told us that blood tests are available for people who want to clarify their immune status and determine whether or not they should get a measles vaccine booster. That is the Immunoglobulin G (IgG) blood test: “Adults born after 1957 were probably vaccinated as children but may have received a less effective inactivated virus vaccine between 1963 and 1967. Anyone who is unsure of their immune status can get a blood test for measles antibody to determine their immunity. Finding sufficient IgG antibodies to measles means you are immune.” To summarise, “you might need a booster if you are a child who only received one dose of vaccine, an adult who received the inactivated vaccine, a high-risk adult who may be exposed to measles, or anyone whose blood test shows a lack of immunity,” said Cutler. “An adult who is certain they never had the disease, never had the vaccine, and has no factor posing undue risk from the vaccine should get the measles vaccine,” he emphasized. “Current recommendations are that children receive two doses of measles vaccine,” Cutler reiterated. Meanwhile, “adults at average risk should have at least one dose of vaccine at some time in their lives.” However, Cutler pointed out that some social categories should get two doses of the MMR vaccine in adulthood if they have not had the vaccine already, as they may face a higher risk of infection compared to their peers. According to the physician, “adults at particularly high risk” of measles include: The only adults who have never been vaccinated against measles who may not wish to get vaccinated are those who may face health risks from receiving a live virus vaccine — and the MMR vaccine counts as such. “The only currently available form of the measles vaccine is the combination MMR vaccine containing live, attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles) virus,” Cutler explained. People who may experience serious adverse reactions to attenuated live vaccines could include: However, even in such cases, the decision whether or not to receive a vaccine is not clear-cut—it all comes down to weighing the potential risks and benefits and figuring out the safest approach. “Balancing risks and benefits can be complicated for certain individuals who have greater vulnerability,” Cutler noted. “This is why it is important to consult with your primary care physician regarding whether measles or any vaccine may be appropriate for you,” he advised.

 highlights the rapid impact that dietary changes can have on immune and metabolic health. Urbanization and increased availability of processed foods in Africa are shifting dietary patterns, with many people abandoning traditional diets for Western-style diets. To explore the effects of this dietary shift, researchers from Radboud University Medical Center and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College investigated the health impacts at the cellular level. Their findings indicate that just 2 weeks of adopting a Western diet over a traditional African diet can lead to increased inflammation, weakened immune responses, and disrupted metabolic pathways tied to lifestyle-related diseases. In contrast, switching from a Western diet to a traditional African diet or consuming traditional fermented beverages may have anti-inflammatory benefits. While more research is needed, these results support the idea that largely plant-based heritage diets — like traditional African, Mediterranean, and Latin American diets — can improve health and lower the risk of lifestyle-related diseases. This randomized controlled trial involved 77 healthy young men, with a median age of 26, residing in the Kilimanjaro region in Northern Tanzania. Researchers assessed initial eating habits through three 24-hour food diaries recorded on nonconsecutive days, with one diary specifically collected during a festival or weekend. They conducted the trial with three groups, providing daily meals: Researchers had five participants in each of the first two groups stick to their usual diets to eliminate any external factors affecting the results. Blood samples were taken at three key points: at the start of the study, right after the 2-week dietary intervention or the 1-week fermented beverage intervention, and again 4 weeks after the intervention ended. The main goal was to investigate changes in the participants’ immune and metabolic health, focusing on immune system function, blood inflammation markers, and various metabolic processes.

Your privacy is important to us The researchers’ final analysis included only high-quality samples that met specific standards. Results were adjusted for factors including age, body mass index, and physical activity levels. Their results showed that switching from a traditional African diet to a Western diet for 2 weeks disrupted key metabolic pathways linked to lifestyle-related diseases. It also appeared to trigger a pro-inflammatory state involving white blood cells, inflammatory proteins in the blood, and changes in gene expression. Additionally, their immune cells became less effective at responding to pathogens. Conversely, transitioning from a Western diet to a mostly plant-based traditional African diet or consuming the fermented beverage resulted in mostly anti-inflammatory effects, including reduced inflammatory markers. Certain immune and metabolic changes remained four weeks after the intervention, suggesting that even short-term dietary modifications might have some lasting effects. This study may be the first thorough investigation of the health effects linked to a traditional African diet. “Previous research has focused on other traditional diets, such as the Japanese or Mediterranean diet,” study author Quirijn de Mast, MD, PhD, internist-infectious disease specialist from Radboud University Medical Center, said in a press release. “However, there is just as much to learn from traditional African diets, especially now, as lifestyles in many African regions are rapidly changing and lifestyle diseases are increasing. Africa’s rich diversity in traditional diets offers unique opportunities to gain valuable insights into how food influences health.” – Quirijn de Mast, MD, PhD Medical News Today spoke with Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS, a physician-scientist and assistant professor at the RUSH Institute for Healthy Aging, RUSH University, College of Health Sciences, who was not involved in the study. He explained that “the shift from a traditional African diet to a Western-style diet resulted in increased inflammation and weakened immune responses, likely due to differences in nutrient composition and microbial exposure.” The traditional African diet in this study was rich in: These foods are high in dietary fiber and bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation and promote metabolic health. They also encourage a healthy gut microbiome and the production of beneficial metabolites that enhance overall health and well-being. In addition, Holland emphasized the potential advantages of traditional African fermented foods and beverages, like Mbege, which “play a critical role by enriching the gut microbiome with beneficial microbes and bioactive metabolites that enhance immune function.” He noted that specific compounds present in Mbege, such as flavonoids, also likely contributed to improved immune responses and vascular health in the individuals who consumed the fermented beverage. In contrast to the nutrient-rich traditional African diet, the Western diet in the study lacked whole foods and included items such as: Holland pointed out that “Western diets are typically high in refined sugars, saturated fats, and processed foods, which can promote inflammation and oxidative stress and disrupt immune regulation.” This likely results from the direct impact of cholesterol, saturated fats, and sugars on immune and metabolic health, as well as indirect effects through changes in gut bacteria and weight gain, according to the researchers. “Given that Westernized diets promote chronic diseases, this study’s results are unsurprising—processed foods drive inflammation, whereas healthy traditional diets rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds help mitigate metabolic and immune dysfunction.” – Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS While the study showed promising results, the authors acknowledge a few limitations. These include the short duration of the research, a small sample size consisting only of men, and unrestricted food intake, which may have led to weight changes affecting immune and metabolic profiles. Despite these limitations, Mast emphasized the significant impact of dietary changes, even over just two weeks. He stated that the “study highlights the benefits of these traditional food products for inflammation and metabolic processes in the body.” “At the same time,” he said, “we show how harmful an unhealthy Western diet can be.” “Inflammation is at the root of many chronic conditions, which makes this study highly relevant for Western countries as well,” Mast noted. Holland agreed, saying that “these findings reinforce the idea that diet has a rapid and lasting impact on immune and metabolic health.” “Even short-term dietary changes can have long-lasting effects, suggesting that integrating more traditional, whole-food-based eating patterns could be a key strategy in disease prevention,” he added. In conclusion, Holland noted that “by preserving and adapting traditional plant-rich dietary patterns, individuals can enhance long-term health while maintaining cultural and regional food heritage.” Share this article There are claims that anti-inflammatory diets could help reduce the risk of some chronic conditions, but are these claims supported by scientific… Can we use food and diet as medicine?

 of adults in the United States have psoriasis. It causes skin symptoms, such as raised plaques and discoloration, and can also affect other parts of the body, such as the joints and eyes. Experts believe inflammation is the common factor that can affect these different areas. In people with psoriasis, immune system dysfunction causes inflammatory cells to build up in the middle layer of the skin, known as the dermis. The condition also speeds the growth of skin cells in the epidermis, the outer skin layer. Typically, skin cells grow and flake off in the span of a month. This process speeds up to just a few days in people with psoriasis. Instead of shedding, skin cells pile up on the skin’s surface, leading to uncomfortable symptoms such as raised plaques, scales, swelling, and redness or discoloration.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/alcohol-use-could-contribute-to-dementia-by-damaging-the-brain,Alcohol use could contribute to dementia by damaging the brain,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Trusted Source
, drinking alcohol can increase the risk of cancer, and excessive use can increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. One area of ongoing research is how alcohol can affect the brain. Published in Neurology, a recent study explored the impact of alcohol consumption on various aspects of the brain, specifically dementia-related neuropathologies. It found that moderate, heavy, and former heavy drinking were all associated with hyaline arteriolosclerosis
Trusted Source
, a distinct thickening and narrowing of the blood vessels that can happen in older people and those with certain health conditions. Former heavy drinking was also linked to having a lower brain mass ratio and poorer cognitive abilities compared to never drinking. While more research is needed, the results indicate the possible damaging effect of alcohol on the brain. This study was a cross-sectional population-based autopsy study conducted in Brazil. Researchers were able to examine the brains of 1,781 participants. These brains were ultimately from the Sao Paulo Autopsy Service and part of the Biobank for Aging Studies. It specifically excludes brain samples where someone died due to trauma. The average age of participants was around seventy-five years old, and the sample was ethnically diverse. Participants were at least fifty and had a next of kin who had been contacting them at least weekly in the 6 months before their death. Researchers did exclude some potential participants, including those with major acute brain lesions or those who did not have any data on alcohol consumption. Researchers were able to gather data from next of kin regarding factors like participants’ medical histories, alcohol consumption, and the presence of dementia. They divided participants into groups based on the level of alcohol they consumed. There were never drinkers, moderate drinkers, heavy drinkers, and formerly heavy drinkers. For this research, 1 dose of alcohol was 14 grams (g). Moderate drinkers had up to 7 doses of alcohol in a week, while heavy drinkers had 8 or more doses in a week. Former heavy drinkers were heavy drinkers who had ceased drinking up to 3 months before their deaths occurred. Of all participants, 965 never consumed alcohol. Researchers then sought to examine the brains for several changes, including those that indicated Alzheimer’s disease. They were also able to determine brain weight.

Your privacy is important to us Overall, the results showed worse outcomes related to alcohol consumption. Researchers adjusted for clinical variables and sociodemographic data, and found that moderate, heavy drinkers, and former heavy drinkers were at a greater risk for having hyaline arteriolosclerosis compared to participants who never had drunk alcohol. Heavy drinkers were specifically at 133% increased risk for hyaline arteriolosclerosis. Heavy and former heavy drinkers were also at an increased risk for neurofibrillary tangles, which are related to Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Former heavy drinkers also had lower brain weights. They had slightly higher average clinical dementia rating scores compared to never-drinkers. In this case, higher scores indicate worse cognitive function. There was no association between heavy and moderate drinking and cognitive function. The findings also indicated that drinking alcohol did not have an overall or direct effect on people’s cognitive abilities. Instead, researchers found that hyaline arteriolosclerosis mediated the association between alcohol consumption and cognitive abilities. This could indicate that alcohol affects hyaline arteriolosclerosis, which then may affect aspects of brain function. Haris Kamal, MD, a neurologist at Memorial Hermann, who was not involved in this research, noted the following about the study findings to Medical News Today: “The effect of alcohol on the human brain is dependent on multiple factors such as age, number of years of heavy alcohol use, overall health, nutritional intake etc. This study demonstrates that moderate to heavy alcohol use or even a history of prior heavy alcohol use is associated with more arteriosclerosis in the smallest arteries in the brain; such a progressive thickening of the arterial walls and increased deposition of neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein can lead to cognitive impairment including dementia.” The research does have some limitations. For one, researchers had to rely on family members for information such as clinical information and data on participants’ drinking habits. It is possible that these reports from next of kin were inaccurate. They also missed “longitudinal follow-up data” before participants’ deaths, such as on how long participants had been consuming alcohol. Furthermore, this study focused on people in one country, so data from other countries may also be useful in drawing stronger conclusions. The study did find that heavy drinkers were more likely to die early but had lower frequency of high blood pressure, neuropathologic lesions, and stroke when researchers did the univariate analysis. The authors think this could be because of survival bias, which is linked to lower life expectancy in this demographic. Researchers also note that since the study was cross-sectional, it does not show causality. The study’s cross-sectional nature also did not allow them to look at the long-term effects of components like heavy drinking. Moreover, it is possible that reverse causality is part of the reason for certain results, such as why they observed cognitive problems in former heavy drinkers. Finally, researchers did not examine participants’ vitamin deficiencies, which could have amplified the observed cognitive decline. Future studies should take vitamin status into account. Study author Alberto Justo, PhD, a researcher at the University of São Paulo Medical School, told MNT that: “Future research should focus on cohort studies to better understand the causal relationships between alcohol consumption and brain changes over time. This research will help clarify how different levels and durations of alcohol intake affect cognitive health.” Tony Thrasher, DO, MBA, CPE, DFAPA, who was not involved in this research, also cautioned that: “While there were limitations (well documented) pertaining to the thoroughness of data collection (from next of kin) and longitudinal knowledge of said alcohol consumption, the overall numbers are fairly striking. Past studies have already demonstrated that heavy drinkers die multiple years earlier when compared to nondrinkers. While still noting survival bias is present, the study gives hope to those health care providers who look for data sets to support them during motivational interviewing.” So far, the data indicate some very real potential dangers that alcohol consumption can pose to the brain. Justo noted that: “Our study found that even moderate alcohol consumption may lead to vascular changes in the brain, such as hyaline arteriolosclerosis. We also observed that former heavy drinkers had reduced brain mass and poorer cognitive abilities. This highlights how alcohol, even in moderate amounts, can significantly impact brain health. These findings suggest the need for increased awareness about the risks of alcohol consumption on brain health, even at moderate levels.” The findings could be highly relevant to clinical practice down the road. “Potential clinical implications of this study are the finding that heavy alcohol use or a history of heavy alcohol use can lead to accelerated subcortical disease in the brain which would manifest as a cognitive impairment,” Kamal. “Such people over time may progressively demonstrate paucity/slowness of thought, memory issues, trouble with executive functioning etc,” he explained, adding that “accumulation of such small vessel disease in the brain typically can lead to a condition called vascular dementia.” Share this article This podcast episode examines two studies that assess the impact type 2 diabetes has on brain health and explores three lifestyle interventions that… Dr. Kamar Ameen-Ali, who specializes in neurodegenerative diseases, and Paula Field, who is a caregiver for a parent with Alzheimer's, talk about the… Can we use food and diet as medicine?

Trusted Source
 globally were living with dementia — a neurological condition that impacts a person’s memory and thinking skills. Past studies show there are a number of modifiable lifestyle factors that may help reduce a person’s risk of developing dementia, such as regular exercise both earlier in life and at an older age. “Dementia affects millions of people worldwide and has a major impact not only on individuals, but also on families and healthcare systems,” Isadora Ribeiro, PhD, a São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) doctoral fellowship recipient at the School of Medical Sciences (FCM) at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil told Medical News Today. “Since there is still no cure [for dementia], finding ways to delay or prevent its onset — especially through accessible, non-pharmacological strategies — is essential to improve quality of life in aging.”
— Isadora Ribeiro, PhD Ribeiro is the first author of a new study recently published in the journal GeroScience reports that weight training may help protect the brains of older adults from dementia, including those already showing signs of mild cognitive impairment. For this study, researchers recruited 44 adults ages 55 or older with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. Study participants were divided into two groups. The weight training group participated in a resistance exercise program with moderate to high intensity sessions twice a week, with progressive loads, meaning weight or sets were increased as participants’ muscles strengthened. The control group did not exercise for the duration of the study. “We chose to study resistance training because its primary goal is to increase muscle strength, which is especially important in older adults,” Ribeiro explained. “Research has shown that greater muscle strength is associated with a lower risk of dementia and better cognitive function. Therefore, investigating the impact of resistance training on the brain anatomy of older adults at risk for dementia is a promising and relevant approach,” she told MNT.

Your privacy is important to us At the study’s conclusion, Ribeiro and her team found that after six months, participants in the weight training group showed improvement in verbal episodic memory

 and the strength of neurons and areas of the brain associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Conversely, the control group’s participants showed signs of worsening brain parameters. “This is an interesting finding because it suggests that weight training may not only help to increase cognition, but also prevent the development of atrophy in regions related to Alzheimer’s disease — potentially delaying progression or even preventing the onset of dementia,” Ribeiro details. “The fact that we observed changes in white matter integrity indicates that resistance training may directly affect the anatomical structure of neurons, which is essential for efficient communication between brain regions, supporting memory, attention, and overall cognitive function.”
— Isadora Ribeiro, PhD Scientists also discovered that five participants in the weight training group no longer had a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment when they reached the end of the study. “This suggests that weight training may alter the clinical trajectory of individuals with mild cognitive impairment, shifting them from an increased risk of dementia to preserved cognition by the end of the study,” Ribeiro said. “Even in a small sample, the fact that several participants showed improved cognitive health after the intervention is a hopeful indication of the potential protective effects of this type of exercise,” she said. “Weight training can reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and increase levels of neurotrophic factors like BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which support the growth and survival of neurons. It also improves cardiovascular health and cerebral blood flow, all of which are important for maintaining brain function. These physiological changes contribute to reducing key risk factors for dementia, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Additionally, physical exercise stimulates the release of irisin

, a hormone associated with neuroprotection and improved brain plasticity.”
— Isadora Ribeiro, PhD “We plan to explore the molecular mechanisms behind these effects, including biomarkers

 related to neuroplasticity, inflammation, and neurodegeneration,” Ribeiro added. MNT had the opportunity to speak with Gary Small, MD, chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey and author of numerous books on cognitive health and aging, including the New York Times best seller The Memory Bible, about this study. “These findings are consistent with previous research in animals and humans showing that strength training improves cognitive abilities,” Small commented. “Most of the previous studies demonstrating the brain health benefits of physical activity have focused on aerobic exercise, and that body of research has been compelling that regular physical exercise increases the volume of brain regions controlling memory and thinking.” “The present study demonstrates similar benefits from strength training. Moreover, it is never too late to begin a strength training program — older adults often experience tremendous benefits. In addition to improved stamina and energy, strength training helps older adults in their everyday tasks and may diminish risks of injuries due to falls

.”
— Gary Small, MD “Further research detailing the amount, cadence, and form of physical exercise that slows, stabilizes, or even reverses age-related cognitive decline will inform the public on how best to keep their bodies and brains functioning well throughout a long life,” Small added. MNT also talked to David Cutler, MD, a board certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, about this research. Cutler said he did not find the study’s findings surprising because doctors always recommend patients engage in exercise to help prevent cognitive decline. “I hadn’t seen any studies specifically looking at resistance training, but that wasn’t a surprise, that it was reinforcing that the things that patients are doing in terms of resistance exercises are most likely helpful,” he continued. “Anytime people engage in any activity, whether it’s exercise, dietary, supplements, or medications, we want to make sure the benefits exceed the risks. And exercise training, especially for older people, can entail some risk. So these exercises need to be guided by someone to make sure patients don’t incur injuries when they’re doing them,” he underscored. “I think we want to see (this study) in larger numbers, in both men and women, in people with other medical conditions, to make sure that we’re not putting people at risk when they’re undergoing these types of exercise regimens,” Cutler added.

Trusted Source
, finds that people with type 2 diabetes who take two common anti-diabetes medications had a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s and associated dementias. The drugs in question were glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), like Ozempic and Wegovy, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), like Jardiance. Specifically, GLP-1RA was linked to a 33% lower risk of dementia, and SGLT2i was linked to a 43% lower risk. Other diabetes medications, however, were not associated with a change in risk. As the average age of the population steadily rises, the number of dementia cases rises in step. Despite decades of intensive research, a cure remains elusive. Although some treatments can slow progress, we are far from a breakthrough. Adding to these challenges, if an effective drug were found, it would take many years to build up a sufficient evidence base and millions of dollars to bring it to market. For these reasons, some researchers are focusing on existing drugs. If they can identify a drug that is already widely used and helps lower the risk of dementia, it would be a much shorter road to wider availability. Some recent research has suggested that type 2 diabetes and dementia may share some physiological similarities, including inflammation and impaired insulin signalling in the brain. People with diabetes also have a higher risk of developing dementia. This raises an interesting question: If a drug reduces the impact of type 2 diabetes, might it also reduce the risk of dementia? Scientists have now investigated this question, and some evidence does suggest that diabetes medication may reduce dementia risk. However, as the authors of the latest study explain, we need more evidence. To build the clearest picture to date, they used “a more rigorous methodological approach and robust adjustment for confounding factors.” To investigate, the scientists accessed data from Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. In total, this amounted to 92,160 people aged 50 or older with type 2 diabetes. Participants were followed until they died or developed dementia, including Alzheimer’s, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia. They focused on three comparisons: The scientists concluded that GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is were associated with a reduced risk of developing dementias compared with second-line diabetes drugs. “GLP-1RA use was associated with a 33% lower risk of [dementia], while SGLT2i use was associated with a 43% lower risk compared with other [glucose-lowering drugs],” the authors write. Medical News Today contacted William Kapp, MD, a longevity expert and CEO of Fountain Life, not involved in tis study. Kapp shared his thoughts on the findings, saying: “The results didn’t shock me — but they did give more credence to what we’ve been observing. Brain and body don’t age separately. Metabolic problems such as insulin resistance are linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, and altered blood flow — all of which impact brain health.” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us Although scientists do not know for sure how GLP-1RA and SGLT2i may reduce dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes, the authors suggest some potential mechanisms. For instance, GLP-1RAs have been shown to: Similarly, SGLT2is may protect the brain by: The scientists also explain that both drugs are associated with improved metabolic and vascular health, both of which may support healthy brain function. Additionally, there is some evidence that these drugs can reduce levels of amyloid-beta and tau proteins in the brain — the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Speaking with the Science Media Center, Prof. David Strain,MD, FRCP, associate professor of cardiometabolic health at the University of Exeter Medical School in the United Kingdom, similarly not involved in the study, explained that: “GLP-1 receptor antagonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to control the sugar, and also reduce the inflammation (a key driver of Alzheimer’s disease) and reduce vascular risk (a key driver of vascular dementia) more than would be expected by the sugar control alone.” “It is therefore no surprise that these data show a lower risk of dementia in people who receive them as part of her routine care,” Strain continued. This study, which analyzed data from almost 100,000 people is supported by a number of previous studies. However, a paper published in the same journal and on the same day casts a small portion of doubt on the results. The paper in question, also published in JAMA Neurology
Trusted Source
, is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 clinical trials including data from 164,531 participants. According to its authors, “glucose-lowering therapy with GLP1-RAs, but not SGLT2is, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in dementia or cognitive impairment.” So, their conclusions on GLP1-RAs mirror those from the original paper, but they did not find the same effect for SGLT2is. This may be partly due to the short duration of follow-up. The average study follow-up in the meta-analysis and the follow-up in the original study were under 5 years. As dementia takes many years to develop, this may not be long enough. “It’s still early, and we’re still not seeing all the long-term data,” Kapp told MNT. But what we’re seeing is that regulating insulin and inflammation might also slow down some of the changes in the brain tied to dementia.” The inevitable next question is: Will these drugs reduce dementia risk in people without diabetes? “If the benefit is from reducing insulin resistance or inflammation, it’s possible that these drugs could be good for people without diabetes,” Kapp told MNT before injecting some caution. “Just because something is good for one group doesn’t mean it is for others. And there are always risks to long-term use,” he warned. For now, the jury is — at least in part — out. We may have to wait for longer studies before we can draw solid conclusions. Still, it is looking increasingly likely that GLP1-RAs might reduce the risk of dementia for people with type 2 diabetes, which is certainly a positive finding.

And a study published in July 2023 discovered a potential link between artificial sweeteners and heightened probability for type 2 diabetes. Now, a new study recently published in the journal PLOS Medicine has found that two certain mixtures of common food additives can increase a person’s chance of developing type 2 diabetes. For this study, researchers analyzed nutritional data from almost 109,000 adults, with an average age of about 43, who participated in the French NutriNet-Santé cohort between 2009 and 2023. “In the past three decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in most countries,” Mathilde Touvier, PhD, (she/her) team leader of the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team CRESS-EREN at the National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm/Inrae/Cnam/Université Sorbonne Paris Nord/Université Paris Cité) in France and lead author of this study told Medical News Today. “Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for several other chronic pathologies such as cardiovascular diseases
Trusted Source
. Diet represents one of the most important modifiable risk factors for this pathology.”
— Mathilde Touvier, PhD Scientists determined the types of food additives participants were exposed to through food composition databases and laboratory evaluations, as well as the mixtures of food additives they consumed. “So far, research and safety evaluation of food additives has been conducted on a substance-by-substance basis, while in real-life, food additive mixtures are consumed by billions of people globally,” Marie Payen de la Garanderie, PhD student on the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team CRESS-EREN at the National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm/Inrae/Cnam/Université Sorbonne Paris Nord/Université Paris Cité) in France first author of the study explained to MNT. “Some experimental studies have raised concerns about potential interactions between additives within mixtures and their potential impact on health — including metabolic health — but human epidemiological data are lacking.

One mixture featured emulsifier additives, including modified starches, pectin, guar gum, carrageenan, polyphosphates, and xanthan gum, as well as the preservative potassium sorbate
Trusted Source
 and food dye curcumin. “Most of these food additives are markers of ultra-processed foods — emulsifiers, artificial sweeteners, (and) dyes,” Touvier explained. “The mixtures observed here result both from the composition of foods containing multiple additives and the association of foods frequently consumed together. The food groups most correlated with one of the mixtures (mixture 2 in the study) were broth, dairy desserts, and fats and sauces.” The second food additive mixture linked to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes included acidifiers and acid regulators such as citric acid, dyes including ammonia caramel
Trusted Source
, artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and sucralose, and some emulsifiers. “The food groups most correlated with ‘mixture 5’ were artificially sweetened soft drinks and other drinks,” Payen de la Garanderie said. “To our knowledge, this study is the first to estimate the exposure to food additive mixtures in a large population-based cohort and investigate their link with type 2 diabetes incidence. These results suggest that food additives found in a wide variety of products and frequently consumed together may potentially represent a modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes prevention.”
— Marie Payen de la Garanderie, first author of the study “They also suggest that it may be of interest to consider potential interaction/synergistic/antagonist effects when assessing the safety of food additives and call for a re-evaluation of regulations governing their use by the food industry, with the aim of enhancing consumer protection,” Touvier added. “They support public health recommendations to limit non-essential additives.” MNT had the opportunity to speak with Mir Ali, MD, a board certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. Ali commented that this was an interesting study showing how food additives can affect health. “As society in general moves towards more processed foods and an increasing number of additives, it is important to understand how these additives can increase the risk for diabetes. Diabetes can be a devastating disease, and finding ways to prevent diabetes is very important,” he said. “What would be helpful is to identify foods with the combination of additives that increase the risk for diabetes, and looking at how eliminating these foods affects diabetes risk,” Ali added. Meanwhile, the International Council of Beverages Associations (ICBA) called the study’s results “misleading” and confusing for consumers. “Decades of robust scientific evidence show these ingredients are safe. Suggesting that recipes—a combination of safe ingredients—are worrisome is simply absurd,” ICBA Executive Director Kate Loatman told MNT. “Due to the study design, the authors cannot accurately identify the exact ingredients participants possibly ate years before potential changes in health outcomes were observed, and they are not able to do more than speculate how various recipes might impact health. Therefore, they cannot make any conclusive findings about the safety of these ingredients or their links to health outcomes,” she added. As previous research shows that ultra-processed foods make up 50% or more of the dietary caloric intake of high-income countries, obviously many people are consuming food additives every day. MNT asked Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, for her top tips on how readers can cut back on the amount of food additives they consume, especially if they are prediabetic or are already at a high risk for type 2 diabetes. “(Lean) on Mother Nature and your local farmers to consume more whole foods and less ‘shelf-stable’ packaged items that don’t have a label,” Richard suggested. “Hit the farmer’s market or grocer’s produce section and stock up on vegetables, herbs, fruits, (and) dry beans. Grab bulk foods such as nuts … (and) seeds.” Richard also advised readers to explore simplified beverages like water, unsweetened tea, homemade lemonade, 100% juice, or carbonated basics like club soda with lemon and mint, and also to cook more. “Recipes call for whole, real food as ingredients and synthetic manufactured fillers, enhancers, thickeners and preservatives are typically not needed for palatability. Savor food by adding flavor — add spices or play with variations of cuisine such as smoked paprika, curries, Spanish, Mexican or Thai flavors.”

Trusted Source
 caused by cardiovascular disease. SCD occurs when a person experiencing sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) — where their heart suddenly stops pumping — is not treated successfully, and usually happens within 1 hour of disease symptoms occurring. People with heart disease are also at an increased risk of developing depression, and some studies further show that depression is a risk factor
Trusted Source
 for SCD. Previous research has moreover suggested that some antidepressant medications are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular issues, including SCD
Trusted Source
, stroke, and atrial fibrillation. “Antidepressants are commonly prescribed for psychiatric conditions such as depression or OCD,” Jasmin Mujkanovic, MD, a doctoral researcher in the Department of Cardiology at Rigshospitalet Hjertecentret in Denmark told Medical News Today. “These medications can have potential adverse effects such as QT prolongation [when the heart muscle takes longer to contract and relax], which may increase the risk for adverse arrhythmic events, and in rare cases, SCD. It is important to recognize that having depression is itself an independent risk factor for SCD/cardiovascular disease.” – Jasmin Mujkanovic, MD Mujkanovic is the first author of a new study recently presented at EHRA 2025, the scientific congress of the European Society of Cardiology, which further confirms that antidepressant use may increase a person’s risk for SCD, and differs between age groups and years of medication use. For this study, Mujkanovic and his team analyzed medical information and death certificates for Denmark adult residents between the ages of 18 and 90 in 2010. Researchers categorized participants by whether or not they had experienced SCD, and by their antidepressant medication use — between 1 and 5 years, or 6 years and longer. At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that participants who used antidepressants for a period of 1 to 5 years had a 56% increased risk of SCD. Participants who used antidepressants for 6 or more years had a 2.2 times higher risk for SCD. “The significance of these findings suggest that longer exposure time increases the risk for SCD,” Mujkanovic said. “However, it is important to be cautious when interpreting this. Longer duration might reflect more severe or persistent depression, which itself contributes to cardiovascular risk. It is difficult to disentangle the effects of medication from the underlying condition.” When breaking down study results by age groups, researchers found some differences in antidepressant use and SCD risk. For participants between the ages of 30–39, those who used antidepressants for 1 to 5 years were three times more likely to experience SCD than those who did not take the medications. This risk increased to five times higher if they used antidepressants for 6 or more years. In the 50-59 age group, 1 to five years use of antidepressant medications doubled their SCD risk, and quadrupled for those using the drugs for 6 or more years. And when looking at participants between the ages of 40 to 79, scientists found their SCD incidence rate ratio was significantly higher for those who used antidepressants for 6 years or more compared to those who used them for 1 to 5 years. “Within each age group, those exposed to antidepressants had a higher risk of SCD, compared to their unexposed peers,” Mujkanovic explained. “However, overall, a 30-39 year old on antidepressants would still have a lower absolute risk than an unexposed 70-79 year old,“ he noted. “This is largely due to competing risk, as baseline risk for SCD increases with age. While antidepressant exposure may increase relative risk in younger individuals, their absolute risk remains lower than that of older individuals.” However, Mujkanovic also provided some reassurance: “The main takeaway [from this study] is please do not panic if you are on antidepressants. Although the study shows that the risk is increased among the exposed, depression is itself an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and SCD. The increased risk is most likely multifactorial, and this highlights the need for a more holistic approach to managing mental health as well as cardiovascular health in these patients.” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us MNT had the opportunity to speak with Cheng-Han Chen, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, about this study. “This study found an association between antidepressant use and future risk of SCD,” Chen, who was not involved in the research, commented. “As this was a population study, the direction of causality cannot be determined.“ “It may be that the antidepressants increased arrhythmias in patients, leading to an increased risk of SCD,” he hypothesized. “However, it is also possible that the underlying depression itself led to increased SCD, through increasing cardiovascular risk factors. Patients taking antidepressant medications should talk to their physicians before making any changes to their medications.” “There is a close relationship between depression and other areas of a person’s health, such as their heart health,” he continued. “Untreated depression can increase someone’s risk of developing heart disease, and many people with heart disease experience depression,” Chen further explained. ”Antidepressant medications can thus play an important role in improving many aspects of an individual’s health. Future research is needed to determine the mechanisms by which antidepressants might increase someone’s risk of SCD.” MNT also spoke with Grant R. Simons, MD, chief of Heart Rhythm Services at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, not involved in the study, about this research. Simons commented that while the findings might seem alarming at first glance, it is crucial to consider the limitations of observational studies and avoid jumping to conclusions about causality. “Further research is needed to understand the complex relationship between psychiatric disorders, antidepressant use, and SCD risk,” he continued. “Patients should discuss any concerns about their medication with their doctor and not discontinue treatment abruptly. While a 56% increased risk and a doubled risk with longer-term use sounds dramatic, it’s important to interpret these findings cautiously and within a broader context.” For example, Simons said the study shows an association, not necessarily a causal link, and this research needs to be examined for whether it differentiates between classes of antidepressants. “It’s possible that other factors related to having a psychiatric disorder and taking antidepressants, such as lifestyle, other medications, or the underlying illness itself, contribute to the increased risk of SCD,” he continued. “For example, it is important to recognize that the use of antidepressants for longer periods of time may be a marker for other risk factors for sudden death. The study may have controlled for some of these, but it’s difficult to account for everything.” “It’s important to see how this study aligns with previous research on this topic,” Simons added. “If other studies have shown similar findings, it strengthens the evidence. If this study contradicts previous research, more investigation is needed.” Share this article In this episode of our podcast, Feature Editor Maria Cohut discusses matters related to diet and heart health with Dr. Oyinlola Oyebode from Queen… Dr. Najaf Amin and mental health advocate Rachel Kelly join Medical News Today in conversation about why and how diet might help fight symptoms of… For Medical News Today's In Conversation podcast for May, we delve into research on the future of mental health, with a focus on psychedelics and… Brisk walking just five minutes a day could help lower the risk of heart rhythm abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation or tachycardia, new… People who are only able to work out on the weekends still reap important health benefits, including a lowered risk of death from cardiovascular… Keep up with the ever-changing world of medical science with new and emerging developments in health.

Trusted Source
 adults in the United States have obesity. With so many foods and beverages marketed to people trying to lose weight, scientists wonder how effective they are at satiating appetites. Some non-caloric sweeteners available include sucralose (Splenda), aspartame (Equal), and saccharin (Sweet ‘N Low). While people often use these when cutting calories, there are possible health effects. Researchers from the Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute of the University of Southern California conducted a study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to determine brain blood flow in the hypothalamus after consuming sucralose, sucrose, or water. Increased hypothalamic blood flow suggests an increase in hunger signals in the brain. The study findings indicate that sucralose may trigger strong hunger signals, potentially increasing appetite and leading to overeating when compared to sucrose and water. The findings appear in Nature Metabolism
Trusted Source
. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener that, according to the existing research, has a “sweetness potency approximately 385 to 650-fold higher than sucrose [table sugar] by weight.” The researchers examined how sucralose impacts people with a group of 75 adults ages 18 to 35 from three different weight categories: healthy, overweight, and obese. Each participant attended three sessions where they drank either a sucralose-sweetened drink, a sucrose-sweetened drink, or water. The researchers used MRI scans to measure brain blood flow in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus plays many roles, including regulating body temperature and hormone release, as well as hunger. Before consuming the beverage, participants underwent a baseline MRI scan and provided their hunger rating. After finishing the drink, the researchers collected more data after 10 minutes, 35 minutes, and 120 minutes. Once the researchers concluded all sessions, they compared the MRI scans and the participants’ reports to determine how sucralose impacts brain signaling. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us The researchers found that, overall, sucralose not only increased blood flow in the hypothalamus compared to water, but to sucrose as well. This indicates a stronger hunger-related brain response which could lead to stimulating the appetite rather than suppressing it. While this was the finding for the group as a whole, when breaking down responses among weight group and sex, the results vary a bit. People at healthy weights showed a stronger increase in hypothalamic activity after sucralose consumption than after sucrose. People in the overweight category did not show significant differences in hypothalamic blood flow in response to any drink. For people with obesity, hunger-related brain activity increased after drinking sucralose compared to water, but not compared to regular sugar. While sucralose use did not seem to significantly affect hunger responses in people with overweight, the results suggest that it may still significantly impact a large percentage of people overall. When taking sex into consideration, females showed a stronger response to sucralose over sucrose and water. The researchers believe this supports the notion that women may have a stronger brain response to food cues. The researchers also noted that their functional connectivity analysis showed that, compared to table sugar, sucralose “significantly increased coupling between the hypothalamus and the anterior cingulate cortex.” This is significant because this area of the brain impacts reward processing and could intensify food cravings. Taking a look at how participants rated their hunger levels, at the start of the experiment, people reported similar hunger levels across all drink sessions — their initial hunger was about the same no matter which drink they were about to consume. However, the type of drink the participants drank affected how they rated their hunger afterward. The participants felt hungrier after consuming sucralose versus sugar but did not report this effect compared to drinking water. The researchers believe that sucralose does not trigger hormones that tell the body it is full. While the researchers note that this area needs more research, the findings suggest that the non-caloric sweetener sucralose may inadvertently affect the brain and trigger the hunger response. Considering that many people use this sweetener to avoid calories and lose weight, this is important to keep in mind when making food and beverage choices since sucralose has the potential to cause hunger and increase food intake. Mir Ali, MD, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center, spoke with Medical News Today about the study. “Based on this study, it seems that the brain processes non-caloric sweeteners to the same or greater extent than actual sugar,” said Ali. Ali said the study findings may impact clinical recommendations. “We already recommend that our patients emphasize protein and non-starchy vegetables in the diet and minimize carbohydrates and sugars,” Ali noted. “After this study, I’m also inclined to recommend my patients minimize non-caloric sweeteners as well.” Eliza Whitaker, MS, RDN, founder and registered dietitian at Nourished Nutrition and Fitness, also chimed in on the study for MNT: “This could suggest that the brain expects energy from calories when eating something sweet. However, this expectation is not met when consuming non-caloric sweeteners, like sucralose, which may prevent the processes within the hypothalamus that reduce appetite after eating something sweet from occurring the way they do when consuming calorie-containing sweeteners.” Whitaker said the study findings would not impact clinical recommendations at this time, since more research is needed, but did say that it may need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. “It may be beneficial to assess sucralose intake for someone who has made other dietary adjustments and feels they are still unable to reach their health goals,” commented Whitaker.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/shingles-vaccine-could-prevent-1-in-5-dementia-cases,Shingles vaccine could prevent 1 in 5 dementia cases,"Globally, the number of people affected by dementia increased
Trusted Source
 by 117% between 1990 and 2016, with more than 57 million people now affected by the condition. And numbers are projected to rise to more than 150 million by 2050. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise
Trusted Source
 that people can help reduce their risk of developing dementia by maintaining an active lifestyle and healthy diet, and controlling conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. However, some risk factors, including age and genetics, are beyond a person’s control. Research has shown that viral infections, particularly those that affect the nervous system, are associated with an increased risk of dementia. Now, a study led by scientists from Stanford Medicine, published in Nature
Trusted Source
, has demonstrated that vaccination against shingles, which occurs when the varicella zoster virus
Trusted Source
 reactivates some time after initial infection, could decrease dementia risk by as much as 20%. The researchers suggest this provides further evidence of the link between viral infection and dementia, and that the vaccine could be a cost-effective way of reducing the risk of dementia. Courtney M. Kloske, PhD, Alzheimer’s Association director of Scientific Engagement, not involved in this study, commented for Medical News Today that: “This new study adds to our current knowledge by suggesting the shingles vaccine may also reduce someone’s risk of developing dementia. These new results, while preliminary, call for further studies in large, diverse study populations to inform public health strategy regarding whether vaccinations can decrease our risk of developing dementia as we age.” The study took advantage of a health policy in Wales which, on September 1, 2013, introduced the shingles vaccine, using a live-attenuated (weakened) form of the virus. The health authority offered the vaccine to all 79-year-olds (born on or after September 1, 1933), but anyone born before September 1, 1933 was not eligible. By selecting those born one week either side of September 1, 1933, the researchers had two age-matched groups of people, one of which had received the shingles vaccine and one which had not. Senior author on the study, Pascal Geldsetzer, MD, PhD, MPH, assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University, said in a press release that “[w]hat makes the study so powerful is that it’s essentially like a randomized trial with a control group — those a little bit too old to be eligible for the vaccine — and an intervention group — those just young enough to be eligible.” The researchers compared the health outcomes of both groups for the next 7 years. About half of those eligible for the vaccine received it, compared with almost none of those not eligible. In their analysis, they allowed for the fact that not everyone who was eligible for the vaccine received it. During the 7 year follow up, of the 296,324 people in the sample, 14,465 had at least one diagnosis of shingles. Those who had received the vaccine had a 37.2% lower relative risk of getting shingles than those were unvaccinated. In this study, the researchers did not differentiate between different types of dementia. A person was recorded as having dementia if there was a new diagnosis of dementia in the electronic health record data, or if dementia was listed on their death certificate as a primary or contributory cause of death. A total of 35,307 people were newly diagnosed with dementia during the 7-year follow-up period. Of these, people who had received the shingles vaccine were 3.5% less likely to receive a dementia diagnosis, which corresponds to a relative reduction of 20%. Steven Allder, MD, consultant neurologist at Re:Cognition Health, not involved in this research, told MNT that: “The findings strengthen the case for encouraging shingles vaccination in older adults. If further research confirms the link between the vaccine and lower dementia risk, it could make vaccination an even more compelling public health strategy. Given the high economic and social costs of dementia care, a relatively inexpensive vaccine could prove to be a cost-effective preventive measure.” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us The effect of the vaccination on dementia risk differed markedly between the sexes, with a much greater reduction in new diagnoses of dementia in women than men. This was seen despite the vaccination having similar effects on diagnoses of shingles and postherpetic neuralgia
Trusted Source
 — chronic nerve pain that can last up to several months after shingles — in both men and women. “This could be due to biological differences in immune response between men and women,” Allder suggested. “Women generally have stronger immune reactions to vaccines, which might lead to a greater protective effect. Additionally, shingles is more common in women, so reducing its occurrence in this group might have a more pronounced impact on dementia rates,” he explained. In the United States, the CDC
Trusted Source
 recommend the shingles vaccination, Shingrix, for those aged 50 or over, and for anyone over the age of 19 with a weakened immune system. Medicare or insurance may cover all or part of it. Generally in the U.S., the vaccine costs around $400 for the 2-dose course. According to the CDC, the vaccine is not associated with any severe adverse events, and is over 90% effective in preventing shingles. In the United Kingdom, the shingles vaccine is provided free by the National Health Service (NHS) to people between the ages of 60 and 80 and those who are immunocompromised
Trusted Source
. Each dose of the 2-dose course costs the NHS £160. It is also available privately, costing around £460 for two doses. The researchers who conducted the current study suggest that if further research verifies their findings, the shingles vaccine could be a much more cost-effective way to prevent or delay the condition than existing pharmaceutical interventions. Nevertheless, some key questions remain in place. The current study assessed dementia risk in people who had received the older vaccine, which used a live-attenuated form of the virus. Shingrix is a recombinant zoster vaccine. David Cutler, MD, board-certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, not involved in the research, urged some caution about the findings. Cutler asked: “If the effect on dementia was real, was it due to the vaccine or was it due to the lower incidence of shingles in the study population?“ “Clearly the Zostavax vaccine was effective at preventing shingles. However,“ he cautioned, “that vaccine is no longer available in the United States. Instead, we have the much more effective Shingrix vaccine.” “Until a study is done comparing the Zostavax and Shingrix vaccines, involving thousands of people over many years (very costly, and unlikely to occur) it won’t be known if the Shingrix vaccine will yield comparable effects,” he told MNT. According to Allder: “While this study provides strong evidence of a link between shingles vaccination and lower dementia risk, a randomized controlled trial would be needed to establish a definitive causal relationship. If confirmed, this could shift public health priorities and encourage further research into how vaccines might play a role in preventing neurodegenerative diseases.” Cutler agreed. “For now, a good take home point is that shingles vaccines are effective for preventing shingles, which is adequate reason for getting this vaccine if you are eligible. An additional, benefit might be protection against dementia,” he told us. However, he added that: “This protection is far from assured.

However, people are not always diagnosed at the beginning of the disease — they can be diagnosed at different stages, which can influence how they are treated. Now, researchers at WashU Medicine in St. Louis, MO, have developed a blood test that can not only help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease but also provide insight to doctors on how far the disease has progressed, helping them determine the right treatment path. A study on this new blood test was recently published in the journal Nature Medicine

 in Alzheimer’s disease in previous research published in August 2023. “MTBR-tau243 is a chipped (off) piece of the protein in Alzheimer’s tau tangles,” Randall J. Bateman, MD, the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine in St. Louis, MO, and co-senior author of this study explained to Medical News Today. “The blood test measures this piece of tau tangles in the blood as a measure of how many tangles are in the brain.” “New biomarkers are tools that allow us to track the disease in different ways,” Bateman continued. “Just like doctors use a stethoscope, x-ray, and CAT scan to measure different aspects of the disease, these biomarkers enable us to measure different aspects of Alzheimer’s disease. By tracking different processes of Alzheimer’s disease, we can better diagnose, predict and even develop new and better treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.” “The new biomarker — plasma eMTBR-tau243 — reflects changes in tau pathology occurring in the clinical symptomatic phase of Alzheimer’s disease and can be used to stage Alzheimer’s disease tauopathy, and to determine if cognitive symptoms are likely due to Alzheimer’s disease tau pathology,” added Kanta Horie, PhD, voluntary research associate professor of neurology at WashU Medicine in St. Louis, MO, and both co-first and co-corresponding author of this study. “Also, many therapeutic developments are ongoing including anti-amyloid and anti-tau drugs. We believe that this new biomarker becomes the key to establish the plasma biomarkers panel to stage Alzheimer’s disease, which would open the new window of precision medicine era for Alzheimer’s disease.” During the study, researchers tested study participants from three main stages of Alzheimer’s disease: presymptomatic, early-stage with mild cognitive impairments
Trusted Source
, and late symptomatic disease where participants have been diagnosed with dementia. The scientists found that blood MTBR-tau243 levels reflected the amount of tau tangles in the brain with 92% accuracy. Among participants showing cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, researchers discovered that MTBR-tau243 levels were significantly higher for participants at the mild cognitive stage, and up to 200 times higher for those in the late symptomatic disease stage. “The cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease is highly associated with (tau) neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) pathology in (the) brain, not amyloid plaques pathology. Since we know that NFTs are more generated in the dementia stage in Alzheimer’s disease, it is reasonable for us to see the drastic increase of MTBR-tau243 in the dementia stage compared to the preclinical Alzheimer’s disease stage, which suggests the validation to characterize the plasma MTBR-tau243 biomarker as the tau NFTs-specific biomarker.”

Bateman, MD MNT spoke with Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD, director of the Division of Geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center and co-director of the Center for Memory Loss and Brain Health at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this study. Parulekar commented that this blood test represents a logical next step in Alzheimer’s diagnosis and treatment, building upon previous research and addressing significant unmet needs. “Scientists have identified key biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s, such as amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain,” she explained. “Earlier diagnostic methods, like PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, could detect these biomarkers, but they are expensive, invasive, and not readily accessible.” “A blood test offers a much simpler and less costly alternative. There’s a growing understanding that early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, which is a complex process, is crucial for effective intervention. Current treatments, while limited, may be more beneficial in the early stages of the disease. A readily available blood test could enable much earlier detection than current methods, allowing for earlier intervention and potentially slowing disease progression.”
— Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD “The initial study needs to be replicated in larger and more diverse populations to confirm its accuracy and reliability across different demographics, ethnicities, and stages of the disease,” Parulekar added. “This includes testing individuals with other neurological conditions to ensure specificity. Clear and standardized protocols for blood collection, processing, and analysis must be established to ensure consistent and reproducible results across different laboratories and healthcare settings.” Share this article A seminal study on Alzheimer's disease has come under fire for alleged image manipulation.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/through-my-eyes-stem-cell-donation,Through My Eyes: Stem cell donation,"After being on a list of potential donors for 12 years or so, this past month saw me finally have the opportunity to give away some of my stem cells. The opportunity to experience first-hand a procedure I have read, written, and edited articles on at Medical News Today. On paper, stem cell donation can sound a bit intimidating. While donating blood may be easy to visualize, stem cells feel more abstract. The name conjures images of microscopes, laboratories, and horribly invasive procedures. I am happy to report that there was nothing horrible about my experience at all! And while it was not exactly a walk in the park — more a run in a wood — it is something that I would encourage folks to consider if they are able to do so. I can’t remember exactly when it was that I signed up on the stem cell register but 12 years ago feels about right. At the time, I was working at a local hospital booking day surgery appointments for people. One day, some people from the charity came in to try and sign National Health Service employees and medical students up. It seemed like the thing to do at the time, and so my name was added to the register, joining over 800,000 others. The charity in question was the British organization Anthony Nolan. They work to provide stem cells and bone marrow donations to patients with forms of blood cancer or blood disorders. The charity also supports research into new treatments for other conditions. To call stem cells “useful” would be doing them a disservice. Stem cells are cells that do not yet have a specific role within the body. When they divide, they have the potential to develop into cells with a specific function. This process is known as differentiation. Each of the many different specialized cells of the adult human body were stem cells, to begin with. Doctors and scientists can use stem cells to help treat certain conditions. Skin stem cells can aid with tissue regeneration to treat skin damage, and blood stem cells can form a crucial part of treatment for blood diseases such as leukemia. Not only that, but researchers can also use stem cells in studies to either find out the causes of certain diseases or to develop new drug treatments for conditions.

Your privacy is important to us A few months ago, I received a phone call asking if I would be interested in donating some cells to be used in a study. With my consent given over the phone, it was time for me to move into uncharted territory. The possibility of donating stem cells had always just been that: a possibility, a thought, an idea. Certainly nothing as concrete or tangible as a trip up from Brighton to London for a health check. Clinical staff provided more detailed information about what was coming so that I could provide written consent. Questions were asked to assess my likelihood of carrying any bloodborne diseases. Blood and urine samples were taken, my body mass index (BMI) was measured, and a COVID-19 test was carried out. A common experience for people who work with health information articles is to feel as though you are developing whatever condition you have most recently written about. This can be useful from time to time. I had an irregular-looking mole removed after working on a melanoma article, for instance. However, it can also leave you fearing the worst when all you have done is perhaps eaten too much beetroot. This neuroticism made waiting for my health check results a slightly nervous affair. Thankfully, I was happy to discover that everything was okay. My fears of gross malnourishment due to a disorganized vegan diet proved to be completely unfounded. I was on to the next stage of my donation journey. The hospital was ready and prepared to have me in to donate my stem cells. I now needed to prepare my body for the process. From here on out, there will be quite a bit about injections and needles! If you want to avoid this and skip to the end, you can click on this link. To improve the chances of collecting a good amount of stem cells, donors take a series of injections in the days running up to the collection date. The injections contain a protein called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which helps boost levels of stem cells in the bloodstream. I had never injected anything before. I am typically quite happy to receive injections — my COVID-19 vaccinations were wonderful — but being the person to push down on the syringe was quite a daunting prospect. Thankfully a nurse walked me through the first day of injecting. They explained that I would need to inject two separate doses of G-CSF into either my thigh or belly once a day for 4 days, alternating between the two areas so as not to cause them to ache too much. The process involved pinching flesh from the thigh or belly and injecting into that. When I was able to grab a good chunk, pushing down with the needle was a fairly simple task. At these times I could barely perceive it piercing my skin. Once I had fully depressed the syringe, there was a click. Releasing my grip at this point would cause the needle to automatically retract, ready for disposal in the sharps bin the nurse had provided. All that was left was for me to do this one more time and that would be my injecting for the day. I soon grew used to this new addition to my lunchtime routine. Stop work. Inject myself twice. Have a sandwich. Do some laundry. Return to work. The only adverse effects were some slight body aches, particularly in my lower back, and a general feeling of being run down. These are typical for G-CSF injections. I reported to the hospital and was admitted to the apheresis unit at 2 p.m. for the “harvesting” of my stem cells. This term made it sound as though the procedure was going to be a brutal process straight out of a dystopian science fiction story. This was not the case! After being assigned a bed and doing some preliminary checks, a nurse began to set things up. All the heavy lifting was going to be done by a cell-separating machine. The nurse inserted a needle into a vein in my left arm from which my blood was drawn into the machine. The machine then separated the blood into its separate components: red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, and platelets. Once the blood was separated, the parts containing my precious stem cells were taken away, leaving the rest of the blood to return to me. The nurse inserted another needle into a vein in my right arm, and the blood was able to rejoin my bloodstream here from the machine. After this had been set up, all that was left to do was wait while the machine did its thing with my blood. My left arm had to remain stationary, although I was permitted to squeeze a stress ball to aid circulation. My right arm was free, however, to play Pokémon on my phone, turn the pages of my book, or struggle with eating the soup and rice pudding that came with my lunch. From time to time, I would look over at the machine. I could see the tubes carrying blood into this strange device with its turning wheels and rhythmic humming. It really was like something out of a science fiction story, only tempered with the mundanity of waiting in a queue at the post office to send a parcel. Overall, there was nowhere near the level of discomfort that the name “harvesting” had suggested. The sites on my arms where the needles went in were a bit sore and provided a dull ache throughout the procedure. My left forearm also felt as though I had been sitting on it at certain times, but a few squeezes of the stress ball soon sorted this out. The other main side effect I experienced was a tingling sensation around my mouth. This is a fairly typical symptom of the blood thinner that the machine uses during the process to prevent the blood from clotting. When this occurred, the nurse provided me with a calcium tablet, and within a few minutes, the symptom was gone. I lay on the bed hooked up to the machine for 2 and a half hours in total. During that time, I caught many Pokémon, made great progress reading my book, and just about managed to eat my lunch without making too much of a mess. The ache in my arms was a constant presence, but overshadowed significantly by how difficult it was to transport soup from a bowl to my mouth. At 5 p.m., the nurse was ready to discharge me. The needles were removed from my arms and a bag full of my stem cells was labeled and packed up, ready to go off to a laboratory. The nurse advised me to drink plenty of water and to take things easy for the next few days. I felt tired, a little short of energy or enthusiasm for anything, but otherwise could feel no ill effects of my afternoon in the hospital. It is typical for people to experience bone aches for a few days after the procedure, along with tiredness. This was the same for me, too. I was fine to return to work as normal the following day, and the only adjustment I made to my routine was to skip playing soccer for a week. The doctor who had seen me for my health check had explained that my spleen would have shrunk during the procedure, and avoiding contact sports would allow it time to return to its usual size without harm. This may have been the first time in my life I have actively considered my spleen’s well-being. The following week, with spleen presumably back to its original size, I was happy to return to all of my usual pastimes! Whenever I told someone I was going to be donating stem cells, quite a few people seemed impressed. Their reactions suggested that the whole process would be a great ordeal with significant levels of discomfort. Thankfully, donating the stem cells was an effortless process, and my experience is one that has been shared by many others. Several testimonies are available to read on the Anthony Nolan website, and all echo the sentiment that the process is largely straightforward and not too painful. Stem cells are a vital part of treatment for several serious conditions while also showing a lot of potential in the development of new therapies for currently untreatable diseases. As a result, it is very important for there to be people willing to donate their stem cells. Many will be able to save lives by joining a donation register. My hope is that this article makes stem cell donation seem less scary and more accessible. I would certainly recommend that folks consider it if they are able to. And if you are lucky enough to be asked to donate, get some practice eating with one arm beforehand. If you live in the United Kingdom and are aged 16–30, you can join the Anthony Nolan register through their website.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/bipolar-disorder-caregiver-story,Caring for a parent who has bipolar disorder: How I learned to prioritize my own mental health,"I have always known deep down that my mother has a serious mental illness. But I only found out about 15 years ago that my mother had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I did not know much about bipolar disorder at the time, but it was easy for me to accept that she had a serious mental illness that had been undiagnosed until then. Throughout my childhood, I remember witnessing my mother’s extreme depressive episodes and periods of mania. During depressive episodes, I would see her crying into a bath towel. She had scars on her wrists from a suicide attempt in high school. When I was little, she told me they were from flea bites. When she was manic, my mom would insist we move. When I was a teenager, we made the move from a comfortable house in the suburbs to a developing country. While abroad, my mother started to have trouble with her physical health. She became bedridden and needed help with most tasks. My father was around, but he coped by becoming very detached. I was a teen at the time, and I became her primary caregiver for most of the next 4 years. I took over day-to-day responsibilities, including cooking for the family and helping my mother get dressed and use the bathroom. I endured the responsibility of caring for my family until I went to college. At this point, it started to become clear to medical professionals that my mother had a mental health condition. They just were not clear on the exact diagnosis. During one inpatient stay, a doctor who suspected dissociative identity disorder told my mother she had reintegrated her personalities on her own. But eventually, the diagnosis of bipolar disorder came about. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us After college, I moved, and there was physical distance between myself and my parents for a while. However, within the last decade, my parents moved nearby, and I started taking on more caregiving responsibilities again. Shortly after my parents moved, I lost my job. Even though I was also caring for my own children, I had a little more time on my hands. So, at this point, I became more heavily involved in caring for my mother. I did my best to be a dutiful caregiver. Around this time, my mother needed several surgeries. She required months of IV antibiotics that I learned to administer. But my mother constantly pointed out all of my shortcomings. My parents began to undermine my ability to parent my children. They constantly compared me with my sister, which seriously damaged my relationship with my sister, as well. This was when caregiving really started taking a toll on my mental health. I started feeling burned out, unappreciated, and frustrated as my mother kept undermining my parenting decisions. I set boundaries and tried my best to reinforce them with my mother. I was hoping that would help preserve our relationship, my relationship with my own children, and my own mental health. But my mother continued to disrespect these boundaries. After serious thought, I ended up cutting ties with both of my parents. I wanted to help care for my mom. I wanted to be close to my parents. They are lovely people in so many ways. But my mom crossed such a big line in actively undermining my parenting decisions, which affected my relationship with my children. And that was the last straw for me. Today, I still do not have contact with my mother. Even years later, thinking about it all still feels painful and shameful. It is hard to share my story, but if even one person reads this and finds it helpful, I feel it was worth it. According to the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP Public Policy Institute, 2 in 10 caregivers feel alone in their caregiving journey. Educating yourself about preventing caregiver burnout and connecting with others who understand what you are going through can help you prioritize your own mental health and feel less alone.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/through-my-eyes-adhd-and-avoidant-restrictive-eating,Through My Eyes: ADHD and avoidant restrictive eating,"Nadine Dirks shares her experience of avoidant restrictive eating as a symptom of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). For as long as I can recall I have been quite averse to certain foods. I hated the consistency of tomatoes, the texture and smell of bananas, and the way yogurt was just smooth. I just put it down to disliking certain foods — that was how my family saw it, too. I would insist my sandwiches be made without butter because I didn’t like the coating on my tongue after eating it. I loathed touching raw meat, particularly chicken, because the smell drove me up the wall, and the texture felt almost slimy. Jelly, processed meats, and anything with multiple components, like trifle, made my skin crawl. It was sensory overload and I couldn’t seem to process it. Some days I would get frustrated with myself because I would suddenly be overwhelmed even by foods I did enjoy, like avocado, eggs, or cheese. I couldn’t understand why it was such an uphill battle just to eat something. The sense of overwhelm was so severe that I would unconsciously avoid eating after experiencing a reaction to a particular food. I was diagnosed with ADHD in my mid-20s, and up until that point had no idea I was neurodiverse. Suddenly everything made sense — difficulties at school, being too talkative, struggling with focus and concentration, overthinking and anxiety, so many elements of my life made sense. I had no idea just how severely ADHD had impacted my life, and how it affected my everyday experience. It was both a relief to finally have an answer for so many things I had experienced and incredibly frustrating and painful because I felt resentful about the difficulties I had faced. I was upset because had I known sooner, I would likely have had better tools to deal with the disorder. My therapist and I discussed my issues with sensory overload, which manifested in multiple ways — sensitivity to lights, loud sounds, crowded spaces, and even textures of my clothes and blankets. It dawned on me that my issues with textures, smells and consistencies in relation to food could absolutely be due to ADHD. I decided to consult the internet, and found out about avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), an eating disorder associated with those with ADHD and autism. The research indicated it was similar to anorexia but with a key difference — people with ARFID have no interest in body weight, size, shape, or body image, which is commonly seen in people who deal with anorexia. I had no idea that ADHD could play any kind of role in the issues I had faced with food all my life. I couldn’t really understand it or find an abundance of resources for the lay person about the connection between ADHD and disordered eating. Some research
Trusted Source
 seems to indicate that sensory issues could be an important factor in ARFID. This is very much aligned with my experiences: I have no desire to lose weight, nor do I have any interest in my body image, but I tend to restrict my eating and lose weight anyway because of a severe reaction to food that causes major anxiety about eating. I tend to worry and become anxious a long time before meals, when I go to new restaurants, or visit someone else’s home for a meal. I worry that the texture, scent, consistency or even appearance of a dish may unsettle me to the point of not eating for hours on end. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us My therapist and I have discussed the issue at length and thankfully, as a neurodivergent woman herself, she truly understands and is able to speak and relate to me in a way that is comforting. Her recommendation to work with an occupational therapist to deal with the sensitivity has been helpful. ARFID is exceptionally difficult to deal with because it completely shifts your life, and makes it difficult to socialize without being hyperfocused on the gaze of others. Generally speaking, people have no idea about ARFID so it can seem like someone is just being difficult or a picky eater, which is not the reality. I wish I could just complete a meal without quitting because the smell was overwhelming — it is just not that simple to navigate. It is a part of ADHD that is incredibly hard to navigate, it is difficult to explain to people. It is not something we talk about often when we speak about ADHD. It is so rare to hear about ARFID that the general public seems puzzled when I attempt to explain my eating habits and their link to ADHD. It isn’t seen as one of the main symptoms to look out for, and in my experience, it took multiple individuals commenting on my weight loss, and my own realization that I avoid multiple foods and often skip meals because I am overwhelmed by the sensory overload to become conscious of it. After a significant battle with attempting to force myself to eat and just ending up overwhelmed and physically unwell, I decided to reach out to experts to discuss the experience I had been having. My issues with eating and sensitivity around particular things seemed to be heightened when I was overwhelmed, in general. It seemed to exacerbate the symptoms. One of the ways in which I have been able to manage my situation has been by consulting experts, prepping meals beforehand so I avoid feeling overwhelmed, and working with an occupational therapist to manage my sensory issues. Neurodivergence is a complicated issue and one that is multifaceted. Our experiences would likely be easier, and our symptoms managed sooner if regarded holistically and not just as focus- and hyperactivity-related issues. This would not make sensory issues go away entirely but it would provide the tools to better manage these sensitivities. Assessing what situations I am fairly comfortable with and the things that distress me has allowed me to open up in a safe environment and slowly work on exposure therapy. We need to have conversations about ADHD that are wide and varied. The condition isn’t the same for everyone, and it would help many if we viewed it holistically and treated the multiple parts of this disorder. Having conversations about ADHD and comorbidities like ARFID could be life-saving to some, it could provide answers, and even encourage others to seek professional help for their disordered eating before it causes long-term effects on the body. In my view, we have a long way to go in having open conversations without the stigma about these kinds of symptoms that everyone shies away from. No one wants to talk about disordered eating, yet it is stigmatized despite the fact that it is not a rarity.

I was only 6 years old and had been looking forward to this moment. I was a happy child with a constant smile on my face. But I wasn’t smiling on this day. I held back my whimpers while I tearfully clutched my blanket. I didn’t know what was going on. An unrelenting rush of pain removed my ability to speak as a monster scratched deep behind my eyes. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us I could only see through tiny holes in my vision, which a dark gray aura was clouding. My mom and dad carried me to the car, but I couldn’t sit up in the seat. I was tightly curled in a ball as my dad placed me in the passenger seat and drove me to the hospital. I will never forget the sensations of my first migraine attack, when I was unaware that this would become a regular occurrence. That scene replayed throughout my childhood, as Migraine became a recurring character in my life. She stops in regularly to carry on the plotline. Full of surprises and twists, there is never a dull episode. She is a titan of strength with a powerful disposition, but she is not welcome. My migraine attacks are easily triggered and usually begin with an aura. My vision clouds with shadowy spheres, and these sensations slowly transition into full body pain. A powerful black hole grows inside my head, quickly removing my ability to function. Nausea comes like a tidal wave as Migraine overtakes my nervous system. She is a powerful foe with a dedication to her job. I have tried many different treatments to combat my friend, Migraine. I’ve armed myself with nasal spray, pills, injections, and even Botox. Many of these treatments have their own side effects, which require preparation. If I don’t take medication soon enough, it doesn’t work as effectively. To help with this, I now have a trained service dog able to alert me to upcoming migraine episodes. Using scent training, he can smell the hormonal changes before a migraine headache, which allows me to take proactive action. I have lived an active life with my friend, Migraine. I have tried special diets to remove certain foods, invested in essential oils, and dedicated my life to peaceful living. I have been desperate to try anything, and other people are not short on recommendations. A cab driver once insisted that a special kind of music would cure all my ailments. A customer in Walmart told me to eat a miracle fruit every morning, and a second told me to go on a fully liquid diet. A friend told me about the benefits of yoga and meditation, and another showed me how to breathe mindfully. I tried them all with different levels of success. I want more. My friend Migraine can be difficult and bothersome, but she is like a sitcom neighbor who’s here to stay. She demands constant attention and expensive gifts. She requires me to eat well and drink lots of water.

However, because she isn’t content with poor self-care, she’s also become an unexpected friend. I must admit that Migraine is a thorn in my side, but she has forced a positive lifestyle change.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/through-my-eyes-empowering-my-son-to-negotiate-the-autism-cliff-enter-adult-life,"Through My Eyes: Empowering my son to negotiate the 'autism cliff,' enter adult life","For an autistic young person and their parents, transitioning into adulthood can be an exciting yet challenging time in their lives. In honor of Autism Awareness Month, here is the story of my experiences with transitioning my autistic son into adulthood. I also talk about navigating certain legal aspects and the “autism cliff” that many autistic young people and their families experience during this transition. Like many parents with young autistic children, my focus suddenly changed when my son received the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). After a long and arduous diagnostic process, I shifted from wondering if he had autism to searching for the services he needed to learn, grow, and manage autism-related challenges. This included in-home therapy, school-based services, and nutritional therapies. Because of the time invested in researching and implementing various treatments, and the effort invested in advocating for my son, I didn’t have the mental bandwidth to think too far into the future. But as he grew, I realized that even though he had experienced incredible progress throughout his journey, the challenges associated with autism would likely not end when he became a legal adult. This realization made planning for his future a new and urgent priority. Autism advocates, including the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN), have called for a change from “Autism Awareness Month” to “Autism Acceptance Month” to encourage inclusion and increase support and opportunities for autistic individuals. Like many autistic students in the United States, my son’s educational journey from pre-school to high school graduation was mapped out with an Individualized Educational Program (IEP). An IEP is a legally binding document developed and instituted when a child meets the public school’s criteria for specialized education. This document outlines the child’s needs and designs an educational program to meet those needs best, whether through speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, or the addition of support people like paraprofessionals to assist the child throughout the day. With an IEP in place, a child’s educational journey does not have to end at 18. Instead, the young person and their parents can decide to continue attending school up to age 21. This 18–21 period is considered one of “transitions”— and is designed to shift the young person from educational-centered to adult-oriented learning. Much of this includes teaching independent living and job skills. In the United States, statistics suggest that 500,000 young adults with autism will transition into adulthood over the next 5 years. Unfortunately, many schools don’t have the resources to develop transitions programs that fully address the needs of autistic students entering the adult world. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) survey
Trusted Source
 using parent-reported data from the National Survey of Children’s Health found that autistic students were less likely to receive transition planning than children with other emotional or behavioral conditions. Furthermore, even if a transitions program exists, it may not cover all the gaps in services that suddenly occur when the child reaches 18 years old. Parents often refer to this sudden loss of services as the autism cliff. BetterHelp is an online service created to help you with your mental health. Sign up and find support for your mental health from a licensed therapist. When faced with a sudden reduction or loss of services, parents of autistic children must build a bridge over that gap. And they may not always have the information and resources needed to construct it, which leaves them unsure about what to do next. Fortunately, my son’s experience has been different due to the charter school for autism he attends. His school, Lakeland STAR School/Academy, was created in 2018 by a group of dedicated parents, educational professionals, and community members and supported by generous donors. STAR serves diverse learners in grades 7–12 and has a transitions-focused curriculum. However, because autism rates
Trusted Source
 continue to rise, the school has seen tremendous growth. As space to enroll new students became limited, a need for a separate transitions program emerged. To address this need, Lakeland STAR is now developing a transitions center with the help of community-based organizations, including Aspirus Health, Lakeland Union High School (LUHS), the Howard Young Foundation (HYF), and the HYF Women’s Legacy Council. Scheduled to open in the fall of 2022, the center will offer transitions-based education, including independent living skills, job skills training, and related services. The new center will help my son and other autistic young adults bridge the gap over the autism cliff and into the adult world. Still, through my experiences, I’ve learned that transitioning is more than just transition programs. It also includes critical legal aspects of becoming an adult regarding healthcare and finances. Depending on the level of support the young person needs, these legal aspects may include deciding whether to pursue legal guardianship, financial power of attorney (POA), or power of health (POH). In the U.S., a parent must complete these documents before the young adult’s 18th birthday. Over the years, I’ve heard many parents and caregivers explain the incredible challenges of navigating finances and healthcare after their autistic child reaches adulthood. And this is especially true if there are no legal documents in place that allows parents to have some oversight in their child’s decision-making after they turn 18. Legal documents may be necessary because autism often affects executive functioning, expressive and receptive language skills, and social skills — leading to unforeseen challenges in the adult world. For example, executive functioning challenges may make it difficult for an autistic person to organize their finances and pay bills on time. This could lead to loss of housing or referrals to debt collection agencies. Autistic individuals may also have a higher risk of exploitation and victimization from others due to social difficulties. Because of this, they could experience fraud or other financial abuse without essential legal safeguards in place. Additionally, expressive and receptive language challenges could lead to miscommunication with authorities, resulting in unwarranted legal issues. Challenges with healthcare can also occur. For instance, in the U.S., medical professionals cannot discuss an adult’s medical situation with parents or caregivers without guardianship or active power of attorney for healthcare. So, an autistic person may not have the support they need in a medical emergency. Although autistic adults who need minimal support can often handle many aspects of adult life on their own, it’s not always easy to determine this by the time they turn 18. Therefore, it’s often in the child’s best interest to establish legal documents until support people can fully understand the young person’s abilities. For some parents in the U.S., especially those who support an autistic child with significant verbal communication challenges, guardianship is the answer to this legal dilemma. However, obtaining this level of legal oversight can be a complicated process. Often, you need a medical professional to declare that the autistic young person is unable to make their own decisions and then go through a detailed court process. In addition, becoming your child’s guardian involves managing their finances and medical needs as a separate individual. Other parents have told me that managing guardianship is like a full-time job, but most consider it a labor of love. Still, for many autistic adults, an active power of attorney for healthcare and finances is adequate because it allows some oversight on decisions yet leaves individuality and decision-making intact. These documents are drawn up by a lawyer and signed by the autistic person soon after reaching the age of 18. In my son’s situation, although he needs minimal support, he was welcoming of the idea of giving his father and myself the ability to assist him financially and medically when required. This acceptance of help may be partly due to his self-awareness — something that began evolving soon after I was transparent with him about his diagnosis at a young age. I believe this knowledge has helped him understand himself better and more easily identify areas in his life where he may need more assistance. Autistic individuals have many strengths that make employment or attending college more than possible. Still, research from 2017 suggests that about 38%
Trusted Source
 of autistic adults are unemployed. In addition, estimates indicate that only 17%
Trusted Source
 of autistic students graduating from high school attend a 4-year university. Still, a transitions program can help increase employment and post-secondary attendance for autistic individuals. In my son’s situation, his school has helped by searching out job experiences in the community. However, these job experiences are slightly different than a typical employment experience. For example, the employer is aware their new employee has ASD and will make accommodations to support their needs. In other cases, a job mentor will accompany the autistic employee when they start their job and slowly withdraw support as needed. Fortunately, our community has been highly supportive of autistic employees. For example, no local business has turned down the opportunity to participate in the Lakeland STAR job experience program. In addition to employment, attending college or a technical school may also be an option for my son. Like many autistic peers, he has specific interests and passions that can transform into a rewarding career. His happen to be history and the visual arts, such as filmmaking and creating documentaries. However, just like neurotypical people, autistic individuals have diverse interests and skillsets. For example, some of my son’s schoolmates are interested in auto mechanics, computer coding, or the culinary arts. Thankfully, post-secondary schools are becoming more accommodating to autistic students, making college a more attainable goal. However, I am just beginning to navigate this process, which includes plans to contact various visual arts and filmmaking schools to inquire about their autism-specific support services. Statistics suggest that about 87% of autistic adults live with or have lived with a parent at some point in their life. Yet, even when living independently, some autistic adults still need support. Because independent living requires many skills, my son’s father and I have begun the process of teaching my son things like doing laundry, paying bills, and shopping for and preparing food. In addition, his school’s independent living classes have addressed these skills, which will continue when he attends the new transition center. Also, with the help of others, I was fortunate enough to acquire a small house close to me. This dwelling will eventually serve as my son’s home while adjusting to adult life and learning to live independently. However, I realize that my son’s situation is not typical, as the fact remains that housing for adults with ASD is difficult to find. Therefore, future goals for our community include a plan for supportive housing that caters to people with special needs like autism. As for me, my son, and his father — we are just beginning to build a bridge over the “autism cliff.” And so far, I’d say we have an excellent foundation to support its construction. Still, because of the ongoing challenges associated with ASD, I am not sure this bridge will ever be complete. Instead, we may have to modify it as our son’s needs change. Hopefully, someday soon, every autistic young person will have a well-defined path to cross as they transition into adulthood. To be most effective, this pathway needs to include transition programs, expanded employment opportunities, and appropriate and supportive housing. Although it seems like a momentous task, I have learned that it is possible. Especially with the support of friends, family, and community members dedicated to creating a world where autism is accepted and woven through the fabric of society — as I believe it should be.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/through-my-eyes-access-to-endometriosis-care,Through My Eyes: Why endometriosis almost killed me,"I have been living with endometriosis officially for 8 years, but I have been symptomatic for around 15 years. On average, it is said that it takes between 8-10 years for an endometriosis diagnosis. A lot of this is purely due to discrimination on multiple levels and intersections. Ranging from discrimination based on gender and weight to class and race — it can seem as though we are speaking to a wall when trying to express our conditions. Doctors across the board seem to disregard anything related to menstrual cycles, calling various symptoms “normal.” But what is normal about debilitating pain, projectile vomiting, and heavy, intense menses? By the time I received my diagnosis, I was already at severe stage 4 endometriosis, and the reality is: Had I been listened to much earlier, this would likely have been a very different outcome. The refusal of adequate endometriosis care is what kept me in the same space — chasing answers, coming up empty, and being dismissed for years. One of the things that stands out to me is the fact that whenever I would express distress or any emotion that didn’t fit the “strong Black woman” trope, even as a teenager, I would be looked at as if I had suddenly sprouted a second head. The doctor would express some variation of the same sentiment: “Well, yes, there’s no cure, but it’s not cancer, and it won’t kill you.” As if that was the balm for whatever ailed me. It didn’t make me feel better, it silenced me and made me feel like talking about my illness was a weakness. As if because it isn’t cancer, I should be grateful and not complain. It isn’t that simple. I still felt sick every day, and every day is a challenge. The lack of serious intervention from healthcare professionals meant that my condition continued to deteriorate, and the symptoms I complained about were not attended to. If I expressed difficulties with walking, lower back pain, or headaches, they would be dismissed as unrelated to my condition. In 2021 my condition had started to take hold of me. I was in constant severe pain, I battled with fatigue, I struggled to walk without pain, my abdomen became so sensitive that I couldn’t wear pants or anything with a waistband. I went to see a new specialist in the hope that I may get the necessary care and that my life would return to some semblance of normalcy. The specialist confirmed that my condition was quite advanced and severe. He was transparent and let me know the surgery may not be entirely life-changing because of the stage that the endometriosis had reached. He let me know that it would likely be a very long surgery and that they estimated it would take around 5 hours. I woke up in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), with medical equipment all over me, attached to me, and around me. The nurse let me know that I had been in surgery for an entire 12 hours, and because of that, they needed to keep me in ICU to monitor my condition. I was floored. In my entire medical experience, doctors had always shut me down and told me that while this was an incurable chronic disease, it wasn’t dangerous and it wouldn’t kill me. Yet I found myself exceptionally unwell and in ICU. My specialist said that in all his years treating endometriosis, I had the most severe case he had ever seen. He explained that it was absolutely everywhere: I had a frozen pelvis, my bowels were attached to my uterus, the endometriosis had attached to my uterosacral ligaments, and had affected the nerves that caused the pain when I was walking. He told me that he had found multiple masses and that the endometriosis extended way beyond the reproductive system. He found endometriosis all the way up to my kidneys, creating havoc between the ureter and bladder: It was constricting my ureter so severely that the surgeons attempted to remove it from the left ureter. Within a few days, I was transferred to a regular hospital ward, wherein I had to start walking and going to the bathroom by myself. I pushed myself because I wanted to go home. It was way beyond the dates we had initially planned for my release. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us But soon after the doctors discharged me from the hospital, my condition deteriorated. I had had surgeries for endometriosis before and knew something was wrong. My mother called my specialist, who suggested I come in for blood tests and a CT scan the following day. I felt awful by morning. The pain and nausea felt like they wouldn’t relent. I couldn’t eat anything, but I knew I needed to go for the tests. We returned home, and I went back to bed. I fell asleep, and I was awakened by severe pain, soaked in a cold sweat. I tried to make my way to the bathroom, where I projectile vomited and called for my mother. I felt as if I couldn’t walk and told my mother to call the doctor and an ambulance. By the time the ambulance arrived, I was slipping in and out of consciousness and couldn’t speak or walk by myself. I was soaked in sweat and running a fever. The ambulance rushed me to the hospital, where my specialist waited for me and reviewed my test results. He informed my mother that I had sepsis, while he started me on an IV of antibiotics, fluids, and pain medication. He explained that due to the damage to my ureter when the endometriosis was removed from it, the scan showed necrosis of the bottom of the ureter, which had been emptying urine into my abdomen. The urine in my abdomen had played a part in the sepsis and the development of abscesses in the abdomen. The doctor quickly recommended emergency surgery and called on the expertise of a urologist. Together, they quickly opened me back up and reimplanted my ureter into my bladder. As well as stenting it, they inserted a semi-permanent catheter and flushed out my abdomen of any infections and fluid. I spend several weeks in ICU on intensive antibiotics, requiring physiotherapy, and experiencing additional complications from all the medical traumas. I recalled how I had been told endometriosis wasn’t deadly and wouldn’t kill me, yet I was in ICU fighting for my life, unable to breathe on my own. I resented the medical professionals who dismissed me for so many years — because of their neglect my condition had got to the point of no return. I ended up requiring another surgery because my bowels had attached to each other and caused severe pain and inflammation. The inflammation was so severe that both of my lungs had collapsed. There I was yet again –—fighting for my life due to endometriosis. I couldn’t eat for weeks, I lost weight and needed to be sustained with an IV until I could eventually have liquids. The most frustrating and heartbreaking part of it all is not the multiple surgeries and long hospital stays but the “what ifs.” I wondered about how different my situation would have been had someone taken the time to listen to me, take my concerns seriously, investigate and do additional research before disregarding my experiences and symptoms. I imagined how different my life would be, had I received adequate care and early intervention. Maybe it wouldn’t have gotten so out of control, maybe it would have been contained at a more moderate stage. The discrimination and disregard for people with endometriosis need to stop, and medical professionals need to be honest about endometriosis. If they don’t know how to treat it, that’s fine, but then they should research or refer the patient to a specialist instead of insisting that endometriosis is not life-threatening or dangerous. My story and several others’ with severe endometriosis are a testament to how life-threatening it is. If the consequences of severe endometriosis were known widely, I believe they would force healthcare providers to take action and remain accountable and proactive in providing access to endometriosis care. The care for endometriosis, in my view, should include early intervention to prevent the disease from creating further havoc if this can be avoided. The stigma associated with women’s healthcare remains a factor in unnecessary deaths and illness worldwide. My hope is that sharing my story will inspire others to advocate for themselves, motivate people to research endometriosis more, and funders to invest in researching endometriosis. No one deserves to be disregarded when looking for medical assistance. Read this article in Spanish.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/lower-proportions-time-2-sleep-stages-may-contribute-alzheimers,Spending less time in 2 deep sleep stages may contribute to Alzheimer’s,"Understanding the risk factors associated with Alzheimer’s disease is a hot topic. With few effective treatments and increased prevalence, taking steps to potentially reduce risk is vital. The authors of a new study, which appears in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, investigate links between sleep architecture and brain regions relevant to Alzheimer’s. Sleep architecture refers to the sleep phases that the brain cycles through each night. These are the four phases of sleep: People generally cycle through these four phases 4–6 times each night
Trusted Source
. Previous research has shown that aspects of sleep, such as sleeping for longer
Trusted Source
 than normal or disturbed sleep
Trusted Source
 are associated with dementia risk and disease progression. However, until the latest study, the direct links between specific aspects of sleep architecture and Alzheimer’s — specifically the neuroanatomy associated with this disease, had not been studied in depth. Alzheimer’s is characterized by brain atrophy. In other words, it shrinks. According to the authors of the new study, some brain regions atrophy more than others
Trusted Source
. These include: Alongside these Alzheimer’s-vulnerable brain regions, other factors are also associated with Alzheimer’s progression — namely, cerebral microbleeds. As the name suggests, these are small bleeds within the brain and a sign of cerebral small vessel disease, which appears to be linked to Alzheimer’s. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us The latest research explores the relationship between specific sleep phases and Alzheimer’s-vulnerable brain regions. To investigate, they recruited 270 participants who were involved in the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities Study
Trusted Source
. They used polysomnography to assess sleep architecture. Then, they used MRI to look at the anatomical features of the brain (such as brain volume and evidence of cerebral microbleeds) 13–17 years later. They also measured the proportion of slow wave sleep, the proportion of REM sleep, and how often they experienced arousal during the night. The scientists found that having less slow-wave sleep was associated with a smaller inferior parietal region and cuneus. Similarly, having less REM sleep was linked to a smaller inferior parietal region and precuneus. After adjusting their analysis for errors, reductions in slow-wave and REM sleep were most tightly associated with atrophy of the inferior parietal region. Interestingly, measures of arousal during sleep and microbleeds were not associated with the volume of any Alzheimer’s-vulnerable brain regions. According to the authors, this study is the “first to examine the relationship of sleep architecture with the atrophy of [Alzheimer’s]-vulnerable regions in older adults.” The results of this study infer that reductions in slow-wave and REM sleep may play a significant role in the reduction of volume in the inferior parietal region. Earlier research has shown that sleep helps clear toxins from the brain. The authors suggest that this might help explain why reductions in sleep might cause neurological atrophy. Medical News Today contacted Chelsie Rohrscheib, PhD, a sleep expert, neuroscientist, and sleep consultant at Wesper, who was not involved in this study. We asked why changes in sleep architecture might influence brain atrophy and Alzheimer’s. “Sleep has many crucial biological functions and is especially important for cell and tissue repair, brain maintenance, learning and memory, cognition, and brain waste clearance,” Rohrscheib explained. “Most of these functions occur during stage 3 slow wave sleep and REM sleep. All of these processes are crucial for maintaining brain health and reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease,” she detailed. Rohrscheib told us how Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by a buildup of junk proteins in the brain. “These proteins are normally removed by a waste removal system that occurs during stage 4 slow wave sleep, called the glymphatic system,” she continued. “People who are chronically sleep-deprived and spend less time in slow wave sleep do not clear their brains effectively.” MNT also contacted Leah Kaylor, PhD, a licensed psychologist who specializes in sleep, who was also not involved in the current research. She delved into a little more detail about how this trash removal service works: “While sleeping, the brain shrinks, creating more space for cerebrospinal fluid to flood the areas where the brain’s waste products accumulate. This fluid acts as a ‘car wash,’ clearing out the toxins, misfolded proteins, and debris that have built up throughout the day, ensuring that our brain functions at its peak when it is time to wake up.” Importantly, “these waste products include beta-amyloid, tau proteins, and other substances linked to neurodegenerative disorders,” Kaylor explained. We asked Kaylor about the importance of these results. “By examining a cohort over 13 to 17 years, the research provides a longitudinal perspective on how sleep architecture impacts brain structure over time,” she explained. This is important as it “strengthens the evidence for causal relationships.” Although the results of this study certainly are intriguing, the authors call for more research — this is a small study. Also, they write that their participant group was not particularly diverse, so their results might not be generalizable to other groups. Whatever the future of this line of investigation, one thing is by now clear: Sleep is essential for good health. We asked Rohrscheib to provide tips for anyone who struggles to get enough sleep: She also advises people to speak with a doctor if they experience chronic sleep troubles, as this may be a sign of a sleep disorder like insomnia or sleep apnea. Kaylor also provided some tips: This new study adds to our understanding of the relationship between sleep architecture, brain atrophy, and Alzheimer’s disease.

 of people and is a common arrhythmia. Experts are continuing to explore the potential complications of the condition. Recent study findings regarding AFib and dementia risk were presented at the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) 2025. The research — called “Association between atrial fibrillation and dementia, with a particular focus on early-onset dementia: A longitudinal population-based study in Catalonia, Spain” — from medical institutions in Spain, involved over 2.5 million participants, and researchers found that having AFib was a weak predictor of dementia. When looking at risk in various age groups, participants with AFib were at a 21% greater risk for dementia if they were below 70 years old. The risk was greatest for dementia diagnosis before age 65. In contrast, the associated risk for dementia was no longer statistically significant for participants over seventy. This study results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The authors of this study noted that there are mixed results when it comes to AFib affecting dementia risk, and that there is a lack of data focusing on the Mediterranean population. They also noted that gaining more data about which subpopulations have the greatest associations between AFib and dementia can help experts understand why and help with finding specific, preventative strategies. Thus, they sought to “assess the independent association between [atrial fibrillation] and incident dementia.” This study was a population-based observational study among participants in Catalonia, Spain. Researchers used data from the System for the Development of Research in Primary Care. This system allowed researchers to look at vast anonymized data. Researchers used demographic records, ICD-10 codes, laboratory data, and drug prescription data in their analyses. The ICD-10 codes and drug prescription data were used to identify the cases of dementia. All participants were at least 45 years old. After excluding people who had previous cognitive impairment or dementia, the overall analysis included 2,458,905 individuals. The researchers also conducted a separate analysis that further excluded participants who had prevalent or incident stroke, ultimately including 2,377,638 participants in this analysis. The average follow-up time with participants was 13 years. Of the study population, 3.25% had AFib. Throughout the follow-up, researchers found a greater crude incidence of dementia among participants who had AFib, and the univariate analysis showed AFib was a strong predictor of someone developing dementia. However, after they adjusted for potential confounders, AFib was only a weak predictor of someone developing dementia. When looking at participants based on age, the risk for dementia in participants with AFib decreased with increased age. Of note, once participants were older than 70, the risk for dementia associated with AFib was no longer at a level that was statistically significant. In participants under 70, AFib “independently increased the risk of dementia by 21%.” Participants with AFib under seventy were also at a 36% increased risk for early-onset dementia. For this study, that meant getting a diagnosis of dementia before age 65. Researchers observed similar findings when excluding participants with baseline stroke or those who experienced a stroke during the follow-up. In this group, AFib appeared to increase the risk for early onset dementia by 52%. Study author Julian Rodriguez-Garcia, MD, from the Bellvitge University Hospital, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain, highlighted the following components of the findings to Medical News Today: “Our study highlights that [atrial fibrillation] is an independent predictor of dementia, with a stronger association in individuals under 70 years of age, especially for early-onset dementia. Notably, the association between [atrial fibrillation] and dementia weakened in individuals over 70, suggesting that the impact of [atrial fibrillation] may diminish as other factors contributing to cognitive decline become more dominant in older age groups.” Since the full study has not been published, this makes it challenging to examine the full limitations of the work. Complete publication of the work will allow for a more in-depth view of the findings. However, the study focused on individuals in Spain, so greater diversity in future studies could be helpful, as well as focusing on other populations. While researchers were able to adjust for potential confounders, residual confounding is likely still possible. They used codes and prescription data to confirm dementia cases, but it is possible that they missed some cases of dementia or that some participants received an incorrect diagnosis. Additionally, it is important to note that the research only describes an increased risk for dementia, not that AFib causes dementia. Paul Drury, MD, a board-certified cardiologist and associate medical director of electrophysiology at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, who was not involved in the study, noted to MNT that “[t]here are interesting findings [in this study]; however, it is retrospective and does not tease out which specific treatments patients received or other comorbidities.” “There does however [appear to] be a much stronger association with dementia the earlier a person is diagnosed with AFib, which implies that AFib has potential mechanisms that can lead to dementia. Larger studies that involve more diverse patient populations and are able to control for specific treatments such as anticoagulation use, rate vs rhythm control or ablation will be needed to confirm the causality of dementia from AFib,” Drury advised. Rodriguez-Garcia further noted that: “Future research should focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms by which [atrial fibrillation] contributes to dementia, particularly in younger individuals. Exploring how [atrial fibrillation] leads to changes in brain structure, such as brain atrophy or microinfarcts, could offer new insights. Additionally, longitudinal studies that assess the impact of early intervention for [atrial fibrillation], including rhythm control and management of cardiovascular risk factors, are needed to determine whether these strategies can reduce dementia risk in the long term.” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us These study results add to the understanding of the relationship between dementia and AFib and drew on data from a very large study population. Drury noted that: “Multiple prior studies have shown an increased risk of dementia in patients with AFib. Some small trials have shown the ability to decrease the risk of dementia with more aggressive treatment such as cardiac ablation or chronic anticoagulation therapy. This study supplements these prior findings, however discovering a way to alter the risk of dementia in a young patient diagnosed with AFib is still necessary.” Overall, these study results highlight how AFib may particularly increase the risk for dementia in younger individuals. “From a clinical perspective,”, Rodriguez-Garcia, added, “our findings emphasize the importance of actively managing [atrial fibrillation], particularly in younger individuals.” “While the increased risk of dementia in those with [atrial fibrillation] is well-established, preventing the onset of [atrial fibrillation] through cardiovascular health management could significantly reduce the likelihood of cognitive decline later in life,” he advised. “Furthermore, the association of [atrial fibrillation] with dementia in patients under 70 suggests that proactive monitoring for cognitive impairment in these individuals could allow for early intervention. The findings also call for a deeper exploration of how rhythm control strategies and other [atrial fibrillation] treatments might potentially mitigate cognitive decline in affected patients,” said Rodriguez-Garcia.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/maintaining-low-cholesterol-may-help-decrease-dementia-risk,Maintaining low cholesterol may help decrease dementia risk,"Cholesterol performs many essential functions within the body, including building cell membranes, producing steroid hormones and helping create bile in the liver. However, too much cholesterol — particularly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) — can lead to health problems, such as cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol levels may also affect a person’s risk of developing dementia but study findings are inconsistent. Some studies suggest that higher levels have a protective effect; others maintain that dementia risk is not linked to high cholesterol. Another study has found very little association between LDL-C and dementia risk. A new study by South Korean researchers has found that people with low, but not extremely low, LDL-C levels have a reduced risk of developing dementia, and this decrease appears to be enhanced if they take cholesterol-lowering statins. The study is published in the BMJ Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. Emer MacSweeney, MD, CEO and consultant neuroradiologist at Re:Cognition Health, who was not involved in this study, explained for Medical News Today that: “The study reinforces the importance of lipid management in overall health, including cognitive function. It also highlights the complexity of LDL-C’s role in dementia, suggesting that optimal levels exist rather than a ‘lower is always better’ approach. While promising, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the observational nature of the study. More high-quality [randomized control trials] are needed to confirm these associations and inform clinical guidelines.” The researchers analyzed outpatient data, collected between 1986 and 2020, from more than 12 million people at 11 medical centers in South Korea. United States Government guidelines state that a healthy level of LDL-C is under 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). After an initial analysis, the researchers divided their final sample into two groups: 108,980 people with LDL-C greater than 130 mg/dL, and 108,980 with LDL-C under 70 mg/dL. All were followed for 180 days after testing, for comparison. They recorded two outcomes — a primary outcome of all-cause dementia, and a secondary outcome of Alzheimer’s disease. The researchers replicated their analysis with a subset of patients who had been prescribed statins before inclusion in the study, dividing them into three groups by LDL-C levels: less than 55 mg/dL, less than 70 mg/dL, and greater than 130mg/dL. People with LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL had a 26% lower risk of all-cause dementia and a 28% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease related dementia, than those with LDL-C levels greater than 130mg/dL. At LDL-C levels below 70 mg/dL, the reduction in dementia risk diminished. People with LDL-C at 55 mg/dL had only 18% risk reduction, and below 30 mg/dL, there was no reduction in dementia risk at all. MacSweeney told MNT: “This is an interesting observation indicating a potential threshold effect, where reducing LDL-C beyond a certain point does not further improve cognitive outcomes. It aligns with previous research indicating that while high LDL-C is harmful, excessively low levels may not offer additional protective effects.” And David Gill, MD, a neurologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center, similarly not involved in the study, explained further that: “High levels of LDL-C are associated with higher rates of vascular disease such as coronary artery disease in the heart and lowering those levels to a point is associated with reduced risk of vascular disease but there does not appear to be additional benefit once they fall below a certain level and extremely low levels may actually be harmful.” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us Statins are medications used to help lower blood cholesterol levels, to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. This study suggests that they might also reduce the risk of dementia. In people with LDL-C below 70 mg/dL, statins were associated with a further 13% reduction in dementia risk, and a further 12% lowering of Alzheimer’s risk, compared with nonusers. The researchers found that statins slightly decreased risk in those with higher LDL-C levels, but had no effect in those with LDL-C levels below 55 mg/dL. However, Gill cautioned that, “s[i]nce this was an observational study, we cannot use the results to say that statins reduced the risk, just that a patient being on a statin medication may have been associated with an even lower risk of dementia.“ “This is an important distinction because there is limited evidence that statin use is associated with less risk of dementia despite many studies looking at this risk,” he noted. “This study is yet another study to add to this list of studies that suggest there may be an association between statin use and a lower risk of dementia.” “In general, I recommend statin or other lipid lowering medications be used according to recommended guidelines for prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease and not merely for dementia prevention given the lack of well controlled research studies to guide their use, as it is possible that statin medications do not reduce the risk of dementia and have their own risks.” – David Gill, MD The authors of the study state that higher levels of LDL-C lead to inflammation, oxidative stress and an imbalance in brain cholesterol homeostasis, all of which are implicated in the development of dementia. Conversely, low LDL-C reduces the risk of atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular disease, which known risk factors for dementia. Statins enhance the function of endothelial cells that line blood vessels, reduce neuroinflammation and regulate the metabolism of beta-amyloid
Trusted Source
, which forms the plaques that are characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease. “This suggests that statins may have neuroprotective effects beyond simply lowering LDL-C, possibly through an anti-inflammatory or vascular mechanism,“ MacSweeney explained further. “However,” she cautioned, “the effect size was modest and more research is needed to confirm causation.” Get our cholesterol micro-lessons to support you in making lasting lifestyle changes to manage your cholesterol levels.

MacSweeney advised: “To maintain healthy LDL-C levels while optimising cognitive benefits, it is advised to follow a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats (e.g., olive oil, nuts, fatty fish).” She also advocated engaging in regular physical activity, avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol consumption.

Trusted Source
 says people who are only able to workout on the weekends — known as the “weekend warrior” approach — are still receiving similar health benefits than if they had spread out their workouts throughout the week. These health benefits include a lowered risk of death from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all causes, compared to those who do not complete the suggested 150 minutes of physical activity every week. For this study, researchers analyzed health and physical activity data from more than 93,000 adult participants of the UK Biobank. Study participants were grouped into three different categories: At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that both the weekend warrior and active regular groups had a significantly lower risk of death from cancer, heart disease, and all causes when compared to the inactive group. Additionally, the percentage risks were lower in the weekend warrior group when compared to the active regular group: “You don’t need to exercise every day to stay healthy,” said Zhi-Hao Li, PhD, an epidemiologist in the School of Public Health at Southern Medical University in China and corresponding author in a press release. “As long as you get 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week — whether packed into one to two days or spread out — you can significantly reduce your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, cancer or other causes. This message is encouraging news for busy people who struggle to fit in daily workouts but can manage a concentrated burst of activity on weekends or over a couple of days,” Li added. Keith Diaz, PhD, Florence Irving Associate Professor of Behavioral Medicine in the Department of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center and volunteer expert for the American Heart Association, told Medical News Today that studies like this one are essential because they help us refine our understanding of healthy exercise prescriptions. “Just as healthcare providers prescribe medications at the right dose and frequency, we’re learning to do the same with physical activity,” Diaz, who was not involved in this research, explained. “This research helps us better define what a healthful dose of exercise looks like for different people and lifestyles.” “It’s important to emphasize that this study found no difference in mortality risk between those who exercised only on the weekend and those who spread their physical activity across the week. In other words, neither pattern is better than the other. They’re equally beneficial. So if you’re already fitting in regular activity during the week, there’s no need to switch to a weekend-only routine.” – Keith Diaz, PhD “The key takeaway is that exercise can be flexible, and that’s good news for people who find it hard to be active during the workweek due to time pressures,” Diaz added. “You can absolutely make up for it on the weekend.” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us MNT had the opportunity to speak with Christopher Berg, MD, a board-certified cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. “As a cardiologist, I find these results promising and exciting,” Berg, who was not involved in this research, commented. “I’ve long seen patients who struggle to fit regular exercise into their busy schedules, often resorting to the ‘weekend warrior’ approach — cramming the majority of their physical activity into one or two days each week,“ he told us. “The findings that this pattern can offer similar mortality benefits to more evenly distributed exercise, particularly for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, were encouraging.“ “It suggests that patients have more flexibility in how they can get their physical activity, which is a relief for those with time constraints,” Berg further noted. “However,“ he pointed out, “I am also somewhat cautious whether this approach suits everyone, especially those with underlying heart conditions [who were omitted from the study], where sudden intense activity could pose risks if not properly managed.” “I would not recommend an inactive person to suddenly start a ‘weekend warrior’ regimen, due to risk of injury and potential difficulties if the person is significantly de-conditioned, but rather start slow and gradually build up to the recommended amount of exercise,” Berg advised. “Overall, these results are a promising step, but I’d want to ensure we guide patients safely based on their individual health profiles,” he added. While some may be happy to know that getting all of their weekly exercise on the weekend provides health benefits, getting at least 150 minutes of physical activity in one weekend can be a lot for some people. How can a person figure out what’s the best time for them to work out during the week, whether that be throughout the week or just on the weekends? Bert Mandelbaum, MD, a sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon and co-director of the Regenerative Orthobiologic Center at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in Los Angeles, advised readers to remember that while just exercising two days a week offers a positive effect in this study, exercising for just 2 days a week may not be all a person needs. “It may be that if you’re 60 pounds overweight and your hemoglobin A1C is 10, that may not be enough for you,” Mandelbaum explained to MNT. “When we exercise and we do a study like this, it shows a positive effect — great. But is it going to be a positive enough effect on you? And I think it has to be customized and it must be specific to the population, to someone that’s 25, is someone 45, or are they 85.” “I think the conclusions are good, in the lineage of exercising, improving longevity, lifespan, play span, is great,” he continued. “But I raise the question, do not look at this [thinking] that it is the right dose for you. It’s so important that people exercise more than two days a week. It’s like saying if you brush your teeth once a day, that the cavities probably are better, but if you brush it three times a day, the cavities are much improved.” “We’re athletes — that’s the bottom line,” Mandelbaum added. “When you go back to Darwinian survival of the fittest, we exercise like we’re positively reinforced to hunt. It’s in our DNA, it’s our heritage.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/43-intermittent-fasting-better-for-weight-loss-than-cutting-calories,4:3 intermittent fasting better for weight loss than cutting calories,"Over the past few years, intermittent fasting has become a popular dietary pattern for helping to lose weight. Also known as time-restricted eating, there are a number of different methods of intermittent fasting, including only eating for specific hours of the day, such as the 16:8 method (eat during an 8-hour window, fast for 16 hours each day). And there are other methods that call for completely fasting or only consuming a minimal amount of calories for a number of days each week, such as the 5:2 method (eat as usual for 5 days, fast 2 days each week) and the 4:3 method
Trusted Source
 (eat as usual for 4 days, fast 3 days each week). Now, a new study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine has found that 4:3 intermittent fasting may result in modestly greater weight loss over 12 months compared to daily calorie restriction. For this study, researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine recruited 165 adults with overweight or obesity. Study participants were randomly assigned to either follow 4:3 intermittent fasting or a daily calorie restriction diet for 12 months. Participants in the 4:3 intermittent fasting groups were asked to restrict their calorie intake by 80% of their typical daily needs for 3 nonconsecutive days each week, and eat normally on the remaining 4 days with an emphasis on healthy eating. Those in the daily calorie restriction diet were assigned a daily calorie goal that would lower their calorie consumption by 34.3%. All participants received a free gym membership, group-based behavioral support, and information on calorie counting and targeting their dietary macronutrients. They were also encouraged to exercise for at least 300 minutes weekly. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us Out of the original 165 participants, 125 successfully completed the study. At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that participants in the 4:3 intermittent fasting group lost an average of 7.6% of their body weight over the 12 month period, compared to those in the calorie restriction group losing 5%. More than half (58%) of those in the intermittent fasting group lost at least 5% of their body weight over 12 months, compared to 47% in the calorie restriction group. Additionally, researchers discovered that participants in the intermittent fasting group had more encouraging changes in their cardiometabolic outcomes. These included systolic blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, triglycerides, and fasting glucose levels. Those in the calorie restriction group showed more favorable changes in diastolic blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. But they noted that many of these estimates in cardiometabolic changes lacked precision and ultimately yielded inconclusive results. “Daily calorie restriction is the most commonly used dietary weight loss strategy,” Victoria A. Catenacci, MD, associate professor in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and first author of this study told Medical News Today. “However, adherence to a strategy where calories are restricted every day is challenging for many people,” Catenacci noted. “Our results suggest that 4:3 intermittent fasting is an alternative dietary weight loss strategy that may be easier to adhere to over time, and thus may produce modestly superior weight loss compared with daily caloric restriction over one year, when supported by a behavioral weight loss program. Thus, 4:3 intermittent fasting should be considered within the range of evidence-based dietary weight loss approaches to be offered to people desiring weight loss.” – Victoria A. Catenacci, MD MNT had the opportunity to speak with Mir Ali, MD, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. “The 4:3 intermittent fasting benefits were modest at best,” Ali, who was not involved in the research, pointed out. “Intermittent fasting has been shown in many studies to have beneficial effects. Further studies are necessary to define the optimal fasting schedule and delineate the health benefits. Unfortunately, no one method will work for all people.” “Comparing different intermittent fasting regimens, and perhaps breaking down further by other variables such as age, gender, or ethnicity, may help define an optimal diet for a particular group of patients,” he added. MNT also spoke with Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, about this study. “The results of the study were not completely surprising as this type of intermittent fasting may act similarly to ‘metabolic confusion’ or ‘calorie shifting’ which essentially can catch the body by surprise and ‘shake things up’ by oscillating between a calorie deficit and sufficiency in addition to burning calories with exercise between intervals of rest and action,” Richard, who was likewise not involved in the study, explained. “There have been research studies that have observed the positive benefits of these patterns, as in this study, but it is limited and overall success is highly variable and based on multiple factors unique to the individual and the study design methodology,” she added. As the 4:3 intermittent fasting schedule calls for three days of fasting and four days of normal eating each week, that might be hard for some people to commit to. So how can a person figure out the best intermittent fasting schedule for them? For those interested in trying out intermittent fasting — and more specifically the 4:3 pattern — Richard advised readers to take into consideration several factors that could influence their success and sustainability, such as: And Richard said to take it one step at a time with these simple tips: You could also practice the 4:3 method by fasting or restricting calorie intake to 20% of your daily calorie needs for 24 hours on three nonconsecutive days per week, as was done in the study. Breaking up fasting days may make this regimen easier to stick to. “We have long observed that in most instances, a slow, steady, informed, and intentional approach is often most advantageous,” Richard said. “Dietary patterns and activity along with mindfulness, neuroplasticity activities, and spiritual and social wellbeing for a well-balanced [life] seem to follow that logic.” “Meeting with a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) will allow clear information related to nutrient needs and the safety, applicability, and best practices in how implementing a pattern such as this can apply to an individual,” she added. “There are also unique genetic pathways and factors that may inhibit or support the success and desired outcomes using intermittent fasting, which an RDN can help an individual navigate and understand.” Share this article In this episode, Medical News Today discusses whether intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating practices are safe for the heart, especially in… There is a lot of hype around intermittent fasting, but what are its actual benefits, and what are its limitations?

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/high-salt-diets-may-contribute-to-depression-mouse-study-shows-how,High-salt diets may contribute to depression: Mouse study shows how,"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 5%
Trusted Source
 of adults globally experience of depression. Experts want to find effective treatment strategies, and one area of focus is diet, with evidence suggesting that following a healthy diet and avoiding components like junk food may help decrease depression risk. A study recently published in The Journal of Immunology looked at the relationship between consuming a high-salt diet and depression-like symptoms in mice. They found that mice who received a high salt diet developed depression-like symptoms and that this was likely related to the induced production of the cytokine IL-17A. The results open the door for future research into depression and possible treatment. Researchers sought to explore how high salt consumption affected depression in mice. First, they tested if mice who received high salt diets developed depression. Mice had either a normal or a high-salt diet for 5 to 8 weeks. Researchers used a few methods to look at mice’s behavior. They also had a positive control group of mice that were exposed to chronic restraint, which is “a common depression-like model.” The mice on the high-salt diet displayed behaviors similar to those of the positive control mice. This indicates that the high salt-diet caused the mice to exhibit depression-like behavior. They also found that these mice experienced an increase in the production of IL-17A
Trusted Source
, a cytokine linked to depression symptoms. Their analyses revealed that certain cells produced more IL-17A, and they also found increased levels of IL-17A in mice’s spleens and areas of the brain. This suggests that the high salt diets promoted the production of this critical cytokine. To further investigate this, researchers used mice with a RORγt deficiency. They note that this transcriptional factor is something that is needed for IL-17A to be produced. They fed these mice the high-salt diet and then saw if they developed depressive symptoms. These mice demonstrated much more normal behavior than those with the transcriptional factor. These mice also did not experience increased levels of IL-17A. The authors note that their findings “suggest that [a high-salt diet] drives depression-like behavior in mice through inducing IL-17A production.” The researchers note that several lymphocyte populations can produce IL-17A, so they next tried to determine the distribution of cells that make IL-17A in the mice’s brains, peripheral blood, and spleens. They found that γδT cells were likely a major cell source of the increased levels of IL-17A in the mice that received the high-salt diets. The results also indicated that mice on the high salt diets experienced an increase in γδT17 cells. Researchers note further that the γδT17 cells were a critical source of IL-17A in the mice who received the high-salt diet. Finally, researchers wanted to see if the production of IL-17A by the γδT cells contributed to the depression behavior of the mice who received the high-salt diet. To do this, they used an anti-γδTCR antibody to diminish the γδT cells. They found that after this, the depression-like behavior in high-salt diet mice diminished. The authors note that “[c]ollectively, our findings show that [a high-salt diet] drives depression-like behavior in mice at least partially through the induction of γδT17 cells.” The results uncover critical information about how salt intake could impact depression. Richard C. Calderone, DO, MPH, FAAP, FACP, an osteopathic physician specializing in internal medicine, who was not involved in this study, noted to Medical News Today that: “Although these findings were in mice, it is reasonable to investigate the effect of limiting salt intake on depression in humans. It should be noted that depression is a complex, multi-factorial condition, and that even with promising studies like this —it remains too early to know the quantity of salt intake necessary to demonstrate any clinical difference in humans. In addition to dietary salt restriction, this study identified that new treatments targeting IL-17A or gamma-delta T cells may also be targets for pharmacologic management of depression. The study provides a biological explanation for the association between high salt intake and depression, identifying new targets for potential treatments.” BetterHelp is an online service created to help you with your mental health.

However, more research will likely be needed to confirm what this study found. Robert Hostoffer, DO, an American Osteopathic Association board member, not involved in the study, told MNT that, “in general, it is difficult to interpret data from mouse studies due to their difference in nomenclature of their immune systems, both soluble and nonsoluble components.” “Caution should be employed with the data in reference to human subjects. Also, the determination of depression in mice is difficult to translate to depression in humans,” Hostoffer advised. More research would be required to see if people would experience similar results and what the long-term effects might be. Additionally, more research to confirm the findings on the γδT cells may also be helpful. The study authors noted that examination of the molecular mechanisms involved in “HSD-induced IL-17A production in γδT cells” will also be helpful in future research. The researchers did acknowledge that high-salt diets might affect depression somewhat differently because of the behavior they observed in mice when the high-salt diet and chronic restraint stress components were combined. It was different than when the mice only experienced the depressive behavior brought on by chronic restraint stress. They noted that “this suggests that there might be alternate effects of HSD or the combined treatment on depression-like behavior.” This study emphasizes another potential reason why minimizing salt intake is a good thing, as it could offer benefits for mental health in addition to the noted physical health benefits. As noted by the American Heart Association
Trusted Source
 (AHA), consuming too much salt or sodium can increase the risk of problems like high blood pressure, stomach cancer, osteoporosis, and stroke. Registered dietitian nutritionist Karen Z. Berg, MS, RD, CSO, CDN, not involved in the recent study, explained to MNT that: “High sodium intake is especially bad for your heart and kidneys. People who have heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or fatty liver need to really watch their sodium intake so that they don’t make their conditions worse.” Berg further noted the importance of seeing sodium consumption in a realistic way because amounts can often get confusing: “The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that healthy adults limit their sodium to 2,300 mg [milligrams] per day. That may sound like a lot, but it’s the equivalent of about 1 teaspoon of salt! It is important to look at all labels to see how much sodium you’re consuming. In order for an item to be classified as ‘low-sodium,’ it has to have 140 mg of sodium or less per serving. Don’t be fooled by labels that say ‘less sodium’.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/study-suggests-why-adhd-might-increase-dementia-risk,Study suggests why ADHD might increase dementia risk,"Research suggests that adults with ADHD have a higher risk of developing dementia, and the reasons for this are currently unclear. Now, a new study has supported this link and suggested the neurological mechanisms involved in this increased risk. Professor Paul G. Unschuld, head of the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry of the HUG, associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine, and the initiator of the study, explained in a press release why they carried out the research: “Recent epidemiological studies show that adults suffering from ADHD have an increased risk of dementia at an advanced age, but the mechanism through which ADHD constitutes a risk is not known.” Their study, published inPsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences
Trusted Source
, found that adults with ADHD have increased levels of iron in areas of the brain that are associated with cognitive functions. They also found blood biomarkers of nerve damage, similar to those seen in people with dementia. “The findings provide an interesting perspective on the long-term neurological effects of ADHD, but the study’s small sample size (32 ADHD patients) means broader conclusions should be approached with caution. More longitudinal research is needed to confirm whether brain iron accumulation and axonal damage directly increase dementia risk or if other factors (e.g., lifestyle, medication, genetics) contribute to the observed patterns.” — Steve Allder, MD, consultant neurologist at Re:Cognition Health, who was not involved in the study Although iron plays an essential role in brain functioning, excessive accumulation can cause damage to nerve cells and immune cells in the brain, leading to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Studies have shown that as we age, iron accumulates in our brains, and this may be associated with poorer cognitive performance. For this study, the researchers recruited 32 adults with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (aged 20-58 years, mean age 35) and 29 age-matched controls (aged 19-59 years, mean age 32). All participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), standardized psychometric testing and assessment of lifestyle factors, such as smoking and body mass index
Trusted Source
 (BMI), that might affect the health of blood vessels in the brain, potentially increasing dementia risk. To assess iron deposition in the brain, the researchers used quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), a form of scanning that can detect areas of magnetism in the brain. Marissa Sobolewski, PhD, Assistant professor of Environmental Medicine and Neuroscience, University of Rochester Medical Center, explained the importance of this: “Fe [iron] is critically important for neuronal myelination and more research is needed to understand how iron overload can influence neuronal damage, including research on a form of cell death called ferroptosis. Iron overload is a common phenotype associated with neurodegenerative disease and an important area for future research focused on neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD.” They also measured neurofilament light chain
Trusted Source

 — the area of the brain that controls voluntary movement — the cerebral white matter, which is responsible for communication between nerve cells to enable cognitive functions and several other structures in the brain. “It is important that we begin to recognize that many diseases and disorders of the nervous system are co-morbid and share similar mechanisms of injury, like white matter and neuronal damage. Instead of studying these diseases and disorders in isolation, we should begin to study risk factors that these disorders share.”
— Marissa Sobolewski As well as having higher iron levels than control individuals, those with ADHD had raised NfL levels in their blood plasma, indicating neuroaxonal damage. Studies have found that people in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease have increased NfL, a biomarker of neurodegenerative brain change, in their cerebrospinal fluid, as well as in their blood. Allder explained: “Iron plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter synthesis, especially dopamine, which is already known to be dysregulated in ADHD. However, excess iron can lead to oxidative stress, damaging neurons and possibly accelerating neurodegeneration.” “High iron levels can promote oxidative stress, which may damage neuronal axons. This aligns with the increased NfL levels found in ADHD patients, which indicate axonal injury,” he added.

Studies have found that people with ADHD may have widespread micro- and macro-structural differences in their brain from people without this diagnosis. The authors suggest that in adult ADHD, there may be a link between excess brain iron and neuroaxonal vulnerability, possibly mediated by oxidative stress, which could account for the association between adult ADHD and dementia. “If ADHD-related brain changes persist into adulthood, the combination of oxidative stress, inflammation and neuroaxonal vulnerability could increase susceptibility to neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s.” — Steve Allder The authors acknowledge limitations in their study, particularly that as a cross-sectional study, it cannot detect changes in participants over time.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/could-a-low-calorie-keto-diet-help-reverse-biological-aging,Could a low-calorie keto diet help reverse biological aging?,"Obesity affects more than 40% of adults
Trusted Source
 in the United States, and one of the health concerns related to obesity is how it affects different systems in the body. When a person’s body age is higher than their chronological age, this can put them at a higher risk of developing chronic diseases. It is also linked to a shorter lifespan. The scientists who conducted the new study further explored obesity and epigenetic aging
Trusted Source
. They found that people with obesity who were on a very low-calorie ketogenic diet for 180 days had an epigenetic age of more than 6 years lower than when they started. The study findings appear in Nutrients. Ketogenic diets, once primarily used by people with epilepsy to reduce seizures, are popular for weight loss. The thinking behind ketogenic diets
Trusted Source
 is that by consuming a reduced amount of carbs — typically under 50 grams (g) of carbs per day — people can put their bodies into metabolic ketosis and shed fat more quickly. This approach is somewhat controversial
Trusted Source
 since a food group is restricted, and some evidence suggests it may cause low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to rise, which is linked to a higher risk of developing heart disease or having a stroke. Obesity is linked to a body mass index
Trusted Source
 (BMI) of 30 or higher, and it can accelerate biological aging by altering DNA methylation patterns, which are measured using epigenetic clocks. When someone’s biological age is higher than their chronological age, they are susceptible to premature aging
Trusted Source
 and a shorter lifespan. The researchers in the new study explored accelerated epigenetic aging, obesity, and whether a very low-calorie ketogenic diet could impact this aging measurement. They tested this using Horvath, Hannum, and Levine age clocks in a cross-sectional cohort of two groups and in a longitudinal cohort: For the cross-sectional cohort, the researchers focused on determining biological age. With the longitudinal cohort, they put the group on a very low-calorie ketogenic diet for 180 days and took blood samples baseline, after 30 days on the very low-calorie ketogenic diet, and at the 180-day endpoint to assess biological age. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us When comparing the normal weight and obesity weight age groups, the researchers found that people in the obesity group had higher biological age. People with obesity had an accelerated epigenetic age of 4.4 years, while people in the normal-weight group exhibited a deceleration of 3.1 years. While this discrepancy in aging between normal-weight and obesity groups was concerning, the researchers established with their longitudinal cohort that it is possible to reverse the aging process through nutritional choices. When analyzing blood samples taken at 30 days on nutritional ketosis – when the body is thought to be in the process of burning fat – the participants had an age deceleration of 6.1 years. At the 180-day endpoint, this participants sustained age deceleration, with an average age deceleration of 6.2 years. The researchers suspect that being in nutritional ketosis is responsible for decelerated aging. They noted that levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body produced during ketosis, were linked to slower biological aging. In addition to experiencing an age deceleration, people on the very low-calorie ketogenic diet saw improvements in glucose and insulin levels, which is significant since people with obesity are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Overall, the scientists established that obesity and biological aging are connected and that it can potentially be reversed. The researchers noted that larger studies should be conducted to “reinforce and consolidate the role of ketone bodies in the epigenetic regulation of aging.” Mir Ali, MD, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California, spoke with Medical News Today about the study. “The key factors through which obesity affects aging is by inducing greater inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction,” Ali, who was not involved in this research, said when explaining how obesity can accelerate biological age. “Stress and inflammation cause increased breakdown of critical cellular functions in the body, leading to accelerated aging,” he continued. As for the study results, Ali found them interesting but was not convinced that the very low-calorie ketogenic diet alone was responsible for the age deceleration. “A very low-calorie ketogenic diet does show benefits, but any weight loss leading to a patient achieving a healthy weight has been shown to improve all medical conditions and prolong the life span; it is difficult to definitively conclude that the type of diet is independent of the weight loss,” noted Ali. Tiffany Marie Hendricks, MD double-board certified in family and lifestyle medicine, also weighed in on the study for MNT. Hendricks, who was not involved in the study, is affiliated with Full Health and Wellness in Athens, AL. She addressed the very low-calorie ketogenic diet from a clinical perspective. Hendricks had some concerns about the safety and sustainability of this approach. “Translating very low-calorie ketogenic diet findings into clinical guidelines faces several challenges,” she told us. Hendricks explained that: “Very low-calorie ketogenic diet involves severe calorie restriction (typically [under] 800 kcal/day [kilocalories per day]) and high fat intake, which may pose risks like nutrient deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, or ketoacidosis if not properly monitored. The study does not report adverse events in detail, but long-term safety data are lacking, especially for vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, those with kidney issues).” Share this article In this episode of our podcast, Medical News Today explores the potential benefits and drawbacks of being on a ketogenic diet for the management of… Can selenium really protect against aging?

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/new-onset-type-2-diabetes-linked-to-higher-colorectal-pancreatic-liver-cancer-risk,"New-onset type 2 diabetes linked to higher colorectal, pancreatic, liver cancer risk","As of 2021, researchers estimated that about 10.5% of the world’s adult population has diabetes, with 90% of cases being type 2 diabetes. Obesity is a known risk factor
Trusted Source
 for type 2 diabetes, and both of these conditions can increase a person’s chances of developing certain forms of cancer. Now a new study presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025) reports that new-onset type 2 diabetes may increase a person’s risk for developing certain obesity-related cancers, including colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancer. The study has not yet undergone peer review or appeared in print. For this study, researchers analyzed data from participants within the U.K. Biobank. More than 23,000 study participants with new-onset type 2 diabetes were matched to over 71,000 other participants without the condition based on their body mass index (BMI), age, and gender, with an average follow-up of 5 years. Scientists also searched for incidents of obesity-related cancers, including: “Research has shown that cancer-related mortality is increasing in people with type 2 diabetes and we want to help identify whether type 2 diabetes is causing cancer, or are the increased cancers in people living with type 2 diabetes due to the coexistence of obesity,” Owen Tipping, BSc, an MBPhD researcher at the University of Manchester and co-lead author of this study told Medical News Today. “This can help with the creation of new potential cancer preventative measures and guide whether people with diabetes should undergo cancer screening,” Tipping explained. “We decided to look at type 2 diabetes and obesity-related cancers because obesity has strong evidence for a causal association with at least 13 cancer types, but this is not so clear for type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes and obesity are associated with similar cancers, and these conditions also often co-exist, making it difficult to decipher whether type 2 diabetes causes cancer, or whether it’s due to coexiting obesity.” – Owen Tipping, BSc Our printable list compiles our favorite nutritious snack ideas to help you manage your blood sugar levels. Join our Type 2 Diabetes newsletter for your free copy and expert guidance twice a week. Your privacy is important to us At the study’s conclusion, Tipping and his team found that new-onset type 2 diabetes was correlated to a 48% increased risk of developing an obesity-related cancer in men, and a 24% heightened chance in women. “The significance of this is that type 2 diabetes may increase risk of cancer independent of obesity, rather than it being solely due to obesity — i.e in the scenario where a person living with diabetes has a healthy BMI value,” Tipping explained. Additionally, scientists found a link between new-onset type 2 diabetes and an increased risk for three of the researched obesity-related cancers. Colorectal cancer risk increased by 27% for men and 34% for women, liver cancer chances almost quadrupled for men and increased five-fold for women. And pancreatic cancer risk almost doubled for women and increased by 74% for men. “The significance of [these findings] is that whilst obesity is causally associated with these cancers, there is evidence from this study that type 2 diabetes is also associated — might be causal here, but more evidence is needed to confirm this,” Tipping said. “Cancer screening for people living with type 2 diabetes might be beneficial to detect these cancers early.” “We plan to replicate this study in cohorts of different ancestry, to verify whether these findings are consistent across different populations,” he added. MNT had the opportunity to speak with Anton Bilchik, MD, PhD, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine and Director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA, about this study. “I found the study quite surprising since we know that there is a relationship between non-insulin dependent diabetes, obesity, and several cancers,” Bilchik commented. “And the fact that this study demonstrated a relationship between newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes, obesity, and some cancers and not others was quite surprising to me. “The study suggests and supports that there are other mechanisms involved in the development of certain cancers, such as hyperinsulinemia, inflammation, the microbiome, and that there are several possible causes other than those related to obesity,” he continued. “I think that there need to be more prospective studies looking at patients that are obese that have type 2 diabetes versus those that don’t and monitoring them prospectively, measuring inflammatory markers, measuring biomarkers
Trusted Source
, looking at the microbiome to better understand the causes of some of these so-called obesity-related cancers,” said Bilchik. MNT also spoke with Jack Jacoub, MD, a board-certified medical oncologist and medical director of MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA, about this research. Jacoub commented that for him, it was still unclear how strong the link is between type 2 diabetes and the cancers discussed in the study. “The obesity-related cancers and the lifestyle modifications that individuals can make to reduce that is probably the bigger message,” Jacoub explained. “It’s interesting, but I wouldn’t go out and tell every type 2 diabetic they’re at increased risk for X number of cancers and to worry about that.” “I would just tell them to try to focus on improving their hemoglobin A1C and getting their sugar under control and their weight under control,” he advised. “There’s been several data sets about trying to treat the insulin pathway or use the insulin pathway as somehow a benefit to patients with cancer,” Jacoub continued. “There’s a case of giving an anti-diabetic drug, metformin, in the case of breast cancer — it’s a very large trial going on — and others to see if there’s any possible way to impact it.” “But it still always comes down to core principles for patients because there’s only so much in your control,” Jacoub added. “Type 2 diabetes, unlike insulin-dependent [type 1] diabetes, is one mediated by weight, diet, lack of activity, etc. And if those are things that you can improve, there’s downstream benefits, not only reducing these cancers, but others as well [and] cardiovascular disease,” he pointed out.

 than ever, we all want to know the secrets to healthy aging. Previous research has shown that certain lifestyle factors like not smoking, limiting alcohol use
Trusted Source
, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and eating healthy all play a role in healthy aging. Now, a new study has found that following specific dietary patterns — that focus on eating plant-based foods and limiting ultra-processed and animal-based foods — may help a person age healthy with no chronic diseases or cognitive issues
Trusted Source
 at age 70. The findings were recently published in the journal Nature Medicine
Trusted Source
. For this study, researchers analyzed health data from more than 105,000 adult participants of the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Participants ranged in age from 39 to 69 at the start of the study and were followed for 30 years, during which time they were regularly asked questions about their diet. Scientists defined “healthy aging” for this study as reaching the age of 70 without a major chronic condition and maintaining good cognitive, physical, and mental health. “More than three out of four older adults report having at least one chronic disease, one in two experiences functional limitations, and one in 10 lives with dementia,” Anne-Julie Tessier, RD, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition at the University of Montreal, researcher at the Montreal Heart Institute, visiting scientist at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, and first author of this study told Medical News Today. “Studies have previously focused on specific diseases or how long people live (mortality). Healthy aging, however, takes a multifaceted view. It asks: Can you live independently and enjoy a good quality of life as you age?”

Your privacy is important to us Researchers focused on eight different dietary patterns for this study: According to the researchers, all dietary patterns shared similarities such as promoting an intake of fruits, vegetables and whole grains, while reducing the amount of red and processed meats. The scientists also analyzed participants’ consumption of ultra-processed foods. At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that participants who most closely followed the AHEI dietary pattern were most likely to age healthy. This group had an 86% higher chance of healthy aging at age 70 and a 2.2-fold higher likelihood of healthy aging at age 75 compared with participants who followed this dietary pattern least closely. “A higher AHEI score reflects a diet that was elaborated to prevent chronic diseases; it emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats,” Tessier explained. “Having a high Alternative Healthy Eating Index score would translate into eating five servings per day of vegetables, and having an extra serving of green leafy vegetables, four servings per day of fruits, five to six servings per day of whole grains, a serving per day of plant protein such as nuts or legumes, a serving of fish weekly, and using plant oils as the main culinary fat.”
— Anne-Julie Tessier, RD, PhD “Yet, higher adherence to all healthy dietary patterns that we examined were associated with healthy aging,” she continued. “People who adhered to eight healthy dietary patterns in midlife, especially those rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, were 45-86% more likely to achieve healthy aging. This suggests that what you eat in midlife can play a big role in how well you age,” she said. “Diet is the second leading modifiable risk factor for chronic disease, following tobacco use. Despite its importance, few studies have explored the link between dietary patterns and overall healthy aging. Our study underscores the potential for dietary recommendations to not only focus on disease prevention but also to promote healthy aging as a long-term objective,” Tessier added. MNT spoke with Mir Ali, MD, a board certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. “I thought it was a great study looking at the effects of diet on overall health,” Ali commented. “We’ve known for some time that diet greatly affects lots of health conditions, and this is a good study showing that it actually improves long-term health.” “The population overall is aging, and so as we age, we encounter more health issues,” he continued. “And if we can find ways to reduce, minimize, or even eliminate some of these health issues just by dietary changes, that would benefit a lot of people,” he said. “(For the) different types of diets (it) may be helpful to break that down further, to come up with the optimal diet based on age and general health.”
— Mir Ali, MD While many readers will be familiar with the Mediterranean, MIND, and DASH diets, some of these other dietary patterns are not as common. How can readers determine the best diet for them to follow so they age as healthy as possible? Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, advised readers to focus less on the name or label of a dietary pattern, and more on the commonality of what is included in the dietary patterns that have been associated with positive outcomes as they take inventory of their own diet. “Essentially what AHEI and the other dietary patterns are categorizing are food groups high in quality, appropriate in portion, varied in selection, and balanced in composition,” Richard explained to MNT. “In other words, foods that are highly nutritious are automatically going to prevent, treat, or course correct the path of chronic disease — the purpose of creation of the AHEI, and many of these including DASH, MIND, etc. The earlier we start with these foundational essentials the more effective they will be as we age.”
— Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN Richard suggested thinking of diets more as “brands” and examining the integrity of their composition by asking: “I encourage my clients and patients to consider the words of Michael Pollan — paraphrasing and with much nuance clarified — we want to eat more plants and eat less food made in a plant,” she said.

Among many misunderstandings, we cover what causes IBS and what to know about exercise and diet changes. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder that affects around 11% of adults worldwide. Symptoms include: While relatively common, IBS is often misunderstood. To help us dispel some prevalent myths about this condition, we spoke with Dr. Ashkan Farhadi, a gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, and Dr. Mollie J. Jackson, a gastroenterologist at the University of Kansas Health System. Dr. Farhadi told Medical News Today that although research is uncovering more about IBS, we still do not know what causes it. While certain foods such as dairy products or spicy foods may trigger symptoms, they do not cause the condition. He noted, however, that post-infectious IBS can be caused by bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni
Trusted Source
. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us In recent years, research
Trusted Source
 has suggested that levels of mental stress influence gut bacteria composition and play a key role in IBS via the gut-brain axis. Dr. Farhadi says, however, that people with and without IBS generally face similar amounts of stress, meaning that it may be how people manage stress — rather than stress alone — that influences whether or not they may experience IBS symptoms. “In my book on IBS, [I wrote about a study showing] that when a person is stressed, numbers of mast cells in their gut increase. So stress doesn’t just increase the release of hormones and mediators in the gut; it also changes the anatomy of the gut in a way that makes it more sensitive to stress,” he explained. “This means that even if you come out of that stressful period, your gut is not the same gut you had before. IBS symptoms triggered by stress can thus linger even though the stress is gone. And this is very common in patients with IBS,” he added. Dr. Farhadi also mentioned a study
Trusted Source
 he conducted that found that subjective perception of well-being is linked to fewer symptoms of IBS. Previous research
Trusted Source
 has also suggested that psychological, social, and genetic factors may all play a role in the development of IBS symptoms. “IBS can be diagnosed without fancy tests,” Dr. Farhadi told us. “With the right clinical criteria, doctors can diagnose IBS with 97% accuracy in 5 years. No other test in the medical field has that kind of accuracy.” “We diagnose IBS based on the Rome IV criteria: Patients with IBS should report symptoms of abdominal pain at least once weekly — on average — in association with a change in stool frequency, a change in stool form, and/or relief or worsening of abdominal pain related to defecation,” explained Dr. Jackson. “There are subtypes of IBS, and you may have predominantly diarrhea, constipation, or a mixed pattern. Patients often also experience bloating, but his symptom is not needed in making the diagnosis,” she added. There are different ways of treating IBS, including a mixture of prescription medication and lifestyle changes tailored to each person’s individual situation. “I can assure you in the overwhelming majority of cases, management is very cheap and simple: fiber, probiotics, reassurance, and exercise,” said Dr. Farhadi. When it comes to medication, according to Dr. Farhadi, it can be a “trial and error” experience. However, it can help relieve the symptoms caused by IBS, alongside other interventions. “Ultimately, there is no cure for IBS,” Dr. Farhadi noted, and sometimes medication may “only [work] like a bandaid for symptom relief. I have to repeat prescriptions for medications like management of bacterial overgrowth with antibiotics. Ultimately, there is no cure for IBS.” “IBS is often a chronic, debilitating, and common disorder of the gut-brain interaction,” said Dr. Jackson. Its “prevalence in North America is 10-15% and is associated with increased health care costs,” she emphasized, adding that “[I]t can significantly affect patients’ quality of life.” “One study
Trusted Source
 highlighted the negative impact of IBS with patients reporting that they would give up 10–15 years of their life expectancy for an instant cure for their condition.” While Dr. Farhadi agreed that some kinds of exercise do help IBS, he said that not all exercise is the same. “Competitive exercise doesn’t relieve stress — it produces stress. The same is true for weight-lifting in the gym if you have to pay a lot of attention to what kind of weight you’re lifting, how you’re pulling this muscle, and how you’re pushing that muscle,” he noted. He also said that many runners have what is known as “runner’s run,” or diarrhea after running for long periods. Thus, he warned, it is very likely that long periods of running can cause IBS symptoms to flare. While some studies
Trusted Source
 suggest that meditation may help relieve symptoms of IBS, research is ongoing. “We are continuing to understand the brain-gut-microbiome axis and how it plays a role in IBS,” said Dr. Jackson. “Gut-directed psychotherapies have been shown to be beneficial in improving IBS symptoms.” “Meditation and mindfulness have shown to help stimulate changes in the brain and how we process thoughts, sensations, and emotional responses, and this may positively affect how we perceive and interpret signals from the gut, thus improving IBS symptoms,” she added. That said, different kinds of meditation may work differently for different people. While it may not work for everyone, Dr. Farhadi recommends “mindless meditation,” which includes walking for 30 minutes per day on the same route until it gets so boring that one stops paying attention to their surroundings. “That’s a meditative walk — you do meditation and walk together. It’s a stress reliever to reboot your system. But it needs a lot of practice. After 1 year, you may get into that zone for 1 minute out of the 15 you’re trying to do,” he said. Sometimes, it seems like even your usual safe foods can trigger symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. But if you don't eat, you risk weight loss and even worse symptoms. Let's meet your nutritional needs. A recent review
Trusted Source
 found that, although many patients with IBS report milk intolerance, there is no conclusive link between IBS and lactose intolerance. As around two-thirds
Trusted Source
 of the world’s population is lactose intolerant, it is reasonably likely for someone to be lactose intolerant and have IBS. This means that cutting out dairy products may help relieve gastrointestinal symptoms. “Many patients with IBS associate their symptoms with eating and try to ease their symptoms by avoiding certain foods,” said Dr. Jackson. “An elimination diet involves removing multiple foods out of your daily diet and then slowly reintroducing them to help identify trigger foods.” “The most studied diet for IBS is the low FODMAP diet. FODMAP foods can lead to increased gas and distension and the triggering of meal-related symptoms in patients with IBS. Dairy is a high FODMAP food, and for some/many may be a dietary trigger, but this is not universally true,” she explained. “Food choices can be overwhelming and if available, a gastrointestinal dietician can help guide you in this process,” she added. Natural remedies such as peppermint oil
Trusted Source
 and cardamom have shown some promise in relieving symptoms of IBS and gastric ulcers. However, research into natural remedies is limited, so they may not be universally helpful. “Black cardamom seeds and spearmint are muscle relaxants for the gut, and so they could reduce symptoms,” said Dr. Farhadi. “People can try these natural remedies and others as long as they are not really strong chemicals. Many herbal remedies have been around for thousands of years, and people are using them with no problem,” he added. Nevertheless, it is always recommended to check with a doctor before taking on any new line of treatment. “Imagine you have an engine, and the engine has a problem. Now you turn it off. Or course, you may not have any problems as long as it’s off, but how long can you keep it off?” said Dr. Farhadi. “So, if you reduce the number of times you eat from perhaps three to two times per day, you may reduce the number of symptoms you experience per day. It may help, but it isn’t necessarily the way to go,” he explained. “Fasting, however, is good for other things — such as weight loss and memory,” he added. If a patient has chronic constipation, Dr. Farhadi said that fiber could help. However, if overdone, fiber can lead to bloating from excess gas in the gut. To avoid this, Dr. Farhadi recommended consuming fiber via a pinch of water-soluble fiber psyllium — a prebiotic — on a spoon of Greek yogurt, which is a probiotic. “There’s no specific diet for IBS,” said Dr. Farhadi. “Diets are not only individualized; they are dynamic. One person may be able to drink coffee when on vacation yet experiences problems with it during finals. As there is no specific diet for different individuals, there is no specific diet for individuals at all times,” he advised.

This article will use the terms “male,” “female,” or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. Click here to learn more. Sometimes, depending on the tissue’s location, it can cause problems with fertility. Moreover, endometriosis can occur in or around other organs, including the lungs. Worldwide, approximately 10%
Trusted Source
 of females of reproductive age have endometriosis. Although extremely rare, endometriosis in males can occur
Trusted Source
. Furthermore, because endometriosis symptoms are so varied, people with the condition often experience a delay in diagnosis. Risk factors for endometriosis include
Trusted Source
 having a mother, sibling, or daughter with the condition, having periods that began before age 11, or having periods that are heavy or last longer than 7 days. Having a history of short monthly cycles of fewer than 27 days can also increase the risk of endometriosis in some individuals. Confirming an endometriosis diagnosis often involves laparoscopic surgery, a common surgical procedure done under anesthesia. Once a doctor confirms a diagnosis, treatments include managing the symptoms with hormone therapy or pain relief medication. If the pain associated with endometriosis is severe or if fertility has become affected, surgery is an option. However, there is currently no known cure for the condition. Despite these known facts, many myths surround endometriosis, leaving many people confused about what to believe. To help separate fact from fiction, we talked with Dr. Barbara Stegmann, clinical lead, Woman’s Health at Organon and OB-GYN, and Carly King, N.D., licensed naturopathic doctor at Entrepreneur and The Health Centre Integrative Therapies. We also looked at recent peer-reviewed research to reveal the science-backed truths about endometriosis. Although estimates suggest that more than half
Trusted Source
 of all menstruating females experience some pain during periods, severe pain can sometimes indicate the presence of endometriosis. Dr. King told Medical News Today: “Periods can be heavy and painful with endometriosis, but it’s not always the case. Pain can show up in other areas, such as with bowel pain, urinary pain, ovulation pain, as well as pain in other areas of the body. Period bleeds can vary in volume — cycle lengths can also vary, with midcycle bleeding a potential symptom as well.” Dr. Stegmann added: “Periods are normally very heavy/very painful — this is only a partial myth. Some people do have very heavy, very painful periods, but that is only one end of the spectrum. Some have mild cramps and light periods, and some have pain between periods. So, it is best to speak to [a healthcare professional] if you have concerns.” “Pregnancy does not cure endometriosis,” Dr. King told MNT. “Some women see improvements in symptoms during pregnancy, although others do not, and still others may see a worsening of symptoms,” she added. Dr. Stegmann also emphasized that “[t]here are no cures for endometriosis.” Still, she explained that pregnancy does cause hormone levels to change. This variation in hormones may result in people experiencing different pain levels after having a baby. Research also suggests that pregnancy does not seem to offer benefits for women with endometriosis. In addition, scientists note that although some endometriosis lesions show regression, others remain stable or increase.

Trusted Source
 of the participants were satisfied with the results after surgery. However, while “[a] hysterectomy can relieve symptoms of endometriosis for many people, […] the condition can recur after the surgery,” Dr. King noted. “Symptoms can also continue if there are endometrial lesions still present outside of the uterus,” she added. “Endometriosis responds to estrogen, which is made by the ovaries. A hysterectomy typically removes the uterus versus the ovaries and therefore wouldn’t cure endometriosis,” Dr. Stegmann further explained. “There are different types of endometriosis, from lesions that are just on the surface to those that invade into the bowel and other organs. That type is called deep infiltrating endometriosis, or DIE. Those lesions will likely not improve even if you have your ovaries removed or your hormones suppressed,” she continued. “Endometriosis lesions are most commonly found in the pelvis and lower abdomen,” Dr. King told MNT. “However, they can develop anywhere in the body,” she noted. Dr. Stegmann explained further: “Actually, most endometriosis does not affect the reproductive organs but implants on the inside of your abdomen on a surface called the peritoneum. That is what causes pain. But endometriosis can be found just about anywhere and has been seen in the lining of the lung and even in the brain, where it causes seizures when the woman has a period.” “Fortunately, this does not occur very often, and your [healthcare professional] should be able to help watch for signs or symptoms of implants [located in] other places,” she continued. Still, a 2017 study
Trusted Source
 in mice that investigated the potential for endometrial-derived cells to migrate to other organs of the body suggests that endometriosis in locations distant from the pelvis may be more common than previously recognized. Study data suggest that more than 60%
Trusted Source
 of females with an endometriosis diagnosis report chronic pelvic pain. Moreover, people with endometriosis are 13 times more likely to have abdominal pain than those without the condition. Still, Dr. King notes that despite pain being a common symptom, it is possible to receive a diagnosis of endometriosis even if a person is not experiencing any pain. Dr. Stegmann added: “Some people with mild forms of endometriosis have excruciating pain, and some people with DIE have little or no pain at all. We think this may be related to whether the implant releases certain pain-causing chemicals, as well as where the implant occurs. In fact, some people never know they have really advanced endometriosis until they have […] abdominal surgery.” Although research is limited, scientists estimate that 2–5%
Trusted Source
 of females have postmenopausal endometriosis. Dr. King told MNT: “Endometriosis doesn’t necessarily end when you’re in menopause. In fact, the condition can develop years after your periods stop.” Dr. Stegmann explained, “For the same reason that a hysterectomy doesn’t always cure endometriosis, menopause may not cure it either.” She suggested that if endometriosis-related pain does not stop after menopause, it is best to consult a healthcare professional about pain management options. Studies suggest that 30–50%
Trusted Source
 of females with endometriosis also experience difficulty becoming pregnant. Still, Dr. King noted that despite statistics linking the condition to fertility challenges, “endometriosis does not automatically mean a diagnosis of infertility.” Dr. Stegmann agreed: “I have had patients with [severe] endometriosis that become pregnant and those with mild endometriosis that do have issues. The only way to know if you will have problems with getting pregnant is to try. Just make sure you work with your [healthcare professional], since many of the medications used to treat endometriosis prevent pregnancy and will need to be stopped for you to be successful.” The myth that abortion causes endometriosis may have surfaced due to abortion-related political debate. However, this is not a fact-based claim. Dr. King told MNT: “While the exact cause of endometriosis is still unknown, there does appear to be a genetic link. There is no evidence that abortion causes endometriosis.” When asked whether having an abortion could cause endometriosis, Dr. Stegmann was clear: “Absolutely not. There is no association between abortion and endometriosis.” Although Dr. King noted that birth control pills do not cure endometriosis, “they may help reduce symptoms due to suppression of ovulation and menses,” she explained. “Nothing cures endometriosis,” Dr. Stegmann reiterated. “But birth control pills do treat endometriosis by leveling out your hormones and preventing you from bleeding. So, they are a good treatment, but not a cure,” she explained. Other medications used to treat endometriosis include pain relievers, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Additionally, in 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, a medication to help treat the pain associated with endometriosis. Debunking this myth, Dr. King said: “High estrogen levels have not been shown to cause endometriosis. However, estrogen-blocking medications can help relieve symptoms.” Additionally, research
Trusted Source
 suggests that although high estrogen levels may not cause endometriosis, estrogen and its receptors may play a role in the processes that scientists associate with the condition. Still, a 2022 study
Trusted Source
 notes that preventing or treating endometriosis may also involve therapies that target immune system activity. The scientists who conducted the study found evidence suggesting that the activation of specific white blood cells may result in chronic inflammation and may contribute to the development of the condition.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/medical-myths-all-about-stroke,Medical Myths: All about stroke,"This installment of our Medical Myths series delves into misconceptions about stroke. Among many misunderstandings, we cover whether stroke is a heart problem and what to know about ministrokes and paralysis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Trusted Source
, over 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke every year, and around 610,000 are first strokes. In 2019, stroke was the second
Trusted Source
 leading cause of mortality globally, accounting for 11% of deaths. There are three main types
Trusted Source
 of stroke. The first and most common, accounting for 87% of cases, is an ischemic stroke. It occurs when blood flow through the artery that supplies oxygen to the brain becomes blocked. The second is a hemorrhagic stroke, caused by a rupture in an artery in the brain, which in turn damages surrounding tissues. The third type of stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA)
Trusted Source
, which is sometimes called a “ministroke.” It happens when blood flow is temporarily blocked to the brain, usually for no more than 5 minutes. While stroke is very common, it is often misunderstood. To help us dispel myths on the topic and improve our understanding, we got in touch with Dr. Rafael Alexander Ortiz, chief of Neuro-Endovascular Surgery and Interventional Neuro-Radiology at Lenox Hill Hospital. Although stroke risk is linked to cardiovascular risk factors
Trusted Source
, strokes happen in the brain, not the heart. “Some people think that stroke is a problem of the heart,” Dr. Ortiz told MNT. “That is incorrect. A stroke is a problem of the brain, caused by the blockage or rupture of arteries or veins in the brain, and not the heart.” Some people confuse stroke with a heart attack
Trusted Source
, which is caused by a blockage in blood flow to the heart, and not the brain. “The most common risk factors [for stroke] include hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, trauma to the head or neck, and cardiac arrhythmias,” said Dr. Ortiz. Many of these risk factors can be modified by lifestyle
Trusted Source
. Exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet can reduce risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes. Other risk factors
Trusted Source
 include alcohol consumption and stress. Working to reduce or remove these lifestyle factors may also reduce a person’s risk of stroke.

Trusted Source
 including a higher risk for high blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors may also indirectly increase stroke risk. As families are likely to share environments and lifestyles, unhealthy lifestyle factors are likely to increase stroke risk among family members, especially when coupled with genetic risk factors. The most common symptoms for stroke form the acronym “F.A.S.T.
Trusted Source
“: Other symptoms
Trusted Source
 of stroke include: “There is an incorrect belief that strokes are irreversible and can’t be treated,” explained Dr. Ortiz. “Emergency treatment of a stroke with injection of a clot busting drug, minimally invasive mechanical thrombectomy for clot removal, or surgery can reverse the symptoms of a stroke in many patients, especially if they arrive to the hospital early enough for the therapy (within minutes or hours since the onset of the symptoms),” he noted. “The longer the symptoms last, the lower the likelihood of a good outcome. Therefore, it is critical that at the onset of stroke symptoms — ie. trouble speaking, double vision, paralysis or numbness, etc — an ambulance should be called (911) for transport to the nearest hospital,” he continued. Research
Trusted Source
 also shows that those who arrive within 3 hours of first experiencing symptoms typically have less disability 3 months afterward than those who arrived later. Age is a significant risk factor for stroke. Stroke risk doubles
Trusted Source
 every 10 years after age 55. However, strokes can occur at any age. One study
Trusted Source
 examining healthcare data found that 34% of stroke hospitalizations in 2009 were under age 65. A review
Trusted Source
 in 2013 points out that “approximately 15% of all ischemic strokes occur in young adults and adolescents.” The researchers noted that stroke risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lipid disorders, and tobacco use were among the most common co-existing conditions among this age group. Not all strokes have symptoms, and some research suggests that symptom-free strokes are far more common than those with symptoms. One study
Trusted Source
 found that out of the over 11 million strokes in 1998, 770,000 presented symptoms, whereas close to 11 million were silent. Evidence
Trusted Source
 of these so-called silent strokes appears on MRI scans as white spots from scarred tissue following a blockage or ruptured blood vessel. Often, silent strokes are identified when patients receive MRI scans for symptoms including headaches, cognitive issues, and dizziness. Although they occur without symptoms, they should be treated similarly to strokes with symptoms. Silent strokes put people at risk of future symptomatic strokes
Trusted Source
, cognitive decline, and dementia. “The term ministroke has been used incorrectly as some think that it is related to small strokes that carry low risk,” said Dr. Ortiz. “That statement is incorrect, as a ministroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA).” “It is not a small stroke, but a premonition that a large stroke can occur. Any symptom of acute stroke, transient or persistent, needs emergency workup and management to prevent a devastating large stroke,” he added. Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability, but not everyone who has a stroke will experience paralysis or weakness. Research
Trusted Source
 shows that stroke leads to reduced mobility in over half of stroke survivors aged 65 and over. However, the long-term impacts
Trusted Source
 of stroke vary on many factors, such as the amount of brain tissue affected and the area affected. Damage to the left brain, for example, will affect the right side of the body and vice versa. If the stroke occurs in the left side
Trusted Source
 of the brain, effects may include: If it affects the right side
Trusted Source
 of the brain, paralysis may also occur, this time on the left side of the body. Other effects may include: Recovery from stroke can take months, if not years. However, many may not fully recover. The American Stroke Association
Trusted Source
 says that among stroke survivors: Research
Trusted Source
 suggests there is a critical time window between 2–3 months after stroke onset, during which intensive motor rehabilitation is more likely to lead to recovery. Some may also be able to spontaneously recover during this period. Beyond this window, and beyond the 6-month mark, improvements are still possible although are likely to be significantly slower.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/medical-myths-all-about-copd,Medical Myths: All about COPD,"Today’s edition of Medical Myths centers on misconceptions about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We cover myths about exercise, body weight, treatments, and more. COPD is an umbrella term for a collection of progressive respiratory conditions, all of which cause breathing difficulties. Two of the most common forms of COPD are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The most prevalent symptoms of COPD are shortness of breath and a cough. Over time, even everyday activities, such as getting dressed, can become challenging. In this article, we cover some of the most common myths associated with COPD. To ensure we provide accurate information, we have recruited two experts. Dr. Neil Schachter is a professor of medicine — pulmonary, critical care, environmental medicine, and public health — at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. He is also medical director of pulmonary rehabilitation at the Mount Sinai Health System. Dr. Shahryar Yadegar is a critical care medicine specialist, pulmonologist, and medical director of the ICU at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center, CA. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), COPD caused 3.23 million
Trusted Source
 deaths in 2019, making it the third leading cause of death worldwide. Dr. Schachter explained that in the United States, COPD “is the fourth leading cause
Trusted Source
 of death. More than 16 million Americans are diagnosed.” Additionally, as Dr. Yadegar told Medical News Today, “millions
Trusted Source
 more people may be undiagnosed.” The American Lung Association (ALA) recommends that anyone who is “experiencing COPD symptoms — chronic cough, shortness of breath, frequent respiratory infections, significant mucus production (also called phlegm or sputum), and/or wheezing — speak with [a] doctor about obtaining a breathing test called ‘spirometry,’ which can help diagnose COPD.” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us It is true that smoking tobacco is the leading cause of COPD, but as Dr. Schachter told MNT, “There are many other risk factors that contribute to the development of the disease, including air pollution, work-related pollution, infection, and some forms of asthma.” Extending this further, Dr. Yadegar told us: “Approximately 10–20% of COPD patients never smoked. Some of these never-smokers include significant secondhand smoke exposure; genetic predisposition, primarily through alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; or substantial exposure to air pollution.” Alpha-1 antitrypsin is an enzyme that protects the body from an immune attack. Some people have a mutation in the gene that codes for this enzyme; this causes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin increases the risk of developing COPD and other conditions that affect a range of bodily systems. COPD is certainly more common in older adults than in younger people, but younger people are not immune to the condition. For instance, in the U.S., between 2007 and 2009, COPD affected 2%
Trusted Source
 of males and 4.1% of females aged 24–44 years. Similarly, the condition affected 2% of males and 3% of females aged 18–24 years. Dr. Schachter told us that a “significant proportion of those individuals diagnosed before the age of 50” have a hereditary form of the disease that causes a deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin. “False,” said Dr. Schachter. “COPD coexists with many comorbidities, including heart disease, lung cancer, hypertension, osteoporosis, and diabetes. The association may be due to common causative factors, as well as ‘systemic inflammation.’” In other words, some of these conditions share risk factors, which makes them more likely to occur with COPD. For instance, smoking is a risk factor for both COPD and heart disease. At the same time, health experts associate COPD with systemic inflammation, which can also independently increase the risk of other conditions. According to Dr. Yadegar, “Without proper guidance, patients with COPD may have difficulty completing physical exercises.” However, he also explained that doctors recommend people with COPD do exercise, as it can help “increase their breathing capacity and improve their daily symptoms.” “Pulmonary rehabilitation programs typically offer guided breathing techniques in conjunction with physical exercise in order to maximize better patient outcomes,” he continued. In a nutshell, Dr. Schachter told us that “exercise is therapeutic for COPD, reducing the number of exacerbations and improving quality of life.” The ALA notes: “You might feel like it is not safe or even possible to exercise, but the right amount and type of exercise has many benefits. Be sure to ask your doctor before you start or make changes to your exercise routine.” This, thankfully, is a myth. “There are numerous therapies and strategies that improve the course of the disease,” Dr. Schachter told MNT, “including medications, rehabilitation, diet, and vaccines that protect against respiratory infections that accelerate the course of the disease.” Dr. Yadegar said, “With a spectrum of presentations, patients may benefit from inhaled bronchodilators, anticholinergics, corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen.” These, he said, can be tailored uniquely to each person. “Certain patients may also benefit from alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation or even lung transplants,” he added. “While both diseases are considered obstructive lung diseases, there are several differences between COPD and asthma,” Dr. Yadegar explained. “Asthma most commonly begins in childhood, where it is frequently associated with allergies and problems of inflammation. COPD usually begins in the 60s and is associated with smoking. There is, however, an overlap syndrome, which has features of both.”

– Dr. Neil Schachter Dr. Yadegar dove into the details: “COPD is a disease of the alveoli, mostly […] a result of elasticity loss induced primarily by smoking. Asthma is a disease of the airways, primarily […] a result of chronic airway inflammation.” “While clinical symptoms may overlap between the two diseases,” he continued, “treatments vary in order to best help patients in the short and long term.” This is not true. Dr. Schachter told us that carrying excess body weight can increase the disability associated with COPD. Conversely, if people have a body weight that is below moderate, it can be “a sign of emphysema and also indicates a poor prognosis.” This is another myth. As Dr. Schachter told MNT, “It is never too late to quit.” He explained that “smoking accelerates the loss of lung function that accompanies COPD.” He also said that smoking tobacco can promote exacerbations of the symptoms. “Shortness of breath is a major presenting symptom but hardly the only one,” according to Dr. Schachter. “Cough, excess phlegm production, respiratory infections, and all the symptoms of the comorbidities are often signs of progressing COPD.” Other symptoms can include sleep problems, anxiety, depression, pain, and cognitive decline. As a matter of fact, a healthy diet can make a difference for people living with COPD. Dr. Schachter told MNT that a healthy diet promotes “general health and can protect against exacerbations of COPD itself and its comorbidities.” For example, a 2020 meta-analysis of eight observational studies investigated the role of diet in COPD. The authors conclude that “healthy dietary patterns are associated with a lower prevalence of COPD, while unhealthy dietary patterns are not.” Similarly, the data generated in another review
Trusted Source
 suggest that “a higher intake of fruits, probably dietary fiber, and fish reduce the risk of COPD.” In summary, although there is no cure for COPD, treatments are available, and lifestyle changes can reduce symptom severity.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/medical-myths-all-about-lung-cancer,Medical Myths: All about lung cancer,"Because November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month, the latest edition of Medical Myths tackles lung cancer. Among a range of misunderstandings and mistruths, we cover pollution, surgery, risk factors, and talcum powder. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2018, there were 218,520 new cases of lung cancer and 142,080 related deaths in the United States. Globally, in 2020, lung cancer was the second most common cancer after breast cancer, with 2.21 million
Trusted Source
 cases. It was responsible for 1.8 million deaths. Although prevalent, lung cancer is commonly misunderstood. To help us get to the truth of the matter, we enlisted the help of Dr. Fred R. Hirsch, executive director of the Center of Excellence for Thoracic Oncology at Mount Sinai’s Tisch Cancer Institute, in New York City. He is also the Joe Lowe and Louis Price Professor of Medicine, Hematology and Medical Oncology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. As Dr. Hirsch explained to Medical News Today, “That is not correct, and unfortunately, it’s a very hurtful myth and causes stigma.” According to the CDC, around 10–20%
Trusted Source
 of people with lung cancer in the U.S. never smoked or have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lives. Every year, around 7,300 deaths
Trusted Source
 from lung cancer among nonsmokers are from secondhand smoke, the CDC reports, and a further 2,900 are from radon exposure. “There are several ways to reduce lung cancer risk,” explained Dr. Hirsch. “First and foremost is smoking prevention and smoking cessation.” For anyone who is trying to give up smoking, here are some evidence-based tips to help. Dr. Hirsch also described the importance of limiting exposure to secondhand smoke, which is sometimes called passive smoking. According to the CDC: “Nonsmokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke at home or at work increase their risk of developing lung cancer by 20–30%
Trusted Source
.” “Other smoking products are also considered to be a potential risk for lung cancer development,” Dr. Hirsch said. “Lung cancer screening with a low-dose CT scan in high-risk populations, such as people who are 50 years old with a history of smoking a pack a day for 20 or more years, reduces lung cancer mortality by more than 20%.” “Other risk factors include radon exposure,” Dr. Hirsch continued. “Thus, measuring radon in your home is important. [In addition,] certain lifestyle behaviors are considered potential risk factors, and exercise and avoiding obesity is important.” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us “No, that is not true.” Dr. Hirsch confirmed. Although more than half
Trusted Source
 of people diagnosed with lung cancer are older than 65, “More and more younger individuals below the age of 50 are getting lung cancer, particularly women
Trusted Source
.” There is good evidence that pollution generated by traffic increases the risk of lung cancer. For instance, the authors of a meta-analysis
Trusted Source
 that investigated this conclude: “Exposure to nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and fine particulate matter were positively associated with a risk of lung cancer. Occupational exposure to air pollution among professional drivers significantly increased the incidence and mortality of lung cancer.” However, comparisons between pollution and smoking are harder to make. “Living in polluted cities is a risk factor, but no one knows for sure whether it is worse than the use of tobacco products, and the combination might be even worse,” explained Dr. Hirsch. Simply put, according to Dr. Hirsch, “Smoking cessation reduces the risk of lung cancer significantly.” Aside from lung cancer, stopping smoking also reduces the risk of developing a range of other conditions, including heart disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes
Trusted Source
. As the National Institute on Aging
Trusted Source
 write: “It doesn’t matter how old you are or how long you’ve been smoking, quitting smoking at any time improves your health. When you quit, you are likely to add years to your life, breathe more easily, have more energy, and save money.” “We believe cannabis represents a risk factor,” explained Dr. Hirsch, “but we need more long-term studies. Epidemiological evidence for an association between cannabis and lung cancer is limited and conflicting.” One of the difficulties in studying this association, he explained, is that people who smoke cannabis often smoke tobacco, too. This makes teasing apart the effects of each factor more challenging. This is not true. Alongside the myriad benefits of quitting smoking, “People with lung cancer who quit smoking have a better prognosis,” confirmed Dr. Hirsch. “No, lung cancer surgery does not make lung cancer spread,” Dr. Hirsch told MNT. He then explained why it is important to have early surgery and the measures taken to prevent any spread. “Lung cancer surgery is advised in early stage lung cancer.” At this stage, he explained, it can cure the cancer. “If a tumor is large or has loco-regional dissemination,” he continued, “adjuvant therapy, such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy before surgery, will further reduce risk of having cancer cells in the blood.” Dr. Hirsch added that clinical research has shown that this approach prolongs survival and reduces the risk of dying. According to Dr. Hirsch, “Talcum has not been associated with higher risk for lung cancer.” He explained how this myth might have started: “Some studies have shown a slightly higher risk in people who are involved in talc mining and processing, but it is not clear whether it is because of the mineral or other things underground known to cause lung cancer, such as the radioactive gas radon.” “Unfortunately, that is not always the case,” Dr. Hirsch explained. “Lung cancer can be detected in totally asymptomatic cases or in individuals with slight respiratory symptoms.” He explained that this is one reason why lung cancer screening in high-risk people is so important. He pointed out that even in nonsmokers there may be an advantage to screening, but studies have not confirmed this yet. “Studies with lung cancer screening in never-smokers are ongoing,” he said, reiterating that catching lung cancer early increases survival rates. Thankfully, this is also false. According to Dr. Hirsch, when healthcare professionals detect lung cancer early, it “has a cure rate of more than 60%.” He continued: “Even lung cancer diagnosed in more advanced disease today has a much better potential for long-term survival in certain situations. Progress in therapy and outcomes for patients with advanced lung cancer that has specific genetic mutations, which can be targeted
Trusted Source
 by specific therapies, has been tremendous over the last decade.” “Because antioxidants play an important role in protecting our cells from DNA damage that could include cancer-causing mutations or other genomic abnormalities, several clinical studies have been performed, but unfortunately, most failed to demonstrate any conclusive protection against lung cancer in a clinical setting,” Dr. Hirsch told us. “There are a few studies indicating that several dietary antioxidants, like carotenoids and vitamin C may protect against lung cancer, but the results overall are somewhat ambiguous. More specific studies in well-defined smoking populations are needed as well as studies of ‘dosages’ of antioxidants.” Smoking is perhaps the most well-known risk factor for lung cancer, but it is certainly not the only one. Other risk factors include a family history of lung cancer, exposure to air pollution, exposure to radon, exposure to asbestos, previous radiation to the chest, and chronic lung disease.

Among other topics, we will discuss treatment, stress, personality, and symptoms beyond the gut. IBD is a condition that affects the gastrointestinal system. The symptoms often include abdominal cramps, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. The symptoms can fluctuate and may last for days, weeks, or months at a time. In 2015, an estimated 3 million
Trusted Source
 people in the United States had IBD. Globally, the disease affected an estimated 6.8 million
Trusted Source
 people in 2017. The most common forms of IBD are Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Both involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. Despite the relatively high prevalence of IBD, a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding surrounds it. Here, we fight fiction with facts. To aid us on our quest, we have enlisted the help of Dr. Abhik Bhattacharya, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY. IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) both affect the digestive system and have similar acronyms. This, perhaps, explains some of the confusion. However, the two conditions are not the same. Dr. Bhattacharya explained to Medical News Today that IBS “is a disorder of the interaction between the gut and brain, leading to diarrhea, constipation, or both, along with bloating and pain. [It] can be worsened or precipitated by stress and anxiety.” Conversely, he continued, IBD “is a disease of a dysregulated immune system, wherein the immune system starts attacking your own gastrointestinal system, leading to damage.” “The disease can lead to stress, worsening anxiety, depression, and loss of sleep because of the devastating consequences it can have on a person’s daily functioning,” he said. “Symptoms can include bleeding in stools, diarrhea, severe belly pain, unintentional weight loss, fevers, chills, rectal pain, fatigue, and more.” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox.

 IBD flares and exacerbate
Trusted Source
 the symptoms in some people, which might help explain the confusion. However, stress does not cause IBD. Some small, decades-old studies have investigated the links between personality traits and IBD. However, when MNT asked Dr. Bhattacharya whether there are any links between a person’s character and IBD, he put it succinctly: “There are none that we know about.” Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis are the most common forms of IBD. However, they are distinct conditions, and people cannot have both. “You can either have Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis,” said Dr. Bhattacharya. “However, in a very small subset of patients, it is hard to determine whether they have Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis. The disease, however, does reveal itself over the course of a patient’s lifetime.” Thankfully, this is untrue. “There are many treatments that are extremely effective for IBD. Depending on what you have and how severe the disease is, we have a plethora of options for medical treatment,” explained Dr. Bhattacharya. He then outlined some of the available interventions: “These include, but are not limited to, biologic medications, such as Remicade [infliximab], Humira [adalimumab], Cimzia [certolizumab pegol], Simponi [golimumab], Entyvio [vedolizumab], and Stelara [ustekinumab], or small molecules like Zeposia [ozanimod] and Xeljanz [tofacitinib]. These are potent immunosuppressant medications, and we are constantly developing new medications through clinical trials.” “No, everyone does not need surgery,” Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT. He explained that in the past, a majority of people with IBD would have undergone surgery. However, “with the advent of very effective and safe immunosuppressant medications,” rates of surgery have dropped significantly over the past 20 years. According to Crohn’s & Colitis UK, about 15% of people with ulcerative colitis will need surgery 10 years after diagnosis. However, in agreement with Dr. Bhattacharya, the organization notes that the improved treatments available mean that this percentage is reducing. “The goal of treatment,” Dr. Bhattacharya said, “is to prevent surgery due to complications of bowel damage.” He advocates for early treatment with potent medications soon after diagnosis. This, he explained, prevents damage, thereby removing the need for surgery. This is not true. “Most IBD medications are very safe during pregnancy,” said Dr. Bhattacharya. He explained that the goal is to keep people with IBD in remission during pregnancy “because the worst thing to happen for both baby and mother is for the disease to be active.” “We have gathered, and continue to gather, a large amount of data regarding the safety of medications during pregnancy.”

– Dr. Bhattacharya There is an important exception, though: methotrexate. Dr. Bhattacharya told us that methotrexate “is stopped even when women with IBD are planning to get pregnant.” Sometimes, it seems like even your usual safe foods can trigger symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. But if you don't eat, you risk weight loss and even worse symptoms. Let's meet your nutritional needs. Once drugs for IBD take effect and the symptoms disappear, it can be tempting to stop taking the medication. However, this is not what doctors recommend. Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT: “At this moment, we don’t have a good way of stopping medications for patients with IBD in remission. […] We don’t recommend stopping medications.” He explained that ending treatment can have serious consequences. For instance, the symptoms might come back, and if the person restarts on the same treatments, these may not work. “While we do have options when it comes to treatment,” he said, “those options are not limitless, and we don’t want to run through medications. There is good data to support that when […] one set of IBD medications [fails], your response to another type may be less likely.” As Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT, a “gluten-free diet works for [people with] celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity,” but it will not benefit those with IBD. Although, as the name suggests, IBD significantly affects the bowel, the disease can also have ramifications on many other parts of the body. “Apart from the gastrointestinal system, which includes the mouth to the anus, IBD can have extraintestinal manifestations like affecting the skin, eyes, and joints, to name a few,” said Dr. Bhattacharya. According to a review
Trusted Source
 of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, they “can involve nearly any organ system […] and can cause a significant challenge to physicians managing IBD patients.” For instance, IBD can affect the musculoskeletal system, as well as the eyes, kidneys, and lungs. It may also damage the hepatopancreatobiliary
Trusted Source
 system, which includes the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and bile duct. At this time, there is no cure for IBD. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya said, “this is a work in progress.” Researchers are working tirelessly to understand the condition better so that they can design better treatments and, perhaps one day, a cure. This, thankfully, is a myth. “They absolutely can,” confirmed Dr. Bhattacharya. “With proper medical management and, sometimes, surgeries, IBD patients can live a completely normal life.” “We have lawyers, doctors, sportsmen, actors, comedians, rock stars, and Presidents — Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy — who have [or had] IBD and lived more than a functional life.”  Share this article In this feature, we address 13 common myths and misconceptions regarding lung cancer.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-much-protein-do-you-need-to-build-muscle,How much protein do you need to build muscle?,"While strength training is important for building muscle, so is consuming the right amount of protein. There has been continuous research and controversy about how much protein is needed to optimize muscle growth. In this Honest Nutrition feature, we discuss current research evaluating the role of protein in muscle growth and how much a person should consume each day. Protein is found in every cell and tissue in the body. While it has many vital roles in the body, protein is crucial for muscle growth because it helps repair and maintain muscle tissue. The current recommended dietary allowance
Trusted Source
 (RDA) to prevent deficiency in minimally active adults is 0.8 grams (g) of protein per kilogram (kg) of body weight. However, newer research suggests individuals trying to build muscle need more than this. Consuming less protein than the body needs has been linked to decreased muscle mass. In contrast, increased protein intakes above the RDA may help increase strength and lean body mass when paired with resistance exercise. Protein is made up of amino acids that act as building blocks for cells and tissues in the body. There are 20 amino acids that combine to form proteins. While some can be synthesized by the human body, others cannot. The nine amino acids that the body cannot make are called essential amino acids. These must be obtained through diet. When a person eats protein, it is digested and broken down into amino acids, which are involved in many processes in the body, including tissue growth and repair, immune function, and energy production. Like other body tissues, muscle proteins
Trusted Source
 are continuously broken down and rebuilt. In order to build muscle, a person must consume more protein than what is broken down. This is often referred to as a net positive nitrogen balance, as protein is high in nitrogen. If a person is not consuming adequate amounts of protein, their body tends to break down muscle
Trusted Source
 to provide the body with the amino acids needed to support body functions and preserve more important tissues. Over time, this can lead to decreased muscle mass and strength. Lastly, the body uses amino acids for muscle protein synthesis (MPS), the primary driver of muscle repair, recovery, and growth after strenuous exercises.

Your privacy is important to us According to the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans
Trusted Source
, most healthy adults over 19 years old should get between 10-35% of their daily calories from protein. One gram of protein provides 4 calories. This means that a person who eats 2,000 calories per day would need to consume between 50 and 175 grams of protein per day. The current RDA of 0.8 g per kg of body weight for protein is based on the amount required to maintain nitrogen balance and prevent muscle loss. However, extending these recommendations to active individuals who are looking to build muscle may not be appropriate. When it comes to building muscle mass, the ideal amount of daily protein a person should consume varies depending on several factors, including age, gender, activity level, health, and other variables. However, several studies have given us a good idea of how to calculate the amount of protein adults need for muscle gain based on body weight. While most studies agree that higher protein intakes are associated with improvements in lean body mass and strength when combined with resistance training, the optimal amount of protein required to build muscle remains controversial. Here is what the latest research says. One 2020 meta-analysis published in the journal Nutrition Reviews found that protein intakes ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 g per kg of body weight can support increases in lean body mass. In particular, researchers noted that gradually increasing protein take, even by as little as 0.1 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, can help maintain or increase muscle mass. The rate of increase in lean body mass from higher protein intakes rapidly decreased after 1.3 g per kg of body weight was exceeded. Strength training suppressed this decline. This suggests that increased protein intake paired with strength training is best for gaining lean body mass. Another 2022 meta-analysis published in the journal Sports Medicine concluded that higher protein intakes of around 1.5 g per kg of body weight daily paired with resistance training are required for optimal effects on muscle strength. Researchers noted that the benefits of increased protein intake on strength and muscle mass appear to plateau at 1.5 to 1.6 g per kg of body weight per day. Lastly, one 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia, and Muscle
Trusted Source
 concluded that a protein intake of 1.6 g per kg of body weight per day or higher results in small increases in lean body mass in young, resistance-trained individuals. The results on older individuals were marginal. Notably, 80% of studies examined in this review reported participants consuming a minimum of 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day, which is still higher than the current RDA. This may be a potential contributor to the decreased effects of protein intervention in combination with resistance training in older adults. While it is difficult to give exact figures due to varying study results, the optimum amount of protein for muscle-building appears to be between 1.2 and 1.6 g per kg of body weight. This means a 180-pound (81.8 kg) male, for example, would need to consume between 98 and 131 g of protein daily, combined with resistance training, to support muscle growth. A person can meet their daily protein needs by eating animal and plant-based protein sources. Animal-based protein sources include: Plant-based protein sources include: Some nutritionists consider animal protein sources
Trusted Source
 to be better than plant-based protein sources when it comes to building muscle mass. This is because they contain all the essential amino acids the body needs in sufficient amounts. They are also easy to digest. Some plant-based proteins are less bioavailable and harder to digest. They also have varying amino acid profiles. However, individuals who opt for plant-based diets can easily supplement by eating more overall protein, and opting for a variety of foods. To obtain all the necessary amino acids in a plant-based diet, individuals can pair ingredients such as rice and beans, hummus and pita bread, or peanut butter on whole wheat bread. One notable exception is soy, which is highly bioavailable, has a good profile of amino acids, and is easy to digest. Doctors generally agree that healthy adults can safely tolerate a long-term protein intake of up to 2 g per kg of body weight per day without any side effects. However, some groups of people, such as healthy, well-trained athletes, may tolerate up to 3.5 g per kg of body weight. Most research suggests that eating more than 2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day can cause health issues over time. Symptoms of excessive protein intake include: More severe risks associated with chronic protein overconsumption include: When combined with resistance training, protein intakes above the current RDA can support muscle building. The best way to meet your daily protein needs is by consuming lean meat, fish, beans, nuts, and legumes. Since the optimal amount of protein a person needs depends on age, health status, and activity level, consider speaking with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to discuss how much protein is suitable for you.

While vegan diets exclude all animal products, vegetarian options — which exclude just meat and fish — are more diverse and may include dairy and eggs. Pescatarian diets exclude meat, but not fish. Plant-based diets continue to grow in popularity worldwide owing to decades of scientific research and the mounting evidence

Trusted Source
 that followed 105,159 adults over a 5-year period, the researchers observed that even a 10% increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with a higher risk of heart disease and stroke.

 and a greater potential for developing obesity
Trusted Source
. To compound the negative health risks associated with diets rich in ultra-processed foods, vegetarian and vegan diets can exclude food groups, making nutrient deficiencies more common. Overall, some studies have shown that vegetarians and vegans have lower levels

 of nutrients like iron, vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids. Furthermore, a 2022 study

 to the omission of iron- and B12-rich meats, and calcium-rich animal sources in vegetarian and vegan diets. These problems may be compounded by individuals not replacing those nutrient sources with fruits, vegetables, nuts, and pulses, and eating ultra-processed foods instead. Well-planned vegetarian or vegan diets consistently offer several health benefits, and they can safeguard against nutrient deficiencies and adverse health risks associated with diets rich in ultra-processed plant-based foods.

Therefore, not all plant-based diets are associated with negative health risks, but it is important to note that following a healthy overall eating pattern is essential for managing risks the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Here are some practical tips to help you maintain a diverse and balanced plant-based diet. First, limit ultra-processed foods. Plant-based ultra-processed foods high in salt, added sugars, and fats should be limited and eaten in moderation. In particular, veggie meat replacement products are often high in sodium and saturated fats, so be sure to choose low-sodium and low-fat alternatives. Make sure to read nutrient labels
Trusted Source
 and be careful with so-called health claims on packaging. Practice reading nutrient labels for packaged food products to become aware of their sugar, salt, and fat content and choose those with fewer additives. Likewise, labels may help choose foods that are higher in calcium and other beneficial nutrients. Monitoring carbohydrate portions is also important: Switching to a plant-based diet may feel restrictive, and research shows that meats may be replaced with refined or highly processed carbohydrate-rich foods. Be sure to include whole grain carbohydrate options in portions appropriate for your health goals. Also focus on proteins: Peas and beans, nuts, seeds, seitan, textured vegetable protein, tofu, tempeh, edamame, eggs, milk, cheese, yogurt and seafood are all high-protein food sources for vegetarians that also provide calcium, iron, vitamin D and some vitamin B12, which are commonly deficient in vegetarians. When appropriate, dietary supplements may help a person reach the desirable amount of daily nutrients to avoid deficiencies. Speak with your medical team about which supplements may be appropriate for you. Finally, you may wish to consult a dietitian: If you are new to plant-based eating, consult with a registered dietitian to learn which foods will help you to meet your nutrient needs Plant-based diets are popular worldwide for their potential health benefits, such as improved blood cholesterol, blood sugar, and reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity. However, “junk” veggie foods or ultra-processed foods — which account for more than half of the daily calorie intake for some individuals — continue to replace minimally processed whole foods, and pose adverse health risks. Furthermore, vegetarians and vegans can experience nutrient deficiencies in iron, calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12, due to the exclusion of animal foods that are rich in these nutrients. Nevertheless, well-planned vegetarian or vegan diets rich in fruits, non-starchy vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and plant sources of protein offer several health benefits, and safeguard against adverse health risks associated with diets rich in “junk” veggie foods.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/is-it-better-to-eat-several-small-meals-or-fewer-larger-ones,Is it better to eat several small meals or fewer larger ones?,"Many of us may have heard that eating several small meals daily can help improve metabolism and achieve optimal health. However, evidence to support this claim is mixed. In this Honest Nutrition feature, we take an in-depth look at the current research behind meal frequency and discuss the benefits of small frequent meals compared with fewer, larger ones. It is widely accepted in modern culture that people should divide their daily diet into three large meals — breakfast, lunch, and dinner — for optimal health. This belief primarily stems from culture and early epidemiological studies
Trusted Source
. In recent years, however, experts have begun to change their perspective, suggesting that eating smaller, more frequent meals may be best for preventing chronic disease and weight loss. As a result, more people are changing their eating patterns in favor of eating several small meals throughout the day. Those who advocate for eating small, frequent meals suggest that this eating pattern can: While a few studies support these recommendations, others show no significant benefit. In fact, some research suggests it may be more beneficial to stick with three larger meals. Here is what the research says. Early epidemiological studies
Trusted Source
 suggest that increased meal frequency can improve blood lipid (fats) levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. As a result, many experts advise against eating fewer, larger meals a day. Over the years, some studies have supported these findings, suggesting that people who report eating small, frequent meals have better cholesterol levels than those who consume fewer than three meals per day. In particular, one 2019 cross-sectional study
Trusted Source
 that compared eating fewer than three meals per day or more than four meals per day found that consuming more than four meals increases HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and lowers fasting triglycerides more effectively. Higher levels of HDL are associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. This study observed no differences in total cholesterol or LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. It is important to note, however, that this is an observational study, meaning it can only prove association, not causation. Additionally, one review published in the American Heart Association’s journal Circulation

 concluded that greater eating frequency is associated with a reduced risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, according to epidemiological studies.

Your privacy is important to us There is a commonly held notion that more frequent meals can help influence weight loss. However, the research on this remains mixed. For example, one study
Trusted Source
 compared eating three meals per day or six smaller, more frequent meals on body fat and perceived hunger. Both groups received adequate calories to maintain their current body weight using the same macronutrient distribution: 30% of energy from fat, 55% carbohydrate, and 15% protein. At the end of the study, researchers observed no difference in energy expenditure and body fat loss between the two groups. Interestingly, those who consumed six smaller meals throughout the day had increased hunger levels and desire to eat compared to those who ate three larger meals per day. Although calorie intake was controlled in both groups, researchers hypothesized that those who consumed frequent meals would be more likely to consume more daily calories than those who ate less frequently. Results of another large observational study

 suggest that healthy adults may prevent long-term weight gain by: Moreover, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee
Trusted Source
, due to inconsistencies and limitations in the current body of evidence, there is insufficient evidence to determine the relationship between meal frequency and body composition and the risk of overweight and obesity. Small, frequent meals are often touted as a cure-all for obesity. Many believe that eating every 2 to 3 hours can help boost metabolism. Digestion of food does require energy. This is known as the thermic effect of food (TEF)

. However, it does not appear that meal frequency plays a role in boosting metabolism
Trusted Source
. In fact, some studies suggest fewer, larger meals may increase TEF more than eating frequent meals. Although evidence to support increased meal frequency in the general population remains mixed, several experts believe that eating small, frequent meals can benefit athletes. According to the International Society of Sports Nutrition
Trusted Source

. When prioritizing total daily calorie intake, limited evidence suggests that, in athletes, a higher meal frequency may increase performance

, support fat loss, and improve body composition. People who eat more frequently are more likely to have better diet quality. Specifically, those who consume at least three meals per day
Trusted Source
 are more likely to have a greater intake of vegetables, greens, legumes, fruit, whole grains, and dairy. These individuals are also more likely to consume less sodium and added sugars than those who consume two meals per day. Similarly, another 2020 study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that increased meal frequency — approximately three meals per day — is associated with higher diet quality. Researchers found that snack frequency and diet quality varied depending on the definition of snacks. Based on the presented studies, no substantial evidence supports one eating pattern over the other. Yet many of these studies also have limitations. For example, there is no universally accepted definition of what a meal or snack consists of. This can have an impact on study outcomes. With that said, both eating patterns can be beneficial as long the primary focus is on healthful eating habits. A review published in Nutrition in Clinical Practice
Trusted Source
shows that certain populations may benefit from six to 10 small, frequent meals. These include people who: If your goal is to lose weight, it is important to be mindful of your portion sizes. Be sure to stay within your allotted daily calorie needs and divide them among the number of meals you consume. For example, if you need 1,800 calories to maintain your weight and choose to eat six small meals daily, each meal should be around 300 calories. Small, frequent meals often come in the form of ultra-processed foods and snacks that fall short in many vital nutrients your body needs. Thus, it is essential to focus on the quality of the foods you consume. People who may benefit from three larger meals per day include: Again, keeping diet quality in mind and prioritizing whole foods is essential. Fewer meals mean fewer opportunities to get in key nutrients the body needs. While we do not have strong evidence to support the importance of meal frequency, substantial evidence supports the overall health benefits of following a well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025

, a healthy diet should: Evidence is mixed about the importance of food frequency. While there is no solid evidence to suggest that one eating style is superior to the other, both can offer health and wellness benefits if you follow a healthy eating pattern. Thus, it ultimately comes down to personal preference and which approach works best for you. Additionally, if you have certain health conditions, one style may benefit you over the other.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/intermittent-fasting-is-it-all-its-cracked-up-to-be,Intermittent fasting: Is it all it's cracked up to be?,"Intermittent fasting is an increasingly popular weight loss dieting strategy. Beyond weight loss however, the diet has promising benefits that may reduce the risk of developing some chronic, lifestyle diseases. In this Honest Nutrition feature, we explain all that you need to know about intermittent fasting, and whether it is worth the hype. Intermittent fasting is a term used to describe a variety of eating patterns that have alternating periods of fasting — abstinence from foods — and eating. The fasting period may last from 12 hours per day to several consecutive days, with a consistent, recurring pattern over the course of a week. The main types
Trusted Source
 of intermittent fasting are: Of these, time-restricted eating
Trusted Source
 is the most popular, and may be what most people refer to when they mention intermittent fasting. The 16:8 pattern — eating during an 8-hour window and fasting for 16 hours each day — may be the most recommended time-restricted eating pattern. Much of the research on intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating considers the impact of fasting on the body’s natural circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm
Trusted Source
, also called the circadian clock, represents the 24-hour cycle of metabolism in the body, including control of the sleep-wake cycle, blood pressure, mood regulation, and hormonal balance, to name a few. It is influenced by light and darkness over the course of the day, eating behaviors, and the timing of meals. A growing body of research
Trusted Source
 suggests that eating for lengthy periods in the day, ranging from 12–15 hours, may disrupt the circadian rhythm and increase the risk of chronic diseases including heart disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Thus, a major goal of fasting, specifically time-restricted eating, is to reduce the time spent eating in the day by extending the overnight fasting period. The study of the relationship between circadian rhythms and food timing is called chrono-nutrition

Your privacy is important to us Many of the benefits of intermittent fasting are attributed to daily fasting periods of no less than 12 hours, although some research suggests that a minimum of 16 hours of fasting may be required. Generally, during 12–36
Trusted Source
 hours of uninterrupted fasting, the liver glycogen stores become depleted, overall metabolic processes are altered, and positive health effects are observed. Here are some of the science-backed benefits of intermittent fasting. Findings across animal and human research
Trusted Source
 show favorable changes in cholesterol levels. Intermittent fasting has the potential
Trusted Source
 to reduce total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol or “bad” cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol or “good” cholesterol. Elevated total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels are risk factors
Trusted Source
 for heart disease. Intermittent fasting can improve blood sugar control
Trusted Source
 by reducing insulin resistance, and increasing insulin sensitivity. This results in lower
Trusted Source
 fasting blood sugar and glycated hemoglobin — HbA1c — levels. In fact, experimental research in adult males with type 2 diabetes showed the potential for intermittent fasting as a therapeutic approach that may reduce the need for insulin therapy. Changes in body weight and composition
Trusted Source
 are among the most studied effects of intermittent fasting. Several studies have shown that weight loss of between 3–7% body weight in an average of 8 weeks was achievable through intermittent fasting. Research also noted that this method could result in fat loss. Fasting in a 14:10 pattern
Trusted Source
 — an eating window of 10 hours and a daily fast of 14 hours — can act on the risk factors of metabolic syndrome, including by reducing waist circumference, body fat percentage, and visceral fat. Intermittent fasting can thus ease metabolic syndrome, a set of risk factors that increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. A 2015 review
Trusted Source
 of 2,650 adult females indicated that reducing calorie intake in the evenings, and fasting for longer periods at night, may lower inflammation and the risk of breast cancer and other inflammatory conditions. Observational research
Trusted Source
 of 26,092 adult males over a 16-year period suggested that reducing late-night eating through time-restricted eating may significantly reduce the risk of heart disease. Other areas of health that intermittent fasting is being explored in include longevity
Trusted Source
 and neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson’s disease
Trusted Source
. Despite the many touted benefits of intermittent fasting, there are also some downsides. Intermittent fasting may be safe for heart and metabolic health, but according to a 2017 review
Trusted Source
, it may induce negative side effects in some people, such as: Additionally, most of the research on intermittent fasting is based on animal research, with little
Trusted Source
 long-term human research available. Furthermore, a 2021 review
Trusted Source
 found that only six out of 104 alleged health benefits of intermittent fasting were supported by moderate- to high-quality evidence, and most findings were based on low-quality research. This means that more rigorous human research on the long-term health benefits of intermittent fasting is warranted. Intermittent fasting is not the only type of diet to result in the aforementioned benefits. Calorie restriction
Trusted Source
 involving a reduction of about 25% of daily energy needs without a change in mealtimes had a positive effect on promoting overall health. Some research suggests that the health outcomes of intermittent fasting are no greater than those observed in calorie restriction diets. In fact, outcomes for weight and/ or fat loss, body fat percentage, and metabolic risk factors are comparable
Trusted Source
 between the two. However, research on intermittent fasting shows a greater adherence over longer periods compared to calorie restriction, and suggests that it may be a more sustainable approach. The Mediterranean diet
Trusted Source
 is a renowned dietary pattern based on the traditional eating patterns of the Mediterranean basin. Like the potential heart-friendly
Trusted Source
 benefits of intermittent fasting, research shows that long-term adherence to the Mediterranean diet reduces the occurrence of heart attack and stroke by up to 30%
Trusted Source
 after approximately 5 years. Additional research on the Mediterranean diet demonstrates its protective nature against the development of colorectal cancer
Trusted Source
 and the loss of nerve cells in Parkinson’s disease
Trusted Source
. A major benefit of the Mediterranean diet compared to intermittent fasting is that similar results can be achieved without the need for fasting. Intermittent fasting describes a variety of eating patterns that alternate periods of fasting and eating with a consistent, recurring pattern over the course of a week. Time-restricted eating is the most popular form of intermittent fasting and uses the principles of chrono-nutrition to lengthen night-time fasting and potentially reduce chronic disease risk. Intermittent fasting may improve cholesterol levels, blood sugar control, weight and/ or fat loss, lower inflammation, promote longevity, and support neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson’s disease. However, most of the research on intermittent fasting is based on animal studies and human research is sparse and often of low quality. Alternative non-fasting diets that produce similar results to intermittent fasting include calorie restriction and the Mediterranean diet.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/covid-19-pandemic-changes-in-personality-traits,Did the COVID-19 pandemic lead to changes in our personality traits?,"All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on COVID-19. Previous studies have shown that levels of neuroticism declined during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A new study published in PLOS One
Trusted Source
 found that these changes in neuroticism were short-lived and normalized later in the pandemic in 2021-2022. However, other personality traits such as agreeableness, openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness declined during the later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021-2022. The study found that younger individuals were especially susceptible to changes in personality traits during the pandemic, suggesting a disruption of the personality development and maturation process that normally occurs during young adulthood. Medical News Today spoke with Dr. Brent Roberts, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “It is quite significant from a theoretical perspective to know that global events, like the pandemic, might have the effect of changing personality, which is often thought to be fixed and impervious to change,” Dr. Roberts said. “It is also of potential pragmatic value, as from an epidemiological standpoint, the changes over the long run, being somewhat negative and centered on young adults would mean that these cohorts would be more vulnerable to problematic mental and physical health outcomes due solely to psychological and not physiological reasons,” he explained. The five-factor model of personality
Trusted Source
 is a widely used model that describes personality based on the presence of five broad traits. The model includes the following five personality traits: These personality traits remain relatively stable over an adult’s lifetime and are generally unaffected by personal experience. Previous studies have shown that individuals show a small change in personality traits with age. Specifically, conscientiousness and agreeableness tend to increase gradually with age, whereas neuroticism, openness, and extraversion tend to decrease. Although regarded as generally stable, personal stressful or traumatic events can influence these personality traits. In contrast, studies examining the impact of collective stressful events, such as the 2011 earthquake in New Zealand or Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana, have shown a lack of change in personality traits in response to these events. The COVID-19 pandemic differs from other natural disasters in its global impact and influence on all aspects of life. Previous studies have shown a decline in neuroticism
Trusted Source
 during the early or acute stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that many individuals with generally higher anxiety levels — associated with neuroticism — experienced lower anxiety levels during the pandemic’s early phase. However, there is limited and contradictory evidence on the impact of the pandemic on other personality traits. In addition, there is limited data on the pandemic’s impact on personality traits beyond 2020. The present study used data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) to examine the impact of the early and subsequent stages of the COVID-19 pandemic on personality traits in a large and diverse population. The UAS consists of an internet panel of about 9,500 individuals representing the national population. The UAS has administered multiple personality assessments over the internet to enrolled participants since its inception in 2014.

Your privacy is important to us In the current study, the researchers categorized the period encompassing the pandemic into the acute phase spanning the period between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, and the adaptation phase spanning the period between January 1, 2021, and February 16, 2022. The study included 7,109 participants in the UAS who had completed at least one personality assessment before the pandemic and another assessment during either the acute or adaptation phase of the pandemic. In comparison with pre-pandemic levels, the researchers found that neuroticism decreased during the acute phase of the pandemic in 2020. This decline in neuroticism levels was, however, not sustained during the subsequent adaptation phase in 2021-2022, with levels of neuroticism in the adaptation phase being similar to those observed before the pandemic. The other four personality traits showed an opposite trend to that observed with neuroticism. The levels of conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness, and extraversion during the acute phase of the pandemic did not differ from their levels before the pandemic. In contrast, the levels of all four traits decreased during 2021-2022 compared with their pre-pandemic levels. Notably, the changes in the expression of these personality traits were similar to those normally observed during a decade of adulthood. The researchers noted that further research is needed to determine whether the changes in personality traits observed in 2021-2022 were enduring and to evaluate potential longer-term outcomes. The researchers further analyzed the data to examine the changes in personality traits among different age and ethnic/racial groups. The researchers found the highest levels of decline in neuroticism during 2020 in participants ages 65 years and over, followed by middle-aged individuals (30-64 years). However, the decline in neuroticism in younger participants ages under 30 years did not reach significance during the acute phase. Interestingly, younger adults showed higher levels of neuroticism in 2021-2022 than before the pandemic. Although the levels of the four remaining personality traits were lower in 2021-2022 among younger and middle-aged participants, the decline in agreeableness and conscientiousness was more profound among younger participants. In contrast, the levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness among older individuals in 2021-2022 were similar to pre-pandemic levels. These data suggest that younger adults were more sensitive to changes in personality traits than their middle-aged and older counterparts. The personality of older individuals, on the other hand, seemed more resilient to the effects of the pandemic. The study’s lead author, Dr. Angelina Sutin, a professor at the Florida State University, noted: “The traits that showed the most change in younger adulthood – neuroticism and conscientiousness – are also the traits that are associated with many important outcomes, including educational and career success, relationships, and mental and physical health. The changes were relatively small, but the cumulative impact could be significant if the changes persist.” Personality traits tend to consolidate during young adulthood as an individual’s personality develops and matures. This could potentially explain why younger adults were more vulnerable to changes in personality traits in response to the pandemic. An alternative reason for these findings could be that the sources of stress (such as job- or school-related stress) associated with the pandemic might have been different for each age group. Among ethnic/racial groups, the impact of the pandemic on the personality traits of Hispanic/ Latino participants deviated from that observed in non-Hispanic/Latino participants. For instance, Hispanic/Latino participants showed a larger decrease in extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness than their non-Hispanic/Latino counterparts in 2021-2022. The researchers speculate that Hispanic/Latino participants may have experienced greater stress levels due to working outside the home and being at increased risk of COVID-19. The study’s authors cautioned that the study had a few limitations. They pointed out that the number of participants from minoritized ethnic/groups was relatively small, which could have hindered the identification of changes in personality traits in these groups. “The participants were all living in the United States, so it is unknown whether the patterns we found using this sample would generalize to people living in other countries,” Dr. Sutin said, “In addition, we could only demonstrate change, not the reasons for the change. We also could not tell whether the changes are temporary or going to be lasting. More assessments of personality are needed to answer that question.” Dr. Roberts also noted, “It is an observational study with no control group, so we can’t infer from this study that the pandemic caused these changes. Moreover, the authors did not examine potential alternative explanations for these changes during this time window. The pandemic, while unique and pervasive, was not the only change occurring in the US during this time window. There were upheavals on the social, political, and economic fronts that could also have affected personality development during this time, especially in the young adults who appeared to change the most.” “Finally, the authors did not directly test whether the experience of COVID-19 itself could explain the results. Given the possibility that many of the participants suffered not only from COVID-19 but from long Covid, it would be prudent to test whether that experience itself could explain the results,” he added.

Trusted Source
, strong relationships, and passion are key to maintaining a healthy brain during the aging process. In a recent paper, researchers performed a thorough review of the extensive body of literature available on the link between brain physiology development, and physical activity, social relationships, and passion. Based on the evidence, they report that increased passion for an area or skill leads to more physical activity, more social relationships, and better well-being. “[From our research], we have found that passion- or strong interest- may be a [key motivational factor for achievement and well-being] as it sets the direction of the arrow,“ Hermundur Sigmundsson, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the lead author, told Medical News Today. “Therefore, we say: Find your passion and develop it! Grit, or perseverance, is the size and strength of the arrow. Find your interest area and focus on the process. [Be ready to] take challenges! Challenges are key for development!” he added. The paper was recently published in a special issue of Brain Sciences. Observational studies indicate that an active lifestyle is helpful for maintaining cognitive and neurological health across age groups — especially in higher order processes such as switching between tasks, working memory, and cognitive inhibition. The researchers noted in their paper that intervention studies had confirmed these findings. For example, older adults who underwent 1 hour of aerobic training 3 times per week for 6 months had increased gray and white matter volume compared to controls. Other research shows that physical activity increases functionality in brain areas linked to attention and attention control, daily life activities, and cognitive reserve, a reserve of thinking abilities that acts as a buffer against age-related cognitive decline. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us The new paper points to studies that suggest that maintaining social ties enhances cognitive reserve through cognitive strategies, greater neural growth, and synaptic density, which protect against pathological processes. Imaging studies have demonstrated that larger social networks are linked to a larger orbitofrontal cortex — involved in decision-making — and amygdala volume. These studies also demonstrate that less socially active people have a greater number of white matter lesions. In addition, randomized control trials have shown that social relations may enhance cognitive reserve, and interventions have shown that increased social interaction in communities is linked to better cognitive function and larger brain volume. Other studies, however, indicate no link between social relations and cognitive function later in life. The researchers thus suggest that more robust evidence from randomized controlled trials is needed to demonstrate causality. In their paper, the researchers defined passion as “a strong feeling toward a personally important value/preference that motivates intentions and behaviors to express that value/preference.” Other research has found that passion is related to more deliberate practice among football players and better well-being and performance among workers. The researchers also noted that passion might thus be important for maintaining neural plasticity. They wrote: “…hence repetition, use it or lose it, use it and improve it and intensity.” An example of this is someone who is passionate about learning new languages. The researchers wrote that passion could motivate an individual to practice the second language more and thus strengthen their gray matter, neural cells, and connections. They also noted that psychological traits such as grit and a growth mindset have also been linked
Trusted Source
 to the development of gray matter in different parts of the brain. The researchers further cited a number of articles that suggest impaired motor function, antisocial behavior, depression, and anhedonia (the inability to feel pleasure) are common in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders and in the natural aging process. They thus suggested that a “vicious cycle” may be at play: less physical activity may promote less social engagement and lower well-being. “Passion gives direction to the area of interest, which could be related to the dopamine system, which is central in attention, learning, goal-directed behaviors, and rewards. Passion may be providing the focus essential for long-term goal achievement,” wrote the researchers. When asked how physical activity, socializing, and passion improve brain health, Art Kramer, Ph.D., professor emeritus in the department of psychology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, not involved in the research, told MNT: “We know more about the mechanisms that underlie physical activity than social interactions or learning novel skills since there is a multi-decade literature on physical activity effects on brain health and learning and memory because there are excellent animal models for physical activity (often wheel running with rodents).” “The animal literature suggests a number of brain changes associated with physical activity, including new neurons in brain regions that support memory, more connections among neurons (called synapses), and increases in vascular structure. Increases in neurotransmitters and nerve growth factors (among other changes) have also been associated with increases in physical activity in animal models.” – Art Kramer, Ph.D., professor emeritus at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign The researchers concluded that physical exercise, social interactions, and passion are key to maintaining brain health. When asked about the paper’s limitations, Dr. Sigmundsson noted that their article is just a review and that intervention studies focusing on increasing passion, physical activity, and social engagement need to be carried out to confirm their hypotheses. Dr. Kramer added: “There are a number of limitations, including how best to personalize these factors to enhance cognitive and brain function in individuals as well as how best to combine intellectual engagement, physical activity and social interactions to maximize their benefits across the lifespan and with non-patients and patients alike.” Share this article A study found that younger people were more susceptible to changes in personality traits during the COVID-19 pandemic.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/healthy/covid-19-did-lockdown-help-or-hinder-our-creativity,COVID-19: Did lockdown help or hinder our creativity?,"COVID-19 lockdowns may have confined many people to their homes but new research suggests that these limits did not hinder people from expressing their creativity. Could this creativity have been fueled by unfamiliar emotions or, perhaps, more free time? All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on COVID-19. The American Psychological Association defines “creativity” as “the ability to produce or develop original work, theories, techniques, or thoughts.” While this obviously applies to artistry, it can apply equally to everyday activities in which one takes existing elements and creates something new—such as using the ingredients of sourdough bread to make the pandemic food staple. A new study from the Paris Brain Institute at Sorbonne University decided to investigate the effect the first COVID-19 lockdown had on creativity. To explore its impact, they conducted a French-language online survey to learn more about people’s experiences with creativity during this first lockdown in France. The study’s authors hoped to reconcile the seeming paradox of heightened creativity during a time of unusual stress. The study’s 343 participants said they were, on average, more creative during the lockdown than during the period before. The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology. In addition to listing self-perceived creativity changes, or subjective creativity change (SCC), as described above, the researchers presented participants with an inventory of 28 creative activities based on existing items often used by research psychologists, including the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA). These included painting, cooking, sewing, gardening, writing, and decorating, among others. Respondents were asked if they engaged in these activities more or less during the lockdown, how often, and why they did or didn’t. The top five creative activities in which the study’s respondents said they engaged in were cooking, sports and dance programs, self-help programs, and gardening. The researchers also inquired about pandemic obstacles that had to be overcome. There was no clear indication that a higher number of obstacles hindered creativity. The extent of obstacles encountered was high for individuals who were more creative as well as for those who were less so. “The minute you set constraints, now the creative mind gets to work on how do I achieve the goal, conditional on these constraints?” said Dr. Ajay Agrawal, University of Toronto, on the Disruptors podcast. The two greatest factors in whether a person’s level of creativity during the lockdown rose or fell were emotional or affective changes and—to a slightly lesser degree—whether the pandemic gave them more free time. The degree to which an individual exhibits openness—one of the Big Five personality traits—followed behind as a significant factor. The authors chose openness 
Trusted Source
because this is the personality trait most associated with creativity. According to the study, previous research suggests that a positive mood
Trusted Source
 is correlated to creative activity, although there is still some debate. The authors of the study confirmed that participants’ affective states aligned with SCC. The descriptors they asked participants about “included anxiety and stress, motivation, psychological pressure, mood, and to a lower extent, loneliness and physical constraints.” Researchers found a link between positive mood and creativity, and one between negative affective states and less creativity. Co-first author of the study Dr. Alizée Lopez-Persem, suggests: “There is some evidence in the scientific literature that you need to feel good to be creative, while other evidence points the other way. Also, it is not known in which direction this process takes place: do we feel good because we are creative, or does being creative make us happier?” “Here, one of our analyses suggests that creative expression enabled individuals to better manage their negative emotions linked to confinement and therefore to feel better during this difficult period.”

Parents, for example, may have had less free time with children confined at home all day. Participants were asked about how many hours they worked, how much free time, and how much personal space they had. The authors came to this conclusion: “An increase in free time was linked to higher creativity change.” Openness is defined by Psychology Today: “Openness to experience, or simply openness, is a basic personality trait denoting receptivity to new ideas and new experiences.” The study’s survey included 11 questions regarding openness, and found that this trait, too, exhibited a correlation to the SCC results. However, as Dr. Emmanuelle Volle, co-author of the study told Medical News Today: “Openness indeed correlated with our subjective creativity change score, indicating that openness played a role in the way people thought their creativity changed during the lockdown. It also correlated with the rated creativity of the activities participants performed during this period.” “However, it did not really draw a line [between being creative or not] because even after correcting for Openness, our creativity change score was still positive, and similarly correlated with free time and affective factors. In other words, free time and affective factors were found related to subjective creativity changes ‘beyond’ Openness,” he said.

All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on COVID-19. In May 2020, the United Nations reported that stress and anxiety levels had risen substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, several waves of COVID-19 have left their mark around the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines
Trusted Source
 mental health as “a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.” Mental health issues occur when people cannot cope well with the stresses of life. A pandemic is a stressor that few might have envisaged having to cope with. For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub. The fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, together with concern about economic effects, has caused anxiety and stress.

 and chronic stress from the increased pressure. Multiple lockdowns, physical distancing, and fear of infection have increased isolation, loneliness, and anxiety, all factors that, according to Lee Chambers, psychologist and founder of Essentialise Workplace Wellbeing, are “massive catalysts” for mental health issues. Other experts agree. According to Dr. Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists: “Social isolation, loneliness, stress and anxiety, domestic abuse, bereavement, financial difficulties, unemployment and severe COVID-19 infection are all factors that might have caused people’s mental health to deteriorate.” In 2019, a study in The Lancet

 reported that some 12.5% of the global population would have an issue with their mental health at some time in their life. In March 2022, the WHO reported that worldwide, anxiety and depression increased by 25%
Trusted Source
 in the first year of the pandemic. Lee Chambers has seen evidence of this: “If I’m honest, from my perspective, the incidence of everything [mental health-related] has increased. […] It has been amplified for people who are already suffering with certain conditions. They’ve found less access to services and challenges in managing their everyday existence.“ He added: “One thing that continually got flagged was new incidences. People who had never previously identified as having any mental health condition had actually disclosed […] or, in surveys, said they were struggling significantly. That is interesting, as it shows the impact is reaching beyond those who were already impacted pre-[COVID-19].” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox.

A report from the European Parliament Research Service highlighted increases in mental health concerns in many European countries at this time. Eight out of 10 people in Italy reported a need for psychological care; in the Netherlands, over a third of the population reported anxiety. Similar patterns became evident in the United States. In a study of people aged 18-35, 80% of survey respondents reported significant depressive symptoms, while 61% reported moderate or severe anxiety. In April 2021, the National Institute of Mental Health reported
Trusted Source
 that rates for anxiety, depression, stress-related symptoms, substance misuse
Trusted Source
, and suicidal thoughts were almost double those expected before the pandemic. However, concerns that suicide rates might rise appear to have been unfounded as, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Trusted Source
, these have fallen slightly. In the United Kingdom, mental health referrals to the National Health Service (NHS) have reached record levels, as Dr. James told MNT: “The pandemic has had a major impact on already stretched specialist mental health services, which received a record 4.3 million referrals during 2021. It’s also resulted in the largest mental health backlog in NHS history with at least 1.4 million people waiting for treatment.” An analysis
Trusted Source
 of more than 200,000 people in northern Europe found that younger respondents and those with previously diagnosed mental illness reported poorer mental health during the first months of the pandemic. However, mental health issues are not confined to these groups. Sharon Greene, L.C.S.W., who specializes in treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents of Providence Saint John’s Child & Family Development Center in Santa Monica, CA, told MNT of the pandemic’s widespread impact: “I actually feel everyone has been impacted across the board in different ways. Of course, frontline workers and health professionals were at the forefront and may have experienced more trauma. We are only starting to understand the mental health impacts of the pandemic.” Young people may be less at risk to contract a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they have not escaped the pandemic’s effects. Disruption to education, work, and social interactions have all taken their toll. In August 2020, the International Labour Organization described the “impact of the pandemic on young people to be systematic, deep and disproportionate.“ Several studies have found that students have experienced higher levels
Trusted Source
 of symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder
Trusted Source
 (PTSD) during the pandemic. “Younger people […] are more likely to fall into negative coping mechanisms because they don’t have the experience and they live in a very digital world — that’s a challenge for them. Dealing with uncertainty when you are at that adolescent-adult transition is hard enough when everything is bright and rosy.” – Lee Chambers It is unsurprising, therefore, that a recent OECD report states that the “[p]revalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression has risen dramatically among young people and remains higher than pre‑crisis levels.” For medical professionals, the pressures have been intense. Not only have they faced continued exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but they have also had to cope with the demands of their changing roles during the pandemic, which has inevitably taken a toll on their mental health. A meta-analysis of studies into mental health effects of the pandemic on healthcare workers found that anxiety, depression, and stress were most prevalent among this cohort. Many healthcare workers also reported burnout, insomnia, fear of infection, and suicidal thoughts. It is not just those dealing with COVID-19 patients in a hospital setting who have been affected. A global review of studies published in the British Journal of General Practice found high levels of work-related stress, anxiety, and burnout among primary care doctors in many countries. Lee Chambers reported another issue among medical professionals: “There is a real feeling of… I suppose the term for it is ‘moral injury,’ a real feeling that you are putting yourself at risk of disease. You are on the front lines really making the best of a crisis and then you’ve got certain people in positions of influence just doing as they please, having parties. […] That’s one of the things that’s really distressing a lot of medical professionals.” The worrying impact of this is that many doctors may leave the profession. The British Medical Association found in a recent survey that 21% of respondents were considering leaving the NHS, and 25% were considering taking a career break because of the stress of working through the pandemic. In the survey, one GP expressed what may well be the views of many, noting that, “[i]f things don’t change in the next few weeks, I do worry that many colleagues will leave the profession, not because they have failed, but [because] the Government and the system failed them.” Nevertheless, there are ways to help protect mental health through these challenging times. According to Lee Chambers, communication is key: “I look at resilience as expressive rather than suppressive, an ability to express yourself rather than trying to be robust and resist. Endurance generally leads to burnout […] Being able to talk and articulate and find someone you trust to express where you are currently at.” He added: “Resilience is like a battery. The main ways to recharge it are the fundamentals — sleeping, nutrition, movement. For me, it’s trying to build those into your life.” People should not be afraid to seek help and to recognize the warning signs that they may need help. “Is it pervasive? Is it prolonged? And, is it something that is increasingly spiraling out of our control. At that point, we need to look to see how we can access professional services.” – Lee Chambers Dr. James echoed this advice, noting that “[p]eople who are struggling with their mental health can talk to their [primary care doctor] or self-refer directly to a local psychological therapy service.” “No one should have to experience this alone — there [is] a range of options for support to get through this.” – Dr. Adrian James The pandemic has exposed gaps in support, particularly in some sectors of society. Lee Chambers made this clear: “So often a little bit of external support from our network can be beneficial. Not everyone has that; it’s a privilege.” He added: “Inequalities have been opened up even further. We should look at navigating the challenges we face and attempting to make an equitable recovery, […] accepting that some groups have had it more challenging than others.” Commenting on possible solutions, he said: “I would like to see more joined-up services, from education to medical to businesses to communities. If we could join the dots, it would make a massive difference.“ Dr. James stressed that these services must be financed properly: “It is […] vital that mental health services are backed by a fully-funded plan to ensure people can access the care they need.” In a press briefing
Trusted Source
 from March 2, 2022, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general further emphasized the importance of the pandemic-related mental health crisis, noting that it should be “a wake-up call to all countries to pay more attention to mental health and do a better job of supporting their populations’ mental health.” Read this article in Spanish.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323446,How much should I weigh for my height and age?,"Many people wish to know the answer to this question: how much should I weigh? There is no single ideal weight for all individuals. While various tools and calculators offer a guide, they may not be accurate in all cases. Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article will use the terms “male,” “female,” or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. Learn more. Tools to calculate a moderate weight range rely on factors such as age, height, and sex assigned at birth. However, everybody is different, and no single formula can determine a person’s ideal weight. No one measure of body size can tell a person their exact health status or potential health risks. Eating a nutritious, balanced diet, exercising, and other lifestyle habits can support improved health regardless of a person’s weight. There is some disagreement among medical experts about the usefulness of tools such as body mass index (BMI). These tools are not exact, and not everyone with excess weight will develop health issues. However, some researchers believe people with obesity who have no other health conditions are still at increased risk for developing obesity-linked conditions, such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, in the long term. People who want to learn more about their current health status, future risks, and ways to improve health can benefit from speaking with their doctor. Read on to discover several tools that help estimate a person’s moderate weight range. BMI is a common tool that measures a person’s weight in relation to their height. A BMI calculation provides a single number, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Trusted Source
 categorizes as follows: However, the CDC also notes that BMI does not assess an individual’s body composition or health. It is a screening tool that people should use alongside other tests and assessments to determine potential health risks. A person can use BMI calculators or review the charts below to calculate BMI. The following weight and height chart uses BMI tables from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
Trusted Source
 to provide a general guideline for categories of moderate (“normal”) weight, overweight, obesity, and severe obesity. BMI is just one tool to understand body size, and it does not account for all of the ways that people’s bodies may differ. A person can talk with their doctor if they have questions about calculating or interpreting their BMI score. Age is not a factor in BMI for adults, but it is for children. This is because children typically grow larger with age. The CDC
Trusted Source
 uses both age and sex assigned at birth in its BMI calculations for people between the ages of 2–19 years. To calculate a child’s BMI, a person can use the CDC’s calculator
Trusted Source
 for children and teenagers. The CDC’s BMI charts for children use percentiles that compare measurements with boys
Trusted Source
 and girls
Trusted Source
 of the same age and gender. If a person has questions about their child’s BMI, they should consult a doctor. BMI is a very basic measurement. While it takes height and weight into consideration, it does not account for factors such as: These factors can affect health. For example, high-performance athletes tend to have a lot of muscle and little body fat. They can have a high BMI because they have more muscle mass, but this does not mean they weigh too much for their height. Another limitation of BMI is that it does not distinguish between people of different racial or ethnic groups. Indeed, a 2021 study
Trusted Source
 found significant racial disparities in BMI and body fat distribution. For example, non-Hispanic Black women were found to have higher BMI but lower levels of liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT). This suggests that non-Hispanic Black women may have a different, potentially healthier fat distribution compared to other groups. This inaccuracy may lead to a misdiagnosis or an incorrect assessment of risk factors between individuals. BMI can offer a rough idea of whether or not a person is at a moderate weight, and it is useful for measuring trends in population studies. However, it should not be the only measure an individual uses to assess whether their weight is ideal. Learn more about the limitations of BMI. A person’s WHR compares their waist size with that of their hips. A high WHR is associated with
Trusted Source
 higher levels of visceral fat, the fat in the abdominal cavity that surrounds several major organs. For this reason, the WHR can be a useful tool for understanding potential health risks when considered alongside other assessments of health status. A 2018 meta-analysis
Trusted Source
 suggests that having a high WHR can put people at a higher risk of myocardial infarction, or heart attack. To calculate their WHR, a person should measure around their waist at the narrowest part, usually just above the belly button. They can then divide this measurement by the width of their hip at its widest part. For example, if a person’s waist is 28 inches (in) and their hips are 36 in, they will divide 28 by 36, giving a WHR of 0.77. Using WHR, a 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) report defines abdominal obesity as follows: However, as with BMI, the WHR does have limitations. For example, this measure does not account for a person’s total body fat percentage or their muscle-to-fat ratio accurately. Optimal WHR differs based on sex assigned at birth as well as race and ethnicity, according to the 2008 WHO report. Plus, body size is not a direct measure of health. Anyone assessing body size needs to take a person’s overall health status into consideration. To discover more evidence-based information and resources for weight management, visit our dedicated hub. The waist-to-height ratio (WtHR) is another tool to assess body size. It compares a person’s waist circumference to their height. According to 2015 research, higher WtHR has associations with worse cholesterol and blood pressure, even at a healthy BMI. For this reason, WtHR may be helpful when assessing health risks when used along with other measures of health. To calculate WtHR, divide waist size by height. If the result is 0.5 or less, that is considered moderate. Measurements that take waist size into account can help to provide insight into an individual’s health risks. A 2023 study
Trusted Source
 analyzed data from 20 studies and found that higher WHtR levels significantly increased the risk of all-cause mortality by 23% and cardiovascular mortality by 39%. While population-level studies are important, individual health is about more than waist size alone. A person should talk with their doctor if they have concerns about the health risks that may have links to a higher WtHR.

Learn how to measure the waist. Body fat percentage is the weight of a person’s fat divided by their total weight. This includes fat found in many different parts of the body. Body fat is necessary for the human body to function. An individual needs a type called essential fat to survive — it is critical for the development of the brain, bone marrow, nerves, and membranes. Other types of fat protect the internal organs in the chest and abdomen, and the body can use it if necessary for energy. Apart from the approximate guidelines for males and females, the ideal total fat percentage can depend on a person’s body type or activity level. Typically, obesity is associated with a high proportion of body fat. Obesity and overweight can carry a greater risk
Trusted Source
 for conditions such as: Calculating body fat percentage can provide useful information because it reflects body composition, unlike BMI, WHR, and WtHR. Learn more about body fat levels by age and sex. One way to measure body fat percentage is to use a skinfold measurement, which uses special calipers to pinch the skin. A health professional will measure tissue on the thigh, abdomen, and chest for males or the upper arm for females. Other measures include While none of these can give a completely accurate reading, the estimates can be close enough to offer a reasonable assessment. Learn more about the different ways to measure body fat. Below are some commonly asked questions about weight, height, and age. Body mass index (BMI) measurements do not
Trusted Source
 take into account a person’s age. Therefore, based on BMI, it is not possible to suggest an ideal weight for a person’s age. Rather, a person’s ideal BMI is based on their weight and height. One method
Trusted Source
 a person can use to determine their ideal weight is body mass index (BMI) measurements. This involves dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of their height (in meters) to arrive at a BMI score. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
Trusted Source
, a good weight for a person who is 5 foot (ft) 4 inches (in) tall ranges from 110–140 pounds (lbs). An ideal body weight can mean different things to different people. BMI, WHR, WtHR, and body-fat percentage are four ways of assessing weight status. Combining results from them may be the best way to get an accurate idea of whether a person’s body size is considered moderate. However, body size alone does not offer a complete picture of a person’s health. Anyone with concerns about their weight, waist size, or body composition should speak with a doctor about their individual health and how to manage any potential risk factors.

Trusted Source
. There are several reasons behind this. Research suggests
Trusted Source
 that insufficient or poor-quality sleep slows down the process in which the body converts calories to energy, called metabolism. When metabolism is less effective, the body may store unused energy as fat. In addition, poor sleep can promote insulin resistance and increase levels of cortisol, which also promote fat storage. How long someone sleeps also affects the regulation of the appetite-controlling hormones leptin and ghrelin. Leptin sends signals of fullness to the brain. Stress triggers the release of hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which initially decrease the appetite as part of the body’s fight or flight response. However, when people are under constant stress, cortisol can remain in the bloodstream for longer, which will increase their appetite
Trusted Source
 and potentially lead to them eating more. Cortisol signals the need to replenish the body’s nutritional stores from the preferred source of fuel, carbohydrate. Insulin then transports the sugar from carbohydrates from the blood to the muscles and brain. If the individual does not use this sugar in fight or flight, the body will store it as fat. Insulin allows sugar from the blood to enter the body’s cells, where it can provide energy. If an individual does not immediately use this sugar, the body will either

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322047,12 home remedies for stomach pain,"Several home remedies can help resolve stomach and abdominal pain, such as drinking water and avoiding spicy foods. If these do not help, over-the-counter and prescription medications are available. Stomach pain, also known as abdominal pain, belly ache, or stomach ache, describes discomfort that a person feels anywhere between their chest and groin. This pain can vary in intensity and affect different areas of the abdomen, such as the stomach, appendix, liver, bowel, and more. Stomach pain can also occur alongside other symptoms such as heartburn, bloating, and nausea. The correct remedy for a person’s stomach pain will depend on its cause. This article looks at 12 of the most popular home remedies for an upset stomach and indigestion. There are several popular home remedies for indigestion. Some may also help ease stomach upset from other sources, such as irritable bowel syndrome. The body needs water to efficiently digest and absorb nutrients from foods and beverages. Being dehydrated makes digestion more difficult and less effective, increasing the likelihood of an upset stomach. Additionally, drinking water may help reduce heartburn. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics says that although the general rule of thumb is drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, a person’s fluid needs can vary. Activity levels, elevation, extreme temperatures, general health, and size can all make a difference in fluid needs. Avoiding lying down may prevent indigestion from becoming heartburn. When the body is horizontal, the acid in the stomach is more likely to travel backward and move upward, which can cause heartburn. Therefore, people with an upset stomach should avoid lying down or going to bed for at least a few hours until it passes. Ginger may help reduce
Trusted Source
 nausea and vomiting in people who are pregnant or those who undergo chemotherapy. Individuals with an upset stomach could try adding ginger to their food or drinking it as tea. Some all-natural ginger ales may also contain enough ginger to settle an upset stomach. Ginger tea is widely available to buy in supermarkets and online. Doctors may recommend the bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (BRAT) diet to people with diarrhea. BRAT
Trusted Source
 foods may decrease the number of stools a person passes and help ease their diarrhea. As these foods are bland, they do not contain substances that irritate the stomach, throat, or intestines. Therefore, this diet can soothe the tissue irritation resulting from the acids in vomit. Many of the foods in the BRAT diet are also high in nutrients, such as potassium and magnesium, and can replace those someone loses through diarrhea and vomiting. Smoking and alcohol may trigger
Trusted Source
 indigestion and other gastrointestinal conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake also improves people’s quality of life and reduces the risk of certain health conditions, such as cancer. However, avoiding smoking and drinking alcohol can be difficult, and individuals may require extra support. Learn more about quitting smoking and drinking: Research

 suggests that the following foods may increase the risk of indigestion: Avoiding difficult-to-digest foods may help ease the stomach and reduce discomfort and pain. However, avoiding heavily preserved foods may be more difficult for people who do not have the time to source fresher food or those who live in a food desert. Food deserts are regions where individuals have limited access to nutritious and affordable food Some healthcare professionals suggest that baking soda can help relieve heartburn and indigestion by reducing stomach acidity. While this home remedy may help with an upset stomach, it may not taste pleasant. Additionally, consuming too much baking soda may lead to

 reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and colitis, although the evidence for these benefits is lacking and needs further research. Healthcare professionals state that drinking aloe vera juice can yield multiple benefits, including providing relief from the following symptoms of GERD: However, ingesting aloe vera may cause abdominal pain and cramps. Aloe vera juice is widely available commercially. Basil contains substances that may reduce gas. Its leaves also contain levels of high linoleic acid, which has anti-inflammatory properties. Basil is usually available to purchase in grocery stores, gardening stores, and online. However, those in food deserts may have to rely on online stores if they find it difficult to source fresh basil. Products that contain licorice root may help
Trusted Source
 relieve digestive symptoms. However, experts are uncertain about the role of licorice in these products. Someone with an upset stomach could try drinking licorice root tea several times daily until their symptoms improve. Licorice root teas are widely available online, but it is possible to make them at home by mixing 1 or 2 teaspoons of licorice root powder with boiling water. However, licorice can cause side effects, such as an increase in blood pressure and a decrease in potassium levels. This may be especially dangerous for those with high blood pressure or kidney or heart disease. Plain rice may be beneficial for those with stomach pain due to irritable bowel syndrome or other conditions that can cause frequent diarrhea, along with other low FODMAP food. Rice is also part of the BRAT diet that doctors may recommend. However, there is some evidence
Trusted Source
 that white rice consumption may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome. However, the risk may increase with regular or frequent consumption and may not affect those who consume white rice to help with stomach pain.

Exercise, supplements, massage, dietary changes, and other strategies can all help reduce bloating quickly. Abdominal bloating is when the abdomen feels full and tight. In this article, we provide techniques for getting rid of bloating quickly and explain how to reduce bloating in the long term. Bloating commonly occurs due to a buildup of gas somewhere in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Bloating causes the belly to look larger than usual, and it may also feel tender or painful. Fluid retention in the body can also lead to bloating. The best way to tackle bloating is to determine its cause. Other common triggers for bloating include: Learn more about the causes of bloating. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us Bloating usually happens when excess gas builds up in the stomach or intestines. When bloating occurs right after a meal, it usually resolves itself, but it is often possible to speed up this process. Many home remedies can help to manage the pain and discomfort of bloating. The following quick tips may help people get rid of a bloated belly quickly: Physical activity can get the bowels moving more regularly, which can help to release excess gas and stool. Getting the bowels to move is especially important if a person is feeling constipated. A walk around the block can provide fast relief from gas pressure. Certain yoga poses can position the muscles in the abdomen in a way that encourages the release of excess gas from the GI tract. This can reduce bloating. Child’s Pose, Happy Baby Pose, and squats can all help people to relieve a buildup of gas quickly. Learn more about yoga poses for flatulence. Peppermint oil capsules may also be helpful for indigestion and related gas. Manufacturers usually market them as a treatment for the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but people without IBS can also use them to relieve bloating. Peppermint works by relaxing the intestinal muscles, which allows gas and stool to move along more effectively. People should always follow the instructions on the packet. Anyone who is prone to heartburn may need to avoid peppermint. Simethicone pills and liquid are anti-gas medications that can help to move excess air out of the digestive tract. It is essential to always take medication according to the instructions on the label. Massaging the abdomen can help to get the bowels moving. A massage that follows the path of the large intestine is especially helpful. People can follow the steps below to do this: If the massage causes any pain, it is best to discontinue it immediately. A study from 2016
Trusted Source
 tested the effectiveness of supplements containing a combination of fennel and curcumin essential oil in 116 people with mild-to-moderate IBS. After 30 days, people reported an improvement in their IBS symptoms, including bloating and abdominal pain. People should not consume essential oils without speaking to a doctor first. This is because some formulations may be toxic or can interfere with medication, and there is no regulation of dosages. The heat of the bath can provide relief for a sore abdomen. Relaxation can reduce stress levels, which may allow the GI tract to function more effectively and help reduce bloating. Quick fixes are not always effective for some causes of bloating. However, people who have frequent bloating may find that certain lifestyle changes can tackle the causes and reduce bloating over time. People can use these simple steps to try to prevent bloating in the long term: Eating more fiber helps to prevent constipation and bloating. However, it is important to bear in mind that eating too much fiber or increasing fiber intake too quickly can cause even more gas and bloating. Including a reasonable amount of fiber in a person’s diet, while making sure to drink enough water, will help prevent this. Most nutritionists recommend that adults eat about 18–38 grams (g) of fiber a day
Trusted Source
. That said, only 7% of people meet their recommended daily fiber intake of 25 grams (g) for females and 38 g for males. When increasing fiber intake, it is best to start slowly and increase the intake over several weeks to allow the body to adjust to this change in the diet. Fizzy, carbonated drinks contain gas that can build up in the stomach. The carbon dioxide that makes soda and similar beverages fizzy can also cause bubbling and bloating in the stomach. Sugars or artificial sweeteners in the diet can also cause gas and bloating. The sugar alcohols in gum can cause bloating in some people. Swallowing air while chewing also may lead to bloating and gas pain. People can use ginger mints or peppermints to freshen their breath instead. Exercise helps your body move stool and gas out of the colon and may make bowel movements more regular. Exercise also releases extra sodium from the body through sweating, which can help to relieve water retention. It is vital to drink plenty of water before and after exercising to stay hydrated, as dehydration can make constipation worse. Many people experience bloating directly after a big meal. It is possible to avoid this by eating several smaller meals each day, which can help to keep the digestive system moving. Swallowing food quickly can introduce air into the digestive tract. Drinking from a straw can also lead to people swallowing more air, which in turn leads to gas and bloating. People who have bloating should avoid using straws if possible and try eating slowly to avoid swallowing air during meals. Probiotics are good bacteria that live in the intestines. Taking a probiotic supplement may help regulate the colon bacteria that can produce gas and cause bloating. An excess of sodium causes the body to retain water. This can cause a swollen and bloated feeling in the belly and other areas of the body, such as the hands and feet. In some cases, bloating may result from a medical condition. To get rid of this bloating, a person may need help from a doctor to diagnose and manage their condition. Inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, may cause people to experience bloating. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), can also cause this symptom. Gynecological conditions, such as endometriosis and ovarian cysts, can also cause pain, swelling, and feelings of bloating in the abdominal area. People with these symptoms should discuss them with a doctor, who will also want to know about any relevant family medical history and other medical conditions. The doctor may order diagnostic tests to look for any problems. These may include an X-ray, ultrasound, colonoscopy, or blood tests. Trying an elimination diet such as the low FODMAP diet might help a person
Trusted Source
 exclude specific foods that are causing bloating. However, this should be done in consultation with a doctor or a dietician. FODMAPs are a type of carbohydrate that occurs in many different foods. A 2020 meta-analysis of 12 studies found that eating low-FODMAP foods reduced IBS symptoms by a mean of 45 percentage points. Food intolerances are responsible for many cases of bloating. They can lead to excessive gas in the digestive tract. Bloating is common in people who have lactose intolerance and are unable to digest the lactose sugar in dairy products. Autoimmune intolerance to gluten, known as celiac disease, is another potential culprit. For people whose bloating happens after meals, keeping track of food and drink intake for several weeks should help to determine whether specific foods are responsible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide a food diary template
Trusted Source
 to help people to get started. Some supplements, such as iron, can cause constipation and other symptoms of indigestion. This can increase bloating. Potassium, on the other hand, may reduce bloating by helping to balance the body’s sodium levels
Trusted Source
. Medications may also cause side effects that affect GI function or cause indigestion. If this happens, a doctor or pharmacist can suggest alternatives that are more gentle on the digestive tract. Although it is not common, bloating and swelling of the abdomen can signify a severe medical condition. Liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, heart failure, kidney problems, and some types of cancer can cause bloating. Bloating that continues for days or weeks may indicate a health issue that needs medical attention. It is advisable to speak to a doctor about ongoing bloating that does not go away over time. People whose bloating occurs alongside these symptoms should seek medical advice: Here are some frequently asked questions. A person could gain a pound or two when bloated due to not passing stool, but this is usually not significant weight gain and will go down once the bloating subsides. Instead of other drinks like sodas, which can make bloating worse, water is a much better alternative. It can help reduce both bloating and constipation. Various remedies can help a person to relieve bloating quickly. These include trying gas relief capsules, abdominal massages, and exercises such as walking and yoga poses. Ultimately, the outlook for bloating depends on the underlying cause. Most of the time, bloating is due to minor issues that lifestyle changes or OTC treatments can resolve. People should see a doctor if bloating is ongoing or occurs with other symptoms.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320233,Anti-inflammatory diet: What to know,"Eating less processed food, alcohol, and red meat and consuming more plant-based foods may help manage inflammation in some instances. Anti-inflammatory diets are typically not specific regimens but rather eating styles. The Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet are examples of anti-inflammatory diets. Dietary changes may help manage both short- and long-term inflammation in many cases, although its efficacy as a management tool will depend on a person’s overall health and the causes of inflammation. For example, chronic inflammation can occur due to psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma. While diet changes may help manage some symptoms, it may not be effective in more severe cases. Some foods contain ingredients that can trigger or worsen inflammation. Meanwhile, other foods contain compounds – such as antioxidants – that may, in fact, reduce it. An anti-inflammatory diet focuses on fresh fruits and vegetables, which are often good sources of antioxidants. Dietary antioxidants are molecules in food that help remove free radicals from the body. Free radicals are the natural byproducts of some bodily processes, including metabolism. Free radicals can lead to cell damage. This damage increases the risk of inflammation and can contribute to various diseases. An anti-inflammatory diet favors foods that are rich in antioxidants over those that increase the production of free radicals. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are present in oily fish, may help reduce the levels of inflammatory proteins in the body. Fiber can also have this effect. Many popular diets already adhere to anti-inflammatory principles. For example, both the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet include fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, whole grains, and fats that are good for the heart. For example, research suggests
Trusted Source
 that the Mediterranean diet, focusing on plant-based foods and healthful oils, can reduce the effects of inflammation on the cardiovascular system. Learn more about the Mediterranean diet here. Research also shows

 people manage blood pressure. In general, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) considers a serving to be: For most ages, the USDA recommends consuming around 2 cups of fruit and 3 cups of vegetables daily, although this varies slightly according to age and sex. Blueberries and strawberries contain antioxidant compounds called anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid. A 2019 review
Trusted Source
 suggests consistent findings to support the theory that anthocyanins and anthocyanin-rich berries can lower blood pressure. However, they emphasize that this outcome is not generalized and may depend on several factors, including study length, baseline characteristics, and dosage. The review’s authors and other researchers
Trusted Source
 suggest that further evidence is necessary to prove this claim. To enjoy berries: A serving of blueberries is around 1 cup of fresh or frozen blueberries or half a cup of dried blueberries. A serving of strawberries is around 7 strawberries. Which other foods are rich in antioxidants? Bananas contain potassium, which can help manage hypertension. One medium-sized banana contains around 422 milligrams (mg)
Trusted Source
 of potassium. A serving would be 1 large banana, 1 cup of sliced banana, or two-thirds of a cup of mashed banana. According to the American Heart Association (AHA)

 harmful. Drinking beet juice may reduce blood pressure in the short and long term because it contains dietary nitrate. According to a 2022 systematic review
Trusted Source
, research shows that nitrate from beetroot juice lowers systolic blood pressure in people with arterial hypertension but does not affect diastolic blood pressure. Tips for use include: A serving of beet is around 1 cup of raw, cooked, or juiced beets. Cacao, an ingredient in dark chocolate, contains flavonoids, an antioxidant. Flavonoids may help reduce blood pressure, according to the AHA
Trusted Source
. However, it notes that a person may not be able to consume enough flavonoids in dark chocolate to experience significant benefits. The AHA says that a small amount of chocolate from time to time can be part of a balanced diet. It advises, however, that people eat it because they enjoy it, not for health reasons. A daily serving of kiwi can reduce systolic blood pressure, among other benefits, according to a 2022 randomized control trial
Trusted Source
. People who ate 2 kiwis per day before breakfast for 7 weeks had a reduction of 2.7 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) in systolic blood pressure compared to a control group. Kiwis are also rich in vitamin C. A 2020 meta-analysis
Trusted Source
 suggests that vitamin C supplementation significantly reduced blood pressure in people with primary hypertension. Kiwis are easy to add to lunches or smoothies. One cup of kiwi, or 2–3 kiwifruits, makes up 1 serving. Which other foods contain vitamin C? Watermelon contains an amino acid called citrulline. The body converts citrulline to arginine, and this helps the body produce nitric oxide, a gas that relaxes blood vessels and encourages flexibility in arteries. These effects aid blood flow, which can lower high blood pressure. A small 2023 controlled crossover trial looked at the effects of watermelon juice on blood pressure in young, healthy adults. They found that watermelon juice lowered systolic blood pressure over two hours. Similarly, a 2023 meta-analysis suggests research up to 2021 supports watermelon’s blood pressure-lowering effects. However, the authors highlight the need for more trials with larger sample sizes. In a small 2019 study
Trusted Source
, 27 people consumed either watermelon juice or another drink before exercise. The females who drank watermelon juice did not experience a rise in blood pressure after exercise, although the males did. People can consume watermelon: One serving of watermelon is 1 cup of chopped fruit or 1 slice of around 2 inches. Oats contain a type of fiber called beta-glucan, which may benefit
Trusted Source
 heart health, including blood pressure. A 2020 rodent study
Trusted Source
 found that beta-glucan and avenanthramide C, both present in oats, reduce levels of malondialdehyde, a marker of oxidative stress in hypertensive rats. These results suggest that ingredients present in oats can help prevent high blood pressure and protect heart health in other ways. However, further research on human subjects is necessary. Ways of eating oats include: Leafy green vegetables are rich in nitrates, which help manage blood pressure. Research from 2021
Trusted Source
 suggests that eating at least 1 cup of green leafy vegetables daily can lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Examples of leafy greens include: To consume a daily dose of green vegetables, a person can: A serving of fresh leafy greens is 2 cups of fresh leaves or 1 cup of cooked leafy greens. Garlic has antibiotic and antifungal properties, many of which may be due to its main active ingredient, allicin. A 2020 review
Trusted Source
 concludes that garlic in general, and specifically Kyolic garlic, can reduce: Garlic can enhance the flavor of many savory meals, including stir-fries, soups, and omelets. It can also be an alternative to salt as a flavoring. Fermented foods are rich in probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that may help manage

Trusted Source
 people to limit their salt intake. However, a 2017 study did not find that eating salt-fermented vegetables increased the risk of high blood pressure despite the high sodium content. Fermented foods to add to the diet include: Probiotic supplements are another option. Lentils provide protein and fiber, and experts
Trusted Source
 say they may benefit the blood vessels of people with hypertension. A 2022 study
Trusted Source
 analyzed legume intake over 3.7 years in 7,522 people from the United Kingdom. Researchers associated higher legume consumption of 55–70 grams (g) daily with a lower risk of hypertension. Legumes included lentils, peas, beans, and more. People can use lentils in many ways, including: Yogurt is fermented dairy food. A 2021 study
Trusted Source
 looked at data for people with and without high blood pressure to see whether there was a link between fermented dairy products and hypertension. The participants with high blood pressure who consumed more yogurt had lower systolic blood pressure and lower arterial pressure than those who did not. To enjoy unsweetened yogurt: Pomegranates contain antioxidants and other ingredients that may help prevent
Trusted Source
 high blood pressure and atherosclerosis. A 2018 trial suggests that daily pomegranate juice consumption may reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure in people with diabetes. However, the authors stress the need for further research. A 2017 review

If home remedies do not help, over-the-counter and prescription medications are available. Allergies, infections, and acid reflux are just a few possible causes of a cough. Some natural remedies may help relieve a cough. This article reviews natural remedies that may help treat a cough. It is important to remember that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
Trusted Source
 does not monitor herbs and supplements, so people who use them may be at risk of using low quality products with impurities. People who want to try natural remedies to treat their cough should consider researching sources and brands. Additionally, some herbs and supplements can interfere with medications, which may result in unwanted side effects. It is best to consult a doctor before taking supplements. People use a range of natural remedies to treat a persistent cough. While they may help some people, it is important to note that some of the following remedies have limited evidence to support their use. This means a person may or may not find that the remedies work for them. According to research, honey may relieve a cough. In a 2021 review of studies, researchers looked at the effect of using honey to treat coughs in upper respiratory infections. The researchers found that honey was superior to usual care, both in suppressing the cough and in helping prevent the need for antibiotics. In another study, researchers compared honey with dextromethorphan, a common cough suppressant. The researchers found that both honey and dextromethorphan worked to suppress coughs. They noted that honey scored slightly higher in one trial and on par with dextromethorphan in another. A person can use this remedy by swallowing a spoonful of honey or adding it to a hot drink, such as an herbal tea. Ginger may ease a dry or asthmatic cough, as it has anti-inflammatory properties. It may also relieve nausea and pain. Only a few older studies have looked at ginger’s effect on coughs. A study from 2015 examined 10 different natural products used in traditional Asian medicines, including ginger. The researchers found that ginger and other remedies, including honey, have played a continued role in traditional medicine. While a long history of use can have valuable implications for a treatment’s effectiveness, the researchers noted that their study may provide future researchers with a place to start when examining natural solutions to coughs. People often add ginger to dishes or drink it in tea. However, in some cases, ginger tea can cause stomach upset or heartburn. While current research is lacking, an older study from 2008
Trusted Source
 showed that drinking liquids at room temperature may alleviate a cough, runny nose, and sneezing. However, people with additional cold or flu symptoms may benefit from warming up their beverages. The same study reports that hot beverages alleviate even more symptoms, including a sore throat, chills, and fatigue. The symptom relief was immediate and remained for a continued period after finishing the hot beverage. Hot beverages that may be comforting include: A wet cough, which is one that produces mucus or phlegm, may improve with steam. To try this method, a person should take a hot shower or bath and allow the bathroom to fill with steam. They should stay in this steam for a few minutes until symptoms subside. They can drink a glass of water afterward to cool down and prevent dehydration. Alternatively, people can make a steam bowl. A person can do this by: A person may find steaming helpful when done one to two times per day. While many believe steam will help with cough and other symptoms, not all evidence supports this. For example, a 2017 study

Marshmallow root is an herb with a long history of use as a treatment for coughs and sore throats. The herb can ease irritation resulting from coughing because of its high mucilage content. Mucilage is a thick, gluey substance that coats the throat. One older, small study found that an herbal cough syrup containing marshmallow root, along with thyme and ivy, effectively relieved coughs resulting from common colds and respiratory tract infections. After 12 days of taking the syrup, 90% of the participants rated its effectiveness as good or very good. In a 2020 in vitro study
Trusted Source
, researchers also noted the coating effect of marshmallow root extract. They found that the root extract has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties and provided similar relief to diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Marshmallow root is also available as a dried herb or a bagged tea. A person should add hot water to either and then drink it immediately or allow it to cool first. The longer the marshmallow root steeps in the water, the more mucilage will be in the drink. Side effects can include stomach upset, but it may be possible to counter this by drinking extra fluids. Marshmallow root is available for purchase in health stores or online. People have used saltwater gargles for a long time to help alleviate sore throat and symptoms associated with the common cold. It may help loosen mucus and alleviate some pain. However, it likely will not help reduce viral load. In a 2021 study

A person can make a saltwater gargle by: Young children and people with high blood pressure should avoid using saltwater gargles Bromelain is an enzyme that comes from pineapples. It is most plentiful in the core of the fruit. It has anti-inflammatory properties and may also have mucolytic properties, which means it can break down mucus and remove it from the body. Some people drink pineapple juice daily to reduce mucus in the throat and suppress coughing. However, there may not be enough bromelain in the juice to relieve symptoms. Bromelain supplements are available and may be more effective at relieving coughs. However, it is best for a person to speak with a doctor before trying any new supplements. Bromelain is a potential allergen, and the substance may also cause side effects and interact with medications. People who take blood thinners or specific antibiotics should not take bromelain. Thyme has both culinary and medicinal uses and is a commonly used remedy for a cough, sore throat, bronchitis, and digestive issues. In a 2015 meta-analysis
Trusted Source
 of several studies, researchers noted that strong evidence suggests that using thyme preparations helped alleviate people’s cough symptoms. However, they noted that additional studies are needed to demonstrate its overall effectiveness. A more recent study in 2021 showed that people using a combination of thyme and ivy drops showed improvement in bronchitis symptoms, cough, and overall quality of life. They also noted that people experienced few side effects using the drops. To treat coughs using thyme, a person can look for a cough syrup that contains this herb. Acid reflux is a common cause of a cough. Avoiding foods that can trigger acid reflux is one of the best ways to manage this condition and reduce the cough that accompanies it. Every individual may have different reflux triggers that they need to avoid. People who are unsure of what causes their reflux can begin by eliminating the most common triggers from their diet and monitoring their symptoms. The foods and beverages that most commonly trigger acid reflux include: Native Americans traditionally

A person can make slippery elm tea by adding 1 teaspoon of the dried herb to a cup of hot water and allowing it to steep for at least 10 minutes before drinking. It is important to note that slippery elm may interfere with the absorption of medications, so a person should talk with a doctor before making a tea or using another supplement. Slippery elm is available in powder and capsule form in health stores and online. NAC is a supplement that comes from the amino acid L-cysteine. Taking a daily dose may lessen the frequency and severity of a wet cough by reducing mucus in the airways. A meta-analysis of 13 studies

 suggests that NAC can significantly and consistently reduce symptoms in people with chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is a prolonged inflammation of the airways that causes mucus buildup, a cough, and other symptoms. The researchers suggest a daily dose of 600 milligrams (mg) of NAC for people without airway obstruction and up to 1,200 mg where there is an obstruction. NAC can have severe side effects, including hives, swelling, fever, and difficulty breathing. Anyone considering this approach should speak with a doctor first. Probiotics do not directly relieve a cough, but they may boost the immune system by balancing the bacteria in the gut.

Growth charts can provide a guide to the average weight of a baby. First, it is worth noting that average weight is not typical weight. Just like adults, babies come in all shapes and sizes. If a baby’s weight is in a lower percentile, this does not necessarily signal a problem with their growth or physical development. With this in mind, using a weight chart can help a person generally track their baby’s growth. This article describes a baby’s average weight month by month from birth and explores what can affect it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Trusted Source
 recommends using the World Health Organization (WHO) weight chart for babies up to 2 years of age. According to the WHO, the average birth weight of a full-term male baby is 7 pounds (lb) 6 ounces (oz)
Trusted Source
, or 3.3 kilograms (kg). The average birth weight of a full-term female is 7 lb 2 oz
Trusted Source
, or 3.2 kg. The average weight of a baby born at 37 to 40 weeks ranges from 5 lb 8 oz to 8 lb 13 oz. This equates to 2.5 to 4 kg.

At delivery, experts
Trusted Source
 consider a low birth weight to be less than 5 lb 8 oz, or 2.5 kg. It is common
Trusted Source
 for babies to lose around 10% of their weight during the first week after birth. This decrease is mostly due to fluid loss and usually nothing to worry about. Most babies gain back this weight within 1 week. Weight charts can help someone tell what percentile their baby’s weight falls into. For example, if their weight is in the 60th percentile, 40% of babies of the same age and sex weigh more, and 60% of these babies weigh less. This does not necessarily mean that any baby weighs too much or too little. It can simply indicate where a baby’s weight falls on a spectrum. The chart below shows baby weights in the 50th percentile, which refers to the average weight. Male babies tend to weigh a little more than female babies, so the chart divides into sex.

Trusted Source
 than formula-fed infants. It is common
Trusted Source
 for babies to lose weight in their first week of life. They usually gain this weight back by the time they are 2 weeks old. Although this can vary, babies tend to double their birth weight by the age of 4 months and usually weigh triple
Trusted Source
 their birth weight by their first birthday. However, growth patterns do not follow a clear schedule. Some babies gain weight steadily and stay in the same percentile, or close to it, for several months. Others gain weight rapidly, signaling a growth spurt, which can occur at any time. This may move a baby into a new weight percentile. It is important not to focus on weight as the only indicator of physical development. Other measurements of this development include the baby’s length and head circumference. Considering all three measurements gives doctors an idea about how the baby is growing, compared with other babies of the same age and sex. Meanwhile, it is also important to consider other developmental milestones. Various checklists of milestones by age are available, including one from Pathways.org, which has endorsement from organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners. For anyone looking for more information about what influences the weight of a baby, several factors can have a role, including the following. Male newborns tend to be bigger than female newborns and typically gain weight a little faster during infancy. Weight gain and growth rates can also depend on whether the baby consumes breast milk or formula. Chest or breastfed babies gain weight and grow slower
Trusted Source
 than formula-fed babies during the first year. However, growth generally follows a similar trend for both chest or breastfed and formula-fed babies. Weight continues to fluctuate even after the baby starts eating other foods. Underlying health issues can cause a baby to gain weight more slowly. For example, babies with congenital heart irregularities may gain weight at a slower rate
Trusted Source
 than babies without this condition. Health issues that affect nutrient absorption or digestion, such as celiac disease, may also lead to slow weight gain. Babies born prematurely may grow and gain weight more slowly during their first year than babies born at full term. However, many premature babies gain weight rapidly and “catch up” by about their first birthday. Below are some common questions about baby weight. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the average birth weight of a full-term male baby is 7 pounds lb 6 oz
Trusted Source
, and 7 lb 2 oz
Trusted Source
 for a full-term female baby. Therefore, a 10 lb baby is big compared to the average weight of a baby. Generally, a baby will weigh double their initial birth weight by the age of 4 months
Trusted Source
. They will usually weigh triple their birth weight by 12 months. The average birth weight for full-term male babies is 7 pounds (lb) 6 ounces (oz)
Trusted Source
, or 3.3 kilograms (kg). For female babies born full-term, the average birth weight is 7 lb 2 oz
Trusted Source
, or 3.2 kg. Baby weight charts can help a healthcare team track a baby’s physical development by comparing the baby’s weight with that of an infant of the same age and sex. Still, a doctor usually looks for steady growth rather than a target percentile when assessing a baby’s physical development. Even if a baby’s weight is in a lower percentile, it will not necessarily lead to them developing into a small adult, just as longer babies do not necessarily become tall adults. Knowing about average weights by month can help people gauge their babies’ physical development, but doctors also look for other important indicators, such as length and head circumference. Healthcare professionals also consider whether a baby is generally hitting other milestones on time. By taking a detailed medical history, they can rule out any medical conditions or nutritional considerations that may be preventing a baby from gaining weight appropriately.

Ovulation, which is when the ovaries release an egg, is the most fertile period. In theory, a person can become pregnant at any time in their cycle, but it is most likely to happen around ovulation. When ovulation happens will vary according to a person’s cycle. The days during the menstrual cycle when a person is least likely to get pregnant are known as the ‘safe period.’ This article describes how to calculate the fertile window to aid or avoid conception. Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article will use the terms “male,” “female,” or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. Learn more. The average person’s menstrual cycle is between 28 and 32 days. Some people have shorter cycles, while others have much longer ones. The first day of a person’s period is the first day of their menstrual cycle. Their period typically lasts 3 to 7 days. According to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a person whose menstrual cycle is between 26 days and 32 days long will be most fertile between days 8 and 19 of their cycle. Variations in the menstrual cycle usually happen in the follicular phase, which occurs before ovulation. The luteal phase, which occurs from ovulation to the next period, is typically 14 days long. Learn more about the phases of the menstrual cycle. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us Ovulation occurs when one of the ovaries releases an egg. After release, the egg moves to the fallopian tube, where it will travel to the uterus over the course of 24 hours or so. Pregnancy occurs if sperm travel to the fallopian tube and fertilizes the egg. If sperm does not fertilize the egg, the egg moves to the uterus and breaks down, ready to leave the body during the next menstrual period. Learn more about sperm. According to the ACOG, ovulation occurs around 14 days before a person expects to have their next period if their monthly cycle is 28 days. Most people ovulate between days 11 and 21 of their cycle. The first day of their last menstrual period (LMP) is day 1 of the cycle. Ovulation does not always occur on the same day every month and can vary by a day or more on either side of the expected date. Doctors call the part of the cycle around ovulation the fertile window because the chance of pregnancy is highest at this time. For example, if ovulation occurs on day 14, a person can conceive on that day or within the following 24 hours. However, their fertile window begins a few days before ovulation because sperm can survive for up to 5 days inside the female body. So, even if a person does not have sex on day 14 or 15, it is still possible to become pregnant if they had sex without using contraception on days 9 to 13. According to research from 2018

Every person and every cycle is different. It can be helpful for a person to chart their monthly cycle and note the signs of ovulation to help pinpoint the exact day of ovulation each month. Learn more about ovulation. Tracking the signs of ovulation can help someone determine the precise day they ovulate each month. Signs include: Some of these signs, such as basal body temperature, will continue to change after ovulation. For this reason, it is advisable not to use temperature to predict the fertile window. It may be helpful for someone to track the signs over a few months to get an idea of what is typical for their body. However, keep in mind that there are several variables, and the timing of ovulation can change month-to-month. Another option is to use an ovulation predictor kit or fertility monitor. Fertility aids measure the levels of specific hormones in the urine to determine the ovulation day each month. Some devices also identify days of peak fertility. Using a combination of these methods may provide an individual with the best accuracy. The following table, based on research from 2015, summarizes a typical menstrual cycle lasting 28 days and how fertile a person is likely to be at each stage. To get a more specific range of highest fertility windows based on the day of ovulation, a person can track the first day of their last period in a pregnancy calculator.

For example, headache pain at the front or on one side of the head may indicate migraine or cluster headaches. Some headaches may go away on their own. People can use at-home treatments, such as OTC pain relief medications or having a nap, to relieve symptoms. However, if headaches are severe, frequent, progressively painful, or occur alongside other symptoms, including vision changes or slurred speech, people should speak with a doctor. Dehydration can cause or worsen headache symptoms and headache disorders. Staying adequately hydrated is the best method to prevent dehydration headaches. To treat this type of headache, doctors typically treat the person’s dehydration, usually by replenishing their fluids. Migraines often affect one side of the head. An individual person’s migraines should not always be on the same side of the head – and episodes can affect the left side or the right side. No, a one-sided headache is not always migraine. Other causes include neurological issues, tension headaches, medication side effects, and allergies. Headaches are a widespread health complaint, affecting most people at least occasionally. Most headaches are not a cause for concern. Usually, symptoms will resolve within minutes to hours. Alternatively, people can ease symptoms with OTC medications, lifestyle changes, and home remedies. People should see a doctor if headaches are severe, persistent, or get progressively worse. Even if a migraine or a cluster headache is responsible for the pain, a doctor can prescribe treatments to manage symptoms and reduce the frequency of the headaches. Read the article in Spanish.

If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process Various home treatments can help manage constipation, such as drinking more water and eating fiber. If home remedies do not help, over-the-counter and prescription medications are available. Constipation affects around 20% of people in the United States, resulting in 8 million doctor visits per year (1
Trusted Source
, 2
Trusted Source
). People may experience constipation due to the foods they eat or avoid, their lifestyle choices, the medications they take, or the medical conditions they have. For many, the cause of their chronic constipation is unknown. This is known as chronic idiopathic constipation. Constipation is characterized by the following symptoms (3
Trusted Source
): Constipation can have a serious negative effect on quality of life, as well as on physical and mental health (1
Trusted Source
, 4
Trusted Source
, 5
Trusted Source
). There are many natural ways to help relieve constipation. People can do these in the comfort of their own homes, and most of them are supported by science. Here are 13 natural home remedies to relieve constipation. Being dehydrated regularly can make a person constipated. To prevent this, it is important to drink enough water and stay hydrated (6, 7
Trusted Source
, 8). When a person is constipated, they might find relief from drinking some carbonated (sparkling) water. This can help them rehydrate and get things moving again. Some studies have found sparkling water to be more effective than tap water at relieving constipation. This includes in people with indigestion, or dyspepsia, and people with chronic idiopathic constipation (9, 11
Trusted Source
). However, drinking carbonated drinks such as sugary soda is not a good idea, as these beverages can have harmful health effects and may make constipation worse (12
Trusted Source
, 13
Trusted Source
). Some people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) find that carbonated drinks worsen their symptoms, so these individuals may wish to avoid sparkling water and other carbonated drinks. Bottom line: Dehydration can cause constipation, so be sure to drink enough water. Sparkling water may be even more effective at relieving constipation.

Your privacy is important to us To treat constipation, doctors often tell people to increase their dietary fiber intake. This is because increasing fiber intake increases the bulk and consistency of bowel movements, making them easier to pass. It also helps them pass through the digestive system more quickly (14). In fact, one 2016 review found that 77% of people with chronic constipation benefited from supplementing with fiber (15
Trusted Source
). However, some studies have found that increasing fiber intake can actually make the problem worse. Others report that dietary fiber improves stool frequency but may not help with other symptoms of constipation, such as stool consistency, pain, bloating, and gas (16
Trusted Source
, 17
Trusted Source
). This is because different types of dietary fiber have different effects on digestion. There are many different dietary fibers, but in general, they fall into two categories: insoluble fibers and soluble fibers. Insoluble fibers — present in wheat bran, vegetables, and whole grains — add bulk to stools and may help them pass more quickly and easily through the digestive system. Soluble fibers — present in oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, and peas, as well as some fruits and vegetables — absorb water and form a gel-like paste, which softens the stools and improves its consistency. Non-fermentable soluble fibers, such as psyllium, are the best choice for treating constipation (18
Trusted Source
, 19
Trusted Source
, 20
Trusted Source
). One 2020 review found psyllium to be 3.4 times more effective than insoluble wheat bran for constipation (18
Trusted Source
). Various brands of psyllium fiber are available online. Studies examining the effects of insoluble fiber as a treatment for constipation have yielded mixed results. This is partly because insoluble fiber can make the problem worse in some people with a functional bowel problem, such as IBS or chronic idiopathic constipation (19
Trusted Source
, 20
Trusted Source
, 21
Trusted Source
) Some fermentable soluble fibers may also be ineffective at treating constipation, as they are fermented by bacteria in the gut and lose their water-holding capacity (22
Trusted Source
). To prevent constipation, people should aim to consume a mix of soluble and insoluble fibers. The total recommended fiber intake per day is 25 grams (g) for females and 38 g for males (14). Bottom line: Try eating more high fiber foods. Supplementing the diet with soluble non-fermentable fiber, such as psyllium, can also help. Various research studies have reported that exercise could help improve the symptoms of constipation (23, 24
Trusted Source
, 25
Trusted Source
, 26
Trusted Source
). Studies have linked sedentary lifestyles with an increased risk of constipation. Because of this, some healthcare experts recommend increasing exercise to get the stool moving (23). That said, not all studies agree that exercise treats constipation. Therefore, more research is needed (27
Trusted Source
). Other studies have reported that although exercise did not always improve the number of times people went to the bathroom, it did reduce some symptoms and improved people’s quality of life scores (28
Trusted Source
). In people with IBS, moderate exercise (brisk walking) can improve digestive symptoms and quality of life scores. However, vigorous exercise (jogging) could make symptoms worse for some (29
Trusted Source
). Try doing some gentle exercise — such as going for regular walks, swimming, cycling, or jogging — to see if it helps. Bottom line: Exercise may reduce the symptoms of constipation in some people. For some people, consuming coffee can increase the urge to go to the bathroom. This is because coffee stimulates the muscles in the digestive system (29
Trusted Source
, 30
Trusted Source
). In fact, one 1998 study found that caffeinated coffee can stimulate the gut in the same way that a meal can. This effect was 60% stronger than drinking water and 23% stronger than drinking decaffeinated coffee (31
Trusted Source
). Coffee may also contain small amounts of soluble fibers that help prevent constipation by improving the balance of gut bacteria (32, 33
Trusted Source
). That said, the bowel-stimulating qualities of caffeine may be stronger in people with IBS. It could also make digestive symptoms worse (30
Trusted Source
). People with IBS can try removing caffeine from their diet to see if it helps. Learn more about foods and beverages that can relieve constipation here. Bottom line: Coffee can help relieve constipation by stimulating the muscles in the gut. It may also contain small amounts of soluble fiber. Senna is a popular safe and effective herbal laxative that helps treat constipation (34, 35
Trusted Source
). It is available over the counter and online, in both oral and rectal forms. Senna contains plant compounds called glycosides, which stimulate the nerves in the gut and help speed up bowel movements (36). Doctors consider Senna safe for adults for short periods of time, but people should consult a doctor if their symptoms do not go away after a few days. Doctors usually do not recommend Senna for pregnant women, those who are breastfeeding, or people with certain health conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Bottom line: The herbal laxative Senna is a popular remedy for constipation. It stimulates the nerves in the gut to speed up bowel movements. Probiotics may help prevent chronic constipation. Probiotics are live, beneficial bacteria that naturally occur in the gut. They include Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus. People can increase their levels by eating probiotic foods. Some people who have chronic constipation have an imbalance of bacteria in their gut. Consuming more probiotic foods could help improve this balance and prevent constipation. One study mentioned in a 2019 review found that taking probiotics for 2 weeks can help treat constipation, increasing stool frequency and stool consistency (37
Trusted Source
). They could also help treat constipation by producing short-chain fatty acids. These may improve gut movements, making it easier to pass stools (38
Trusted Source
). Alternatively, try a probiotic supplement. Some studies have found that people started to feel the benefits of these supplements after 4 weeks (39
Trusted Source
). Try taking probiotic supplements, which are available online, or eating more probiotic-rich foods to see if this helps with constipation. Probiotic foods include: Bottom line: Probiotics may help treat chronic constipation. Try eating probiotic foods or taking a supplement. A person can speak to a doctor or pharmacist about choosing an appropriate laxative. Different types have varying methods of action, but all are effective for constipation (40
Trusted Source
, 41
Trusted Source
). A doctor may recommend one of the following types: However, people should not take most of these laxatives on a regular basis without speaking to a doctor. Bottom line: Laxatives are effective for relieving constipation. Speak to a doctor or pharmacist about the best ones to use. Constipation can be a symptom of IBS. The low FODMAP diet is an elimination diet that helps treat IBS and may relieve IBS-related constipation (42
Trusted Source
, 43
Trusted Source
, 44
Trusted Source
). FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. The diet involves limiting high FODMAP foods for a period of time before reintroducing them to determine which ones the body can tolerate (45
Trusted Source
). In people with constipation-predominant IBS, the low FODMAP diet alone is often not enough. Such people will probably need to pay attention to other aspects of their diet, such as getting enough water and fiber, to experience relief from their symptoms (46
Trusted Source
, 47
Trusted Source
). Bottom line: A low FODMAP diet may help relieve IBS-related constipation. However, that alone may not provide sufficient relief. Glucomannan is a type of soluble fiber from the roots of the konjac plant. Some research suggests that it is effective against constipation (48
Trusted Source
). As well as improving bowel movements, glucomannan may act as a prebiotic to improve the balance of good bacteria in the gut. One review on the effect of glucomannan in children concluded that glucomannan moderately increases defecation but does not increase stool consistency or benefit treatment overall (50). However, another controlled study found no significant effects (51
Trusted Source
). People can get glucomannan from supplements or by eating shirataki, or konjac, noodles. Glucomannan supplements are also available. They vary in their benefits by brand, so it is best to compare brands before making a purchase. Glucomannan supplements are available online. Bottom line: Glucomannan may help treat constipation in some people. Sources include supplements and shirataki noodles. Prebiotics are an indigestible carbohydrate fiber. Prebiotics include oligosaccharide and inulin. Although dietary fibers reduce constipation by improving the consistency and bulk of stool, prebiotics have their effects by improving digestive health. Prebiotic fibers improve digestive health by feeding the beneficial bacteria in the gut, which boosts probiotics and improves the balance of the gut bacteria (37
Trusted Source
, 52
Trusted Source
). In fact, some prebiotics may help increase the frequency of bowel movements, as well as make stools softer (53). Prebiotic foods include: However, garlic and onions are not included in a low FODMAP diet as these foods can trigger symptoms in people with IBS. Bottom line: Foods that contain prebiotic fibers can improve digestive health and the balance of beneficial gut bacteria. Prebiotics may help relieve constipation. Magnesium citrate is a popular home remedy against constipation. It is a type of osmotic laxative that people can buy over the counter or online. Taking moderate amounts of magnesium supplements can help relieve constipation. Doctors use higher dosages to prepare and clean out the bowel before surgery or other medical procedures (54, 55). Bottom line: Taking magnesium citrate, an over-the-counter supplement, can help relieve constipation. People often tout prunes and prune juice as nature’s remedy for constipation — and for good reason. Prunes may be the most accessible natural solution available. In addition to fiber, prunes contain sorbitol. This is a sugar alcohol that has a laxative effect (56
Trusted Source
, 57
Trusted Source
). Some studies have shown that prunes may be more effective than fibers such as psyllium (58
Trusted Source
, 59
Trusted Source
). The effective dosage may be around 50 g, or seven medium prunes, twice per day (59
Trusted Source
). However, people with IBS may want to avoid prunes, because sugar alcohols are high FODMAP foods. Learn more about prune juice for constipation and other juices for constipation here. Bottom line: Prunes contain the sugar alcohol sorbitol, which has a laxative effect. Prunes can be a very effective remedy for constipation. In people with an intolerance to it, eating dairy can cause constipation due to its effect on the gut’s movements (60
Trusted Source
). This includes children who are intolerant to cow’s milk protein and adults with lactose intolerance. If someone suspects a dairy intolerance, they can see their doctor for diagnosis. The doctor may recommend temporarily removing dairy from the diet, while increasing other calcium-rich foods, to see if it improves the symptoms. Bottom line: Dairy or lactose intolerance may cause constipation in some people. In these people, removing dairy from the diet can help relieve symptoms. Here are some frequently asked questions about constipation. Taking laxatives can provide quick relief from constipation. Examples
Trusted Source
 include stool softeners, bulking agents, stimulant laxatives, and osmotic laxatives. A doctor or pharmacist can advise on which type of laxative they recommend. Laxatives and dietary changes can help treat constipation. This can include
Trusted Source
 consuming more fiber, drinking more water, and consuming more probiotics. Constipation typically refers to fewer than three bowel movements

If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process A rash is defined as a widespread eruption of skin lesions. It is a very broad medical term. Rashes can vary widely in appearance. Their causes range from insect bites to HIV and reactions to medications. A rash can affect one part of the body or cover a large area. Rashes can also be dry, moist, bumpy, smooth, cracked, or blistered. They can involve pain, itching, and color changes. Some rashes will clear up on their own, some respond to home remedies, but others might be a sign of something more serious that needs medical attention. Rashes can happen for many reasons, including skin infections, allergies, and medications. They can also result from bacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic infections and other diseases. In this article, learn about 71 possible causes of a rash and see images showing how they might appear. Allergies and sensitivities to food and other substances can cause skin rashes. One of the most common causes of rashes — contact dermatitis — occurs when the skin has a reaction to something that it has touched. The skin may become inflamed, and the rash tends to be weepy and oozy. Common causes include: A food allergy can also cause a rash and other symptoms.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322293,6 ways to do intermittent fasting,"Intermittent fasting involves periods of entirely or partially abstaining from eating. There are many methods of intermittent fasting that vary in the number of fast days and calorie allowances. Some studies suggest that this way of eating may offer benefits such as fat loss, better health, and increased longevity. Proponents claim that an intermittent fasting program is easier to maintain than traditional, calorie-controlled diets. An intermittent fasting pattern is based on a set schedule and does not follow random times. That said, each person’s experience of intermittent fasting is individual, and different styles will suit different people. This article discusses the research behind the most popular types of intermittent fasting and provides tips on maintaining this type of diet. To discover more evidence-based information and resources for weight management, visit our dedicated hub. There are various methods of intermittent fasting, and people will prefer different styles. Read on to find out about six different ways to do intermittent fasting. Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article will use the terms “male,” “female,” or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. Learn more. The rules for this diet are simple. A person needs to decide on and adhere to a 12-hour fasting window every day. According to some researchers, fasting for 12 to 14 hours can cause
Trusted Source
 the body to turn its fat stores into energy, which releases ketones into the bloodstream. This should
Trusted Source
 encourage weight loss. This type of intermittent fasting plan may be a suitable option for beginners. This is because the fasting window is relatively small, much of the fasting occurs during sleep, and the person can consume the same number of calories each day. The easiest way to follow the 12-hour fast is to include the period of sleep in the fasting window. For example, a person could choose to fast between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. They would need to finish their evening meal before 7 p.m. and wait until 7 a.m. to eat breakfast but would be asleep for much of the time in between.

Your privacy is important to us Fasting for 16 hours a day, leaving an 8-hour eating window, is called the 16:8 method or the Leangains diet. Some experts may recommend females fast for 14 hours and slowly build their way up to 16 hours, while males can start fasting for 16 hours straight away. This type of intermittent fast may be helpful for someone who has already tried the 12-hour fast but did not experience any benefits. On this fast, people usually finish their evening meal by 8 p.m. and skip breakfast the next day, not eating again until noon. A 2022 review
Trusted Source
 found that this fasting method, alongside calorie restriction, may be beneficial for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity and may have a positive effect on blood sugar processing. People following the 5:2 diet eat standard amounts of healthful food for 5 days and reduce calorie intake on the other 2 days. During the 2 fasting days, men generally consume 600 calories
Trusted Source
 and women 500 calories. Typically, people separate their fasting days in the week. For example, they may fast on a Monday and Thursday and eat regularly on the other days. There should be at least 1 nonfasting day between fasting days. There is limited research on the 5:2 diet, which is also known as the Fast diet. A 2022 study
Trusted Source
 examining different types of fasting found that the 5:2 diet had no clear ranking when compared with the other intermittent fasting regimens. A 2021 randomized controlled trial
Trusted Source
 found that adults with obesity who tried the 5:2 fasting method with group support experienced a greater weight loss at 6 weeks and rated the diet highly. However, the effect of weight loss diminished over time, with the weight difference no longer being significant by 1 year. There are several variations of the alternate day fasting plan, which involves fasting every other day. For some people, alternate day fasting means a complete avoidance of solid foods on fasting days, while other people allow up to 500 calories. On feeding days, people often choose to eat as much as they want. Alternate day fasting is an extreme form of intermittent fasting, and it may not be suitable for beginners or those with certain medical conditions. It may also be difficult to maintain this type of fasting in the long term. Fasting completely for 1 or 2 days a week, known as the Eat-Stop-Eat diet, involves eating no food for 24 hours at a time. Many people fast from breakfast to breakfast or lunch to lunch. People following this diet plan can have water, tea, and other calorie-free drinks during the fasting period. People should return to regular eating patterns on nonfasting days. Eating in this way reduces a person’s total calorie intake but does not limit the specific foods the individual consumes. A 24-hour fast can be challenging and may cause fatigue, headaches, or irritability. Many people find these effects become less extreme over time as their bodies adjust to this new eating pattern. People may benefit from trying a 12-hour or 16-hour fast before transitioning to the 24-hour fast. The Warrior Diet is a relatively extreme form of intermittent fasting. It involves eating very little, usually just a few servings of raw fruit and vegetables, during a 20-hour
Trusted Source
 fasting window, then eating one large meal at night. The eating window is usually only around 4 hours. This form of fasting may be best for people who have tried other forms of intermittent fasting already. Supporters of the Warrior Diet claim that humans are natural nocturnal eaters and that eating at night allows the body to gain nutrients in line with its circadian rhythms. During the 4-hour eating phase, people should make sure they consume plenty of vegetables, proteins, and healthy fats. They should also include some carbohydrates. Although it is possible to eat some foods during the fasting period, it can be challenging to stick to strict guidelines on when and what to eat in the long term. Some people may also have difficulty eating such a large meal so close to bedtime. There is also a risk that people on this diet will not eat enough nutrients, such as fiber. This can increase the risk of cancer and have an adverse effect on digestive and immune health. It can be challenging to stick to an intermittent fasting program. The following tips may help people stay on track and maximize the benefits of intermittent fasting: Recent research from the American Heart Association (AHA) has suggested a link between intermittent fasting and cardiovascular disease. One 2024 study involving over 20,000 adults from across the United States found that people who restricted their eating to an 8-hour eating schedule — otherwise known as the 16:8 method — had a 91% higher risk
Trusted Source
 of death from cardiovascular disease. Researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China presented these findings at an AHA conference. However, it is important to note that the study was observational, so it does not show cause and effect, only a link between two factors. This study does not show whether time-restricted eating itself increases the risk of cardiovascular death. Nor does it show whether those who are more likely to die from cardiovascular-related illness might also be more likely to be on a time-restricted diet. Another thing to note is that these findings have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, so have not gone through the peer-review process. Most research shows that time-restricted eating is beneficial
Trusted Source
 for health, particularly in those with overweight and obesity. However, these dietary approaches may not be suitable for everyone. For example, if someone has a history of disordered eating, intermittent fasting may exacerbate their atypical relationship with food. It is also important for people with health conditions such as diabetes to consult a healthcare professional before fasting. Below are some common questions about intermittent fasting. People starting intermittent fasting for the first time may find the 12-hour fasting method the easiest. This involves fasting for 12 hours every 24-hour period. People can include the time when they are asleep in this fasting window, for example, fasting from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. The amount of weight someone can lose with intermittent fasting depends on various factors, including the type and duration of fasting, their current weight, and how many calories they consume when they are not fasting. A 2023 meta-analysis states that alternate day fasting, 5:2 fasting, and time-restricted eating can cause weight loss reductions of 1% to 13%
Trusted Source
 over 2 to 52 weeks. The effectiveness of different fasting methods may vary between people. Fasting for 16 hours may be effective for people who did not experience results when fasting for 12 hours. Some fasting practices may involve fasting for 1 day a week, every other day, or 2 days a week. People should speak with a healthcare professional to ensure they are staying safe when fasting. There are many ways to do intermittent fasting, and no single plan will work for everyone. Individuals will experience the best results if they the various styles to learn what suits their lifestyles and preferences. Regardless of the type of intermittent fasting, fasting for extended periods when the body is unprepared can be problematic. These forms of dieting may not be suitable for everyone. If a person is prone to disordered eating, these approaches may exacerbate their irregular relationship with food. People with health conditions, including diabetes, should speak with a doctor before attempting any form of fasting. For the best results, it is essential to eat a healthful and balanced diet on nonfasting days. If necessary, a person can seek professional help to personalize an intermittent fasting plan and avoid pitfalls.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666,Everything you need to know about anxiety medications,"Types of anxiety medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, and more. People with persistent anxiety may benefit from anxiety medications to help manage symptoms. A doctor can help decide on the most suitable option. This article discusses the main types of anxiety medication and lists their risks and side effects. Several types of medication can treat the symptoms of anxiety. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) notes there are of drugs for anxiety disorders. Although SSRIs are a type of antidepressant, doctors can prescribe them to people with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). According to a 2022 article, doctors consider SSRIs to be the first-line drug treatment for general anxiety disorder. SSRIs work by stopping nerve cells in the brain from reabsorbing serotonin, which is a chemical that plays a vital role in mood regulation. Examples of SSRIs for anxiety include: These medications typically begin to take effect within 2–6 weeks
Trusted Source
, but they may not work for everyone. People usually take SSRIs for 6–12 months to treat anxiety and then gradually reduce the dosage. These drugs are not habit-forming, meaning that they do not usually lead to dependence. People should consult a doctor or physician before they start reducing or stopping their medication. SNRIs are another class of antidepressants that can treat depression and anxiety. Doctors may also prescribe them to treat some chronic pain conditions. The ADAA notes that medical professionals also consider SNRIs to be the first-line treatment for anxiety. However, they are not as effective in treating OCD. These medications work by reducing the brain’s reabsorption of the chemicals serotonin and norepinephrine. Examples of SNRIs for anxiety are: As with SSRIs, SNRIs can take several weeks to have an effect. Learn more about SNRIs. TCAs are an older class of antidepressant. Although they may be effective for the treatment of depression and anxiety, doctors often prescribe SSRIs instead as they cause fewer
Trusted Source
 adverse side effects. However, TCAs may be useful for some people, especially if other medications do not provide relief. These medications work by blocking the reabsorption of serotonin and norepinephrine. This increases the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain. Examples of TCAs for anxiety include: Learn more about TCAs. Fanapt has a boxed warning about an increased risk of death in certain older adults. A boxed warning is the most serious warning from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It alerts doctors and patients about drug effects that may be dangerous.

Older adults with dementia-related psychosis who take atypical antipsychotic drugs have an increased risk of death. For this reason, Fanapt is not approved for psychosis that’s related to dementia in adults ages 65 years and older.

For more information, see “Dosage adjustments” in the “Factors that can affect your dosage” section below. Fanapt has a boxed warning about an increased risk of death in certain older adults.

Benzodiazepines are a type of sedative that reduces the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as tense muscles. These drugs also encourage relaxation, and their effects take place quickly. Peak levels in the blood occur 1–2 hours after a person takes their dose. People may feel the effects sooner than this. Benzodiazepines include: Although they can be highly effective for short-term issues, doctors rarely prescribe benzodiazepines because they become less effective over time and can be addictive. Due to these risks, experts suggest that doctors do not prescribe the continuous use of benzodiazepines for more than 6 months
Trusted Source
. Some people may take benzodiazepines to manage short-term anxiety. For example, people with a fear of flying may take them before a flight. At times, people can take a benzodiazepine alongside an SSRI for 2–4 weeks until the SSRI takes effect. Learn more about the benefits and risks of benzodiazepines.

Many other medications may help treat anxiety, although doctors usually only prescribe them if SSRIs or similar drugs do not work. Beta-blockers are a common medication for people with high blood pressure and heart conditions. However, doctors may prescribe them
Trusted Source
 off-label for anxiety in certain situations. Beta-blockers reduce the effects of norepinephrine, meaning that they can relieve some of the physical symptoms of anxiety. Examples of beta-blockers include atenolol (Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal). This anti-anxiety medication may treat
Trusted Source
 short- or long-term anxiety symptoms. Buspirone (BuSpar) works much more slowly than benzodiazepines and may not treat all types of anxiety disorders, but it causes fewer side effects and has a lower risk of dependency. MAOIs are one of the earliest types of antidepressant. Doctors may prescribe them off-label to treat some types of anxiety, though they can potentially cause serious side effects, so doctors rarely prescribe them. Types of MAOI include: Learn more about MAOIs. Antidepressants and other drugs for anxiety have the potential to cause side effects in some people. These often resolve after a few weeks, but it is crucial to contact a doctor if they are severe or do not subside. Some doctors may recommend taking anxiety medications with food to minimize side effects or taking them before bed if the drug does not interfere with sleep. The side effects a person experiences may vary depending on the type of medication. The side effects of SSRIs can include: The side effects of SNRIs are similar to those of SSRIs, and can include: Side effects vary among TCAs as they work in different ways. Possible side effects include: Benzodiazepines can cause several side effects, such as: Benzodiazepines also carry certain risks. For example, they can cause physical dependence, even after a short period of use. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines may lead to
Trusted Source
: More severe risks of benzodiazepines may include
Trusted Source
: Possible side effects of beta-blockers include: People with asthma should avoid beta-blockers. Individuals with diabetes should take them with caution and speak with a doctor about the possible risks. The side effects of buspirone may include: Some common side effects
Trusted Source
 of MAOIs include: These medications also interact with several other drugs, as well as some foods and drinks. Anyone taking MAOIs should ask their doctor for a complete list of the medications, foods, and drinks they need to avoid. In 2004, the FDA required
Trusted Source
 all antidepressants to carry a black-boxed warning relating to the risk of suicide in children and young adults. People under 25 years of age may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts and behaviors while taking antidepressants. If you or someone you know is in crisis and considering suicide or self-harm, please seek support: If you’re calling on behalf of someone else, stay with them until help arrives.

It is best for anyone experiencing symptoms of an anxiety disorder to contact a doctor. They may recommend therapy, medications, or a combination of both. To diagnose an anxiety disorder, doctors will typically carry out a physical examination to check for any underlying conditions and ask a person about their symptoms. They may also perform a psychological evaluation and compare the person’s symptoms to the American Psychiatric Association’s
Trusted Source
 criteria for anxiety disorders. If a doctor thinks anxiety medication might be suitable, they can discuss whether they recommend short-term or long-term medication. Once a person starts taking prescription medication for anxiety, their doctor will recommend regular follow-up appointments, typically every 2–4 weeks to begin with, to monitor how well the medication is working. Everybody will respond differently to anxiety medication. What works for one person may not be suitable for somebody else. If a person starts taking anxiety medication and finds they are not experiencing an improvement in symptoms after several weeks or months, the doctor may recommend a different medication. It is essential never to stop taking medication without medical supervision, as doing so may cause withdrawal symptoms. Here are some common questions about anxiety medication. The most common
Trusted Source
 anti-anxiety medications are benzodiazepines. However, doctors do not consider benzodiazepines to be first-line treatment due to their side effects. Instead, SSRIs and SNRIs are first-line treatment
Trusted Source
 medications for anxiety. There is no individual anxiety medication that works best for everybody, as each person’s symptoms will respond differently. However, the four major classes of drugs that a doctor may recommend for anxiety include SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and benzodiazepines. As with any medication, a person may experience side effects with any anxiety medication. Side effects may also be different for each person. However, SSRIs typically

They include passing stool, avoiding gum, taking peppermint supplements, and more. If these do not help, over-the-counter remedies are available. Gas trapped in the intestines can cause sharp pain, cramping, swelling, tightness, and even bloating. It can be so intense that it can resemble appendicitis, gallstones, or even heart disease. Most people pass gas up to 30

 times per day. Diarrhea, constipation, certain foods, and other factors can more cause gas to build up than usual. Here, we look at 20 ways to get rid of gas at home, and when to seek medical help. Many home remedies can help prevent or release trapped gas. Holding in gas can cause bloating, discomfort, and pain. The easiest way to avoid these symptoms is to let out the gas, if possible. If it seems the gas will not come out, consider the possibility of constipation. If it persists, worsens, or is very painful, a person may need medical treatment. A bowel movement can relieve gas. Passing stool will usually release any gas trapped in the intestines. Home remedies may help relieve constipation. If not, a pharmacist can advise on over-the counter options. Eating quickly or while moving can cause a person to take in air as well as food, leading to gas-related pain. Tips for slowing down eating include taking meals around a table with other people and chewing each bite of food 30 times. Breaking down food by chewing aids digestion and can prevent a number of related complaints, including bloating and indigestion. As a person chews gum

Some people take peppermint oil capsules to resolve issues like bloating, constipation, and trapped gas. Some research
Trusted Source
 suggests it may help, but more investigations are needed. Always choose enteric-coated capsules. Uncoated capsules may dissolve too quickly in the digestive tract, which can lead to heartburn. Peppermint inhibits the absorption of iron, so people should not take these capsules with iron supplements. They may not be suitable for people with anemia. Clove oil has traditionally been used to treat digestive complaints, including bloating, gas, and indigestion. There is not enough evidence
Trusted Source
 to show it is effective or safe for flatulence, but some research
Trusted Source
 suggests it may have ulcer-fighting properties. Consuming clove oil after meals can increase digestive enzymes and reduce the amount of gas in the intestines. Placing a hot water bottle or heating pad on the abdomen can help relieve gas pain and discomfort. The warmth relaxes the muscles in the gut, helping gas to move through the intestines. Heat can also reduce the sensation of pain. One case study
Trusted Source
 has suggested apple cider vinegar may help manage functional dyspepsia, symptoms of which include bloating. Add a tablespoon of the vinegar to a glass of water and drink it before meals to prevent gas pain and bloating. It is important to then rinse the mouth with water, as vinegar can erode tooth enamel. Activated charcoal pellets taken by mouth may help treat or prevent gas. The charcoal traps the gas and removes it as it leaves the body in the stool. It is best to speak with a doctor before taking activated charcoal and to follow their instructions. Probiotic supplements add beneficial bacteria to the gut. They are used to treat several digestive complaints, including infectious diarrhea. Some research
Trusted Source
 suggests that certain strains of probiotics can alleviate bloating, intestinal gas, abdominal pain, and other symptoms of IBS. However, more investigations are needed to establish which probiotics are most helpful. Moderate exercise — such as walking or doing yoga — may help

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/napping-and-alzheimers,The link between napping and Alzheimer’s,"There is some evidence that Alzheimer’s disease may increase napping, and that this, in turn, may worsen the symptoms of Alzheimer’s. This finding comes from a study of 1,401 older adults
Trusted Source
. It found that while napping generally increases with age, Alzheimer’s disease more than doubles the yearly increase in napping frequency or duration. Likewise, this increase in napping due to Alzheimer’s had associations with worsened thinking abilities 1 year later. Read on to learn more about the link between napping and Alzheimer’s disease, including whether it can be a symptom, whether napping can cause Alzheimer’s, and how much sleep people with Alzheimer’s should get. Excessive napping could be a sign of Alzheimer’s disease, if it occurs alongside other potential symptoms, such as memory loss. A 14-year study
Trusted Source
 with 1,401 participants found that all adults napped more with age, but as Alzheimer’s disease progressed, the duration and frequency of daytime naps increased by twice as much. Napping alone does not directly cause Alzheimer’s, but excessive napping could be a risk factor. This means it may elevate the risk a person will develop the condition but not guarantee it. Research from 2019
Trusted Source
 involving 2,751 older men discovered that participants who napped for 120 minutes or more per day had a 66% increased chance of developing cognitive impairment over the next 12 years than those who napped less than 30 minutes per day. Cognitive impairment can be a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us Naps may have neutral or even positive effects on a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, but it depends on their duration. As the above research
Trusted Source
 suggests, only longer naps had links with cognitive decline in older men. People who napped for less than 30 minutes did not have an increased risk of cognitive impairment. Similarly, a 2021 study
Trusted Source
 involving 389 older adults found that short naps could be beneficial for cognitive decline. Naps of less than 30 minutes reduced the risk over the course of 5 years. As with other studies, the authors of the 2021 study noted that longer naps had a negative effect on cognition, but it is unclear why. A 2020 review
Trusted Source
 reports that napping is more common in older adults than in younger adults. So, to an extent, it is typical for an older person to start napping more as they age. Older research from 2016
Trusted Source
 found that, in British adults of all ages, 28.6% of people took naps. The sample included individuals older and younger than age 65. However, another 2016 study
Trusted Source
 in China found 57.7% of older adults take naps after lunch for about an hour, which is considerably higher than the general population. If studies on napping and cognitive decline are accurate, it may be better
Trusted Source
 for people to take short naps rather than long ones, although more research is necessary to understand the relationship between nap duration and cognition. Most adults, including older adults, require approximately 7–9 hours
Trusted Source
 of sleep per night. This includes those with dementia. However, sleep schedules can be different for those with Alzheimer’s. It may cause a person to feel too sleepy in the daytime or too awake at night. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)
Trusted Source
 recommends the following to help people with Alzheimer’s sleep better: People who are concerned about excessive napping or daytime sleepiness that has lasted more than 2–3 weeks
Trusted Source
 should speak with a doctor. There are many reasons why a person could have this symptom. If they do not have signs of Alzheimer’s, they could be experiencing a sleep disorder, side effects from medication, or another underlying condition. A doctor will be able to help identify the root cause. If a person has a family history of Alzheimer’s, they may also benefit from speaking with a doctor about ways to lower the risk. There may be a bidirectional relationship
Trusted Source
 between napping and Alzheimer’s disease. This means that napping may be both a sign of the condition and a risk factor for worsening symptoms. However, researchers do not yet understand why this is. Some research indicates that naps could be beneficial for cognitive decline if they are short, lasting less than 30 minutes

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324591,What causes upper stomach pain?,"Several conditions can cause upper stomach or upper abdominal pain, including indigestion, gas, and gastritis. Treatment typically depends on the cause, but medications and diet changes may help. Stomach aches are a common complaint. While many issues responsible for upper stomach pain, such as gas or a stomach virus, are not cause for concern, others may require medical treatment. In this article, learn about ten possible causes of upper stomach pain, as well as treatment options and when to see a doctor. Gas occurs naturally in the intestines and digestive tract. When this gas accumulates, it can cause feelings of pressure, bloating, or fullness. Gas usually goes away without treatment once it passes. If it does not pass on its own, over-the-counter (OTC) medications can help. A person can also try eating more slowly to avoid swallowing air and prevent the gas from getting worse. Some people notice that certain foods are more likely to cause gas pain and reduce their intake. The medical term for indigestion is dyspepsia. It appears when there is too much acid in the stomach. It can cause a burning feeling in the upper stomach and sometimes in the mouth or throat. The pain may also feel like it stems from the chest. OTC medicines, such as antacids, are highly effective at managing temporary indigestion. Identifying the triggers, such as certain foods, can help a person make beneficial lifestyle changes. Sometimes, frequent indigestion is a sign of an underlying condition, such as a stomach ulcer or even cancer. If this symptom keeps coming back, speak with a doctor. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us Acute gastritis is a short-term condition that can cause pain, nausea, and vomiting. It often occurs
Trusted Source
 due to an infection. Causes of chronic or long-term gastritis include: Antibiotics can usually treat bacterial infections. When gastritis is chronic, diagnosing and treating the underlying cause can help. Gastroenteritis is the result of an infection that causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, in addition to stomach pain. Some people call gastroenteritis the stomach flu, but it is not actually a type of flu. For most people, gastroenteritis is not serious and the symptoms go away on their own within a few days. It is vital to avoid dehydration, so consider drinking something that restores electrolytes until the symptoms pass. Many muscles extend to the upper stomach. Pain from a mild muscle injury or spasms can cause temporary pain in the upper abdomen. Mild pain can get better with gentle massage and rest. Some people also find relief by using cold and hot packs. Appendicitis is an infection of the appendix. Without treatment, it can cause the appendix to rupture, and the condition can become life-threatening. People with symptoms need immediate medical attention. In the early stages of appendicitis, a person may notice a dull ache around their belly button, but this pain can radiate to the upper stomach. As the infection gets worse, the pain moves to the lower-right side. Gallstones are hard formations of cholesterol or bilirubin that can develop in the gallbladder. They do not always cause problems, but sometimes they block a biliary duct. A blockage from a gallstone can cause
Trusted Source
 intense pain in the upper-right stomach, as well as vomiting, fatigue, and exhaustion. In some cases, surgery is necessary to resolve problems from gallstones. For example, if gallstones block the cystic duct, then a doctor will remove the gallbladder. If gallstones block the common bile duct, then an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography may be necessary to help extract them. This involves inserting a thin camera and other implements down the throat to manipulate and resolve the blockage. The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder work together to support digestion. All three organs are in the upper-right side of the stomach. Sometimes, untreated gallstones block biliary ducts, causing pain in the liver or pancreas. Liver diseases, such as hepatitis, can cause liver pain. Pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas, may also cause pain. Occasionally, the cause could be cancer. The right treatment depends on the underlying cause. People with pancreatitis may need to stay in the hospital for fluids and observation. Liver diseases require medication, and a liver transplant can treat advanced liver disease. Small pouches called diverticula can appear in the intestines, especially in the colon
Trusted Source
. The presence of these pouches is known as diverticulosis. When these pouches become inflamed or infected, a person can develop intense abdominal pain. Inflammation of the diverticular is known as diverticulitis. The location of the pain depends on where the diverticula are. While diverticula are more common in the lower intestines, they can also appear in the upper intestines, causing pain in the upper stomach. Probiotics and a high fiber diet often help treat diverticulitis. Antibiotics have been traditionally used to treat diverticulitis, but emerging recommendations suggest supportive care only in uncomplicated diverticulitis If the infection worsens or does not go away, a doctor may perform surgery to remove the diverticula or a part of the intestines. A bowel obstruction blocks the intestines, making it difficult or impossible for anything to pass through. This can cause intense pain, constipation, and difficulty digesting and absorbing food. A bowel obstruction is a medical emergency, as the bowel can tear or become seriously infected. Medications, fluid, and pain relievers often help. In some cases, a surgeon may need to remove the blockage. If stomach pain does not get better after a few days, or it keeps coming back, people should speak with a doctor. Contact a doctor promptly if: Go to the emergency room if a person has: Seek immediate help for any infant with a fever, or persistent vomiting or diarrhea. Below are frequently asked questions about the causes of abdominal pain. Different causes of upper gastric pain produce different symptoms. However, this pain may feel like a dull ache, a burning sensation, or an intense expanding pressure pain. Seek immediate medical help if upper abdominal pain becomes severe, long lasting, or follows a direct injury to the area. If upper abdominal pain accompanies changes in stool color, fatigue, or severe dehydration, it is also essential to visit an emergency room. Treatments to relieve upper abdominal pain depend on the cause. For example, a person can often relieve the pain from indigestion with OTC antacids, while pain from viral infections requires hydration and rest. Abdominal pain can be a minor inconvenience or so intense that it makes functioning difficult. In many cases, especially those due to minor infections or gas, upper stomach pain will disappear in a few hours or days. It is important to pay attention to other symptoms before deciding whether medical attention is necessary.  Share this article Stomach spasms occur when muscles in the stomach or intestines contract.

However, there are a number of things you can do to lower your blood pressure naturally, even without medication. Here are 15 natural ways to treat high blood pressure. Exercise is one of the best things you can do to lower high blood pressure. Regular exercise helps make your heart stronger and more efficient at pumping blood, which lowers the pressure in your arteries. In fact, getting 150 minutes per week
Trusted Source
 of moderate exercise, such as walking, or 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise, such as running, can help lower blood pressure and improve heart health. Walking for just 30 minutes a day can help lower your blood pressure. Getting more exercise helps reduce it even further. Optum Perks is owned by RVO Health.

Many studies have linked high salt intake with high blood pressure and heart events, including stroke. If a person already has high blood pressure, it’s worth cutting back your sodium intake to see whether it makes a difference. Swap processed foods such as canned vegetables for fresh ingredients and try seasoning with herbs and spices rather than salt. Most guidelines for lowering blood pressure recommend reducing sodium intake. However, that recommendation might make the most sense for people who are sensitive to the effects of salt.

Trusted Source
 and increase the risk of several chronic health conditions. While some research has suggested that low to moderate amounts of alcohol consumption may protect the heart, those benefits may be offset by negative effects. In the United States, moderate alcohol consumption
Trusted Source
 is defined as no more than one drink per day for females and two drinks per day for males. If you drink more than that, it might be best to consider reducing your intake. Drinking any amount of alcohol may raise your blood pressure. Therefore, it’s best to moderate your intake. Potassium is an important mineral that helps your body get rid of sodium and eases pressure
Trusted Source
 on your blood vessels. Modern diets have increased most people’s sodium intake while decreasing potassium intake. To get a better balance of potassium and sodium in your diet, focus on eating fewer processed foods and more fresh, whole foods. Foods that are particularly high in potassium include: Eating fresh fruits and vegetables, which are rich in potassium, can help lower blood pressure. A person may want to discuss a potassium-rich diet with their doctor prior to starting. There are some blood pressure medicines that inherently increase the potassium in the body. If you pair these with a high-potassium diet, then the level may get too high, which can be dangerous. If you’ve ever downed a cup of coffee before you’ve had your blood pressure taken, you’ll know that caffeine causes an instant blood pressure boost. However, there’s not much evidence to suggest that drinking caffeine regularly can cause a lasting increase. In fact, people who drink caffeinated coffee or tea tend to have a lower risk
Trusted Source
 of heart disease, including high blood pressure, than those who do not drink it. Still, if you suspect you’re sensitive to the effects of caffeine, consider cutting back to see whether it lowers your blood pressure. Caffeine can cause a short-term spike in blood pressure. However, for many people, it does not cause a lasting increase. Stress is a key driver of high blood pressure. When you’re chronically stressed, your body is in a constant fight-or-flight mode. On a physical level, that means a faster
Trusted Source
 heart rate and constricted blood vessels. When you experience stress, you might also be more likely to engage in habits that can have negative effects on blood pressure, such as drinking alcohol and eating processed foods. Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure. Finding ways to manage stress can help. While eating massive amounts of dark chocolate probably won’t help your heart, small amounts may. That’s because dark chocolate and cocoa powder are rich in flavonoids, which are plant compounds that cause blood vessels to dilate. A 2017 review found that flavonoid-rich cocoa may reduce short-term blood pressure levels in healthy adults. For the strongest effects, use non-alkalized cocoa powder, which is especially high in flavonoids and has no added sugars. Dark chocolate and cocoa powder contain plant compounds that help relax blood vessels, which may lower blood pressure. In people who are overweight, losing weight can make a big difference to heart health. Studies show that in people with obesity losing just 5% of their body weight had significant benefits for blood pressure The effect can be even greater when weight loss is paired with other lifestyle changes, such as exercise. Losing weight can help your blood vessels do a better job of expanding and contracting, making it easier for the left ventricle of your heart to pump blood. Losing weight can significantly lower high blood pressure. This effect is even more pronounced when you exercise. Among the many reasons to quit smoking is that the habit is a strong risk factor for heart disease. Every puff of cigarette smoke causes a slight, temporary increase in blood pressure. The chemicals in tobacco are also known to damage blood vessels. However, studies haven’t found
Trusted Source
 a conclusive link between smoking and high blood pressure. This could be because people who smoke regularly develop a tolerance over time. Still, since both smoking and high blood pressure raise the risk of heart disease, quitting smoking can help lessen that risk. Though there’s conflicting research about smoking and high blood pressure, both increase the risk of heart disease. There’s a growing body of research showing a link between added sugar intake and high blood pressure. A 2020 research review found that increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was linked to higher blood pressure levels in children and adolescents. And it’s not just sugar — all refined carbs, such as the kind found in white flour, convert rapidly to sugar in your bloodstream and could cause problems. Some studies have shown that low carb diets may also help reduce blood pressure. In fact, one review of 12 studies showed that following a low carb diet could reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure, along with several other risk factors for heart disease. Consuming refined carbs, especially sugar, may raise blood pressure. Some studies have shown that low carb diets may help lower your blood pressure levels. Berries are full of more than just juicy flavor. They’re also packed with polyphenols, natural plant compounds that are good for your heart. Polyphenols can reduce the risk of stroke, heart conditions, and diabetes and improve blood pressure, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. Berries are rich in polyphenols, which can help lower blood pressure and the overall risk of heart disease. While these two behaviors could also fall under “stress reduction techniques,” meditation and deep breathing deserve specific mention. Both meditation and deep breathing may activate the parasympathetic nervous system. This system is engaged when the body relaxes, slowing the heart rate and lowering blood pressure. Studies show that different styles of meditation appear to have benefits for lowering blood pressure. Deep breathing techniques can also be quite effective. The authors of a 2021 review concluded that practicing diaphragmatic breathing, a deep breathing technique, twice daily for 4 weeks could lead to a reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Both meditation and deep breathing can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps slow your heart rate and lower blood pressure. People with low calcium intake often have high blood pressure. While calcium supplements haven’t been conclusively shown
Trusted Source
 to lower blood pressure, calcium-rich diets do seem to be linked to healthy blood pressure levels. For most adults, the calcium recommendation is 1,000 milligrams (mg) per day
Trusted Source
. However, some people, including older adults, may need more. In addition to dairy, you can get calcium from collard greens and other leafy greens, beans, sardines, and tofu. Here is a list of calcium-rich plant-based foods. Calcium-rich diets are linked to healthy blood pressure levels. You can get calcium by eating dark leafy greens, tofu, and dairy products. Some natural supplements may also help lower blood pressure. Here are some of the main supplements that have evidence behind them: Researchers have investigated several natural supplements for their ability to lower blood pressure. Magnesium is an important mineral that helps blood vessels relax. While magnesium deficiency is pretty rare, many people don’t get enough magnesium in their diet. Some studies have suggested that getting too little magnesium is linked with high blood pressure, but evidence from clinical studies has been less clear. Still, you can ensure that you’re meeting your needs by enjoying a variety of magnesium-rich foods
