https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/pennsylvania-baby-first-receive-personalized-gene-therapy-rcna207100,Baby born with rare disease is first to successfully receive custom gene editing,Health news,"A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is growing and thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him.
Researchers described the case in a new study, saying he’s among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.
“This is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments,” said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around one in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.
Knowing KJ’s odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.
“We were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something that’s never been done before,” Nicole said.
“We prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go,” her husband added.
Within six months, the team at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJ’s faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA “letter” — also known as a base — to the correct type. Known as “base editing,” it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.
It’s “very exciting” that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches.”
In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.
While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, “he slept through the entire thing,” recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at CHOP.
After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 ½-month old also takes less medication.
Considering his poor prognosis earlier, “any time we see even the smallest milestone that he’s meeting — like a little wave or rolling over — that’s a big moment for us,” his mother said.
Still, researchers caution that it’s only been a few months. They’ll need to watch him for years.
“We’re still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ,” Ahrens-Nicklas said. “But every day, he’s showing us signs that he’s growing and thriving.”
Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.
Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.
Musunuru said his team’s work — funded in part by the National Institutes of Health — showed that creating a custom treatment doesn’t have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was “not far off” from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.
“As we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in and I would expect the costs to come down,” Musunuru said.
Scientists also won’t have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research “sets the stage” for treating other rare conditions.
Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasn’t involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.",Unknown,"May 16, 2025, 2:44 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-outbreak-congressional-hearing-rcna206776,RFK Jr. clashes with lawmakers over vaccines and HHS mass layoffs,Health news,"WASHINGTON — Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. raised his voice several times during back-to-back congressional hearings Wednesday as Democratic lawmakers pressed him on his past statements about vaccines and his actions as health secretary to reduce funding to vaccine programs.
The hearings with House Appropriations and the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committees were held to discuss next year’s budget for HHS and the mass layoffs Kennedy oversaw at the agency. But the most contentious exchanges came during questions about vaccines.
Amid a number of measles outbreaks across the country, with the largest in West Texas, Kennedy has, on occasion, offered tepid support of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, but frequently undercuts that message with false claims about harms and a lack of long-term protection.
Kennedy largely maintained his stance Wednesday, telling Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., during the House Appropriations Committee hearing, that he would “probably” vaccinate his children against the measles today, but added, “My opinions about vaccines are irrelevant.”
“I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me,” Kennedy said.
In the afternoon, during a heated back-and-forth with Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Kennedy even seemed to suggest that the measles vaccines was unsafe — despite decades of evidence that the shot is safe and effective.
Murphy said that Kennedy had “consistently been undermining the measles vaccine.”
“You told the public that the vaccine wanes very quickly,” Murphy said. “You went on the Dr. Phil Show and said that the measles vaccine was never fully tested for safety. You said there’s fetal debris in the measles vaccine.”
When asked whether he would recommend the measles vaccine, Kennedy said, “I’m going to tell the truth about everything we know and we don’t know about vaccines.”
“I am not going to just tell people everything is safe and effective if I know that there are issues,” Kennedy added. “I need to respect people’s intelligence.” Kennedy’s children are vaccinated — a decision he has previously said he regrets.
In a separate exchange, Kennedy also claimed that only the Covid vaccine has been tested in a placebo-controlled trial.
Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, R-La., who hadn't been in the room when Kennedy made that assertion, later paused the hearing to correct the health secretary.
""For the record, that's not true. Rotavirus, measles and HPV vaccines have been [evaluated against a placebo] and some vaccines are tested against previous versions. So just for the record, to set that straight,"" Cassidy said.
The U.S. has had at least 1,023 cases of measles since the beginning of the year, according to NBC News data. Kennedy has pushed unproven remedies to fight the measles outbreak, including a steroid called budesonide, an antibiotic called clarithromycin and cod liver oil, a supplement high in vitamin A.
None are proven treatments for measles, experts say. High doses of vitamin A can cause nausea, vomiting and liver damage, especially in small children.
Public health experts also pushed back on Kennedy’s responses about vaccines.While Kennedy has no medical training, “the problem is that the top line of his job description is the nation’s chief health strategist,” Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said during a call with reporters Wednesday. “His job is to give people the best advice that he can.”
“I wonder what it would be like if the transportation secretary refused to answer a question about whether he would fly,” said Dr. Marissa Levine, a professor of public health practice at the University of South Florida said on the same call.
In his opening statements, Kennedy said that the HHS budget will reflect values of “compassion and responsibility” and “move beyond lip service to communities of color.”
And at the start of the Senate hearing Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., agreed with Kennedy's opening statement that the health care “system is structurally broken.”
Sanders asked if Kennedy and Trump would work with him on lowering the price of prescription drugs.
“If we are serious about that, let’s work together,” Sanders said, adding that the administration would need the help of Congress as Trump’s executive order to lower drug prices would likely be thrown out in court.
However, some lawmakers at both hearings were displeased with Kennedy for appearing unaware of basic details surrounding the HHS layoffs, including which divisions were eliminated and how the job cuts could impact ongoing clinical research.
Sanders said the NIH had taken a $2.7 billion cut, reversing over a decade of investment in medical research.
At one point, Kennedy couldn’t answer a question about cuts to funds for domestic violence survivors, saying he would “go back and check.”
“I’ve been sitting through this hearing all day today, and have noted that you’ve been unable, in most instances, to answer any specific questions relating to your agency,” said Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md.
When Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., asked about the childhood lead poisoning department that had been fired, Kennedy responded that they didn’t intend to get rid of that agency.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., asked how many jobs had been lost at the National Institutes of Health’s Clinical Center after a woman in her state said she faced delays in care for Stage 4 cancer.
Kennedy didn’t know, but later in the hearing said that his team had investigated the woman’s case, and discovered that she was ineligible for medical care through the NIH program.
Murray countered that her constituent was ""already enrolled in that clinical trial.""
""It’s not a question of eligibility. The issue, as I stated clearly, was the delay in care that she got. And what you stated, Secretary Kennedy, is not true,” Murray added.
The proposed HHS budget for fiscal year 2026 is about $93 billion, which is a 26% reduction from the current budget and includes funding cuts across most programs — a fact some lawmakers took issue with following the mass layoffs.
The hearings also come as House Republicans work on portions of a bill that propose making deep cuts to Medicaid and could leave millions of people uninsured.
Kennedy acknowledged that the legislation — as currently written — would cause people to lose their health insurance, following a question from Sanders.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Megan Lebowitz, Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Megan Lebowitz","May 15, 2025, 12:06 AM GMT+8 / Updated May 15, 2025, 7:38 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hhs-reinstates-hundreds-health-workers-rcna206856,HHS backtracks on firing hundreds of federal health workers,Health news,"The Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday reinstated 328 federal employees who faced terminations, including those involved in screening for “black lung” disease in coal miners and for health issues in 9/11 first responders.
The reinstated employees are part of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that is focused on preventing and responding to work-related illnesses.
The Trump administration previously aimed to eliminate the majority of NIOSH’s more than 1,300 employees, part of a broader plan to downsize the federal workforce.
Hundreds of NIOSH staffers received termination letters in April and May, though some were temporarily brought back to complete certain tasks, while their terminations remained in effect for June. HHS’ acting chief human capital officer, Tom Nagy, told some employees on Tuesday that their terminations were “hereby revoked,” according to a memo obtained by NBC News.
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed at a House budget hearing on Wednesday morning that 328 NIOSH employees had been called back. Roughly a third of them work at a facility in Morgantown, West Virginia, he said, and another third work in Cincinnati, where NIOSH operates two facilities.
“Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact,” a CDC spokesperson said in a statement. “The Trump Administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary’s leadership, NIOSH’s essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations. Ensuring the health and safety of our workforce remains a top priority for the Department.”
The Morgantown facility is home to NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division, which oversees a program that offers free X-rays to identify “black lung” in miners, or lung scarring caused by continuously inhaling coal dust. A U.S. district judge in West Virginia ordered HHS on Tuesday to restore the division and continue its health surveillance in coal miners. Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., said at the House budget hearing that 111 NIOSH employees in Morgantown were reinstated this week.
As part of the 328 reinstatements, HHS also brought back 15 employees at the World Trade Center Health Program, which covers treatment for cancer, asthma, post-traumatic stress disorder and other 9/11-related illnesses. The program’s fate seesawed over the past few months as the Trump administration fired and rehired staffers, making it harder to enroll members or confirm that their treatments were covered by federal funding.
“Our agency was asked to make very, very serious budget cuts that were going to be painful. Some of them should not have been made, and that was one that should not have, and I reversed it,” Kennedy said at a Senate budget hearing on Wednesday afternoon.
The program began processing enrollments again on May 1, according to an internal email shared with NBC News by Citizens for the Extension of the James Zadroga Act, an advocacy group that supports 9/11 responders and survivors. But the group’s executive director, Benjamin Chevat, is asking for more certainty.
“Given the history of the last few months ... we need to finally get a public assurance from the Secretary that this won’t just happen again and that the World Trade Center Health Program’s work will NOT be impacted any more,” Chevat said in an email.
In an agencywide email sent Tuesday afternoon and obtained by NBC News, NIOSH Director John Howard noted that some of the institute’s positions are still being eliminated.
“While we celebrate with those who received a recission letter from HHS, I am mindful that others did not,” Howard wrote. “I am hopeful that we can continue to make the case for reinstating everyone at NIOSH.”
Howard himself received a termination notice in early April, but returned to his post after bipartisan opposition from members of Congress regarding his dismissal. Fifty-six positions in the NIOSH director’s office were brought back Tuesday, according to an internal breakdown of the reinstatements viewed by NBC News.","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","May 15, 2025, 4:44 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/us-overdose-deaths-fell-27-last-year-remain-prepandemic-levels-rcna206765,U.S. overdose deaths fell 27% last year but remain above prepandemic levels,Health news,"There were 30,000 fewer U.S. drug overdose deaths in 2024 than the year before — the largest one-year decline ever recorded.
An estimated 80,000 people died from overdoses last year, according to provisional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released Wednesday. That’s down 27% from the 110,000 in 2023.
The CDC has been collecting comparable data for 45 years. The previous largest one-year drop was 4% in 2018, according to the agency’s National Center for Health Statistics.
All but two states saw declines last year — with some of the biggest in Ohio, West Virginia and other states that have been hard-hit in the nation’s decades-long overdose epidemic.
Experts say more research needs to be done to understand what drove the reduction, but they mention several possible factors. Among the most cited:
Still, annual overdose deaths are higher than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic. And some experts worry that the recent decline could be slowed or stopped by reductions in federal funding and the public health workforce, or a shift away from the strategies that seem to be working.
“Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal,” said Dr. Daniel Ciccarone, a drug policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco.
The provisional numbers are estimates of everyone who died of overdoses in the U.S., including noncitizens. That data is still being processed, and the final numbers can sometimes differ a bit. But it’s clear that there was a huge drop last year.
Experts note that there have been past moments when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again. That happened in 2018.
But there are reasons to be optimistic.
Naloxone has become more widely available, in part because of the introduction of over-the-counter versions that don’t require prescriptions.
Meanwhile, drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy chains and other businesses have settled lawsuits with state and local governments over the painkillers that were a main driver of overdose deaths in the past. The deals over the last decade or so have promised about $50 billion over time, with most of it required to be used to fight addiction.
Another settlement that would be among the largest, with members of the Sackler family who own OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma agreeing to pay up to $7 billion, could be approved this year.
The money, along with federal taxpayer funding, is going to a variety of programs, including supportive housing and harm reduction efforts, such as providing materials to test drugs for fentanyl, the biggest driver of overdoses now.
But what each state will do with that money is currently at issue. “States can either say, ‘We won, we can walk away’” in the wake of the declines or they can use the lawsuit money on naloxone and other efforts, said Regina LaBelle, a former acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. She now heads an addiction and public policy program at Georgetown University.
President Donald Trump’s administration views opioids as largely a law enforcement issue and as a reason to step up border security. That worries many public health leaders and advocates.
“We believe that taking a public health approach that seeks to support — not punish — people who use drugs is crucial to ending the overdose crisis,” said Dr. Tamara Olt, an Illinois woman whose 16-year-old son died of a heroin overdose in 2012. She is now executive director of Broken No Moore, an advocacy organization focused on substance use disorder.
Olt attributes recent declines to the growing availability of naloxone, work to make treatment available, and wider awareness of the problem.",Unknown,"May 14, 2025, 10:52 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/men-are-likely-die-broken-heart-syndrome-study-says-rcna206276,Why men are more likely to die of 'broken heart syndrome',Heart Health,"After a traumatic event like a divorce or the death of a loved one, some people may experience chest pain and shortness of breath — the result of a condition known colloquially as “broken heart syndrome.”
The syndrome, which doctors formally call takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is thought to be triggered by physical or emotional stress, which releases bursts of stress hormones like adrenaline that prevent people’s hearts from contracting properly. Most patients recover quickly, but a small minority suffer heart failure.
Although broken heart syndrome is most common in women, men die from it at more than twice the rate, according to a study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association.
The study analyzed data from nearly 200,000 adults in the U.S. who were hospitalized with broken heart syndrome from 2016 to 2020. Around 11% of men in that group died, compared with roughly 5% of women. The data reinforce previous studies that showed higher mortality rates in men.
“It seems to be a consistent finding that men don’t get takotsubo syndrome as much, but when they do, they do worse,” said Dr. Harmony Reynolds, director of the Sarah Ross Soter Center for Women’s Cardiovascular Research at NYU Langone Health, who wasn’t involved in the study.
The differences between men and women may have something to do with what’s triggering their conditions, cardiologists said. In men, broken heart syndrome is usually brought on by a physical stressor, such as a surgery or stroke. In women, the impetus is typically emotional, like losing a job or loved one.
“The people with emotional stressors actually do quite well,” said Dr. Ilan Wittstein, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who wasn’t part of the new research.
“Men may be more at risk for dying and having bad outcomes because they’re less susceptible to begin with,” he said. “So it takes a more dangerous trigger to precipitate the syndrome.""
The study’s lead author, Dr. Mohammad Movahed, said men may also have a harder time recovering from broken heart syndrome since they tend to have less social support to help them manage stress.
“If you have this stressful trigger, and the stress is not gone, that’s probably going to continue to harm the heart, or at least reduce the chance of recovery,” said Movahed, a cardiologist at the University of Arizona’s Sarver Heart Center.
But scientists still have lingering questions about what’s driving the syndrome, and why people die from it in rare cases.
“People are still looking for the holy grail of what causes this condition,” Wittstein said.
To confirm that a person has broken heart syndrome, doctors look for a few tell-tale signs. In a typical patient, part of their heart muscle is enlarged like a balloon, but they do not have a blocked artery, which is usually associated with heart attacks. Most patients can also point to a stressful event that predated the episode.
“The stresses that we endure in our daily lives, both physical and emotional, can in fact take tolls on us,” said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City. “You can feel the heartache in those moments, and there may literally be some heartache of sorts that’s accompanying that.”
But Wittstein said stress alone may not be enough to trigger broken heart syndrome.
“Some people just get a little frustrated at work, or somebody was out jogging a little too vigorously, or somebody just got stuck at a red light and was annoyed,” he said.
Reynolds said one of her patients has had the syndrome four times — each event precipitated by minor stomach bugs that caused her to vomit.
“She just really hates vomiting and will throw up and get” takotsubo cardiomyopathy, she said.
Wittstein now believes some patients may have an underlying susceptibility to broken heart syndrome. His research suggests that stress hormones can constrict tiny blood vessels surrounding the heart, which decrease blood flow. That would make certain people, such as those with high blood pressure or high cholesterol, more susceptible, he said.
Research has also shown that post-menopausal women are more prone to broken heart syndrome. Wittstein said that’s probably due, in part, to a decline in estrogen, which helps dilate the tiny blood vessels around the heart.
But Reynolds said there’s not enough research to know that for sure.
“It’s at some level obvious that sex hormones are implicated but trying to draw that link and really connect the dots, we have not gotten there yet,” she said.
Cardiologists said the mysteries surrounding broken heart syndrome can make it hard to prevent or treat.
Doctors occasionally prescribe medications used for other heart issues, such as beta blockers, or find ways to help people reduce stress, such as meditating and talking to a mental health professional.
“We have not found anything so far — any medication, any specific treatment — that can reduce complications or reduce mortality,” Movahed said.
His new study found that deaths from broken heart syndrome were relatively stable from 2016 to 2020 — a sign that the current treatment landscape isn’t sufficient, he said.
But Wittstein said the study relied on diagnostic codes given to hospitalized patients, which can sometimes miss the full picture of what contributed to a person’s death, especially if that person had a stroke or other neurological issue.
“I’m quite sure that some of these people recovered from the broken heart syndrome and then died of complications of something else,” he said.
Cardiologists said their best advice is to encourage patients to go to the hospital if they have chest pain or shortness of breath, and not to dismiss their symptoms as stress.","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","May 14, 2025, 5:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-fluoride-pull-drops-tablets-prescription-supplements-rcna206514,FDA moves to take prescription fluoride drops and tablets for kids off the market,Health news,"The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday announced it will begin the process of pulling prescription fluoride drops and tablets for children off the market. The supplements are usually given to kids at high risk for cavities.
The federal government and some state legislatures are increasingly drawing attention to what they claim are the risks associated with fluoride, a mineral that’s been used for decades in community water systems, toothpastes and mouth rinses to prevent tooth decay.
Dentists fiercely contest the notion that the harms of fluoride outweigh the benefits.
“The only side effect that we know of from using fluoride is dental fluorosis,” a cosmetic issue that leads to white or, in extreme cases, brown marks on teeth, said Margherita Fontana, professor and chair of the department of cariology, restorative sciences and endodontics at the University of Michigan.
FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a news release that he's instructing the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research “to evaluate the evidence regarding the risks of systemic fluoride exposure from FDA-regulated pediatric ingestible fluoride prescription drug products to better inform parents and the medical community on this emerging area.”
The news release suggested that ingested fluoride can alter a child’s gut microbiome and cause weight gain, thyroid disorders and “possibly decreased IQ.”
“The best way to prevent cavities in children is by avoiding excessive sugar intake and good dental hygiene,” Makary said.
Experts agree that the U.S. diet has far too much sugar, which is linked to chronic diseases like obesity and type 2 diabetes.
“Those are the same diets that will completely destroy our teeth. But the reason our teeth have been able to succeed in this modern diet is because of the fluoride products that we have,” Fontana said. “If we start removing them, we’re going to be where our grandparents or great-grandparents were, with dentures at young ages.”
The FDA said the evaluation should be completed by Oct. 31.
The new action goes after tablets and drops that contain fluoride. According to the American Dental Association, pediatric dentists can prescribe fluoride supplements to kids living in areas with low fluoride levels in drinking water.
Dr. Meg Lochary, a pediatric dentist in Union County, North Carolina, said she’s been prescribing more of the drops and tablets since county commissioners voted to stop adding fluoride to its water supply last year.
“This is really going to hamper our goal of providing kids with fluoride,” Lochary said. “It’s ridiculous, and it takes away the choice of parents to allow their children to have better dental health. It doesn’t make scientific sense.”
“Unlike toothpaste with fluoride or fluoride rinses, these products are swallowed and ingested by infants and toddlers,” the statement said.
The press release included links to several studies to back up its assertions about fluoride. None looked at the effects of fluoride tablets or drops.
One reviewed 49 studies of water fluoridation: 42 in animals, 4  in humans and 3 in the lab. It concluded that, in humans, extremely high levels could possibly be harmful to the microbiome, while low levels of fluoride — less than 2 milligrams per liter — had no negative effect. Optimal water fluoridation in the U.S. is 0.7 mg/L.
Another concluded that research on fluoride’s possible effect on the microbiome is “still in its early days, and studies investigating the impact of fluoride on the human microbiome have only begun to appear in the literature.”
A third review of research, published this year in JAMA Pediatrics, found a link between higher fluoride exposure and lower children’s IQ scores. But the studies included in the analysis were based in countries with much higher fluoride levels than the U.S. A majority of the studies were also deemed to be of poor quality.
The body of evidence linking fluoride to issues related to the microbiome or brain is “very, very poor,” Fontana said. “Rigorous studies on this don’t exist.”
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previously referred to fluoride as “industrial waste” on the social media platform X and said on MSNBC that the faster the mineral goes away, the better.
“Ending the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue,” Kennedy said in Tuesday’s announcement.","Erika Edwards, Erika Edwards","May 14, 2025, 12:11 AM GMT+8 / Updated May 14, 2025, 10:58 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/proposed-medicaid-cuts-republicans-leave-patients-doctors-fearing-wors-rcna206597,'Thicket of red tape' for Medicaid in GOP bill sparks fears of coverage losses,Health news,"Melannie Bachman, 39, of Charleston, South Carolina, is among the patients closely watching the sweeping Republican bill to overhaul Medicaid that’s been brought to the House. She was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer — an aggressive and difficult-to-treat form of the disease — in 2021. She said she had to apply for Medicaid multiple times and wasn’t approved until four months later, which meant she had to pay for multiple screenings while waiting.
Bachman no longer qualifies for Medicaid because she's cancer-free. But she worries that the proposed revisions could make it harder for her or others in similar situations to get covered again, or even cause them to give up on the process altogether.
Bachman is still within five years of her diagnosis, and her doctors tell her that it’s essential for her to continue being monitored in case the cancer returns.
“It’s one of the hardest parts of this journey, besides fighting for your life,” Bachman said of applying for Medicaid. “The application process, the figuring how and when to find coverage, being someone who had no coverage at all.”
As House Republicans on Tuesday haggled over parts of a bill that proposes deep cuts and new restrictions on Medicaid, patients and doctors who rely on the program said they’re bracing for the worst, including overwhelming red tape and administrative hurdles that could prevent many people from getting the care they need.
The legislation, introduced Sunday by the Energy and Commerce Committee, proposes a slew of changes to the health program, such as work requirements, patient co-pays for doctor visits, tougher eligibility checks and citizenship verification. The panel began marking it up Tuesday and hopes to send it to the full House this week, with the goal of passing the entire bill by Memorial Day.
The legislation could lead to 8.6 million people losing Medicaid coverage, according to a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. More than 70 million people currently get health coverage through the program.
The changes would make some people ineligible for coverage due to work requirements. Certain groups, such as the disabled, pregnant women and people who are in prison or rehabilitation centers, would be exempt.
Others — particularly those covered under the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion — could be forced to drop out as they face higher fees and additional paperwork to maintain their coverage.
Republicans say they’re fine with the new rules — including Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has publicly and repeatedly warned his party not to slash Medicaid benefits.
“Based on the work requirement, anti-fraud provisions — there’s going to be coverage losses associated with that, which I’m OK with,” Hawley told NBC News. Republicans are proposing cutting spending to states that allow immigrants without proof of citizenship to be on Medicaid.
“But for people who are otherwise qualified, who are able bodied and are working and need Medicaid because they cannot otherwise afford health insurance, I just am opposed to cutting these people’s benefits,” he said.
Asked if he worries the red tape could end up removing rightful Medicaid recipients from coverage, Hawley downplayed the prospect saying his priority is “just no benefit cuts.”
The Medicaid provisions are expected to save the government over $715 billion over 10 years, which Republicans intend to use to pay for an extension of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts before they expire at the end of this year.
Democrats argue the added bureaucracy is a feature — not a bug — of the GOP plan.
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking member of the Finance Committee that oversees Medicaid, said Republicans want to throw people off the program by putting recipients through “bureaucratic water torture” that many won’t be able to navigate.
“This whole thicket of red tape bureaucracy is being deployed in order to keep people who are eligible from getting covered,” Wyden said in an interview. “It’d be one thing if they had found a pattern of fraud and abuse, and they were trying to root it out. But what they’re doing is they are targeting eligible people who are eligible for Medicaid now.”
“I think it’s really a despicable thing,” he said.
The bill, as it stood before Tuesday’s markup, did leave out some of the more controversial ideas Republican leaders had discussed — including limits on how much Medicaid can spend per person and making states pay more for expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, for which the federal government currently pays 90%.
Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the proposed changes to eligibility, even the possibility of additional paperwork, will cause people to fall through the cracks and lose their coverage.
“You don’t need to be a doctor to realize that this is dangerous,” Gaffney said. “If you’re facing multiple medical problems, the last thing you need to do is try to get through a lot of red tape and jump through hoops and bureaucracy, and that’s exactly what this legislation would do.”
People who want to work may not be able to because of health issues, lack of childcare or limited transportation options.
When people lose coverage, they typically have no other options, Gaffney said. He noted that in the early 2000s, when Tennessee implemented reforms to rein in Medicaid costs, thousands of people lost coverage.
“Most people who lost Medicaid went uninsured,” he said. “The reality is Medicaid covers some of the lowest-income folks in the nation, and when they lose coverage, they’re probably not going to be able to afford it.”
Likewise, in Georgia, following the implementation of Medicaid work requirements in 2023, fewer people chose to enroll, said Robin Rudowitz, director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a health policy research group.
“Basically reporting and having to document that you’re working, or even if you’re a group that might be exempt from the requirements, sometimes it’s just hard to document that you might be in one of those groups,” she said.
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said the new rules are part of a “cruel” and “craven” plot.
“Any added bureaucracy will take people who are justifiably using these services and make it more difficult for them to get on, which will result in loss of coverage — again, for Americans who have sicknesses and illnesses,” Booker said.
Rudowitz said the bill proposes a provision that would require patient co-pays for people with incomes up to 130% to 138% of the federal poverty level— around $35,000 a year for a family of three. There’s also a provision, she said, that would reduce the amount the federal government gives states if they provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
If the bill clears the House, it goes to the Senate, where some Republicans are eying changes.
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who sits on the Finance Committee, said Republicans must take a close look at the new Medicaid rules and coverage impacts.
“That’s what we’re going through now. A lot of that has to do with the semi-annual versus annual affirmation, that sort of stuff. We got a lot of mechanics to work out,” said Tillis, who faces re-election next year in a purple state.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Sahil Kapur, Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Sahil Kapur","May 14, 2025, 7:07 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-executive-order-prescription-drugs-price-match-rcna206218,Trump signs executive order that aims to slash drug prices by at least 50%,Health news,"President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order Monday that aims to cut prescription drug costs in the U.S. by aligning what the government pays for certain medications to the prices paid in other countries.
The order, experts say, is a reimagined and far more aggressive version of Trump’s policy during his first term to cut drug costs, which failed to take effect after a federal judge blocked it.
Like the original policy, health policy experts expect it will meet significant pushback from the drug industry.
The new order directs Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to come up with price-cutting goals within 30 days, White House officials said on a call Monday. The move will kick off a round of negotiations between Kennedy and the drug industry.
Should talks stall, Kennedy will move to enforce the “most favored nation” pricing model, capping the U.S. prices at the lowest rates paid by other wealthy nations.
Most notably, officials said the policy will not be limited to certain drugs under Medicare, as it was in original version, but will also target medications covered by Medicaid and private insurance.
“I’m doing this for the American people,” Trump said at the White House discussing the executive order. “I’m doing this against the most powerful lobby in the world probably, the drug lobby.”
The administration hasn’t singled out a specific class of drugs for price cuts, but officials said it’s fair to expect that GLP-1s — a class of drugs that includes Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound — will be included among them. Last month, the administration rejected a Biden-era proposal for Medicare to cover weight loss drugs. The move would have saved patients money but cost the government about $25 billion over 10 years.
The Food and Drug Administration will also consider expanding the importation of prescription drugs from countries beyond Canada, where prices are often cheaper than in the U.S, officials said, and the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission will be directed to act against “anti-competitive” actions by drugmakers that they say keep drug prices high.
Prescription drug prices are notoriously high in the U.S. Although the country makes up less than 5% of the global population, it accounts for nearly three-quarters of global pharmaceutical profits, officials said Monday. According to the Rand Corporation, a public policy think tank, Americans pay up to 10 times more for medications than people in other similarly wealthy nations.
The U.S. spends $1,126 per capita on drugs, a fifth of what Britain spends, Kennedy said, adding that the U.S. is no longer “subsidizing” other countries. Americans often pay more than other nations, helping drugmakers recoup on research and development costs.
While experts backed Trump’s approach, they questioned how the administration would legally pursue price reductions for drugs under private insurance. They also worried about its ability to withstand legal pushback from the drug industry.
“If this touches all drugs for all people, it’s far more ambitious, but the ripple effects are far more uncertain,” said Tricia Neuman, executive director for the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “I would expect the drug industry to throw every legal argument at this proposal.”
Arthur Caplan, the head of the medical ethics division at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, said the administration may need to set more realistic expectations for what it can achieve.
In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump claimed that prescription drug costs would be reduced “almost immediately” by 30% to 80% and that the U.S. “will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.”
In a follow-up post Monday, Trump said drug prices would be cut by 59%. At the White House later Monday, Trump claimed drug prices would be reduced by 50% to 90%.
Caplan said immediate relief would be great — but argued it’s impossible for the U.S. to achieve the lowest prices in the world.
“We are not going to get the price paid by South Africa, Peru, Egypt, Bolivia and Laos,” Caplan said. “Drug companies usually give whopping discounts to very poor countries on humanitarian grounds they won’t give rich countries. The prices paid in the poorest nations have no chance of being the price paid by the Trump administration.”
Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, worried the policy might harm doctors and pharmacies if the price cuts were immediate.
“For retail pharmacies or clinician administered drugs, they buy their drugs ahead of time to stock the shelves or have them available to treat patients,” she said. “What the pharmacy or clinic paid to acquire their drugs is likely higher than the proposed new price, which means they would lose money when those drugs were filled.”
On Monday’s call, an official appeared to clarify Trump’s Sunday remarks, saying that drugmakers are expected to be “coming to the table very soon” and that the administration anticipates “action” and “relief very soon.”
Officials didn’t say how this would affect the ongoing Medicare drug pricing negotiations, a policy signed into law by President Joe Biden through the Inflation Reduction Act.
In the final days of the Biden administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the next round of drugs up for price negotiations. The first round of negotiations is estimated to save Medicare $6 billion in 2026, when the prices go into effect.
But officials argued that the lower prices achieved through the Biden administration were “inadequate” and that Trump’s new policy would achieve more aggressive price cuts.
“We’ll be taking action to go beyond what was achieved under the Inflation Reduction Act,” an official said.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a drug industry trade group that filed a lawsuit against Trump’s original policy, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement last week, Alex Schriver, a spokesperson for the group, said the Trump administration should instead focus on so-called pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to address high drug costs.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","May 12, 2025, 10:22 PM GMT+8 / Updated May 12, 2025, 11:10 PM GMT+8"

Clinical trial participants who took tirzepatide, the drug sold as Zepbound, lost an average of 50 pounds (22.8 kilograms) over 72 weeks, while those who took semaglutide, or Wegovy, lost about 33 pounds (15 kilograms). That’s according to the study funded by Lilly, which was published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Both drugs are part of a new class of medications that work by mimicking hormones in the gut and brain that regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. But tirzepatide targets two such hormones, known as GLP-1 and GIP, while semaglutide targets GLP-1 alone, said Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.
“Two drugs together can produce better weight loss,” said Aronne, who led the study and presented the findings Sunday at the European Congress on Obesity in Spain.
While tirzepatide won out in what Aronne said many view as “a drag race of efficacy,” both are important tools for treating obesity, which affects about 40% of American adults.
“The point of these medications is to improve health,” he said. “The majority of people won’t need the most effective medication.”
The trial included 751 people from across the U.S. who were overweight or had obesity and at least one other weight-related health problem, but not diabetes. Participants received weekly injections of the highest tolerated doses of Zepbound, either 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, or Wegovy, 1.7 milligrams or 2.4 milligrams.
By the end of the trial, those who took Zepbound lost about 20% of their body weight on average, compared with a nearly 14% loss for those who took Wegovy. The tirzepatide group trimmed about 7 inches (17.8 centimeters) from their waist circumference, compared to about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) with semaglutide. In addition, nearly 32% of people taking Zepbound lost at least a quarter of their body weight, compared to about 16% of those taking Wegovy, the study found.
Weight loss was about 6% lower in men than in women in both groups, the authors noted. As participants in both groups lost more weight, they saw improvements in health markers such as blood pressure, blood fat and blood sugar levels.
More than three-quarters of patients taking both drugs reported at least one side effect, mostly mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, constipation, diarrhea and vomiting. About 6% of participants taking Zepbound left the trial because of adverse events, compared with 8% of those taking semaglutide.
The GLP-1 drugs have become increasingly popular, with at least 1 in 8 U.S. adults reporting their use, according to a 2024 survey by KFF, a independent health policy research organization. Zepbound generated $4.9 billion in global sales last year. Wegovy brought in nearly $8.8 billion (58.2 billlion Danish kroner).
Access and affordability have limited wider use of the drugs. Tirzepatide and semaglutide were removed recently from a list of drug shortages by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Both manufacturers recently released programs that cut costs to about $500 per month or less, depending on the dose.
Other factors can affect access. This week, CVS Health said Wegovy will become the preferred option on its standard formulary, or list of covered drugs, as of July 1. Zepbound will be excluded.
It’s important to have a range of drugs to treat a disease as widespread as obesity in the U.S., said Dr. Angela Fitch, chief medical officer of knownwell, an obesity care company. Wegovy has been found to cut the risk of serious heart problems by 20%, she noted. A drug may work well for one patient, but not for others.",Unknown,"May 12, 2025, 7:19 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-new-food-colors-minerals-algae-flower-petals-rfkjr-rcna205947,"FDA will allow new color additives made from minerals, algae and flower petals",Health news,"U.S. regulators said Friday that they would allow three new color additives made from natural sources to be used in the nation’s food supply.
It comes after health officials pledged a sweeping phase-out of petroleum-based dyes widely used in foods from cereals to sports drinks to boost health — though action is still pending.
The Food and Drug Administration said it is granting petitions to allow galdieria extract blue, a blue color derived from algae; calcium phosphate, a white color derived from a naturally occurring mineral; and butterfly pea flower extract, a blue color made from dried flower petals.
The colors will be approved for use in a range of foods from fruit drinks and yogurt to pretzels, ready-to-eat chicken and candies. The move “will expand the palette of available colors from natural sources for manufacturers to safely use in food,” FDA officials said in a statement.
Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating the dyes can cause neurobehavioral problems for some children, including hyperactivity and attention issues. The FDA has maintained for decades that the approved dyes are safe and that “the totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.”
The new color approvals include a 2021 petition from the French company Fermentalg to allow galdieria extract blue; a 2023 petition from Innophos Inc. of Cranbury, New Jersey, to allow calcium phosphate; and a 2024 petition from Sensient Colors LLC of St. Louis, Missouri, to allow butterfly pea flower extract.
The approvals are set to be published in the federal register on May 12 and would take effect in June.
In April, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary announced that they would take steps to eliminate synthetic food dyes in the U.S. food supply by the end of 2026, largely through voluntary efforts from the food industry. The officials also said they would revoke authorization for two little-used artificial dyes, Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B, and accelerate the timeline to remove Red 3, a food color banned in January because of a link to cancer in laboratory rats.",Unknown,"May 10, 2025, 4:48 AM GMT+8"

Texas still accounts for the vast majority of cases in the U.S., with 709 confirmed as of Friday in an outbreak that also spread measles to New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. Two unvaccinated elementary school-aged children died from measles-related illnesses in the epicenter in West Texas, and an adult in New Mexico who was not vaccinated died of a measles-related illness.
Other states with active outbreaks — which the CDC defines as three or more related cases — include Indiana, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
North America has two other ongoing outbreaks, all of which are the same measles strain. One outbreak in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 1,440 cases from mid-October through May 6, up 197 cases in a week. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 1,041 measles cases and one death as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.
Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.
As the virus takes hold in U.S. communities with low vaccination rates, health experts fear that spread could stretch on for a year. Here’s what else you need to know about measles in the U.S.
There are a total of 709 cases across 29 counties, most of them in West Texas, state health officials said Friday. The state confirmed only seven more cases since its update Tuesday.
The state also added one hospitalization to its count, for a total of 92 throughout the outbreak.
State health officials estimated about 1% of cases — fewer than 10 — are actively infectious. Fifty-seven percent of Texas’ cases are in Gaines County, population 22,892, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 403 cases since late January — just over 1.7% of the county’s residents.
The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.
New Mexico added four cases Friday for 71 total. Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state’s cases are in Lea County. Three are in Eddy County, two in Doña Ana County and one in Chaves County. Curry County logged its first case this week.
An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness March 6. The person did not seek medical care.
Oklahoma held steady with a total of 14 confirmed and three probable cases as of Friday.
The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases, but Cleveland, Oklahoma and Sequoyah counties have had public exposures in the past couple of months.
Kansas has a total of 48 cases across eight counties in the southwestern part of the state, with one hospitalization. Most of the cases are in Gray, Haskell and Stevens counties.
Indiana has eight cases, all of them in Allen County in the northeast part of the state. The cases have no known link to other outbreaks, the Allen County Department of Health has said.
Michigan has nine confirmed cases of measles, with an outbreak of four connected cases in Montcalm County in the western part of the state that state health officials say is tied to the Ontario outbreak.
Montana added three new measles cases in the last two weeks, bringing the total to eight. The state’s outbreak started in mid-April in southwestern Gallatin County — Montana’s first measles cases in 35 years. Health officials didn’t say whether the cases are linked to other outbreaks in North America.
North Dakota has nine cases of measles as of Tuesday. The state hadn’t seen measles since 2011, health officials said.
All are in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. The state health department says three of the confirmed cases are linked to the first case — an unvaccinated child who health officials believe got it from an out-of-state visitor.
The other five cases were people who were not vaccinated and did not have contact with the other cases, causing concern about community transmission. The state health department said four people diagnosed with measles attended classes while infectious at a Williston elementary school, middle school and high school.
Ohio has 34 measles cases and one hospitalization, according to the Ohio Department of Health. That count includes only Ohio residents.
The state has two outbreaks: Ashtabula County near Cleveland has 16 cases, and Knox County in east-central Ohio has 20 — 14 among Ohio residents and the rest among visitors.
Allen, Cuyahoga, Holmes and Defiance counties have one case each.
Pennsylvania has 15 cases overall in 2025 as of Friday, including international travel-related cases in Montgomery County and one in Philadelphia.
There were eight measles cases in Erie County in far northwest Pennsylvania in late April; the county declared an outbreak in mid-April.
Tennessee had six measles cases as of early May. Health department spokesman Bill Christian said all cases are the middle part of the state, and that “at least three of these cases are linked to each other” but declined to specify further. The state also did not say whether the cases were linked to other outbreaks or when Tennessee’s outbreak started.
Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.
The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.
Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.
People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have “presumptive immunity.”
Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — due to “herd immunity.” But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.
Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.
The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.
Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.",Unknown,"May 10, 2025, 4:16 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-stalls-posting-food-safety-warning-letters-staff-cuts-rcna204879,FDA stalls in posting food safety warning letters amid staff cuts,EXCLUSIVE,"A seafood company failed to follow federal safety rules to prevent potential botulism contamination. A business was hawking dietary supplements with the misleading claim that they’d cure, treat or prevent disease. A fresh sprouts producer didn’t take adequate precautions against contamination.
The Food and Drug Administration laid out these inspection findings in warning letters, accusing the companies of committing “significant violations” of federal laws, according to an FDA staff member who described the letters to NBC News.
But the public doesn’t know about any of this, after the federal workers responsible for reviewing the food safety letters before they’re posted online were fired, the current FDA staff member and a former FDA employee told NBC News.
That review process ground to a halt after the Trump administration’s mass layoffs of federal health workers in early April, which gutted the teams responsible for reviewing public records and redacting any confidential information, according to the current and former FDA employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to share internal details.
Since then, the publication of more than a dozen food safety warning letters has been stalled, they said.
The FDA responded to questions with a statement that didn’t address the publication of warning letters. The agency “remains fully committed to transparency, accountability, and the protection of public health,” the statement said. The FDA added that it is continuing to conduct inspections, enforcement and oversight “to ensure consumer safety.”

The FDA often issues warning letters after initially flagging its concerns to a company and determining the company’s response was inadequate. The agency typically gives the company a few weeks to respond to the letter, and, after an internal review, the letters are publicly posted on the FDA website.
The letters are one of the agency’s major enforcement tools — and one of the few windows into a company’s food safety record available to the public. The letters can make headlines and are especially important in alerting retailers to serious food safety violations that could put the public at risk, safety advocates said.
“It’s an indication that something has gone wrong — it’s not just a normal part of the inspection process. You get a warning letter when there’s a real problem,” said Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group. “There are people you’d expect to use this information to protect the public.”
The FDA also uses warning letters to pressure companies to take action after the agency’s initial attempts have failed. Last June, for instance, the FDA sent a warning letter to Dollar Tree, the discount retail chain, for failing to pull lead-tainted applesauce pouches from its shelves, even after a national recall of the product. (Dollar Tree denied this, saying in a statement that it “took immediate action” on the recall and “will continue to cooperate with FDA.”)
In recent days, the FDA has rehired some of the staff who worked on public records at the agency, according to two former employees. The agency has also continued to publish warning letters related to drugs and tobacco products, as well as one related to imported food that was issued by a separate FDA division that was spared from deep staff cuts, the former workers said.
But even before the mass layoffs in April, staffers said there was a backlog in posting warning letters related to food safety.
Since the week of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, no warning letters to U.S. food manufacturers have been posted publicly, FDA records show.","Suzy Khimm, Suzy Khimm","May 10, 2025, 2:48 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/fda-approves-home-hpv-test-screen-cervical-cancer-rcna205713,FDA approves at-home HPV test to screen for cervical cancer,Women's Health,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the first at-home test to screen for cervical cancer, Teal Health, which makes the test kit, said.
Currently, cervical cancer screening is done in a doctor’s office during a pelvic exam, a process some women find uncomfortable and even painful.
Some patients don’t get screened for cervical cancer because they don’t want a pelvic exam, said Dr. Emeline Aviki, a gynecologic-oncologist at NYU Langone Health.
“It’s not a fun exam and it’s the easiest thing to cancel,” said Aviki, who worked on some of the early studies to validate the new test.
Cervical cancer is considered highly preventable, thanks to screenings and the HPV vaccine. Rates of the disease have plummeted since the 1970s, according to a 2025 report from the American Cancer Society, though they have begun to level off in recent years. The report estimated that this year, 13,360 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer and about 4,320 women will die.
However, the number of women getting screened has fallen since the mid-2000s. A 2022 study found that 23% of women were behind on their cervical cancer screening in 2019, up from 14% in 2005. Up to half of women diagnosed with cervical cancer in the U.S. weren’t up to date on their screenings, the American Cancer Society says.
“Cervical cancer screening in general is something that saves lives,” said Dr. Jessica Kiley, chief of general obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago.
The new test, called the Teal Wand, detects HPV using a vaginal swab, making it less invasive than a pap smear, in which the gynecologist inserts a speculum and collects samples of cells from the cervix.
HPV, or human papillomavirus, is a sexually transmitted infection and the leading cause of cervical cancer. There’s no treatment for HPV, but most cases clear on their own. Several strains, however, are linked to cervical cancer.
The Teal Wand is not the first HPV test that uses a vaginal sample: Last year, the FDA approved a similar swab, also performed by patients themselves, that’s collected in a doctor’s office.
“What’s different about this new indication is that this sample can be collected at home and not in a medical setting,” said Dr. George Sawaya, a gynecologist at UCSF Health. “You have to logically believe that would increase access if people’s main barrier was getting to a medical setting.”
A recent report in JAMA Network Open found that women in rural areas are 25% more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer and 42% more likely to die from the disease than women who live in cities, a trend that likely reflects lower access to screenings and care in rural parts of the country.
Patients will be able to order the test kit after a telehealth appointment with a doctor and then collect the sample themselves at home. For now, the product will have to be prescribed by one of Teal Health’s virtual providers, but the company plans to make it available for other doctors to order as well. The swab is then mailed to a lab for analysis.
Teal Health said if the result is positive, its providers will help arrange for further care. Following a positive test, women may need additional tests in a doctor’s office.
Still, experts want more information on the cost of the test, and whether patients will follow up if they need more testing.
“Those are some of the uncertainties around it,” Sawaya said.
Kara Egan, the CEO of Teal Health, did not say how much the test would cost.
However, she said, because cervical cancer screening is endorsed by a government group called the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the company is anticipating the test will be covered by insurance and expects to know definitively in the coming months. In December, the task force endorsed in-office self-swabs in a draft recommendation.","Akshay Syal, M.D., Akshay Syal, M.D.","May 9, 2025, 9:54 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trumps-medicare-drug-price-plan-expected-push-drugmakers-charge-prices-rcna205601,Trump's drug price plan expected to push drugmakers to charge same as other countries,Health news,"President Donald Trump will announce a plan to lower U.S. prescription drug costs by tying the amount the government pays for some medications to prices paid abroad, according to two administration officials familiar with the matter — a strategy he pursued unsuccessfully during his first term.
Trump is expected to sign an executive order early next week that will instruct federal health officials to adopt a “most favored nation” pricing model for certain drugs covered by Medicare, meaning the U.S. would pay no more than the lowest prices paid by other wealthy countries, said the officials, who was granted anonymity because they weren’t authorized to describe internal deliberations.
The plan to sign the executive order was first reported by Politico.
Prescription drug prices in the United States are notoriously higher than in other countries — up to 10 times more than in other nations of similar size and wealth, according to the Rand Corporation, a public policy think tank.
Trump initially tried to implement this policy in 2020 as part of a broader effort by his administration to cut U.S. drug costs, but it was halted by a federal judge following a lawsuit from the drug industry.
The plan would have linked the prices of Medicare Part B drugs — which are medications administered in a health care facility, such as chemotherapy drugs — to what countries like Canada, Germany and the U.K. pay.
The administration at the time estimated it would save U.S. taxpayers more than $85 billion over seven years.
It’s unclear if Trump’s new plan will once again target only Medicare Part B drugs or include other medications covered under the program.
One of the officials said the proposal hasn’t been finalized and could still change. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Health policy experts supported Trump’s approach, arguing that drug companies should be forced to match the prices they give other countries.
“I don’t see an excuse for why prices should be all over the place, and we wind up getting charged the most,” said Arthur Caplan, the head of the medical ethics division at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. “If this can do something about what is clearly an emergency, which is the ever-increasing cost of drugs as one major source of inflation, I’m for it.”
However, experts also doubted the new policy would withstand pushback from the drug industry.
“I am unsure the new executive order will fare any better,” said Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.
Tricia Neuman, executive director for the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health policy research group, said it would likely have public support if implemented.
More than 3 in 4 adults in the U.S. say the cost of medications is unaffordable, according to a KFF poll.
“The idea of making sure the U.S. pays no more than similar countries polls well, but it’s controversial, and will likely face fierce opposition from the pharmaceutical industry,” Neuman said.
In a statement, Alex Schriver, a spokesperson for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry trade group that filed the lawsuit against Trump’s original drug pricing rule, said the Trump administration should instead focus on so-called pharmacy benefit managers to address high drug costs.
PBMs, also known as middlemen, work with insurance companies to negotiate discounted prices from drug companies in exchange for including the drugs in their coverage. In theory, PBMs are supposed to save patients money, but they’ve been the target of U.S. lawmakers following government findings accusing them of inflating the price of drugs.
Caplan noted that even if the drug industry pushes back on the executive order, the administration still has another tool at its disposal: Medicare drug pricing negotiations.
The provision, signed into law by President Joe Biden through the Inflation Reduction Act, allows Medicare to negotiate prices on the costliest medications.
The first round of negotiations is estimated to save Medicare $6 billion in 2026, when the prices go into effect.
In the final days of the Biden administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the next round of drugs up for price negotiations. It’s unclear whether the Trump administration is pursuing the negotiations.
Caplan said the administration should support both policies.
“This is a walk and chew gum at the same time,” he said. “You can go after these price disparities and go for the least costly comparable price.”","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","May 9, 2025, 5:54 AM GMT+8 / Updated May 9, 2025, 8:43 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/women-pelvic-symptoms-pain-doctors-gaslight-study-rcna205403,"Doctors often gaslight women with pelvic disorders and pain, study finds",Women's Health,"Women seeking help for certain gynecological disorders may have their symptoms gaslighted by their doctors or nurses, a new study suggests.
The flood of dismissive and invalidating remarks by health care providers about disorders affecting the vulva and vagina can be devastating for women, sometimes leading them to abandon their search for help with their pain, researchers reported Thursday in JAMA Network Open.
The study focused on patients at a vulvovaginal clinic who were seeking medical care for a variety of disorders that may cause pain, sexual dysfunction, and bowel or bladder dysfunction.
OB-GYN Dr. Chailee Moss, lead author and an adjunct professor at George Washington University, said the roots of the research lay in “the years and years of hearing such experiences from patients and feeling like the broader medical community didn’t know how distressing the comments were to patients.”
Moss and her colleagues devised a survey that included dismissive comments and behaviors patients regularly encounter, such as doctors telling women to lose weight, go to therapy or drink more alcohol to cope with pain.
The survey was completed by 447 women between August 2023 and February 2024. Some of the survey questions included:
The participants reported that an average of 43.5% of past practitioners were supportive. But more than a quarter of the providers were belittling and about 20% did not believe the patient.
Overall, just over 40% of the women were told they just needed to relax more, about 20% were recommended to drink alcohol, and 39.4% said they were made to “feel crazy.”
Many women said they stopped coming for care because they felt their concerns were not being met. An estimated 20% of the patients were referred to psychiatry without medical treatment.
“In particular the comment ‘Just have a glass of wine’ was a particularly pervasive piece of advice that pain patients reported was very distressing,” Moss said.
The findings are significant because women whose conditions are dismissed may stop seeking medical care and experience a delayed diagnosis, the researchers said.
There are notable limitations to the study. It was conducted at one clinic and may not be representative of a diverse population. The researchers did not explore whether there were more problems with male or female caregivers, although Moss said a number of participants felt they were treated differently based on the clinician’s gender. And the survey was based on patient recall.
However, Moss believes similar results would be found in other centers.
Dr. Roger Dmochowski, a professor of urology, surgery and gynecology at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the new report underscores what women with urinary and pelvic floor complaints often experience.
“It’s my impression that women are traditionally undertreated and their symptoms are minimized or marginalized,” Dmochowski said. “Women are persistently ignored or depreciated for their symptoms.”
An important factor in providing care is paying attention to what the patient is saying, Dmochowski said. “A really critical part is listening to what the patient says,” he added. “Many patients have a very complicated presentation: pain, pelvic floor dysfunction, urinary problems, sexual issues. And each piece of the puzzle is important. Empathy is critical.”
Dmochowski said patients shouldn't hesitate to go to a different provider.
""Don’t give up,"" he said. ""A couple of negative experiences should not dissuade you from seeking care.""
Dr. Alessandra Hirsch, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, wasn't surprised by the study's findings.
“In the whole medical community there’s a history to contend with providers not believing in women’s pain,” she said. “I was sad and upset to read the patients’ accounts, especially those with chronic pain syndromes, such as endometriosis, which doesn’t usually get a diagnosis for many, many years.”
Hirsch hopes doctors who read the study “try to avoid falling into these habits.”
It's important for doctors to listen, Hirsch said.
“There is a chronic pain study that showed that patients who had providers they felt were attentive and listened to them scored lower on symptom severity,” she said.
A big part of the problem is that doctors don’t get much training in pelvic pain, Hirsch said. And the health care system makes doctors rush through exams.",Unknown,"May 9, 2025, 1:21 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cut-18-billion-nih-grants-rcna205568,Trump administration cut more than $1.8 billion in NIH grants,Health news,"The Trump administration terminated $1.81 billion in National Institutes of Health grants in less than 40 days, including $544 million in as-yet-unspent funds.
That’s according to an analysis published Thursday in JAMA, which relies on data from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System.
The analysis offers the most comprehensive look to date at how much NIH funding has been slashed since the Trump administration kickstarted a massive effort to reduce what it sees as waste and inefficiency in federal spending.
Some grants were temporarily reinstated due to court orders as new terminations were being issued, so the data is still in flux, said Michael Liu, an author of the study and a student at Harvard Medical School. Nevertheless, the HHS grant tracker is still the most accurate, real-time dataset available, he said.
From Feb. 28 to April 8, the administration terminated nearly 700 grants across 24 NIH institutes and centers focused on subjects such as aging, cancer, child health, diabetes, mental health and neurological disorders.
“These cuts were not spread evenly,” Liu said. “Namely, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities was hit the hardest. About 30% of all of its funding was cut. That’s 10 times more than the average.”
President Donald Trump’s new budget proposal would eliminate all funding for the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities next year, and refers to the institute as “replete with DEI expenditures.” His executive order in January called for an end to programs focused on diversity, equity and inclusion.
The proposal also calls for an overall reduction in NIH funding, lowering next year’s budget to $27 billion — a roughly $18 billion cut that would eliminate gender-focused research and research on climate change. The administration plans to prioritize research on chronic disease and other epidemics.
Most of the terminated NIH grants so far had been allocated to research projects, but around 20% were early career grants for fellowships, training or career development. Larger grants were more likely to be terminated, according to the analysis, though it’s unclear from the data whether they were directly targeted.
“These larger grants are usually funding big clinical trials and big research centers,” Liu said. “Closing the lights or stopping patients from receiving medications or interventions is potentially incredibly disruptive.”
Liu said the analysis also suggests that terminated grants were uniformly disruptive to public and private institutions.
Among grant recipients, Columbia University received the most terminations — 157 in total, according to the analysis. The Trump administration has targeted Columbia with funding cuts, citing “the school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students” following large pro-Palestinian protests on campus. Columbia laid off 180 staff members this week who had been working on federal grants affected by the cuts.","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","May 8, 2025, 11:36 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hhs-plan-medicare-medicaid-data-autism-rfkjr-alarm-rcna205427,HHS plan to use Medicare and Medicaid data to study autism alarms experts over privacy,Health news,"Autism experts and advocates expressed alarm after the Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday it intends to create a database of enrolled Medicare and Medicaid patients to support a study aimed at identifying the “root causes” of autism.
Under the leadership of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will partner up to build the database, using insurance claims data, electronic medical records and wearable technology, like smartwatches.
In a release, Kennedy said the agency is “pulling back the curtain — with full transparency and accountability — to deliver the honest answers families have waited far too long to hear.”
An HHS spokesperson declined a request to make an agency official available to discuss the project, including how it will be implemented, how it will define autism and how the data will be able to identify its causes.
In a news release, the agency said researchers would focus on autism diagnosis trends, outcomes from medical and behavior therapies, access to care and disparities by demographics and geography, and health care costs.
Scientists have identified a variety of risk factors linked to the development of autistic traits — most of which exist before birth — including more than 100 genes believed to play a role in 60% to 80% of cases.
Experts who’ve already spent decades researching the disorder said they worry about patient privacy under the new plan.
There’s a “lack of clarity around how the data will be collected, how it will be shared, maintained, and how we know it’s going to be accurate,” said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit group that helps to fund evidence-based autism research.
Singer said her team has been inundated with calls and emails from people in the autism community concerned over the lack of transparency from federal health officials about how their private medical data would be obtained and managed.
The database project doesn’t include input from the autism community and overlooks well-established genetic links to the disorder, experts say.
“We’ve had expert scientists who have been studying this issue for 20 years,” Singer said. “If there were one environmental toxin, I think we would have found it.”
In a statement, the HHS spokesperson said, “Wearable devices can provide continuous, real-world data on sleep patterns, physical activity, stress markers, environmental exposures, and more — all of which may help researchers identify early-life factors associated with autism spectrum disorder.”
The spokesperson didn’t respond to a question about how wearable devices would detect environmental exposures or who would be using them.
Michael Snyder, a professor of genetics and director of the Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine at Stanford Medicine, called the idea of using wearables to learn more about autism in general a “phenomenal idea.”
The challenge, he said, is that using wearables to get at the causes of autism would ideally require participants to wear them at an early age, before a diagnosis, and would also require a large sample size.
Snyder is leading a small pilot study with a wearable device his team invented that measures environmental exposures as well as sleep and activity levels, to see if there are any links to autism.
Singer said that currently, wearables are only used to alert teachers and caregivers to when an autistic person may become overwhelmed and overstimulated, and in need of a break.
“In the profound autism community, we’re using wearables to give an early warning as to when a meltdown might occur or self-injury may occur,” she said. “That enables someone to intervene.”
Autism and its possible causes have been an obsession for Kennedy over decades, starting with his false claim linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to the disorder — a connection that has been widely debunked by research from several countries. Experts predicted that Kennedy would revisit his mission as health secretary — which came true last month when he announced a study to identify the root causes by September.
Following a report published in April by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found a rise in autism rates in children in the U.S., Kennedy said the study would look at “environmental exposures,” including mold, food additives, pesticides and medicines.
Federal health officials were recently forced to walk back a plan to create a national registry of people with autism after backlash from the autism community.
The registry would’ve included data from private medical records, which autism advocacy groups warned could violate people’s privacy and lead to people with autism to avoid or refuse medical care “for fear of their data being shared without their permission,” according to the Autism Science Foundation.
It's unclear how the new project, which will also rely on medical records, is any different.
Zoe Gross, director of advocacy for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, said, “None of us have been consulted on this. Under previous administrations, both Democratic and Republican, we have had more contact with HHS and more involvement in major projects involving autism.”","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Erika Edwards, Akshay Syal, M.D., Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Erika Edwards, Akshay Syal, M.D.","May 8, 2025, 7:03 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mysterious-brain-diseases-canada-werent-mystery-rcna205134,Mysterious brain diseases in Canada weren't a mystery after all,Health news,"Six years ago, a Canadian neurologist claimed to notice strange symptoms in a cluster of patients in New Brunswick, a province bordering Maine.
According to the neurologist, Dr. Alier Marrero, the patients suffered hallucinations, spasms, rapid memory loss and the sensation that bugs were crawling underneath their skin, but their symptoms and brain scans didn’t neatly fit an existing diagnosis. In other words, the cases were a mystery.
But since then, neurologists who have reviewed the cases have identified clear diagnoses, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and cancer.
A study published this week in JAMA Neurology reinforces those findings, putting the probability of a mystery disease at roughly 1 in a million.
Doctors working on the study evaluated 25 people who had been identified as part of the New Brunswick cluster. Eleven of the patients had died, so neuropathologists used autopsies to determine their illnesses. For the 14 living patients, neurologists relied on cognitive assessments, among other tests. They concluded that all of the patients had well-known conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, cancer, traumatic brain injuries or post-concussion symptoms.
“We really felt we had a good explanation for 100% of the cases,” said an author of the study, Dr. Anthony Lang, a neurologist at University Health Network’s Krembil Brain Institute.
However, some doctors worry it won’t be enough to quash speculation that the cases have an unknown origin — a theory many patients and their families have clung to.
According to the study authors, 52 people identified as part of the New Brunswick cluster refused second opinions, and 42 more didn’t respond to the authors’ reaching out. The study attributes that to declining trust in health institutions and the spread of misinformation on both traditional and social media.
“These were examples of misdiagnosis that then led to misinformation. And sadly, the physician involved continues to believe and convince the patients and families that they have a mysterious illness,” Lang said.
Marrero took issue with the study and its findings in a statement.
“I am in profound disagreement with the study conclusions and have many questions regarding the methods and the content,” he said. “I am sure that our patients, families, and communities share the same very serious concerns.”
Dr. Valerie Sim, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Alberta who wasn’t involved in the study, said there has been no proof that the patients’ illnesses are related. In fact, she said, the cases are “so broad in their description that we could all have this mysterious illness.”
“Sadly, the one thing that all the patients have in common is the same neurologist,” Sim said. “And the patients who have been seen by other neurologists get a diagnosis of a known entity that’s not a mystery.”
James Mastrianni, a neurology professor at the University of Chicago who wasn’t part of the research, said the study reinforces that “a second opinion by an expert in the field is often helpful.”
The mystery illness theory gained traction in 2021 when Canadian health authorities began investigating cases based on Marrero’s reports. But even after the investigation determined that most patients had known conditions, some families were skeptical. In November, the premier of New Brunswick, Susan Holt, called on the province’s health minister to conduct a scientific review “into the mystery brain disease.”
“New Brunswickers deserve answers,” Holt said in a statement last year. “We need to know what’s making us sick.”
Some patient advocates now believe an environmental exposure is triggering the illnesses, claiming patients’ blood and urine tests show the presence of heavy metals, pesticides and rare antibodies that warrant further study.
“It wasn’t ever about whether a patient could have an alternative diagnosis,” said Kat Lanteigne, an advocate from New Brunswick. “It was what has triggered them to have this neurodegenerative disease?”
Dr. Yves Léger, New Brunswick’s chief medical officer of health, said in a statement Wednesday that the new study “doesn’t change my Office’s intention to complete its own investigation into cases of undiagnosed neurological illness in New Brunswick.”
His office has received 222 reports of cases identified as part of the cluster.
Marrero said he has “evaluated more than 500 patients in this cluster, and provided a significant amount of unequivocal, sometimes critical environmental exposure evidences, as well as rare autoimmune markers in many of them.”
But Lang said that just because a substance is in blood or urine doesn’t mean it caused someone’s neurological symptoms.
“You don’t do a shotgun approach looking for anything and everything and then finding something and claiming it’s related to what the problem is,” he said.
Neurologists with no connection to the New Brunswick cases point to a few reasons advocates, doctors and government officials are still debating the cause of the illnesses.
For one, they said, accurate diagnoses can take time. And some of the conditions detected in the study, like Alzheimer’s, can have complex presentations.
“It really takes a cohesive story from the family and a timeline to understand if someone is developing dementia. There can be confusing signs on a neurologic exam,” said Dr. Kimberly O’Neill, a neurologist in the NYU Langone Health Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center.
One of the core symptoms used to identify the New Brunswick patients was rapidly progressing dementia. But families sometimes miss early signs of neurodegeneration, making it appear that dementia came on suddenly, Mastrianni said.
Once debilitating symptoms arrive, patients and their families are often desperate for answers and may be reluctant to let go of the first diagnoses they get, Sim said.
“We see this all the time in medicine, that patients gravitate to a diagnosis or a group entity,” Sim said. “That’s clearly what’s happening here.”","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","May 8, 2025, 6:25 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/puberty-late-period-healthy-diet-chemicals-obesity-rcna204935,"Girls who eat a healthy diet may be less likely to start puberty early, study suggests",Women's Health,"Girls who grow up eating a healthier diet than their peers may be less likely to get their first menstrual periods at an earlier age — regardless of height or body mass index — a new study suggests.
Though previous research has tied height and BMI to the earlier onset of menarche, or first period, the study, published Tuesday in the journal Human Reproduction, claims to be the first to explore the biological milestone’s link to specific diets.
Girls typically begin puberty — marked by acne, growth spurts, breast development and the growth of body and pubic hair — anywhere from ages 8 to 13, according to the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. They get their first periods roughly two years after their breasts start developing.
While precocious puberty, which is the onset of puberty in girls younger than 8 and boys younger than 9, affects just 1% of U.S. children, girls nationwide are getting their first periods earlier and earlier. The median age at menarche was 11.9 in 2013 through 2017, down from 12.1 in 1995, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
Early menarche is more than untimely sexual maturity. Girls who get their periods younger than average are at increased risk of myriad medical problems throughout adolescence, such as depression, substance abuse and eating disorders. As adults, they have heightened odds of developing breast cancer, heart disease, obesity and other conditions.
To study the possible effects of diet on the age of a girl’s first period, researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle looked at the health records of more than 7,500 children ages 9 to 14 who had been enrolled in two waves of the Growing Up Today Study, from 1996 through 2001 and 2004 through 2008. As part of that study, the kids completed questionnaires about the foods they ate.
The researchers used two scales to gauge the girls’ self-reported eating habits. One looked at how healthy a child’s diet was, giving more points for healthier foods, such as legumes, whole grains and vegetables, and deducting points for less healthy foods, including red meat and products high in salt and trans fats. The second scale looked at how much people’s diets contributed to inflammation, with foods such as refined grains, high-calorie drinks and red and processed meat considered more inflammatory.
The median age of participants’ first periods was 13.1, the study found.
Girls who ate healthiest, the study estimated, were more likely to get their periods at a slightly older age than those who reported eating the least healthy diets. Similarly, girls who ate the highest amounts of inflammatory foods were more likely than those who ate the lowest amounts to get their first periods at a slightly younger age.
The study is observational, meaning it doesn’t prove that a particular diet causes early periods but instead establishes a possible link. A major limitation of the study is that the majority of participants were white. Race and ethnicity are well-studied aspects of early menarche, with Black and Hispanic girls more likely to experience it.
One hypothesis linking diet and age of first period, the authors wrote, is that the foods a person eats can affect levels of sex hormones in the body. A previous study of premenopausal women found that eating a healthier diet is linked to lower levels of certain sex hormones, including versions of estrogen. Inflammation has also been shown to have an effect on sex hormone levels.
Previous research has shown that excess fat, or adipose tissue, influences the hormone pathways that regulate puberty, said Erin Hennessy, director of the ChildObesity180 program at Tufts University, who wasn’t part of the study.
“Adipose tissue produces certain hormones, including leptin, which send signals to the brain, and the thought is that higher levels of leptin among children with excess weight can trigger specific hormones that initiate puberty earlier,” Hennessy said in an email. “Adipose tissue can also alter sex hormones, leading to higher estrogen levels that promote breast development and menarche onset.”
Diet alone doesn’t determine the timing of a girl’s first period. Genetics, environmental toxins, physical activity and socioeconomic status, among other factors, also play roles. Still, parents can support their children’s overall health and well-being through nutrition, Hennessy said.
“The first strategy is to acknowledge that weight is one of many factors of health and should never be the sole focus,” Hennessy said. “The second strategy is to take a family approach — everyone in the family can benefit from healthy eating.”
Third, Hennessy encourages parents to provide nutritional structure that isn’t coercive or overly controlling, such as pressuring children to eat or using food as a reward. Parental role modeling is a simple way to guide food choices and help children build healthy eating routines. Parents might also consider engaging their children in meal planning and preparation.
When in doubt, Hennessy said, refer to the Agriculture Department’s MyPlate program for dietary recommendations for children at different developmental stages.
“Emphasis should be on the major food groups and include a variety of foods within each group,” Hennessy said. Your meals should include “a rainbow of fruits and vegetables; at least half of your grains are whole grains; lean proteins (meat, fish, poultry, eggs, beans and nuts) and low-fat dairy or dairy alternatives.”
In addition, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans encourage limiting intake of sodium, added sugars and saturated fats.
“No matter what your weight status, a healthy diet is important for better health,” Hennessy said.
Even for preteens who’ve long consumed unhealthy foods, puberty presents an opportunity for positive change, said Dr. Rachel Whooten, a pediatric endocrinologist at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, who wasn’t involved in the study.",Unknown,"May 8, 2025, 12:20 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/modernas-combo-covid-flu-mrna-shot-outperforms-current-vaccines-large-rcna205242,Moderna's combo Covid and flu mRNA shot outperforms current vaccines in large trial,Health news,"Moderna’s combined Covid and flu shot outperformed the existing standalone vaccines for both viruses, according to the results of a phase 3 clinical trial published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The vaccine uses the same messenger RNA technology as Moderna’s approved Covid vaccine. (There are no approved mRNA-based flu shots.)
The trial, funded by Moderna, included more than 8,000 adults ages 50 and older who were enrolled in October and November 2023. For people ages 50 to 64, the new vaccine was compared to Moderna’s Covid vaccine and the flu shot Fluarix. For people 65 and older, it was compared to the Covid vaccine and a different flu shot, called Fluzone, which is a stronger dose typically given to older adults. The trial participants either got the existing shots, or the new combination vaccine plus a placebo shot. (This way, both groups got two injections.)
The main goal of the trial was to see whether the combination vaccine generated more antibodies in blood samples than the current shots against multiple strains of influenza and the XBB.1.5 Covid variant. This so-called serological testing is a common way for researchers to gauge how well a vaccine shot might work and how long the protection might last.
The trial found that antibody levels were higher for Covid and all but one influenza strain in people who got the combination vaccine, compared to those who got the existing shots in both groups.
Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said the antibody levels generated by the new vaccine were about 20% to 40% higher.
Dr. Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and infectious disease at Georgetown University and former chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, said the trial results are a good sign that the combination shot will provide protection against both Covid and the flu.
“We know that antibody responses generally correlates with a degree of protection,” Goodman said. “This is very promising, and it suggests this vaccine should have similar or higher levels of protection to traditional flu vaccines.”
Side effects such as fever and chills were more common in people who got the new vaccine. Creech attributed that to how the body is responding to the vaccine.
“Immunologically, what’s happening in each cell is they’re acting as if they’ve been infected with both viruses, and so your immune system is going to respond and make the type of inflammation that you would if you had flu or Covid or both simultaneously,” he said.
A combination shot would make it easier for people to get vaccinated against both Covid and the flu, especially since both shots usually come out in the fall. A new shot that provides better protection is needed, experts say, because the existing vaccines don’t do a good job at stopping infections.
The data is expected to be used to support Moderna’s application to the FDA for approval. Last week, Moderna said it doesn’t expect regulatory approval for its combination shot until 2026, after the agency said it required late-stage data showing the shot’s efficacy against the flu.
It’s unclear whether the agency’s new rule that all new vaccines will need to undergo placebo-controlled clinical trials to gain approval will apply to the combination shot. The FDA already delayed Novavax's Covid vaccine, requiring an additional clinical trial, and may impose the requirement for Pfizer’s and Moderna’s updated Covid vaccines for the fall.
A Moderna spokesperson declined to comment. An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, noted that mRNA vaccines are a particular target among anti-vaccine activists, and several states have introduced legislation that would ban them.
“One of the things I’m concerned about, at least for the United States, is all the anti-vaccine sentiment, and this specific targeting of the mRNA vaccine platform by anti-vaccine activists,” he said.
Hotez said Moderna’s combination shot would be “a potentially very useful advance,” as it would only require people to take one shot for two respiratory viruses.
“If this works, you could also use it for adding RSV or as well as other pathogens,” he said.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","May 7, 2025, 11:02 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/new-cholesterol-drug-lowers-ldl-levels-statins-arent-enough-study-find-rcna204938,"New cholesterol drug lowers LDL when statins aren't enough, study finds",Heart Health,"A new medication that combines an already approved drug with a new unapproved one has been shown to cut the level of LDL, or “bad” cholesterol, when statins aren’t helping enough.
In the Phase 3 trial, Cleveland Clinic researchers found that the combination of the new drug, obicetrapib, with an established medication, ezetimibe, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 48.6% after about three months’ use — producing more effective results than either drug alone. Ezetimibe is a cholesterol-lowering drug that is often prescribed with statins to reduce LDL even more.
The research was presented Wednesday during a late-breaking science session at the annual meeting of the European Atherosclerosis Society in Glasgow, Scotland, and simultaneously published in The Lancet.
In the multicenter clinical trial, the lead researcher, Dr. Ashish Sarraju, a preventive cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, and his colleagues enrolled 407 patients with a median age of 68 with LDL cholesterol levels greater than 70 mg/dL even though they had taken medication to lower it.
The participants were randomly assigned to four groups: a group for a pill that combined obicetrapib with ezetimibe, a group for each of the drugs separately and a placebo group. All participants continued on the medications they were taking before they started the trial, along with the medications being studied.
The reason: Some people have to take a number of prescriptions to get LDL down to desired levels.
“We need to give patients and their doctors all the options we can to try to get LDL under control if they are at risk for, or already have, cardiovascular disease,” Sarraju said. “In higher-risk patients, you want to get LDL down as quickly as possible and keep it there as long as possible.”
High-risk patients either had had strokes or heart attacks or were likely to in the future.
For that reason, the researchers enrolled patients in the trial who, despite already being on statins or even high-intensity statins, still had LDL levels that were too high.
The hope is that lowering LDL levels will reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as strokes and heart attacks. According to the American Heart Association, the optimal total cholesterol level for an adult is about 150 mg/dL, with LDL levels at or below 100 mg/dL (“dL” is short for “deciliter,” or a tenth of a liter). For high-risk patients, Sarraju recommends an LDL no higher than 70 mg/dL.
The trial was funded by the maker of obcetrapib, Netherlands-based NewAmsterdam Pharma. It expects to have conversations with the Food and Drug Administration about approval for the new combo drug “over the course of the year,” a spokesperson said.
A multitude of modifiable factors can result in high LDL, such as a diet high in saturated fats, processed foods and fried foods; being overweight; smoking; and older age.
Dr. Robert Rosenson, director of lipids and metabolism for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, said other drugs in the same class have failed to reduce heart attacks or stroke, “but I am cautiously hopeful.”
The drugmaker is currently running an additional trial to determine if the combo drug not only lowers cholesterol but also protects against adverse heart events.
While lifestyle changes can help bring down LDL, levels remain stubbornly high for some people. Only 20% of patients at high risk of heart disease are able to manage their LDL, said Dr. Corey Bradley, a cardiologist at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.
Heart disease is the leading cause of death for adults in the United States.
“High LDL is one of the leading risk factors for heart disease, and we have such a poor handle on controlling that risk,” Bradley said. “Many people have such a high LDL they will require multiple agents to control it.”",Unknown,"May 7, 2025, 7:05 AM EDT"

The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) crafted national standards for hand-washing, mask-wearing and isolating sick patients that most U.S. hospitals follow.
Four committee members said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention delivered the news about HICPAC’s termination to members Friday.
A letter reviewed by NBC News — which members said the CDC sent out after a virtual meeting — says the termination took effect more than a month previously, on March 31. According to the letter, the termination aligns with President Donald Trump’s executive order calling for a reduction of the federal workforce.
Four professional societies previously asked Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a letter on March 26 to preserve the committee amid widespread cuts to federal health agencies. The CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Several of the committee’s web pages have been archived, meaning they are still available to view online but are no longer being updated.
Some members now say they fear that its guidelines will be frozen in time, unable to evolve with new scientific research or the spread of drug-resistant organisms, which are a particular threat to hospitals.
“At some point, when things need to change, the guidelines likely won’t change, and then people will be sort of flying by the seat of their pants,” said Connie Steed, a HICPAC member since 2023 and former president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.
Dr. Anurag Malani, a fellow at the Infectious Diseases Society of America who joined HICPAC in January, said the committee was close to finalizing new guidelines for airborne pathogens before the termination. The guidelines, which had not been updated since 2007, included a controversial recommendation that would allow surgical masks in lieu of N95 respirators to prevent the spread of certain pathogens.
“There was really a lot of important material in there and, I think, a lot of lessons learned from Covid that helped shape those guidelines to put us in a better place than we were pre-pandemic,” Malani said.
Jane Thomason, the lead hygienist at National Nurses United — a union for registered nurses that criticized the new mask recommendations — lamented the loss of the committee. HICPAC appointed Thomason to a work group last year.
“While we had significant concerns regarding HICPAC’s make up and proposed guidance, the termination of the committee removes important public transparency,” Thomason said in a statement Tuesday. “Without HICPAC’s public meetings, there is no longer any public access to the process for drafting CDC guidance on infection control for health care settings. This further undermines safety for patients, nurses, and other health care workers.”
According to the CDC letter Friday, HICPAC has made 540 recommendations to the agency since its inception more than three decades ago — 90% of which were fully implemented.
Malani said it is important for those recommendations to continue so infection control practices stay consistent across the country.","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","May 7, 2025, 8:31 AM GMT+8 / Updated May 7, 2025, 3:58 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-slows-west-texas-doctors-remain-alert-rcna205105,"As measles outbreak slows in West Texas, doctors remain on alert",Measles Outbreak,"The measles outbreak that’s sickened hundreds and killed two young girls since January appears to be slowing in West Texas as the virus runs out of people to infect.
On Tuesday, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported a total of 702 measles cases, an increase of 19 since the agency’s last update on Friday.
Ninety-one people have been hospitalized since the beginning of the outbreak. About two-thirds were kids.
But for the second week in a row, no children are hospitalized with the virus in West Texas, said Katherine Wells, the public health director for the city of Lubbock, located at the epicenter of the outbreak.
“I’m hopeful that things are slowing down,” Wells said.
Still, she and others who’ve been on the front lines of the outbreak were cautious.
“I don’t think it’s over, but I do think it’s beginning to taper a little bit now,” said Dr. Lara Johnson, a pediatrician and chief medical officer at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock. “That could change tomorrow.”
Measles is so contagious, Johnson said, it can easily infiltrate  vulnerable, mostly unvaccinated, communities. At this point, she said, it seems the virus has made its way through many West Texas communities with low vaccination rates.
“Outbreaks burn themselves out,” Johnson said. “Everyone who’s susceptible in the community becomes not susceptible, either because they have the illness, or perhaps they choose to vaccinate.”
Doctors on the ground said there’s been a slight uptick in people choosing to get themselves or their children vaccinated. Others have been convinced to stay home while contagious to prevent further spread.
Mostly, however, measles has likely run out of people to infect among the vulnerable population.
Even as the outbreak slows in West Texas, it’s growing elsewhere.
As of Tuesday, there were 987 measles cases nationwide, according to an NBC News tally of state health departments. It’s the largest number of measles cases since 2019, when more than 1,200 cases were reported, driven by an outbreak in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York.
Most of the current cases are related to international travel. Montana and North Dakota are now reporting eight and four cases, respectively.
But some of the outbreaks in other states are linked directly to cases in West Texas.
Fifty-seven measles cases, including one death in an adult, have been reported in New Mexico. Health officials in Kansas report 46 cases, and 17 have been reported in Oklahoma.","Erika Edwards, Joe Murphy","May 7, 2025, 8:00 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-names-oncologist-vinay-prasad-new-vaccine-chief-rcna205145,FDA names outspoken Covid vaccine critic as the new vaccine chief,Health news,"The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday named Dr. Vinay Prasad — a hematologist-oncologist who has been accused of spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines and was an outspoken critic of the agency’s decision to approve Covid shots in children — as its new vaccine chief.
The FDA commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary, announced Prasad would lead the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to agency employees earlier Tuesday and later on X.
Makary called the appointment “a significant step forward,” saying Prasad would bring “scientific rigor, independence, and transparency.”
Prasad comes from the University of California, San Francisco, where he most recently was a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics. He is a practicing physician, according to his website.
He spent much of the pandemic criticizing the FDA’s and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s response to the virus.
In a 2021 blog post and an accompanying video, Prasad suggested the national response to Covid might bring on the collapse of democracy, invoking the rise of Hitler and the Third Reich in Germany.
On the blog that year, Prasad downplayed the anti-vaccine activism of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — now the secretary of health and human services — specifically his role in a 2019 measles outbreak in Samoa.
On Bari Weiss’ contrarian website, The Free Press, Prasad seemed to defend Kennedy’s most controversial positions on vaccines, raw milk and fluoride by listing other countries that have policies that align with Kennedy’s views.
Prasad has also been an outspoken critic of Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA’s former vaccine chief, saying on Twitter, now X, in 2022 that Marks “might be the worst FDA regulator in modern history” after the approval of Covid boosters in children. Last year, he called on Marks to be fired “ASAP,” claiming the FDA approved boosters for kids who had already had Covid with “no data.” The agency approved the boosters based on blood samples and safety data from other versions of the vaccines.
Prasad has also advocated for randomized placebo-controlled trials for the Covid vaccines every year — a position the FDA, in the Trump administration, now appears to support.
Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, noted that some of Prasad’s views — including that healthy children and other low-risk groups may not need additional Covid vaccinations — are more widely accepted in the scientific community now.
However, Prasad’s criticism of the health agencies’ response during the pandemic is unfair, he said.
“If we had the luxury of knowing then what we know now, we would do it differently,” Creech said. “But my goodness, the world was on fire, and we were doing our best.”
Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who has been a critic of Kennedy, said Prasad’s past comments are “dangerous” and “irresponsible,” noting that 1,800 children have died from Covid and hundreds of thousands have been hospitalized. The center, a member of the World Health Organization's vaccine safety program, provides information about vaccines to parents.
“Does he think Covid doesn’t hurt children?” Offit said. “It makes me think he never spent a minute in a children’s hospital.”
Offit also questioned whether Prasad was fit for the role as an oncologist and hematologist. As head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Prasad would also oversee a number of other medical products, including gene therapies.
“He has no experience at all in vaccine research or design or development of testing,” Offit said. He added that most people in the role do have such experience — although Marks, the former vaccine chief, was also criticized for having a background in oncology and hematology.
Prasad didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
In late March, Kennedy forced Marks out of his position.
Marks wrote in his resignation letter that undermining confidence in vaccines is “irresponsible, detrimental to public health, and a clear danger to our nation’s health, safety, and security.”
According to a poll published Tuesday by KFF, a health policy research group, less than half of Americans say they have confidence in the Trump administration’s health agencies, including the FDA, to protect against outbreak of infectious diseases and ensure the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs and vaccines, among their other responsibilities. The poll, which was conducted last month, found that most adults say they are at least “somewhat confident” in the safety of many routine vaccines, including those for measles and the flu.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Brandy Zadrozny, Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Brandy Zadrozny","May 7, 2025, 5:43 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/20-state-attorneys-general-sue-trump-admin-restore-health-agencies-rcna204824,20 state attorneys general sue Trump administration to restore health agencies,Health news,"Twenty attorneys general, including the AGs of New York, California, Colorado and Michigan, sued the Trump administration Monday over its mass firings and the dismantling of agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services.
The lawsuit, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, alleges that the administration violated hundreds of laws and bypassed congressional authority by endeavoring to consolidate the number of HHS agencies from 28 to 15 and initiating layoffs of around 20,000 employees.
James called the terminations “dangerous, cruel and illegal” at a news conference Monday.
“This administration is not streamlining the federal government; they are sabotaging it,” she said in a statement. “When you fire the scientists who research infectious diseases, silence the doctors who care for pregnant people, and shut down the programs that help firefighters and miners breathe or children thrive, you are not making America healthy — you are putting countless lives at risk.”
HHS announced the restructuring in late March as part of the Department of Government Efficiency’s broader effort to reduce the size of the federal workforce. The cuts included 3,500 employees at the Food and Drug Administration, 2,400 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 1,200 employees at the National Institutes of Health.
HHS said it would create a new agency, the Administration for a Healthy America, to absorb some responsibilities carried out by terminated agencies, such as programs focused on mental, environmental or worker health.
But the lawsuit claims the recent cuts will have “severe, complicated, drawn-out, and potentially irreversible” consequences. The attorneys general said in a press release that the restructuring has rendered HHS unable to carry out many of its vital functions by gutting mental health and substance use services, crippling the nation’s HIV/AIDS response and reducing support for low-income families and people with disabilities.
In particular, the release said, the Trump administration fired staff responsible for maintaining the federal poverty guidelines — which states use to determine eligibility for food assistance, housing support and Medicaid — and slashed the team behind the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps families with heating and cooling bills.
Half the workforce at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration — one of the dismantled HHS agencies — has also been terminated, according to the release. As a result, the attorneys general said, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health has been halted and the federal team running the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is gone.
The CDC lost several labs tracking infectious diseases, an office focused on tobacco control and prevention and a team that monitored maternal mortality in the U.S, according to the release.
“The federal government has cut lab capacity so much that they have all but stopped testing for measles in the middle of an unprecedented measles outbreak,” James said at the press conference. “New York’s public health lab, the Wadsworth Center, one of the only labs in the country still equipped to detect rare infectious diseases, is scrambling to fill the void left by a hollowed out CDC.”
HHS also gutted the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a CDC agency that helped screen for health issues in workers with toxic exposures.
The Trump administration has said that certain programs like the World Trade Center Health Program, which covers screening and treatments for 9/11-related illnesses, or the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program, which screens for black lung in miners, will continue through the Administration for a Healthy America. But many NIOSH employees involved with the programs were placed on administrative leave and face impending terminations in June, according to an internal government memo obtained by NBC News.
Monday’s lawsuit calls on HHS to halt its efforts to dismantle agencies and restore critical programs that have been lost. James said her office will request a preliminary injunction this week to temporarily block the Trump administration from making further cuts.","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","May 6, 2025, 12:30 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/celiac-disease-kissing-eating-gluten-safe-study-rcna204413,Can you kiss someone who just ate gluten if you have celiac disease? A study says yes,Health news,"People with celiac disease can kiss without fear, even if their partner has just eaten gluten, according to a new study.
People with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, a protein found in foods such as bread, pasta, gummy bears and soy sauce. Everyday activities often require careful calculation to avoid exposure.
Whether it’s safe to kiss someone who just ate gluten is a question that comes up frequently on Reddit. “Can celiac people kiss someone who just ate gluten?” asked a user in the r/glutenfree subreddit. Another user asked in the r/celiac subreddit, “Should I have my non celiac partner wash their mouth before.. kissing?”
Dr. Nielsen Fernandez-Becker, director of the Celiac Disease Program at Stanford University, said she’s spent hours counseling patients with celiac disease about the safety of kissing.
“I get this a lot,” Fernandez-Becker said. “Up until now, we didn’t have any study addressing it directly.”
With no official guidance, health care providers have been left to offer their best judgment when advising patients on what to do.
“We have all just given guidance based on, ‘It seems like it’s OK,’” said Anne Lee, an assistant professor of nutritional medicine at the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University in New York City. “There were no guidelines. There was no one who had researched this.”
Lee decided to change that and carried out a study looking at whether it’s safe for someone with celiac disease to kiss someone who has just eaten gluten. Lee presented her team’s findings on Monday at Digestive Disease Week in San Diego. The findings have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
The study included 10 couples that all had one partner with celiac disease and one who didn't have it. They wanted to see whether kissing the partner who had eaten gluten would trigger symptoms in the celiac partner.
Lee and her team tested this using two scenarios. Both started with the non-celiac partner eating 10 saltine crackers before kissing their gluten-free partners. In one instance, the couples waited five minutes before going in for a smooch. In another, the gluten-eating partner drank half a glass of water before the kiss.
The couples were asked to give the kiss their best shot. It had to be open mouth, with tongue, and it had to last close to a minute.
“We felt it needed to be like real life,” Lee said.
Post-kiss, Lee and her team collected saliva samples from all of the celiac partners and tested their urine for traces of gluten.
In the first scenario — waiting five minutes before kissing — two of the celiac participants had more than 20 parts per million of gluten in their saliva sample. (The Food and Drug Administration requires food labeled gluten-free to contain less than 20 ppm of gluten.) One was just slightly over the threshold, but the other person’s saliva contained 154 ppm of gluten post-kiss. That person also had a positive gluten urine test six hours after the kiss but didn’t have any symptoms of gluten exposure.
In the scenario in which non-celiac partners drank 4 ounces of water before the kiss, everyone’s saliva tests contained fewer than 20 ppm of gluten. That means out of all 20 kisses, just 10% resulted in traces of gluten higher than the amount deemed safe for food. Even when the celiac partners had amounts that were higher than this, they didn’t develop any symptoms.
Both methods answered the question on the minds of many people living with celiac disease: Kissing seems to be safe, especially if the person who ate the glutenous food drinks water before going in for the kiss.
“Gluten exposure has to be at a certain threshold for someone with celiac disease to react. It looks like for most of these people it was well below this threshold,” said Dr. Joseph Murray, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic, who was not involved in the research.
Although there probably are some patients who are extremely sensitive to gluten for whom kissing someone who just ate gluten could be a problem, Murray said those people are the outliers.
He added that the findings are largely what health care providers assumed based on knowledge of the disease. However, he said, it’s nice to have this study to point to when talking to patients.
Fernandez-Becker, of Stanford, said it’s a good idea for people to use their judgment and take precautions if they are worried, such as having the non-celiac partner drink water before kissing. If people have already been kissing without symptoms, they don’t need to change anything about their routine, she said.
Lee, who led the study, said, “There are so many aspects of being celiac and on the gluten-free diet that impact overall quality of life,” including social anxiety around dating.",Unknown,"May 5, 2025, 5:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/autism-community-needs-rfkjr-stigma-funding-rcna203578,Many autistic people say Robert F. Kennedy Jr. doesn't understand their needs,Health news,"In just two months on the job, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has raised the profile of autism more than any recent public official.
Autism advocacy groups typically welcome more attention to their cause. But many autistic people say Kennedy is exploiting their community — and perpetuating harmful stereotypes — as part of his decadeslong campaign against vaccines, even as the Trump administration threatens to eliminate services that help people with autism reach their full potential.
At an April press conference on autism rates among school-age kids, Kennedy described autism as an epidemic and a “tragedy” that “destroys families.”
“These are kids who will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use the toilet unassisted,” Kennedy said.
In response, 15 advocacy groups issued a joint statement calling for autistic people to be treated with respect and support. The groups said they are “deeply concerned by growing public rhetoric and policy decisions” that fail to “reflect the inherent value, rights and diverse needs of autistic people.”
Zoe Gross, director of advocacy for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, was one of many people to speak out. Gross and her brother have autism.
“It was a challenge for our parents, but our family wasn’t destroyed,” Gross said.
Ari Ne’eman, an assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said he sees Kennedy’s disparaging remarks as “part of the long and unfortunate history of fearmongering in the autism world.”
“There’s an unscrupulous industry of alternative medicine providers who exploit families by charging them tens of thousands of dollars to ‘recover’ people with autism,” said Ne’eman, who has autism. “The way that industry works is by terrifying families.”
Even among people with intellectual disabilities — a category that includes 40% of people with autism — 1 in 5 held a paid job in the community in 2020.
Kennedy later said he was referring to people with “profound autism,” including those without access to speech. Research suggests 10% to 27% of autistic people are nonverbal or have other significant needs, a rate that has remained relatively consistent since 2000.
Philip Weintraub, 53, didn’t speak a word until he was 5 years old.
But he received speech therapy throughout elementary school. Occupational therapy improved his motor skills, which allowed him to play soccer and basketball in middle school and high school, as well as softball as an adult.
After high school, he began volunteering for the Bill Clinton campaign and later worked for the White House. Weintraub now works at the Universal Services Administrative Company, which connects people to broadband services. When he returned to school to become certified in computer science, his school provided someone to take notes and gave him extra time on a test.
He and his wife, Liz, who has cerebral palsy, live in the Washington, D.C., area. Weintraub noted that they have gone on many dates.
“We are coming up on our 20th anniversary,” he said.
Many autistic people and their advocates say Kennedy’s remarks on autism perpetuate stigmas about the disorder, a neurodevelopmental disability in which people experience difficulties with social interaction or communication and often have restricted interests or repetitive behaviors.
Symptoms can vary dramatically from person to person, however, and some people with autism need higher levels of support than others.
Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, said she welcomed Kennedy’s focus on autistic people who need more intensive support. However, she objects to the suggestion that the lives of some autistic people have little worth.
Kennedy “made it sound like these individuals’ lives had no value if they couldn’t pay taxes,” Singer said. “That they couldn’t love and weren’t worthy of love. My daughter has profound autism and so does my older brother. They both live lives of meaning and dignity.”
Although attitudes toward autism have changed significantly in recent decades, Kennedy doesn’t seem to have kept up, said David Mandell, associate director of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s Center for Autism Research.
Kennedy’s comments about autism echo the language of some autism organizations from 20 years ago, when advocates often spoke of “curing” the condition, Mandell said.
In a written statement to NBC News, an HHS spokesperson said, “Secretary Kennedy remains committed to working toward a society where people with autism have access to meaningful opportunities, appropriate supports and the full respect and recognition they deserve. His statements emphasized the need for increased research into environmental factors contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses, not to stigmatize individuals with autism or their families. HHS supports ongoing collaboration and research to both identify the causes of autism and provide the best possible care and management strategies for those impacted.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are more than 5 million adults with autism in the United States.
When talking about autism, Kennedy refers to children but doesn’t mention of the needs of autistic adults, insisting that he’s never seen an adult his age with symptoms of autism.
Kennedy is “not just excluding the voices of autistic adults from the conversation, but excluding the fact of our existence,” Ne’eman said.
Kennedy has also said he didn’t know anyone with autism when he was growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, before some modern vaccines were available.
There’s a reason why people were autism were rarely seen at that time, Mandell said. Like others with intellectual or physical disabilities, they were often institutionalized, often living in appalling conditions that shortened their lives.
More than a century ago, when doctors first described autism, they saw it as a symptom of childhood schizophrenia. In the 1940s, doctors blamed the condition on “refrigerator mothers” who weren’t warm enough to their children.
Kristyn Roth, chief marketing officer of the Autism Society of America, said Kennedy’s claims about autistic children’s limited potential echo the warnings that doctors used during the mid-20th century to persuade parents to institutionalize their children, rather than raise them at home.
Children with autism weren’t afforded the legal right to a free public education until 1975. Children with developmental delays can receive early intervention services until age 3, then transition into special education, if needed.
Today, advocacy groups say it’s important to tell parents of newly diagnosed children about the many possibilities open to their kids.
“You don’t know what’s possible for your kid,” said Gross. “No one knows what’s possible for your kid when they’re 3 years old,” Gross said.
Part of Kennedy’s plan to “Make America Healthy Again” includes “streamlining” and “restructuring” federal health agencies in ways that could hurt people with autism, Roth said.
One of the most significant potential losses is the proposed dismantling of the Administration for Community Living, or ACL, which is best known for the Meals on Wheels program that delivers food to people’s homes. The ACL also protects the civil rights of older adults and people with disabilities — including those with autism — and helps them live independently, rather than in institutions.
According to the Trump administration, the agency’s “critical programs” — but not all programs — will be split across other departments. According to news reports, half of the ACL’s staff has been fired.
Proposals by Republicans in Congress to cut Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade to pay for Trump’s budget priorities could deal a devastating blow to people with autism and their families, Roth said.
Many children and adults with autism receive their health care through Medicaid, which covers people with disabilities or low incomes. Health insurance is critical for people with autism, who tend to have more serious medical needs than others. Up to half of those with autism have seizures, which can be life-threatening.
Medicaid also pays for screening, diagnosis, acute medical care, physical therapy, occupational therapy and one-to-one aides for people who need them, among other services, Mandell said.
Some states have received waivers to provide additional services through Medicaid, such as respite care for caregivers, a service that has been shown to reduce institutionalization.
Medicaid is “a literally lifesaving program for so many people in our community,” Roth said.
The Autism Society of America, which co-signed a letter to congressional leaders asking them to save the ACL, said the level of federal cost-cutting is leading to “the decimation of programs that directly serve and support the disability community, including those with autism,” according to a statement from the group.
If the federal government doesn’t fund services that help people with autism live at home, for example, they could end up living in institutions, which are much more expensive, Mandell said.
In an online statement, the Autism Self Advocacy Network said Kennedy has not consulted autism advocacy groups about any of the plans that affect their community.
Although Kennedy has pledged a “massive testing and research effort” to find the causes of autism, Ne’eman said research dollars would be better spent investigating ways to support autistic people in their daily lives, such as addressing barriers to jobs and education.
“The false idea that autism is caused by an ‘injury,’ by something external going wrong, makes people more afraid of autism and of autistics,” the Autistic Self Advocacy Network wrote in a statement in April. “So does the idea that it is better for a child to die of a vaccine-preventable disease than to live as an autistic person.”
Trump also has vowed to eliminate the Department of Education, which oversees special education services and enforces the law that guarantees children with disabilities — including those with autism — receive a free public education in the least restrictive environment. The White House has promised that services for children with disabilities will be “preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments,” but many autism advocates worry that key services will be lost in the shuffle, making it harder for students to receive individual education programs and special instruction in school, as well as accommodations that help meet their needs.
Twenty-two percent of families of children with disabilities experience financial hardship, such as difficulty paying a medical bill or going without care due to cost, according to a study published in JAMA on April 24. That rate is nearly twice as high as in families without children with disabilities.
“I have not heard Kennedy say one word about supports,” Mandell said. “I would love to change the conversation to talk about what we should be doing to support these individuals.”
The report from the CDC that triggered Kennedy’s recent briefing shows that increased efforts to screen young children for autism have led to an increase in the number of children diagnosed with the condition.
Kennedy rejects the idea that increased awareness and screening explains the growth in autism diagnoses.
Jemma Bat-Anat Page, 29, said she would not have been diagnosed with autism if she hadn’t sought out testing two years ago.
Page, who works in theater in Cincinnati, paid for the tests using health insurance from her employer. Page said she has been uncomfortable making eye contact since she was a child and she sometimes got in trouble for not being able to control the volume of her voice. She decided to be tested, not for accommodations or services, but simply to better understand herself.
Page and her partner, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, consider themselves “neurodiverse.”
She also likes the increasingly popular term “neurospicy.”

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/stomach-cancer-diagnosed-earlier-symptoms-survival-rcna204536,"Stomach cancer is rising among younger people, but there is hope for early detection",Cancer,"Doctors are increasingly detecting stomach tumors at an early stage, raising hopes for lifesaving treatment for one of the deadliest types of cancer.
Stomach cancer, the disease that killed country music star Toby Keith last year, is typically difficult to catch early and tends to be discovered at an advanced stage when cancer cells have spread, researchers reported Saturday at Digestive Disease Week, a major international conference for doctors and researchers in gastroenterology, liver diseases and endoscopy.
Advances in the tools used to scrutinize the upper gastrointestinal tract have made it possible to get a clearer view of the stomach, allowing doctors to see small tumors that previously wouldn’t have been detected, according to the study’s lead author, Dr. Mohamed Tausif Siddiqui, a gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition fellow at the Cleveland Clinic.
“They used to be detected after they metastasized, which is why there were very poor outcomes,” Siddiqui said in an interview. “The whole paradigm is changing, with more and more local cancers and fewer metastatic cancers being detected.”
Newer endoscopes, thin tubes used to look inside the body, provide higher-definition views of the upper gastrointestinal tract, Siddiqui said. The cameras that are guided into the patient’s stomach have the capacity to zoom in on suspect areas.
Siddiqui and his colleagues analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute’s SEER-22 database and found that diagnoses of early-stage stomach cancer rose steadily from 2004 to 2021.
In contrast, more advanced cases — when the cancer had already spread to nearby lymph nodes and/or distant organs — had dropped significantly.
In 2004, early-stage stomach cancer, also called gastric cancer. was detected at a rate of 1.94 per 100,000. By 2021, that number had risen to 2.97 per 100,000. That’s compared to 2.55 per 100,000 for late-stage cancers detected in 2004 and 2.35 per 100,000 detected in 2021.
The American Cancer Society predicts that in the U.S. in 2025, there will be around 26,500 new cases of stomach cancer diagnosed and more than 10,800 deaths.
More cases of stomach cancer are being diagnosed in people ages 50 and younger, a separate study being presented at the meeting by Cleveland Clinic researchers found.
There are many factors that can raise a person’s risk of developing stomach cancer, including infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria, genetic predisposition and a history of smoking, Siddiqui said.
H. pylori infections lead to inflammation in the stomach and have been shown to cause ulcers.
Early signs of stomach cancer include:
The researchers hope that the new findings will lead to guidelines for stomach cancer screening, similar to recommendations for colon cancer.
Currently in the U.S. people get checked for the disease only if they have symptoms or family histories of the disease. Many people don’t have noticeable symptoms until the cancer has spread.
Dr. Ji Yoon Yoon, a gastroenterologist and an assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said the new research could be a “turning point” for early detection.
“What’s very exciting about these findings is, for the first time, localized stomach cancers are the most common diagnoses in the U.S.,” said Yoon, who was not affiliated with the new study.
Japan and South Korea, which have higher rates of stomach cancer, have screening programs, Yoon said. “Anybody older than 50 gets screened in Japan, and in South Korea, people aged 40 to 74 get an upper endoscopy every two years.”
Early-stage gastric cancers, when confined to the stomach lining, can often be treated with minimally invasive procedures. In more advanced cases, more extensive surgery is usually required to remove part of the stomach.
The overall five-year survival rate for stomach cancer is around 36%, Yoon said. For people with earlier-stage or localized cancer, the five-year survival rate is 77%.
Dr. Michael Gibson, an associate professor of medicine and the director of translational research for esophagogastric cancer at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said it’s good that it's increasingly being caught early, especially since “the incidence of gastric cancer is rising in the adolescent and young adult population.”
The new study’s data shows that the stage of diagnosis is getting lower within adolescent and young adult groups. While it’s not clear why the patients in the study got checked for gastric cancer, it’s possible some of the patients were being scanned for other reasons and the stomach cancer was picked up incidentally, he said.
The new findings suggest that more patients may survive stomach cancer because it’s being caught early, said Dr. Ryan Moy, a medical oncologist specializing in gastrointestinal cancers at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York.",Unknown,"May 3, 2025, 3:01 PM GMT+8 / Updated May 3, 2025, 7:12 PM GMT+8"

The 216 pediatric deaths reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eclipse the 207 reported last year. It’s the most since the 2009-2010 H1N1 global flu pandemic.
It’s startling that the number already is this high, given that the flu season is still going on. The final pediatric death tally for the 2023-2024 flu season wasn’t counted until autumn.
“This number that we have now is almost certainly an undercount, and one that — when the season is declared over, and they compile all the data — it’s almost certain to go up,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
There are likely several contributors to this season’s severity, but a big one is that fewer children get flu shots, added O’Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.
The flu vaccination rate for U.S. children has plummeted from about 64% five years ago to 49% this season.
Flu vaccinations may not prevent people from coming down with symptoms, but research shows they are highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths, O’Leary said, adding that the decline in vaccinations “is certainly playing a role” in this season’s loss of life.
The season has not only been hard on children. CDC officials have described it as “highly severe,” and estimate that so far there have been at least 47 million illnesses, 610,000 hospitalizations and 26,000 deaths this season.",Unknown,"May 3, 2025, 12:19 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/updated-covid-vaccines-fall-may-jeopardy-rfk-jrs-new-rules-rcna204242,Updated Covid vaccines for the fall may be in jeopardy under Kennedy's new rules,Health news,"The anticipated rollout of updated Covid vaccines this fall might be at risk after a change by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in how vaccines are tested, experts say.
Under the change by Kennedy, according to an HHS spokesperson, all new vaccines will need to go through placebo-controlled clinical trials — where some people get the actual shot and others get something inactive, like a saline shot — to compare the results.
Running trials that include a placebo group is already routine for most new vaccines.
The original Covid vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, approved in late 2020, went through placebo-controlled trials. But as the virus continued to mutate and the vaccines needed to be updated to match the circulating strain, drugmakers moved to a flu vaccine-like model — using smaller studies to test how well the updated shots triggered an immune response against the variant in question.
Like the annual flu shot, the updated Covid vaccines weren’t treated as entirely new products, since they still used the same formula, with just a tweak to what strain the vaccine would be targeting. The mRNA Covid vaccines were designed so that this change would be particularly easy to make, in the event the shots needed to be quickly updated.
Quickly, in this case, turns out to be several months. In order to have enough Covid doses ready to go for the fall, vaccine-makers are told what strain to target in the spring.
The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee is expected to meet in May or June to make a recommendation on which strains should be included in the next round of shots. A person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the FDA had planned to schedule a meeting for May 22. An HHS spokesperson declined to comment on the meeting date.
If the FDA deems Pfizer’s and Moderna’s updated vaccines “new” products, requiring fresh trials, it’s extremely unlikely the doses would be ready for the fall, experts said.
Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee, said the change would almost certainly delay the rollout of the updated shots from Pfizer and Moderna by “months,” as it would take time for the drugmakers to design the new trials and enroll participants.
That would only be the start — the drugmakers would then have to run the actual trial, which would take several months on its own, at minimum, and analyze the results.
Even the Covid vaccines — which were hailed as “the most successful government science program” because of how quickly they were developed, according to Dr. Alex Greninger, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at UW Medicine in Seattle — still took at least about six months to run their Phase 3 trials.
The HHS spokesperson didn’t directly respond to a question about whether the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would require new clinical trials.
However, the spokesperson said in a statement that “FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has indicated that significant updates to existing vaccines — such as those addressing seasonal strain changes or antigenic drift — may be considered ‘new products’ requiring additional clinical evaluation.”
“As we’ve said before, trials from four years ago conducted in people without natural immunity no longer suffice,” the spokesperson said. “A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data,” they said, adding that the flu shot would be exempt from the new rule, because it “has been tried and tested for more than 80 years.”
The FDA has already delayed the approval of Novavax’s updated Covid vaccine, requiring the company to carry out a new clinical trial because the strain included in the shot differs from what was originally authorized.
Vaccine experts panned the new requirements.
It’s “unethical,” Offit said, noting that it’s generally frowned upon in the scientific community to give someone a placebo when an approved product already exists that can protect them.
Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a pediatrician who played a key role in developing the rubella vaccine, said the move would make “no sense.”
“What would be reasonable is to compare the old vaccine with the new vaccine to see whether the new vaccine gives better immunologic responses,” Plotkin said. “We have vaccines against Covid, where we have pretty concrete ideas as to what works and what doesn’t work. We know they’re not perfect, but we have vaccines we know work.”
Spokespeople for Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Former government officials have said HHS, under Kennedy, was moving to slow-walk vaccine approvals, including by imposing new regulatory hurdles on drugmakers, such as changing the requirements for approval or seeking additional clinical trial data.
Vaccine experts also fear the rule change is part of a broader effort by Kennedy to sow distrust in vaccines and limit public access to them.
“The goal is to make vaccines more onerous to make, more onerous to test by bringing up these sort of false safety concerns or false efficacy concerns,” Offit said.
Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said the change is unlikely to affect brand-new vaccines. But it could have major implications for vaccines that may require updates besides Covid — like those for RSV — since placebo trials are costly and take significantly more time to conduct.
“It’s really not feasible, and would lead to lots of hospitalizations and deaths,” O’Leary said.
Plotkin added that vaccines being developed for infections that are incurable, like HIV, may also be at risk.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","May 2, 2025, 5:48 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/federal-workers-focused-black-lung-screenings-reinstated-still-face-ju-rcna203747,Some federal workers focused on 'black lung' screenings reinstated but face June termination,Health news,"The Trump administration plans to terminate federal workers focused on preventing and responding to work-related illnesses, including ""black lung"" disease in coal miners, according to an internal government memo obtained by NBC News, despite in recent days reinstating some who had been let go.
Those terminations could threaten critical programs used to screen for health issues in workers with toxic exposures, including 9/11 first responders, according to people who work on or benefit from the programs. Some workers who benefit from those programs have expressed fears that conditions such as cancer or lung disease could go undetected as a result.
Concerns about the future of those programs began earlier this month when the Department of Health and Human Services effectively gutted the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), drastically cutting the headcount of an agency that has been around for 55 years. The move was part of a broader plan to reduce the size of the federal workforce, including a massive restructuring of federal health agencies that called for the termination of roughly 20,000 full-time employees.
In an agencywide email sent Wednesday, NIOSH’s director, John Howard, acknowledged “a significant number of [reduction in force] notices sent to staff” and said some staffers were brought back from administrative leave this week as part of “a temporary arrangement to help complete our obligations.” The staffers had received notices on April 1 that they had been placed on leave, with official termination dates set for June.
Howard himself received a termination notice in early April but returned to his post after bipartisan opposition from members of Congress regarding his dismissal.
The notices “created confusion and gaps in information that we are continuing to try to fill,” Howard said in his memo. Some programs within NIOSH will move to a newly created agency known as the Administration for a Healthy America, he said, but it’s unclear how that transition will occur.
One program caught up in the cuts is the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program, a congressionally mandated effort to monitor the health of coal miners. For decades, it offered free X-rays to identify lung scarring in miners who continuously inhale coal dust — what’s colloquially known as “black lung.”
An HHS official said critical NIOSH programs, including the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program, will continue to serve the needs of miners via the newly created Administration for a Healthy America, but did not address the upcoming staffing cuts.
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said Tuesday evening on X that she was encouraged by some NIOSH staff returning to work this week.
“My understanding is that this is temporary, so my focus will continue to be on working with @HHSGov on permanently restoring these functions and personnel in the most efficient and effective manner,” she wrote.
A lawsuit filed earlier this month by a coal miner in West Virginia on behalf of himself and others in his field calls for the program to be reinstated. It accuses HHS of violating the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act — which established the program in 1969 — by terminating staffers involved in black lung screenings. HHS has until Thursday to respond to the suit.
Coal miners have a higher-than-average risk of dying from black lung by virtue of their occupation. One in 10 underground coal miners who worked in mines for at least 25 years had black lung, according to a NIOSH report in 2018. In Central Appalachia, one of the main coal mining regions in the U.S., the rate was 1 in 5.
Scott Laney, an epidemiologist at the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program, said the program diagnosed new cases and provided evidence of the disease to miners filing for disability benefits. He estimated that, due to staffing cuts, there are hundreds of thousands of X-rays currently sitting in the basement of the NIOSH facility in Morgantown, West Virginia.
“There’s a tranche of X-rays that have gone unread in our system, and these miners are waiting to find out whether they have black lung or not,” he said.
On top of that, he said, “if someone calls NIOSH and asks for their personal health information, we don’t have the ability to send that to them right now.”
Dave Dayton, a miner in Marion County, West Virginia, said he has personally taken advantage of NIOSH’s mobile screenings for lung disease. Many miners work long shifts and would otherwise struggle to see a doctor, he said.","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","May 1, 2025, 3:39 AM GMT+8 / Updated May 1, 2025, 7:17 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/wegovy-treated-serious-form-liver-disease-major-clinical-trial-rcna203677,Wegovy treated a serious form of liver disease in a major clinical trial,Health news,"The weight loss drug Wegovy treated a serious form of liver disease in about two-thirds of patients in a major clinical trial, according to the findings published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease — previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease — affects about 33% of adults in the U.S. About 5% to 7% have a more advanced form of the disease, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH. (Another type of liver disease, alcohol-associated liver disease, is caused by drinking.)
Both conditions are the result of the body storing too much fat in the liver, said Dr. Sobia Laique, a liver doctor and the director of the Multidisciplinary MASLD Clinic at Cleveland Clinic. In people with MASH, the excess fat has started to cause inflammation, which over time can lead to scarring, or fibrosis.
Left untreated, it can progress to liver failure and liver cancer, Laique said.
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is more common in people with obesity or Type 2 diabetes, according to the National Institutes of Health. An estimated 75% of overweight people and more than 90% of people with obesity have the disease.
There’s only one FDA-approved medication for MASH, called resmetirom, Laique said. However, the medication only helps about a quarter of patients and doesn’t address the underlying conditions that drive the disease. Bariatric surgery is often the recommended treatment for those who can’t resolve the condition through lifestyle changes, she added.
“This is fairly monumental and really is going to be paradigm-changing,” Laique said of the Wegovy trial results, “because at least in the pharmacotherapy space, you don’t have a comparable drug yet.” She was not involved with the clinical trial.
The trial, funded by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, included 800 patients with MASH from 37 countries. Patients either got a weekly 2.4 milligram dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, or a placebo, for 72 weeks.
The trial found that about 63% of patients in the semaglutide group saw a reduction in liver inflammation, compared with 34.3% of people who got a placebo.
Prior to starting the trial, the participants also had moderate to high levels of scar tissue in the liver, known as stage 2 or 3 fibrosis.
About 37% of the semaglutide group saw improvements in their fibrosis, compared with 22.4% in the placebo group. The semaglutide group also saw other benefits, including a 10.5% average weight loss.
Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina who was not involved in the study, said she was impressed, noting that once fibrosis has developed in patients, it’s often difficult to reverse or treat the inflammation.
“It’s incredibly good news that semaglutide not only reduced inflammation but also that fibrosis regressed,” Spratt said.
Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, said in an email that the results may offer hope for a condition with few treatment options but added that long-term data is to determine whether the improvements from the drug will reduce liver-related complications and death.
“These findings represent a very promising step forward in the fight against a common, progressive, and often silent disease,” McGowan said.
The trial results add to the growing list of conditions that GLP-1s —  the class of drugs that includes Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound — can treat beyond diabetes and weight loss.
Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved Wegovy to reduce heart disease risk in people with obesity. The agency also approved Zepbound for obstructive sleep apnea in December, and Ozempic to treat chronic kidney disease in patients with Type 2 diabetes in January. Researchers are also investigating whether the drugs are effective against Alzheimer’s and alcohol addiction.
Insurance companies are often reluctant to cover the drugs for weight; however, they’ve shown willingness to cover them when approved for other conditions, such as heart disease risk and sleep apnea.
In a release Wednesday, Novo Nordisk said the FDA could make a decision on whether to approve Wegovy for MASH as early as the end of the year.
The FDA has granted the drug a priority review designation, the drugmaker said, meaning it will review the application in six months, rather than the standard nine-month window.
Spratt noted that side effects can be a barrier for some who want to take Wegovy and similar weight loss drugs.
The drug was well tolerated, according to the trial results. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, including nausea, diarrhea, constipation and vomiting. Side effects leading to people dropping out of the trial were 2.6% for the semaglutide group and 3.3% for the placebo group.
Laique questioned whether patients would continue to see improvement after 72 weeks. She also noted that patients would likely have to continue taking the medication, or risk MASH coming back.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","May 1, 2025, 5:04 AM GMT+8 / Updated May 1, 2025, 5:17 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-vaccine-safety-datalink-conspiracy-theory-rcna203411,The little-known database at the heart of RFK Jr.'s vaccine conspiracy theory,Health news,"For as long as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has falsely claimed that vaccines cause widespread harm — from autism to sudden death — he has pointed to the one source he says could immediately prove it.
In speeches, interviews and writings, Kennedy has repeatedly claimed that the evidence of a massive public health cover-up lies buried in a little-known database of medical records of some 12 million Americans: the Vaccine Safety Datalink, or VSD.
“For decades, the CDC has kept a tight grip on the Vaccine Safety Datalink, concealing vital vaccine safety information from the public,” Kennedy said in 2023.
Kennedy now oversees the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — including the Vaccine Safety Datalink — and one of his first initiatives as health secretary was to launch his long-dreamed-of study using the VSD to investigate the link between childhood vaccines and autism. It’s a theory that has already been disproven in dozens of studies, many using VSD data.
“We’re going to be able to get into these databases and give answers to the American public,” Kennedy said last month. He told President Donald Trump at recent Cabinet meeting that he would reveal the cause of autism by September.
However, in recent weeks, Kennedy’s anti-vaccine allies have begun casting doubt on this pledge, once again alleging a government conspiracy to block access to the truth.
Without evidence, anti-vaccine lawyer Aaron Siri and activist Del Bigtree have claimed on the internet show ""The HighWire"" that the CDC scattered the vaccine safety data after Kennedy took office, making it unavailable for Kennedy’s team to examine. The goal, according to Siri, was to “thwart the ability for the current administration to actually conduct a study in the VSD.”
It’s a pattern that has echoed through the first months of the Trump administration: Onetime outsiders who had long asserted that the federal government was hiding the truth suddenly had access to all the government documents they could want — only to reveal that, perhaps, there were no nefarious secrets after all. The JFK assassination files exposed little about his killing that wasn’t already known. The release of records in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case was a dud. Trump and Elon Musk’s claims that millions of people over 100 were receiving Social Security quickly fell apart.
Now, it appears that anti-vaccine activists are similarly girding for the possibility that Kennedy’s promises may fall short — and they’re already laying the groundwork for someone to blame.
“We’ve been saying that database is where the answers are,” Bigtree, who was communications director for Kennedy’s 2024 presidential campaign, said of the VSD on “The HighWire” last week. “You could do the study in probably minutes with AI and computer learning and everything that’s possible. Then the moment before Bobby gets in there to be able to do that study, what did they do? They obliterated it.”
It’s not clear exactly what Bigtree and Siri meant; neither responded to requests for comment. Kennedy also didn’t respond. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services initially said he would “look into it,” but did not respond to further requests for comment. A CDC spokesperson confirmed that nothing about the stewardship of VSD data had changed in the last year.
There’s one thing that Bigtree and Siri have right: The data in the VSD is not actually housed at the CDC — but that’s not a recent change.
The VSD is a collaboration between a small team at the CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and 11 private health care organizations. Since the 1990s, it’s been used to monitor vaccine safety and conduct studies of rare side effects.
“These studies that use the VSD are able to tell the difference between a condition that coincidentally happens after vaccination and a condition that may actually be the result of vaccination,” said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
The health care organizations used to send their anonymized medical data to the CDC each year for analysis, but since 2001, the organizations have kept the data on their own servers, to ensure it stays secure.
“Sometimes people have the image that if there’s a vaccine safety study, there must be one giant database with all the information in it,” Sharfstein said. “If you’re not familiar with how distributed networks of data are designed and used in studies, then it can be confusing. Because there is no one big dataset. There is no single file that can just be sent or released.”
The conspiracy lore around the VSD began in the early aughts, around the time that Kennedy, then an environmental lawyer, was being introduced to the anti-vaccine movement.
At that point, the only groups with access to the VSD were the CDC and the participating health care organizations. The studies they produced relied on the data they collected, including from doctor and hospital visits, vaccinations, pharmacies and lab results.
Then in 2002, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who had a grandson he believed had been injured by vaccines, allied with several parent-led autism groups. Frustrated with anti-vaccine researchers’ lack of access to data that might prove the link, Burton threatened to subpoena the VSD’s patient records.
At a hearing on the topic, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., urged Burton not to do it.
“A subpoena could have the effect of driving HMOs from the program and destroying CDC’s ability to scientifically test hypotheses relating to adverse events potentially associated with vaccines,” Waxman warned, referring to the health care organizations. (Burton and Waxman left Congress in the mid-2010s.)
Subpoenaing millions of medical records “would have been a profound invasion of privacy,” said Johns Hopkins’ Sharfstein.
The CDC offered a solution: It would work with the participating health organizations to get independent researchers access to the data. Among the earliest beneficiaries — with the help of  former Rep. Dave Weldon, R-Fla., the recently withdrawn CDC director nominee — were the anti-vaccine researchers Mark and David Geier, a father-son pair who baselessly theorized that autism was the result of an interaction between a preservative in vaccines and testosterone.
(Mark Geier died this year in Florida, over a decade after being stripped of his medical license in several states, partly for improperly treating autistic children with hormone blockers. David Geier, who was disciplined by the Maryland Board of Physicians for practicing medicine without a license in 2012, was hired at HHS this year as a senior data analyst to reanalyze vaccine safety data under Kennedy, according to two sources familiar with the plan.)
The Geiers' work with VSD data was marked by alleged ethical breaches. In 2003 and 2004, the Geiers visited the CDC’s Maryland data center to access VSD data for a study looking at whether the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine increased risks for harmful side effects.
Instead, according to a letter of complaint from one of the health care groups, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, the Geiers violated protocol and began comparing rates of autism in children who received vaccines with different amounts of a preservative. Further, Kaiser Permanente said the Geiers tried to merge datasets in a way that would have risked patients’ confidentiality, then tried to remove files from the datacenter. Subsequently, Kaiser Permanente suspended the Geiers' access to the VSD.
The Geiers denied the accusations and published their findings in journals known more for conspiracy theories than rigorous science. At an Institute of Medicine panel in 2004, Mark Geier claimed the VSD data they analyzed showed that vaccines were linked to autism. Their published papers have been widely criticized by scientists and their findings never replicated or supported by mainstream research.
In 2006, they were approved for another study using VSD data, and again, stopped after violating protocol, according to lawyers representing the government in a set of test cases known as the Omnibus Autism Proceedings. Lawyers representing the parents of autistic children — for whom the Geiers had been providing research — suggested in legal filings that the Geiers had been unfairly banned at the whims of CDC.
For the Geiers, the experience was one of oppression. At anti-vaccine conferences, they presented PowerPoints alleging that the CDC had “restricted” their access to data and “attacked” their findings.
At the same conferences, Kennedy, who has consistently praised the Geiers, told a similar story.
“Oh, they’ve hidden it, and they won’t let anybody in it, except their own guys who cherry-pick and design these fabricated studies and change the protocols constantly to try to use it to defend vaccines,” Kennedy said in a 2017 keynote at AutismOne, an anti-vaccine conference for parents of autistic children where the Geiers also presented. “It’s being used instead to craft these fabricated, fraudulent studies,” he said, “to fool the public about vaccine safety.”
That same year, as Trump considered chairing a committee to review vaccine safety, Kennedy and a group of anti-vaccine activists met with Francis Collins, then the director of the National Institutes of Health, to ask him to “open up” the VSD to scientists who would “investigate whether vaccines are associated with the epidemic of health disorders plaguing our children today.”
In a letter following the meeting, Collins, who resigned from the NIH last month, told Kennedy that because of privacy concerns, access was limited to researchers who made formal requests and met certain criteria. Further, Collins said the kind of study Kennedy had suggested would be difficult because the sample population of unvaccinated children in the VSD — already just a fraction of the U.S. population — would be too small.","Brandy Zadrozny, Brandy Zadrozny","May 1, 2025, 3:16 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-research-contradicts-rfk-jrs-claim-severe-autism-cases-are-rising-rcna202791,New research contradicts RFK Jr.'s claim that severe autism cases are rising,Health news,"When Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the government’s new autism findings this month, he painted a grim and highly controversial picture: Not only was autism becoming more prevalent, he said, but “most cases now are severe.”
The notion that severe symptoms are becoming more common isn’t substantiated by scientific evidence. Rather, new research being announced this week at the annual meeting of the International Society for Autism Research in Seattle suggests that the share of autism cases with moderate or significant symptoms remained relatively consistent from 2000 to 2016.
In the past few weeks, Kennedy has repeatedly referred to autism as an “epidemic” that is leading to more cases of severe intellectual disability.
“This is an epidemic like nothing we’ve ever seen before. It dwarfs the Covid epidemic,” he told Fox News this month. “This is disabling children for their entire lives.”
The characterization has sparked outcry among some parents, advocates and medical experts, who say Kennedy is using a minority of cases to represent autism as a whole.
A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 1 in 31 children are diagnosed with autism by their 8th birthdays, but it didn’t distinguish between cases with mild or severe symptoms.
Kennedy estimated at an April 16 briefing announcing the findings that a quarter of children diagnosed with autism don’t speak or use toilets without assistance. A previous CDC study found that nearly 27% of people with autism were nonverbal or minimally verbal or had IQs below 50. But many researchers believe the actual rate could be lower — and even then, not all cases have the same limitations.
Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning it can have a range of manifestations — some mild, others more pronounced — that affect how people socialize, communicate, learn or behave.
The new research being shared this week found that only mild cases rose from 2000 to 2016.
The analysis is based on data from the CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, which tracks autism cases across the United States. To determine whether cases were mild or not, the researchers looked at adaptive test scores — interviews that evaluate kids’ social, communication and daily living skills — as opposed to IQ scores, which illustrate intellectual disability.
“There are many kids with autism that have IQ scores that would define them as having intellectual disability, but their adaptive scores are higher,” said a co-author of the research, Maureen Durkin, a professor of population health sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
David Mandell, a psychiatry professor at the University of Pennsylvania who wasn’t involved in the analysis, said adaptive scores are designed to catch severe cases like the ones Kennedy described. Compared with IQ scores, they offer a better picture of how children with autism function in real life, he said — such as whether they can speak to others, dress themselves or use the bathroom on their own.
According to the analysis, 1.2 out of 1,000 children had autism with moderate or significant impairment in 2016, compared with 1.5 out of 1,000 in 2000. By contrast, mild cases rose 139% during that period — from 3.1 out of 1,000 to 7.3 out of 1,000.
“The increase is in kids who are less severely impaired. It would be really good if the current secretary of HHS knew that,” said Marianne Barton, a clinical professor of psychological sciences at the University of Connecticut, who wasn’t involved in the research.
The Department of Health and Human Services didn’t respond to a request for comment.
One possible explanation for the rise in mild cases, Durkin said, is that doctors have gotten better at identifying mild symptoms. Developmental screenings became more common over the study period, and the American Academy of Pediatrics began recommending universal screenings specifically for autism in 2006.
The diagnostic criteria for autism also changed in 2013 to include milder cases, such as the condition formerly known as Asperger’s.
“We are seeing the extraordinary expansion of the diagnostic criteria to include people who never would have met criteria for autism 50 years ago,” Mandell said.
Dr. Alex Kolevzon, clinical director of the Seaver Autism Center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said that since the analysis is based on health and school records rather than in-person diagnoses, it’s possible it may include some children with mild symptoms who don’t have autism at all.
“When you look at this group that we are probably pretty confident in the diagnosis, you’re not seeing an increase in prevalence,” he said.
Kennedy has decried that theory, suggesting that only “small slivers” of rising cases are attributable to increased diagnoses.
“The media has bought into this industry canard, this mythology that we’re just seeing more autism because we’re noticing it more,” he told Fox News host Sean Hannity this month.
Instead, Kennedy has said without evidence that an environmental toxin is driving up cases, and he tasked CDC scientists with identifying a catalyst by September — a feat outside researchers say is unrealistic unless the CDC already has a predetermined conclusion.
Kolevzon said that it’s possible that something in the environment could aggravate underlying genetic risks for autism but that existing research hasn’t pointed to any culprits yet.","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","April 30, 2025, 9:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/taking-fewer-medications-key-lowering-drug-costs-us-rcna203539,Is taking fewer medications the key to lowering drug costs in the U.S.?,Health news,"In recent weeks, top health officials have floated an idea for bringing down prescription drug costs in the United States: getting Americans to take fewer medications.
Health policy experts say that while the goal is reasonable, the approach places too much blame on patients and overlooks key issues with drug pricing.
“We need new approaches,” Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said last week at an event on food dyes, discussing the “alarming” rate of cancer and diabetes in young people. “Let’s not forget that the best way to lower drug prices is to stop taking drugs we don’t need.”
Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, made a similar point at a White House event celebrating his confirmation. “Healthy people don’t consume health care resources,” Oz said. “The best way to reduce drug spending is to use less drugs because you don’t need them, because you’re healthy.”
Chronic disease has been a particular focus for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is planning to launch an ad campaign called “Take Back Your Health.” One part of the campaign will ask Americans to pledge to eat healthier and exercise as a way to address the country’s chronic health problems. Beyond the anticipated campaign, the White House hasn’t yet publicly laid out a strategy for lowering chronic disease rates.
About 3 in 4 adults in the U.S. had at least one chronic disease in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The prevalence of chronic conditions among young adults, in particular, has risen sharply over the last decade, from 52.5% in 2013 to 59.5% in 2023. Chronic diseases, such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes, cost the U.S. trillions of dollars a year in medical care and prescription drugs.
Studies show that healthier people with fewer chronic conditions typically have lower medical costs. However, experts argue that health officials are missing two key points: many people rely on prescription drugs for conditions that have nothing to do with lifestyle choices, and drug prices are much higher in the U.S. than in other countries.
“We have the highest drug prices in the world, and when that’s the case, you’re going to be spending a lot on drugs, regardless of whether you’re healthier or sicker,” said Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
Stacie Dusetzina, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said that even if people in the U.S. had “every tool at their disposal” to live healthier lives, they would still get sick.
“People should not be blamed for their need of medication,” she said.
The pronouncements, experts say, echo Kennedy’s view that Americans are overmedicated.
Kennedy has questioned the safety and effectiveness of antidepressants, referring to them as potentially more difficult to stop taking than heroin— a claim that isn’t supported by research. He’s also been critical of the extremely popular diabetes and weight loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy, telling  Fox News in October that companies are “counting on selling it to Americans because we’re so stupid and so addicted to drugs.” (He later walked back those comments, telling CNBC in December, “the first line of response should be lifestyle, it should be eating well, making sure that you don’t get obese, and that those GLP drugs have a place.”) Earlier this month, the Trump administration said it wouldn’t move forward with a proposal by the Biden administration for Medicare to cover weight loss drugs.
While the push to make Americans healthier isn’t “a bad motivation,” Dusetzina questioned whether people using fewer drugs would indeed lower costs.
“We wouldn’t be changing how pharma prices their medications specifically,” she said. “If we stopped using as many drugs, there’s nothing necessarily to say that companies won’t just re-price their drugs.”
Dusetzina noted the Trump administration’s self-responsibility approach to lower drug costs is a shift from the Biden administration’s strategy, which focused on going after drugmakers through policies targeting their pricing or the out-of-pocket costs that consumers pay.
Then-President Joe Biden, through the Inflation Reduction Act, lowered the out-of-pocket cost of insulin to $35 a month for people on Medicare — a move that pressured drug companies to do the same for those on private insurance.
The law also required drug companies to pay a fee if they raised the prices of their drugs faster than the rate of inflation.
Most notably, it allowed Medicare to negotiate prices on the costliest prescription drugs people take directly with drugmakers. (It remains unclear whether the Trump administration will ramp up the negotiations or scale them back.)
Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health policy research group, said few would disagree with the idea that lifestyle changes — such as better nutrition and more exercise — would make Americans healthier and reduce health care costs.
“But,” he added, “the anti-pharma rhetoric threatens to obscure the fact that there are chronic illnesses that people can’t control through behavior change,” including Type 1 diabetes, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and certain cancers.
Gaffney, of Harvard Medical School, said the idea that high drug costs in the U.S. are mainly due to American’s poor health choices is “just not true.”
A recent report by 46brooklyn, a nonprofit group that tracks U.S. drug pricing, found that drugmakers raised the net prices — the cost after rebates and discounts to insurers— on 963 brand name drugs in the January 2025, up from 896 in January 2024.
The drugs included Stelara, used to treat autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis; Revcovi, for a rare immune deficiency disorder called ADA-SCID; Nexavar, used to treat liver, kidney and thyroid cancers; and Januvia, used to help manage blood sugar in people with Type 2 diabetes.
“The whole framing I find perverse,” Gaffney said.
An HHS spokesperson said in a statement that the Trump administration is “committed to lowering the cost of prescription drugs and helping Americans regain and maintain their health.”
“By advancing pro-patient, pro-innovation policies and cutting unnecessary red tape, we are working to make life-saving treatments more affordable and accessible — without compromising safety or quality,” the spokesperson said.
Gaffney said that he would like the health officials to move away from the rhetoric that taking medications is inherently bad.
He noted that many older adults, even those who exercise and eat well, still have difficulty controlling their blood pressure and rely on medications to live. If they didn’t take them, they would likely end up in the hospital with heart attack or stroke, ballooning health care costs.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","April 30, 2025, 5:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/florida-water-fluoridation-political-fluoride-kennedy-rcna200645,When the F-word is 'fluoride.' Health experts worry they're in a losing battle to defend it.,Health news,"Florida moved closer to becoming the second state to ban the long-standing practice of adding fluoride to public water systems. State lawmakers supported a bill to ban the cavity-fighting mineral on Tuesday, with the state House voting 88-27.
The word “fluoride” isn’t found anywhere in the Florida Farm Bill SB700, but it would be included because the legislation aims to ban “the use of certain additives in a water system” throughout the state.
If Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signs the bill, which he is widely expected to do, Florida will become the second to ban fluoride from water supplies. Utah’s Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, signed a bill in late March that prohibits any person or government entity from adding the mineral from the state’s water systems. The Utah rule will go into effect May 7.
Similar legislation is making its way through other states, including Kentucky, Massachusetts and Nebraska.
In Wisconsin, nearly 80 communities have already voted to stop adding fluoride, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources, and others in the state are considering bans. And Union County in North Carolina voted last year to remove fluoride from drinking water.
Like the anti-vaccine movement, the push to pull fluoride from water has been gaining momentum for several decades. It’ has grown more powerful with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy said this month he was planning to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending that fluoride be added to water supplies.
The CDC doesn’t make official recommendations about fluoride, however. Those come from the U.S. Public Health Service, composed of members from various federal health public health agencies.
Kennedy also said, without providing evidence, that “we know that there is no systemic advantage” to preventing tooth decay by drinking fluoridated water. “You can achieve that benefit from brushing teeth.”
Water fluoridation has long been heralded as one of the top public health initiatives of the last century for its ability to drive down tooth decay.
While defending fluoride in a Florida Senate debate earlier this month, Sen. Tina Scott Polsky, a Democrat, said, “Find me a dentist who thinks we should get rid of fluoride.” The bill passed the Senate on April 16.
Lorna Koci, head of the Utah Oral Health Coalition, an advocacy group that promotes oral health initiatives among Medicaid beneficiaries, said the movement against fluoride has nothing to do with health and science. “It really is a political issue,” she said.
Kennedy, who has no training in medicine or dentistry, has previously referred to fluoride as “industrial waste” on the social media platform X and said on MSNBC that the faster the mineral goes away, the better.
Historically, dentists and other oral health experts would have been vocal defenders of fluoride. Now, many feel that they’re in a losing battle against the anti-fluoride movement and worry about speaking publicly in favor of the mineral.
“It’s like a four-letter word,” a public health dentist in the Southeast said. The mere mention of fluoride, even in the context of public education, is forbidden by superiors, the staffer said.
“We can’t defend the science we believe in,” said another public health dentist in the Upper Midwest. Opposition to both fluoride and vaccines has become more vocal locally because of what’s happening on the national level, he said. “It’s basically giving them a boost.” Public health dentists work with a state or county to increase dental care access in underserved communities and promote oral health overall.
Last month, the Trump administration pulled more than $11 billion earmarked for state public health departments. As part of the mass layoffs at health agencies ordered by Kennedy, HHS gutted the CDC’s oral health division, which provides funds to states and local jurisdictions to promote good dental health practices, including the use of fluoride.
Dentists argue that while fluoridated toothpaste is critical in preventing cavities, underserved communities may not be able to afford it. Many, they say, are unable to go to a dentist for fluoride treatments.
Dr. Johnny Johnson, a pediatric dentist and president of the American Fluoridation Society, a fluoride advocacy group, said legislators opposed to water fluoridation “need to be skewered over total disregard for our residents’ health.”
An HHS spokesman didn’t respond to a question about how the federal government might address those disparities.
Speaking publicly about the benefits of the mineral might result in a target on the backs of health departments already strapped for cash, fluoride advocates say.
A year ago, “fluoride was fine to bring up” in discussions with public health leaders, said Koci.
Now, “I think many people in public health are feeling like they need to just lay low. It’s probably very risky to be taking a position on a topic that is so political and controversial.”
Major public health groups, including the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC, support the use of fluoridated water. All cite studies that show it reduces tooth decay by 25%.
More than a dozen jurisdictions in Florida, including Seminole County, had already banned water fluoridation despite decades of the mineral being safely used in the water supply and evidence that it fights cavities.
In November 2024, the state’s surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, said communities should stop adding fluoride to drinking water because of what he called “neuropsychiatric risk.”
Similar to the anti-vaccine movement, which has focused on widely debunked research associating the mumps, measles and rubella shots with autism, groups opposed to fluoride tend to seize on a study that suggests the mineral is a neurotoxin that lowers children’s level of intelligence.
A study published in 2019 suggested that IQ levels were slightly lower in kids whose mothers had higher measures of fluoride in their urine during pregnancy. The research was far from conclusive.
Other studies looking at how fluoride affects children’s brains have been called “low quality” by health scientists and were conducted in other countries.
Another public health dentist said that faced with extensive funding cuts for any public health measures, fluoride isn’t “the hill they want to die on.”
Dentists predict they’ll see a jump in dental decay, especially among kids, in the coming years.
Dr. Tom Reid, president of the Wisconsin Dental Association, said that within the next three to five years, those towns can expect to see a significant increase in rates of tooth decay.
“It’s disheartening,” Reid said. Dentists aren’t pushing for fluoride for their own benefit, he said. “We’re really trying to act in what is the best for the health of our patients, for the health of our communities.”
It’s what happened in the Canadian city of Calgary, for example, after leaders there voted to remove fluoride from public water in 2011. A decade later, they voted to reinstate community water fluoridation amid a significant rise in cavities among kids.
In Seminole County, Florida, which voted earlier this month to get fluoride out of the water system, utilities director Johnny Edwards said during the meeting that it would save the county at least $100,000.","Erika Edwards, Erika Edwards","April 26, 2025, 6:39 PM GMT+8 / Updated April 30, 2025, 3:23 AM GMT+8"

Kennedy Jr. plans to launch a sweeping, four-year public relations campaign called “Take Back Your Health” that could cost tens of millions of dollars, according to a document obtained by NBC News.
Kennedy is conducting sweeping budget cuts that could eliminate 10,000 jobs and several HHS divisions, including global health and domestic HIV prevention.
The document, a request for proposals, calls for public relations firms to bid to run the campaign. The winning firm would employ up to 30 people to manage the campaign and oversee the purchase of up to three ads a day on five major television networks.
The total dollar amount for the campaign is not listed in the document. A person familiar with the campaign said labor costs are expected to be at least $20 million and estimated that television and digital ad purchases could cost tens of millions over the next four years.
An HHS official praised the initiative.
“Empowering Americans with the knowledge to make healthy decisions is central to HHS’s mission. Our upcoming ad campaign is both an investment in our nation’s wellbeing and a commitment to Make America Healthy Again,"" the official said in a statement. ""While HHS has not disclosed specific costs for the initiative, the competitive RFP process is designed to ensure funds are used wisely and deliver the greatest return on investment for the American people.”
The campaign will seek to address Americans' chronic health problems by inspiring them to ""take control of their health” and pledge to adopt healthier habits like eating well and exercising, according to the document. The campaign will also create a fitness challenge expanding the Presidential Youth Fitness Program to adults.
Richard Frank, director of the Brookings Institution’s Center on Health Policy, said the campaign's messages sounded positive and reminiscent of previous federal public health campaigns.
Frank, who learned about the plan from NBC News, also cautioned that some people's incomes and socioeconomic statuses limit their ability to eat healthier organic food and exercise more often.
Frank cited people who live in “food deserts” where healthy and affordable food is not easily available. “They don’t have a lot of fresh foods and vegetables,” he said. “And no amount of ads will fix that problem.”
The “Take the Pledge” feature of the campaign will include “shareable badges,” as well as partnerships with gyms, health stores and wellness centers, according to the document.
The document does not mention accompanying funding for recreational activities or physical education, but it does seek to promote “clean eating” and “spiritual growth.”
One example of how the campaign could encourage healthier and different food choices was described as creating a partnership “with a grocery chain to promote healthy eating by providing discounts on nutritious foods alongside campaign messaging.”
The success of the campaign will be measured by audience reach, engagement, shift in perception and behavior change, according to the document.
Surveys and polls will be conducted to measure behavior change. Participants will be asked to self-report whether they took actions such as “exercising more, eating more whole food, incorporating meditation into daily routine.”
HHS is also exploring ways to promote healthy messages across its headquarters, which sits at the foot of Capitol Hill. A recent “request for information” the department posted online calls for bids to produce a graphic vinyl wrap that could encase the building and display a message to ""promote a healthy America.”
The Take Back Your Health campaign is reminiscent of former first lady Michelle Obama’s 2010 “Let’s Move” campaign. That effort aimed to combat childhood obesity by promoting healthy eating and physical activity. It also included a website and a reboot of the presidential physical fitness program.","Laura Strickler, Laura Strickler","April 30, 2025, 12:16 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/why-life-expectancy-varies-us-women-study-rcna203396,Life expectancy for women in some Southern states has barely budged in more than 100 years,Health news,"How long you live depends on where you live, new research suggests.
Americans’ life expectancy increased throughout the 20th century, although in some states, particularly in the South, people aren’t living much longer than they were 100 years ago. It’s worse among women.
Researchers at the Yale School of Public Health analyzed the death data of 77 million women and 102 million men born from 1900 through 2000. The findings, published Monday in the journal JAMA Network Open, showed that nationwide life expectancy for women increased from 73.8 to 84.1 in that time frame, while it jumped from 62.8 to 80.3 for men.
Scientists and health officials calculate life expectancy at birth as a way of understanding a country’s health over time. How long people in the United States lived since the last century varied drastically by state.
“What was surprising to me was that for some states, especially for women, there’s basically no change,” said study co-author Theodore Holford, a senior research scientist in biostatistics at Yale University. “Over 100 years, in some of these Southern states, they improved less than two years in the framework of all of the medical advances that we have seen during the 20th century.”
The bottom five states for life expectancy among women born in 2000, compared to women born in 1900, are:
Southern men born in 2000 also tended to have lower life expectancies, though they showed greater improvements than women since 1900:
Not all Southern states show lower or stalled life expectancies for people born in 2000.
Florida, Texas and Virginia are among the Southern states featured in the top 20 of life expectancy for both men and women born in 2000.
States outside the South that ranked in the bottom 10 for both sexes include Ohio and Indiana.
The study also highlights life expectancy by state and sex at the midway point of 1950.
Men in particular showed greater improvement during the first half of the century. In North Dakota, for example, male life expectancy jumped 10 years from 66.4 in 1900 to 76.5 in 1950, but only one year, 77.8, from 1950 to 2000.
Data reflects the state in which a person died, not where they were born.
It’s well-established that women live longer than men, but this latest research unveils geographic disparities in life expectancy at a turning point in federal public health administration. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. lamented the state of the nation’s health care system in an April 10 statement that was also published in the New York Post.
“Our country’s health is declining. America has the highest rates of chronic disease in the world,” Kennedy said. “We rank last in terms of health among developed nations. And life expectancy is declining for many groups of Americans.”
The Yale study claims to be the first to analyze historic state mortality trends by birth cohort, meaning entire generations are tracked.
Population health research more commonly involves a metric called period life expectancy, which estimates influences on mortality over a select year, such as during a pandemic.
“The idea here is to try to pick up on generational factors,” Holford said. “There are lots of factors related to health that are more closely tied to generations than a calendar year.”
Cindy Prins, an associate professor in the department of population health sciences at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine, who wasn’t involved in the study, said, “This is a unique and important approach to examining life expectancies.”
That doesn’t make the data any less alarming.
“It’s concerning to know that cohort life expectancies in many Southern states, which have the lowest overall life expectancies, haven’t changed much over time,” Prins said.
Overall, Americans are living longer, thanks to improvements in health care, sanitation, tobacco control, and the prevention of cancer, heart disease and other diseases, the study said. Previous research indicates that states with progressive public health policies are more likely to have higher life expectancies. Socioeconomic differences among states also impact longevity.
Dr. Marc Gourevitch, a professor in the department of population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, said research shows that states with policies that support a more livable minimum wage and paid sick leave, as well as access to affordable medical care, are more likely to show significant life expectancy gains over time.
“Focusing on policies that help people better meet their everyday needs promises to go a long way in improving life expectancy and, with it, giving more people a chance at getting to watch their grandchildren grow,” said Gourevitch, who wasn’t involved in the Yale study.
Women born in 2000 in the District of Columbia have both the highest life expectancy, 93 years, and the biggest improvement since 1900, when life expectancy was 63.9. Similarly, D.C. men born in 2000 have the third-highest life expectancy of 86.5 years, up from 48.7 at the start of the century.
“Urban areas tend to do a lot better than rural areas, presumably because of differences in access to health care,” Holford said of people living longer in the nation’s capital.
Another change is the mix of the population in the District of Columbia.
“Many more people moving into the area who would have a lot of the monetary advantages that would give them better access to things affecting their health,” Holford said.
States with the longest life expectancies for women born in 2000 spanned both coasts and beyond the continental U.S.:
Other than D.C., these states show the longest life expectancy among men born in 2000:
Holford said the Yale study is part of his work with the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET). A goal of this and other CISNET research is to help health departments address state-specific disparities.
One downside to implementing promising public health policies, Holford said, is that it can take years  — even generations — to measure their effects.",Unknown,"April 29, 2025, 10:52 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/women-survive-cancer-are-likely-fatigue-depression-men-rcna203376,Women who survive cancer are more likely than men to have fatigue and depression,Cancer,"Women who survive cancer are more likely to experience cancer-related fatigue and depression than men, according to new research presented Tuesday at the American Association for Cancer Research’s annual meeting in Chicago.
As a result, women are less likely to engage in recreational physical activity, which over time exacerbates their symptoms and lowers their quality of life, the research suggests.
The new findings build on previous research that found women develop more severe side effects during cancer treatment than men. They also underscore the “very real consequences” that cancer treatment can have for women after they’ve entered remission, said Joseph Unger, a biostatician and cancer researcher with the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle who was not involved in the study.
“Cancer treatments are becoming more effective at keeping patients alive and turning cancer into more of a chronic disease,” said Unger, who studies cancer patients’ quality of life. “Understandably, patients don’t want to just live, they want to live well. So, that’s really where this research helps to point us in the next direction.”
Dr. Simo Du, lead author of the study and internal medicine resident physician at NYC Health + Hospitals/Jacobi, had noticed that many more female than male cancer survivors in her clinic were complaining of fatigue that made it hard to shop for groceries, get dressed, shower and do other social or hygiene-related activities.
To better understand how this disparity affected patients’ quality of life, Du and her colleagues analyzed responses from 1,555 adult cancer survivors that were included in the 2015-2016 and 2017-2020 cohorts of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
Participants answered questions about whether they feel hopeless, deal with poor appetite, experience trouble sleeping and have thoughts of self-harm. They also completed questionnaires about the type of physical activities they participate in.
Overall, the researchers said, the responses could be extrapolated to 25 million survivors with over 20 different types of cancer across the U.S., including those of the prostate, breast, skin, colon and cervix.
The findings have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
The study found that, compared with male survivors, female cancer survivors were 69% more likely to report cancer-related fatigue and 58% more likely to report depression.
While fatigue is already known to affect more than 80% of people with cancer, the study found that women were 1.5 times more likely than men to experience it.
Cancer treatments affect the entire body, as they can kill both cancerous and healthy cells, said Carolyn Gotay, cancer researcher and professor emeritus of population and public health at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who was not involved in the study. These effects can persist for months to years after treatment is done, she said, leaving survivors with a host of health issues from deafness to infertility.
Cancer-related fatigue and depression can be caused by cancer itself or the other medical conditions it causes, according to the National Cancer Institute. The emotional impact of dealing with the disease can also cause these symptoms.
Why women bear the brunt of these effects remains unclear, although experts have some theories.
Research shows that women have stronger immune responses to treatments, which causes greater inflammation. Women also tend to clear drugs from their bodies more slowly than men, Du said, leading to higher concentrations of medications in their system and thus worse symptoms. It’s possible, too, that differences in body size affect how drugs and radiation are distributed and absorbed in women’s bodies.
Women are also more likely to develop cancers that are treated with hormone therapies that can contribute greatly to fatigue and depression, Du said. Some of these therapies, like tamoxifen that’s used to treat some breast cancers, are taken for five to 10 years after remission to lower the chances the cancer returns, according to the American Cancer Society.
That said, women are more likely to report fatigue and depression even without a cancer diagnosis, Gotay said, so it’s possible that sex-related hormone differences might better explain why women experience more of these symptoms from the start.
Du said that it’s also possible social gender norms play a role. Women typically have more caretaker responsibilities like tending to children and chores that can increase stress and contribute to fatigue and depression, she said.
Notably, the study found that men were more likely to have thoughts “that they would be better off dead,” Du said. This finding mirrors other data that shows suicide rates are generally higher in men than in women. Du speculated that social norms, namely expectations that men should be able to provide for their families, could be to blame.
The study also found that, among all cancer survivors, those who did moderate physical activity such as walking or cycling had a 50% lower risk of cancer-related fatigue. Those who participated in more vigorous activity didn’t see any improvements in their energy, Du said.
Meanwhile, both moderate and vigorous activity was associated with a two- to five-fold decrease in depression risk, according to the research.
Overall, the results suggest that post-cancer therapy programs should prioritize exercise. A 2024 review of 113 randomized controlled trials came to similar conclusions, and found that exercise, along with cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based programs, improved cancer-related fatigue both during and after cancer treatment.
“We always prescribe medications” to help cancer survivors cope with lingering symptoms, Du said. “But for cancer-related fatigue, exercise may actually work better than pharmaceutical interventions.”
Even still, exercise may be a bandage solution, Unger said, treating just the symptom and not the root cause. Future research needs to investigate why women experience worse side effects after cancer so they can benefit from more effective treatment options.
In the meantime, Gotay said she hopes the study helps normalize the idea that it’s OK to not feel OK after surviving cancer, which can be tough for many survivors to understand and accept.",Unknown,"April 29, 2025, 9:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-appears-slow-walking-vaccine-approvals-rcna202596,FDA appears to be slow-walking vaccine approvals,Health news,"Former government health officials fear the Trump administration is moving to slow-walk vaccine approvals, including by imposing new regulatory hurdles on drugmakers, such as changing the requirements for approval or seeking additional clinical trial data.
The Food and Drug Administration confirmed Monday it was requiring drugmaker Novavax to run another clinical trial as part of the approval process for its Covid vaccine, which has been available under emergency use authorization since 2022. Dr. Marty Makary, the FDA’s commissioner, said the company is asking the agency to approve “a new product” based on old data.
Novavax’s shot uses traditional protein-based vaccine technology and is the only alternative to the mRNA shots from Pfizer and Moderna. The drugmaker’s application to the FDA was based on a 30,000-person randomized clinical trial conducted in 2021 in the U.S. and Mexico.
The agency missed an April 1 deadline decision, prompting concerns among investors that it wouldn’t be approved.
On Saturday, Makary suggested in a post on X that Novavax was seeking approval for a “new” vaccine because the strain used in its trial has since been updated to target a more recent  Covid variant called JN.1.
“Under this administration, we are prioritizing the Gold Standard of Science--not what saves pharma companies ‘tens of millions of dollars,’” Makary said.
Novavax declined to comment on Makary’s remark. In a release issued Monday, Novavax said it responded to an earlier FDA request to commit to providing more data on the vaccine if approved — a standard practice.
Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, criticized the administration’s move, pointing out that the seasonal flu vaccines are updated each year with new strains without the need for new clinical trials. The mRNA Covid vaccines have been similarly updated each year to target the most current strain.
“I mean, how exactly does he propose they do this?” said Offit, who also serves on an independent vaccine advisory committee for the FDA. “It just worries me that it’s part of an overall general strategy to weaken vaccine efforts.”
The FDA directs all media inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services. In a written statement, an HHS spokesperson said the Biden administration waived clinical trial requirements for new Covid vaccines “using the COVID pandemic as an eternal justification for blanket approvals.”
Under Makary, the spokesperson said, trials from four years ago “no longer suffice.”
“With Novavax seeking authorization for a new formulation targeting the JN.1 variant, the public deserves clear answers about its efficacy and if its benefits outweigh the risks,” the spokesperson said.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the FDA’s request for a new clinical trial.
Novavax’s shot isn’t the only Covid vaccine that officials say may be at risk.
Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg, who was announced as a special adviser to Makary earlier this month, has called for more scrutiny of vaccines, telling FDA staff and high-ranking officials in a meeting outlining priorities that the agency would be doing fewer vaccine approvals going forward, according to three former government officials familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.
Høeg, a sports medicine physician, rose to prominence during the pandemic as a vocal critic of the Covid vaccines, particularly for children.
Her appointment added another anti-Covid-vaccine voice to the Trump administration. In 2021, HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described the Covid vaccine as the “deadliest vaccine ever made.” In 2023, Makary and Høeg co-wrote an editorial for the New York Post criticizing the Biden administration’s recommendation of the Covid shot in children.
It’s unclear what role — if any — Høeg played in the FDA imposing an additional requirement for Novavax’s Covid vaccine approval. Høeg did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
There are also concerns about several upcoming FDA deadlines related to Pfizer’s mRNA Covid vaccine, including a decision for the full approval for the shot in children under 11, according to two of the former officials. The vaccine currently has an emergency use authorization for ages 11 and under.
The mRNA vaccines are a particular target among anti-vaccine activists. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are the first-ever approved using mRNA technology, which has led some to claim they pose a unique threat. Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo has railed against mRNA vaccines, alleging they could possibly alter a person’s DNA. Several states have introduced legislation that would ban mRNA vaccines. The CDC says the mRNA Covid vaccines are safe and do not alter DNA; the technology had been studied for decades before its first approval in the U.S. in late 2020.
Last week, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the discussions, that Kennedy is considering pulling the Covid vaccine from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s list of recommended immunizations for children, a move that could affect insurance coverage and influence some pediatricians’ consideration of whether to administer them. NBC News has not independently confirmed the reporting.
Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California Law San Francisco, said that while Covid vaccine uptake in children is low, it’s important for parents to have the option available.
That’s especially true for children with underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable to severe illness and death from the virus, she said.
Experts also worry that a possible bird flu vaccine for people could be at risk. One of the former officials said the FDA previously planned to use an emergency use authorization pathway in case health officials needed to quickly greenlight a shot, but it’s now unclear whether the Trump administration would do the same.
Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who has advised the FDA, said it’ll be important for public health experts to advocate for vaccines, including the Covid shots.
“It’ll be important to have some sort of updated antiviral and Covid vaccine this fall available, and that’s particularly important for the most vulnerable individuals,” Levy said.
Levy — who said he would not prejudge the administration’s potential examination of vaccines — also said common respiratory viruses like the flu and Covid still spread widely, and the public will need vaccines.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Brandy Zadrozny, Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Brandy Zadrozny","April 29, 2025, 5:48 AM GMT+8"

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-patients-immunotherapy-may-way-skip-surgery-chemo-rcna203038,"For some cancer patients, immunotherapy may be way to skip surgery and chemo",Cancer,"Maureen Sideris was driving to Maine for a wedding when she realized she couldn’t swallow the sandwich she was having for lunch.
The 71-year-old was soon diagnosed with gastroesophageal cancer. It was August 2022. The tumor, she said, blocked off a portion of her esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach, making it difficult to swallow food.
The standard treatment approach for esophageal cancer — chemotherapy and radiation, followed by surgery to remove part of the esophagus and stomach  — “is quite devastating,” said Dr. Luis Diaz, the head of solid tumor oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. “One can overcome that, and there’s a new normal after that, but it’s not like what it was before.”
Going through all of those treatments, Sideris said, “would have been horrendous.”
Instead, she received just one treatment — immunotherapy — as part of a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering. It’s been two years since she completed her treatment and she’s in remission.
Diaz, the senior researcher on the clinical trials, said when the first person in the trial responded to the immunotherapy, it was exciting.
“You can say, ‘Hey, you’re done. You don’t need chemotherapy, radiation or surgery,’” Diaz said.
The approach won’t work for everyone. The Phase 2 trial focused on people whose tumors had what’s known as mismatch repair deficiency, a mutation that means mistakes in the DNA aren’t fixed when cancer cells replicate. This leads to even more mutations.
For the treatment to work, “the tumors need to have this mutation,” said Dr. Andrea Cercek of Memorial Sloan Kettering. Cercek led the clinical trial and presented the findings at the American Association for Cancer Research’s annual meeting on Sunday in Chicago. The research was simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Mismatch repair deficiency occurs more frequently in some cancers than in others. About 16% of ovarian cancers and as much as 30% of endometrial cancers have the mutation, compared to 10%-20% of colorectal cancers. Between 8% and 22% of nonmetastatic gastroesophageal cancers are mismatch repair deficient.
Immunotherapy drugs work by teaching a person’s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. The drugs have been found to work particularly well against tumors with mismatch repair deficiencies, because the many mutations provide more targets for immune cells.
However, the drugs typically aren’t used as a first-line treatment for these cancers. Instead, they’re brought in if approaches like chemotherapy and radiation don’t work, or if a cancer returns or has already spread.
The new trial expanded on a smaller study from Cercek that used the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab as the first treatment in 12 people with rectal cancers that were advanced but had not spread elsewhere in the body. All of the people’s tumors had mismatch repair deficiencies. Everyone underwent immunotherapy treatment for at least six months. At the end of that time, all 12 had a complete response, meaning there was no evidence of the tumor remaining. None of them had to undergo other cancer treatments that would usually be used to treat these types of cancer, including surgery.
The researchers started with rectal cancers because the treatments, and in particular the surgery, can be life-changing. Surgery may involve removing the rectum — the final portion of the large intestine before the anus. Patients who undergo this surgery must have a colostomy, an operation where the intestine is rerouted to a hole made in the abdomen for stool to pass out of the body into what’s known as an ostomy bag. “This will have a significant impact on your quality of life,” Diaz said.
The second part of the trial expanded the treatment to more people, including patients with other cancers known to have mismatch repair deficiencies, including cancers of the esophagus; endometrium; kidney and ureters; and liver, gallbladder and bile ducts. Everyone enrolled in the trial had early-stage cancer, meaning it hadn’t spread to other organs.
Sideris was one of the first people with a noncolorectal cancer to be cleared for the treatment in the trial.
During her first appointment, Sideris was hooked up to an IV that dripped the immunotherapy into her bloodstream. “Within 45 minutes, it’s done,” she said.
Sideris repeated the process every three weeks over the next six months as Cercek and her team enrolled other people who had recently been diagnosed with cancer. They were divided into two categories: those with colorectal cancers, and those with the other types.
The first group, rectal cancers, included 49 patients who completed six months of immunotherapy. All of them responded to the therapy and didn’t need surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. About 75% of them were still cancer-free a year or more after completing the treatment.
In the second group, 54 people completed the six-month treatment, and 35 — about 61% — had complete responses and didn’t need to undergo further treatment. The researchers didn't look at data on the patients’ 12-month results.
Sideris said she’s grateful she didn’t have to endure the side effects of chemotherapy, but the immunotherapy did cause adrenal insufficiency, a known side effect of the drug. She’s now taking medication to manage the condition.
Still, Sideris said, “it was like winning the lottery.”
Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic, cautioned that mismatch repair deficiencies only account for “1%-2% of cancers at most.”
“Unfortunately, this is not going to be something that is a cure-all,” he said.
But for people who do have this type of cancer, the findings offer substantial hope: Cancer surgery can often be “life-altering,” Kamath said. “A huge number might not need surgery at all and can be cured from the immunotherapy alone.”
Diaz said that for patients with mismatch repair deficiency, it may be possible to avoid 80% of operations.
Being able to preserve people’s organs by avoiding surgery can have a huge effect on quality of life. Depending on the surgery, patients could experience sexual dysfunction, loss of bowel control, acid reflux and infertility. Chemotherapy and radiation can also hurt fertility. This is particularly important at a time when more young people are being diagnosed with cancer, Cercek said.
The research also suggests that immunotherapy could possibly be used as a first-line treatment for early-stage mismatch repair deficient cancers.
“Immune therapies have a ton of potential. This shows we might be able to start with that,” said Dr. Heather Yeo, a surgical oncologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.
Diaz said that while larger studies are needed to confirm the trial’s findings, using immunotherapy in place of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy may not be far off for certain patients.
“I think it’s a short step from this report to application of standard of care,” he said.","Marina Kopf, Marina Kopf","April 28, 2025, 12:00 AM GMT+8 / Updated April 28, 2025, 9:34 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/health-program-911-illnesses-faces-uncertain-future-federal-staffing-c-rcna202980,Health program for 9/11 illnesses faces uncertain future after federal staffing cuts,Health news,"More than 23 years after the Twin Towers collapsed, blanketing lower Manhattan in toxic dust and debris, the number of people diagnosed with 9/11-related illnesses is still growing.
Since 2011, the main resource for people exposed to the fumes has been the World Trade Center Health Program, which covers treatment for cancer, asthma and post-traumatic stress disorder, among other health conditions.
Of the roughly 132,000 people enrolled in the program as of December, 64% have at least one condition linked to 9/11. Cancer is the most common, affecting more than 40,000 members. Some people join the program after illnesses have developed, while others join to receive annual screenings that could detect illnesses in the future.
The program’s fate has seesawed over the past 10 weeks as the Trump administration fired and rehired certain staffers, only to terminate them again last month, according to lawyers and advocates for people with 9/11-related exposures. They added that the staffing cuts have made it harder to enroll members or confirm that their treatment is covered by federal funding.
“These cuts are going to potentially delay treatment, delay diagnosis and early detection of their cancers, and it’s going to cost lives,” said Todd Cleckley, a nurse medical specialist at Barasch & McGarry, a law firm representing 9/11 responders and survivors.
“The health program already operated on a very slim staffing margin,” he added. “We’re only beginning to see what those negative impacts will be.”
Sixteen of the program’s staffers were swept up in the Trump administration’s firing of probationary workers in February. The administration reinstated the positions roughly a week later, following outcry from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
Then, in late March, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it was laying off around 20,000 federal employees. Those layoffs again included 16 staffers at the World Trade Center Health Program, plus the program’s director, according to lawyers and advocates. The director was reinstated on April 5 after more bipartisan opposition, they said, but the staffers were not.
The HHS layoffs were part of a massive restructuring that gutted the agency responsible for the World Trade Center program, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In addition to the 16 staffers, HHS terminated other institute employees in charge of certifying that patients’ 9/11-related illnesses were eligible for federal funding, lawyers and advocates said.
“They weren’t on the World Trade Center Program payroll, but they did things that are essential to the program running,” said Benjamin Chevat, executive director of 9/11 Health Watch, a nonprofit group that helps ensure people have access to the program’s services.
Lawyers and advocates plan to visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday to ask lawmakers to reinstate staffers. HHS did not respond to a request for comment.
New York City Mayor Eric Adams said that his office has reached out to the federal government “about restoring these important resources.”
“New York City is dedicated to providing quality health care to the heroes who responded on 9/11 and the survivors of the most tragic day in America’s history,” Adams said in a statement. “Our partnership with the federal government to deliver these services is vital, providing access to life-saving, time-sensitive treatment for every firefighter, police officer, volunteer, and everyday New Yorkers who remember that day, and remember what it took to rebuild the next morning.”
Before the staffing cuts, 9/11 responders and people who lived, worked or attended school or day care in the disaster area could apply to join the program and typically get accepted within a few weeks. But Chevat said no one has been enrolled since April 1. The program usually enrolls around 200 people per month, on average.
Michael Barasch, a partner at Barasch & McGarry, said he’s still submitting applications on behalf of his clients, but “they’re not hearing from the health program, so we don’t know if or when they will ever get an appointment.”
Members of the program receive annual screenings at certified health clinics, which are largely concentrated in the New York area. There, doctors evaluate people for a host of mental and physical illnesses with known ties to 9/11. If a doctor determines there’s a link, the clinic submits paperwork to federal employees, who must certify that the condition is eligible for funding before patients can be treated at no cost. More than 8,200 cancer diagnoses were certified last year.
New certifications haven’t been issued since the start of April, shortly after HHS announced it was dismantling NIOSH, Chevat said.
The delays could have dire consequences for people who were exposed to toxic dust and debris, lawyers and advocates said. Many cancers — once identified — must be treated right away.
“You’ll never hear me say something inflammatory just to make a headline, but it is a fact: People will die because of these decisions,” Barasch said.
The collapse of the Twin Towers released cancer-causing chemicals such as asbestos, benzene and dioxins that lingered in the air for days to weeks. A 10-year study found an elevated risk of leukemia and prostate and thyroid cancers among rescue and recovery workers who responded to the disaster. Other cancers, such as lung cancer and mesothelioma, may develop decades after exposure to asbestos, so future diagnoses are expected.
“We were breathing in glass and asbestos and everything else that you could imagine,” said Michael O’Connell, who assisted with search-and-rescue operations as an early-career firefighter after 9/11. “We slept in it, we ate in it, we bled in it. We didn’t leave it. We were in that zone for almost nine months.”
Roughly six years later, O’Connell was diagnosed with a rare inflammatory disease called sarcoidosis that caused debilitating pain in his joints and skin. He received treatment through the World Trade Center Health Program, which he credits for helping him manage his symptoms. The idea that new members might not be able to enroll or receive treatment is “deeply disturbing,” he said.
If the NIOSH staffers aren’t reinstated, lawyers and advocates said, hospitals may not get reimbursed for chemotherapy or surgeries and eventually may stop offering them to patients. Barasch said he has already received calls from clients worried about whether they can continue to get chemo.
‘“It’s bureaucratic cruelty,” he said. “They’re trying to save money, which is fine, but don’t do it on the backs of the 9/11 community.”
Mariama James, a lower Manhattan resident who was pregnant with her third child during 9/11, said she has been waiting to see if the program will cover a treatment for her sleep apnea. She now expects that process to be delayed.
“How are they going to get a new medication covered if the doctors from NIOSH have been fired?” James said. “I’ll be waiting forever for that medication.”
The World Trade Center Health Program was already vulnerable before the layoffs due to budgetary constraints, Barasch added. In December, Congress opted not to include a long-term funding package for the program in a bipartisan spending deal. Several lawmakers anticipate that the budget shortfall could force the program to close enrollment or scale back treatment for current members starting in October 2028. A bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate in February calls for more funding to be made available until the program expires in 2090.","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","April 27, 2025, 12:30 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/medicaid-kids-cancer-trump-budget-cuts-rcna199970,Parents of kids with cancer fear GOP budget cuts could slash Medicaid,Health Care,"Tony, an energetic 7-year-old who loves playing football and roughhousing with his brothers wasn’t all that excited when his parents took the family to see Santa in December. Instead, he was tired and lethargic.
His parents were surprised because Tony would usually be bouncing off the walls at the prospect of seeing Santa.
Tony had been feeling under the weather for a few weeks, and his pediatrician diagnosed him with a virus and bronchitis. But after the visit to Santa near their home in Wesley Chapel, Florida, Pauline McLaurin says, her mother’s intuition told it was something more serious.
She took her son directly to the emergency room, and her gut instinct was right: Tony had leukemia. From there, things got worse.
Tony has been in and out of the hospital, his body weakened by chemotherapy. Pauline McLaurin quit her job as a fifth-grade teacher to care for him, and they struggle to pay their bills on the salary her husband, Ronnie McLaurin, makes as an electrician.
As if that weren’t enough, the McLaurins have a new worry. They lost their private insurance when Pauline McLaurin left her job, and now they fear losing their Medicaid, the government health insurance program that pays for Tony’s care.
Medicaid insures 1 out of 3 children diagnosed with cancer in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network.
President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have called for dramatic government budget cuts that many nonpartisan experts say are unfeasible without significant cuts to Medicaid.
A House Republican budget plan instructs the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, to identify at least $880 billion in mandatory spending cuts over the next 10 years. While the plan doesn’t specifically mention Medicaid, the experts say it would be unfeasible for Republicans to hit that target without significant cuts to the health program, since it’s one of the largest sources of federal spending, costing more than $600 billion per year, according to government data.
Pauline McLaurin said she is “terrified” and “hopeless” at the prospect of losing Medicaid.
“It’s a very scary, uneasy feeling,” she said.
The McLaurins are not alone.
Mary Ann Massolio runs 1Voice Academy, a school for children with cancer, which Tony attends. She says over the past few months, many parents have expressed distress about possibly losing Medicaid.
“It’s anxiety on steroids,” she said.
In February, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups wrote a letter to lawmakers expressing their “grave concerns” about potential Medicaid cuts and “the devastating consequences for millions of children across the country.”
If these Republican budget cuts go through, some children with cancer could die, said Dr. Sharon Castellino, who studies Medicaid as a pediatric oncologist at the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, and a professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine.
“This is a bipartisan issue,” she said. “We’re incredibly worried.”
As of November 2024, Medicaid covers more than 70 million people in the U.S., according to the federal government’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It’s the largest single source of health coverage in the U.S., covering nearly half of all children and more than 40% of births, according to the American Hospital Association.
A 2024 study, conducted by Emory's Castellino and other researchers found that children who experienced interruptions in Medicaid coverage before or during their cancer diagnosis and treatment were less likely to survive the disease, compared to those with continuous coverage.
Republicans say budget cuts can be made without hurting Medicaid.
“Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched,” Trump said in February.
“The president has said repeatedly, we’re not going to hurt Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid recipients who are eligible for it. And that is our guiding north, our true north,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told Punchbowl News last month.
In his rural Louisiana district, nearly 25% of adults under age 65 rely on Medicaid, according to an NBC News analysis.
“I understand this acutely — it directly affects my people. We’re going to be very careful not to cut a benefit for anyone who is eligible to receive it and relies upon it,” Johnson told Punchbowl.
But last month, the Congressional Budget Office, which is nonpartisan, said House Republicans can’t meet their budget target without making significant cuts to Medicaid or Medicare, the nation’s health insurance program for seniors.
In the House, the Medicaid budget falls under the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Republican budget plan instructs that committee to cut spending.
In February, Johnson said that “we’re going to cut the fraud, waste and abuse and that’s where we’re going to get the savings to accomplish this mission.”
It would be very difficult to make the proposed Republican cuts just by targeting fraud, waste and abuse, said Megan Cole Brahim, an associate professor at the Boston University School of Public Health and co-director of the school’s Medicaid Policy Lab.
“This on the surface seems like a reasonable idea — nobody likes fraud, waste or abuse,” she said. “But there is a misalignment between the proposed cuts the Republicans are trying to make [and] the actual scope of fraud and waste.”
Johnson identified another way he intends to save Medicaid dollars.
“You’ve got a lot of able-bodied workers, young men who could be out working, who are choosing not to because they’re on the government wagon,” he told Punchbowl. “I think that’s wrong, and I think if you get those people out of the program — and there’s a large number of them — then you preserve it for the people who actually need it and deserve it.”
Cole Brahim called this a “false narrative,” pointing to a KFF study that shows in 2023, nearly two-thirds of adults ages 19-64 covered by Medicaid were working and nearly 3 in 10 were not working because of caregiving responsibilities, illness or disability, or school attendance.
In the McLaurins’ case, Ronnie McLaurin doesn’t have health insurance through his work as a self-employed electrician.
At this point, the Republican budget proposals are just that — proposals. The House and the Senate each have their own plans, and nothing has been written into law yet. The House Energy and Commerce Committee could meet as early as the week of May 5 to identify the spending cuts that could slash into Medicaid.
That’s why Massolio at the 1Voice Foundation — the group that runs the school Tony attends in Florida — joined a trip to Capitol Hill earlier this year with other advocates to urge lawmakers to keep Medicaid intact.
She says one of her big fears is that even if Medicaid funds for hospital services and doctor visits remain stable, other critical support services might be slashed, such as transportation to doctor's appointments or in-home nursing visits for very sick children.
On her trip to Washington, one of Massolio’s first stops was the office of Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., a familiar face. Massolio’s 9-year-old son, Jay, died from lymphoma in 1997, and she’s often turned to Castor, who is co-chair of the congressional Childhood Cancer Caucus, for help advancing legislation to support children with cancer.
Castor’s message to the group was to keep fighting. She reminded them that in Trump’s first term, he vowed to eliminate the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare — but in the end, after widespread public opposition, it didn’t happen.
There are already tensions within the Republican Party over Medicaid, with some in the party expressing concern that the proposed budget cuts could hurt families on Medicaid.
“Advocacy really matters. This is not a done deal yet,” Castor told NBC. “As they craft policy behind the scenes, I’m really hoping some of these Republican members go and say, ‘I can’t do this. This hurts families. This goes too far.’”
Back in Florida, the McLaurins worry every day that Tony won’t survive, as they struggle to pay their bills and care for their other five children without any family nearby to help.
They don’t know what they’ll do if Tony can’t get Medicaid for the rest of his cancer treatment, which is expected to last another two years.
“I feel hopeless right now, because it’s not like I have a second option,” Pauline McLaurin said.
She hopes Castor is right, and that advocacy will help protect Medicaid.",Unknown,"April 25, 2025, 5:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-young-people-dna-damage-gut-toxin-antibiotics-rcna202572,Gut toxin may be 'critical piece of the puzzle' behind rise in early-onset colorectal cancer,Cancer,"A gut toxin that’s been linked to colorectal cancers for more than two decades may be contributing to the sharp rise of the disease in younger people, according to landmark research published Wednesday in the journal Nature.
A number of species of harmful gut bacteria — including certain strains of E.coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter koseri — produce a toxin called colibactin. Since the mid 2000s, studies have repeatedly shown that this toxin can inflict distinct DNA damage on colon cells that’s difficult to repair and can eventually lead to the development of cancer.
That DNA damage is particularly prominent in people who developed colorectal cancer at a younger age, researchers at the University of California San Diego said Wednesday. The new study sequenced the DNA of colorectal cancer tumors collected from 981 patients in 11 countries around the world, and found that colibactin-related DNA mutations were 3.3 times more common in patients under the age of 40, compared with those over 70.
“Around 50% of early-onset colorectal cancers in individuals under 40 carried the distinctive signature of colibactin exposure,” senior study author Ludmil Alexandrov, a bioengineering and cellular and molecular medicine professor at UC San Diego, said in an email interview.
The finding could have critical implications for public health amid rising rates of colorectal cancer in young people. Two years ago, the American Cancer Society reported that colorectal cancer diagnoses in patients under 55 had doubled between 1995 and 2019, with rates of advanced disease now increasing by roughly 3% every year in people younger than 50. Christopher Johnston, associate professor and director of microbial genomics at MD Anderson Cancer Center, described the connection to colibactin as being potentially crucial to explaining this alarming trend.
“It may be a critical piece of the puzzle,” Johnston, who was not involved with the new research, said.
According to Alexandrov, the new findings indicate that colibactin’s damaging effects begin in childhood, with the initial DNA changes that lead to tumor formation seemingly occurring during the first decade of life. Lifestyle changes over the past 40 years may be predisposing more children to having a greater abundance of colibactin-producing strains of bacteria in their guts.
“There are several plausible hypotheses, including early-life antibiotic use, which may allow these strains to establish more easily; dietary shifts such as increased consumption of processed foods or reduced fiber consumption; increased rates of C-section births or reduced breastfeeding; and wider use of early group childcare which could facilitate microbial transmission during a critical developmental window,” Alexandrov said. “Collectively these shifts may be tipping the balance towards early-life acquisition of these microbes.”
At the same time, many questions remain unanswered.
Dr. Shuji Ogino, a professor of pathology and epidemiology at Harvard University, said it’s still unclear whether some people are simply more susceptible to the DNA-damaging effects of colibactin than others, or whether it can definitely be attributed to specific lifestyle patterns.
Colibactin-producing microbes are also not the only bacteria that have been linked to colorectal cancers. In recent years, both Ogino and Johnston have published studies implicating another gut microbe, called Fusobacterium nucleatum, in the development of the disease. Alexandrov suggested that while colibactin-producing species may cause the initial mutations that drive tumor formation, F. nucleatum may contribute to disease development by enabling the tumor to proliferate and evade the immune system.
However, Johnston said this is another area where more research is needed; the original cause of colorectal cancers may be the result of a combination of microbes and their toxins.
“Microbial interactions could amplify these effects,” he said. “For example, in patients with a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome called familial adenomatous polyposis, studies have shown that when Bacteroides fragilis co-occurs with colibactin-producing E.coli, DNA damage is significantly enhanced.”
Over the next two to three years, Alexandrov said he and his colleagues are planning to develop a noninvasive test that uses stool samples to determine whether people have had prior exposure to colibactin-producing bacteria.
“The goal is to identify people who are at elevated risk for developing early-onset colorectal cancer, ideally before any disease has developed,” he said. “We would want to have these people regularly checked.”
Given the wealth of evidence for the role of colibactin in these diseases continues to grow, scientists say that it’s also now important to explore preventive approaches, such as targeted probiotics or vaccines.
“Considering the abundance of reproducible evidence, targeted interventions that seek to eliminate these specific microbes are now warranted,” Johnston said.",Unknown,"April 24, 2025, 2:49 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-announces-plans-remove-artificial-dyes-nations-food-supply-rcna202184,FDA to phase out all artificial dyes from food and beverages,Health news,"Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday the government will phase out all artificial dyes from the food supply by the end of next year — a swift timeline that could meet resistance from the powerful food industry.
Under the plan, the Food and Drug Administration will give the food industry roughly two years to transition from petroleum-based synthetic dyes to natural alternatives.
""For companies that are currently using petroleum-based red dye, try watermelon juice or beet juice,"" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news briefing. ""For companies currently combining petroleum-based yellow chemical and red dyes together, try carrot juice.""
Makary said the FDA will authorize four new food dyes it says are derived from natural sources in the coming weeks.
The FDA has approved 36 food dyes, nine of which are artificial and made from petroleum. The others are derived from natural sources, like vegetables.
Among the nine artificial dyes is Red No. 3, which gives food and drinks a cherry color and was banned in January over concerns about possible cancer risks.
The FDA is beginning a process to revoke the approval of two of the artificial dyes — Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B — “within the coming months,” the Department of Health and Human Services said. Citrus Red No. 2 is used to color the skin of oranges.
The FDA will also ask food companies to remove Red No. 3 from the nation’s food supply earlier than 2027 — the Biden administration’s initial deadline. (Drug companies got an additional year.)
It will work with food companies to eliminate the remaining six artificial dyes by the end of next year, it says.
“For too long, some food producers have been feeding Americans petroleum-based chemicals without their knowledge or consent,” Kennedy said in the release.
Kennedy and Makary were joined on a stage filled with women and their young children. Dr. Mark Hyman and Vani Deva Hari, better known as “Food Babe,” who are longtime Kennedy associates, and West Virginia’s Republican governor, Patrick Morrisey, spoke about harms from artificial ingredients.
Kennedy often got applause when he described failures in the U.S. food system, slamming sugar as “poison” and suggesting that if food companies wanted petroleum in their products, they should eat it themselves.
While Makary said removing artificial dyes wouldn’t be a “silver bullet” that “instantly” makes America’s children healthier, the overall impression the other speakers gave was that the United States was entering a new era.
The FDA hasn’t established that artificial dyes cause behavioral problems, although Makary listed studies from other groups that suggested dyes might cause issues in kids.
“For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,” he said.
Jerold Mande, an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said Kennedy’s two-year timeline, while fast for “FDA historical standards,” is doable.
“It will meet some resistance,” said Mande, who is also a former FDA senior adviser and former deputy undersecretary for food safety at the Agriculture Department, “but since companies already eliminate these additives in other countries, I don’t expect a big fight.”
Kennedy has vowed to eliminate artificial dyes from the country’s food supply, claiming they are responsible for behavioral problems in children, including hyperactivity — a link that the FDA says it is monitoring but that hasn’t been established.
The dyes are commonly used in thousands of products marketed to kids, including candy, breakfast cereals and soda, giving the products bright, vibrant hues.On Tuesday, HHS said the FDA would fast-track the review of a number of “natural” dyes, including calcium phosphate, Galdieria extract blue, gardenia blue and FDA-approved butterfly pea flower extract, which can range in shades from deep purple to bright blue.
No representatives from the food companies spoke at the briefing. Asked whether the administration has reached an agreement with food companies to transition to natural dyes by the end of next year, Kennedy responded, “We have an understanding.”
In a previous interview, Marion Nestle, professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, called the issue “an easy one” for Kennedy to address.
While the FDA hasn’t established a link, Nestle said there is some research that dyes might contribute to behavioral problems in kids.
A 2021 report from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, for example, reviewed 27 trials in children and concluded food dyes can interfere with normal behavior in at least some kids.
Nestle — who added that the dyes serve no purpose for food beyond cosmetics — noted that other countries have moved to either restrict or ban them. In those countries, she said, companies have introduced natural alternatives.
“This should have been done a long time ago,” she said. “They’ve been promising to get rid of these things for years and balking. They’ve gotten rid of them in Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. There’s no reason why we can’t use something else.”
Mande said food dyes make ultra-processed foods look more appealing, resulting in overeating and obesity.
“Overweight is the primary food cause of cancer,” he said in an email. “Thus, we must regulate the use of both synthetic and natural colors as well as flavors that allow food companies to transform powders and sludges into calorically dense, hyperpalatable ultra processed ‘foods’ that are making us and our children sick.”
The FDA began looking into a possible link between dyes and behavioral problems in kids in the 1970s, when a California allergist and pediatrician proposed a possible connection. In 2011 and 2019, however, the FDA determined that no causal relationship could be established.
Still, there’s also a growing movement among several states to eliminate dyes.
In March, Kennedy praised Morrisey, the governor of West Virginia, after he signed a law banning seven artificial dyes approved by the FDA. The law, which takes effect in 2028, follows a similar move by California last year that banned six dyes from food served in public schools.
The same month, Kennedy told executives from major food companies in a closed-door meeting that he wanted all of the dyes gone by the end of his term.
In a statement, Melissa Hockstad, president and CEO of the Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group, said removing artificial dyes won’t “change the consumer packaged goods industry’s commitment to providing safe, affordable and convenient product choices to consumers.”
“The ingredients used in America’s food supply have been rigorously studied following an objective science and risk-based evaluation process and have been demonstrated to be safe,” Hockstad said.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","April 22, 2025, 4:12 AM GMT+8 / Updated April 23, 2025, 6:05 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/glp-1-supplements-weight-loss-science-what-know-rcna201921,What to know about GLP-1 supplements for weight loss,Health news,"As the Food and Drug Administration cracks down on compounded versions of popular weight loss drugs Wegovy (semaglutide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide), Americans who rely on these cheaper medications may be drawn to a dicey sector of the dietary supplement market.
From colorful patches and fruit punch-flavored gummies to prebiotic powders and under-the-tongue tinctures, dietary supplements that claim to “complement” or “supercharge” the body’s levels of the gut hormone GLP-1 are a dime a dozen. While compounded drugs require at least a virtual consultation with a clinician to get a prescription, supplements are available over the counter.
At best, such products are misleading, said Jamie Alan, an associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Michigan State University’s College of Human Medicine. So-called GLP-1 supplements, named to echo the class of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist drugs that includes Wegovy and Zepbound, are likely to be ineffective for weight loss.
“If you can buy it without a prescription, it’s not an actual GLP-1 drug,” Alan said. “It is something else that’s marketed to support your endogenous GLP-1 production. These things are just older weight loss [supplements] that are rebranded, and there’s really no scientific evidence for these.”
Ashwagandha and green tea extract are among the natural ingredients that have been recycled in diet products for decades, Alan said. Ashwagandha is often advertised as a stress reliever, and though the stress hormone cortisol is tied to weight gain, there’s little proof the evergreen shrub directly helps shed pounds. Green tea and green tea extract may have a “possible modest effect on body weight,” according to mixed research cited by the Office of Dietary Supplements, some of which links the extract to liver damage.
“We’re coming back to these products that have been ineffective in the past,” Alan said. Ingredients popping up on GLP-1 supplement labels include everything from berberine to chromium to saffron extract, which have a minimal body of research supporting their effects on weight loss.
What’s missing from the ingredient lists is also of note.The brand Kind Patches indicates its GLP-1 adhesive “does not contain synthetic GLP-1 and is not a GLP-1 agonist drug.” Lemme, Kourtney Kardashian Barker’s wellness brand, features an identical disclaimer for its GLP-1 Daily Support Capsules. Trim Biome GLP-1, manufactured by Inno Supps, boasts “clinically studied ingredients” but not the hormone in the product’s name.
Lemme declined to comment; Inno Supps and Kind Patches didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Jeff Ventura, the vice president of communications for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group for the supplement industry, said in a statement that there are “no direct comparators” for GLP-1 drugs in the dietary supplement industry.
“While some supplement ingredients have shown promise in limited studies related to metabolic health and weight management, they do not have the same effects as GLP-1 drugs,” Ventura said.
“It is very tricky, because they’ll put that big ‘GLP-1’ on there and it makes you think, ‘Well, maybe this is the drug,’ if you’re not thinking about how to read these labels or if you don’t know how to read these labels,” Alan said.
The FDA doesn’t regulate dietary supplements for safety or effectiveness before they hit the market, whether they’re a daily multivitamin or a post-workout protein powder. For that reason, the agency advises consulting a health care provider before adding any supplement to your regimen.
“There could be harm in some of these,” Alan said. “There are going to be some people who might have a significant drug interaction, who might have a significant medical condition. In most people there’s probably minimal risk of harm, but that’s not true for everyone.”
GLP-1 drugs aren’t new, having been used to treat Type 2 diabetes since 2005. Demand soared after the FDA approved Wegovy and Zepbound for weight loss in 2021 and 2023, respectively. The ensuing shortages made it legal for compounding pharmacies to step in.
Compounding pharmacies typically mix, alter or combine drug ingredients to meet a patient’s specific needs. For example, a pharmacy may make a liquid version of a drug that only comes in pill form for a patient who has trouble swallowing. During drug shortages, they’re also authorized to craft medications that are “essentially copies” of commercially available drugs.
Compounded versions of Wegovy and Zepbound skyrocketed in popularity — in part because they were generally sold for far less than their brand-name counterparts. Wegovy, for instance, has a list price of $1,349.02 for a four-week supply, though some insurance plans cover it. Meanwhile, WeightWatchers offers compounded semaglutide starting at $129 a month.
That’s coming to an end: The FDA declared the tirzepatide shortage over in December and did the same for the semaglutide shortage in February. Compounders must now pull their products. The grace period for tirzepatide manufacturers is over, and semaglutide producers have until Tuesday or May 22, depending on whether they’re a state-licensed pharmacy or an outsourcing facility.
That leaves a huge opening for GLP-1 supplement sellers to flood the $49.3 billion global market — and convince consumers a $15 pack of unproven patches will yield the same results as brand-name drugs that have undergone comprehensive clinical trials, said Dr. W. Scott Butsch, director of obesity medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Bariatric and Metabolic Institute.
Butsch, who has previously consulted for Novo Nordisk (maker of Wegovy) and Eli Lilly (maker of Zepbound), said he was already concerned about the ubiquity of compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide in recent years.
“The FDA states very clearly: These compounded versions are not the same,” he said. “They don’t have the same ingredients. They have not been tested.”
Worse still, Butsch said, compounders and now supplement companies are using lower pricing to target an already vulnerable clientele. Walmart, for example, sells a variety of GLP-1 supplements under $50.
Blair Cromwell, the director of global communications for Walmart’s U.S. Marketplace, said in a statement that dietary supplements are sold by third-party sellers on its Marketplace.
“Our policy allows the sale of dietary supplements if they comply with applicable regulations as well as federal, state and local laws, and FTC guidelines,” Cromwell said, adding that the company would be likely to review products marketed as GLP-1 supplements and “remove them if found to make inappropriate or inaccurate claims.”
“[The wellness market] has continued to prey on the desperate, and these are people who have poor access,” Butsch said. “Patients with obesity have always had poor access to obesity medications.”
He added, “You have some optimism among people who think that they can save some money and still get the benefit. But it’s a bigger carrot that they’re carrying in front of the horse now.”
Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and the director of Tufts University’s Food Is Medicine Institute, said, “There’s no simple dietary fix that’s going to do what these drugs do in a short amount of time.”
Still, the metabolic mechanism the supplements claim to achieve — boosting natural GLP-1 production — isn’t without merit.
“The food I’m eating is biologic information that’s activating hormones in my body, including GLP-1,” Mozaffarian said, noting that healthy fats and high-fiber foods have been shown to trigger GLP-1 production. But its natural release into the bloodstream is fleeting; GLP-1 drugs work by mimicking the hormone and keeping it around longer, which can aid in appetite suppression.
“It’s too early for [GLP-1 supplements] to have science behind them,” Mozaffarian said. “But I do think in the future we will be able to give people more clear recommendations on what’s a natural, lifestyle way to boost your GLP-1 function.”
For now, he said, “I wouldn’t spend money on these supplements, I would spend money on healthy food.”

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/psilocybin-use-rise-public-perception-changes-report-shows-rcna202201,"Psilocybin use is on the rise as public perception changes, report shows",Health news,"More Americans are using psilocybin, the hallucinogenic compound found in psychedelic mushrooms.
A report published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine found psilocybin use has been rising since 2019, after remaining relatively stable for years.
“That tells us something is changing,” said Kari Rockhill, an epidemiologist and assistant statistical scientist at Rocky Mountain Poison & Drug Safety in Denver, who worked on the report.
In adults, a changing public perception of psychedelics is likely at the forefront of this shift — combined with decriminalization of psilocybin across several U.S. jurisdictions.
“We saw a similar phenomenon with cannabis when it started to be legalized across the country. There is probably a stigma around this that is going down,” Rockhill said.
In 2019, the city of Denver voted to decriminalize the Schedule I drug, allowing people to grow and gift, but not sell, psychedelic mushrooms that contain psilocybin. Oregon followed suit in 2020, and decriminalization expanded to the entire state of Colorado in 2022. Books like Michael Pollan’s “How to Change Your Mind” have also helped change public perception of psychedelics, said Dr. Todd Korthuis, an internist and addiction medicine specialist at Oregon Health and Science University.
“This is not surprising at all given the developments over the last 10 years,” said Korthuis, who is also co-director of the Open Psychedelic Evaluation Nexus, which conducts research on psychedelics.
Andrew Yockey, an assistant professor of public health at the University of Mississippi, added that an unregulated online market, mounting research that suggests psilocybin could be used as a treatment for mental health conditions, and a rise in microdosing also likely contributed to the increase in use. Indeed, the researchers found that psilocybin use was highest among adults with mental health or chronic pain conditions.
Rockhill and her team analyzed five national databases that included self-reported data on psilocybin use, calls made to 55 poison control centers, and medical records to get a picture of how many people used psilocybin across the nation from 2014 through 2023.
Overall, use of the drug remains relatively low: In 2023 — the most recent year for which data was available — just about 2% of adults in the U.S. said they had taken psilocybin in the past year. Twelve percent reported ever taking the drug, up from 10% in 2019, when rates began to increase.
Among adults ages 18 to 29, past-year psilocybin use rose by 44%, to 2.1% in 2023; for adults ages 30 and up, use nearly tripled, to 1.8% in 2023. About 2.5% of 12th graders reported using psilocybin in the last year in 2023, a 53% increase from 2019.
“It is interesting to see the rise in adolescents,” Yockey said. “I want to see where they are getting it from, why they are taking it.”
The study also found that calls to poison control centers for psilocybin rose sharply over the study period, particularly among children ages 11 and under. In 2023, calls for this age group rose 723% from 2019, though the rates were still low, at less than one child per 100,000 people. For children 12 to 18, calls increased 317%, to just over two people per 100,000. Adults saw a 200% increase in calls, rising to a rate of less than half a person per 100,000.
In addition, 1,550 people, including 1,192 adults, sought medical care because of psilocybin in 2023. From 2015 to 2021, there were just three cases involving medical care.
The calls to poison control for the children under 11 in the report were almost certainly due to kids getting into psilocybin edibles that were not meant for them, Korthuis said.
Although psilocybin alone has a relatively safe toxicology profile, meaning it’s highly unlikely to cause life-threatening physical health problems, an unregulated market of edibles can lead to people ingesting things other than psilocybin, even if the packaging does not list them, Yockey said.",Unknown,"April 22, 2025, 5:01 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/whooping-cough-surges-vaccines-decline-us-rcna201853,Whooping cough surges as uptake of vaccines falters,Health news,"Kate and Greg Moor weren’t thinking “whooping cough” when their son, 13-year-old Joe, started having coughing fits in early March.
Joe probably just had a late winter virus, the Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, couple figured. Maybe it was spring allergies. Other than the coughing, he seemed fine.
Cough medicine didn’t touch Joe’s brutal and increasingly frequent coughing jags — sometimes every five to 10 minutes for hours at a time.
“It was a very violent cough. I just had to pause what I was doing and wait until I was done coughing,” Joe said. “Sometimes it felt like I’d throw up.”
It was difficult to watch Joe’s body convulse uncontrollably, said his mom, Kate. “Nothing seemed to be working,” she said. “It just seemed really aggressive. He’d double over.”
Tests revealed that Joe had pertussis, a bacterial infection. It’s also called whooping cough because of the sound some kids make during the coughing fits that Joe experienced.
The constant hacking is exhausting and sometimes life-threatening, doctors say, especially for small children and babies with tiny airways.
“They’re unable to catch their breath,” said Dr. Sapna Singh of Texas Children’s Pediatrics near Houston. “They’re fighting for air. They’re fighting to breathe.”
The virulent cough is unparalleled.
“I had a patient this year who broke two ribs coughing,” said Dr. Molly O’Shea, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “We had an infant who coughed so hard that they ended up with a pneumothorax,” also known as a collapsed lung. “That’s essentially when your lung pokes a hole out of itself and air starts collecting outside the lung.”
Whooping cough has been increasing since the early 2000s, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, with about 10,000 reported cases each year. The spread slowed during the pandemic lockdown, as many infectious illnesses did, but cases are rising once again.
In Michigan, where the Moor family lives, whooping cough cases have skyrocketed. There were 110 cases in the state in 2023, according to the state’s department of health. In 2024, 2,081 cases were reported — a nearly 1,800% increase.
The state’s on track to meet or exceed last year’s number. In 2025, 497 whooping cough cases have been reported in Michigan.
In Louisiana, two young infants died of pertussis within the last six months, the state's surgeon general posted on Facebook at the end of March. In South Dakota, a school-age child died from a co-infection of influenza and pertussis in January, the Department of Health reported. Pertussis contributed to the death of an adult in Idaho in February, according to the state's Central District Health.
The most common complication of whooping cough is pneumonia, which can be fatal.
So far this year, there have been 8,064 reported cases of whooping cough in the U.S., compared with 3,835 for the same time in 2024, according to the CDC. And there were more than four times as many whooping cough cases in the U.S. in 2024 compared with 2023.
According to the medical journal BMJ, if the current trend continues, the U.S. may be on course for the highest number of infections since vaccination was introduced in 1948.
Vaccine hesitancy in general is playing a major role in the increase. “We have clear indication that our vaccine rates are falling,” Singh of Texas Children’s said. “Look at the West Texas measles outbreak.” Almost 600 cases of measles have been reported since late January in West Texas.
A 2024 CDC report found that the percentage of U.S. kindergartners during the previous school year who had been vaccinated against both measles and whooping cough dipped to less than 93%. In 2019, the national coverage rate was 95%.
What's more, the pertussis vaccine doesn’t work as well as it used to. In the 1990s, manufacturers altered the way the vaccine was made to reduce its side effects, like fevers and vomiting. As a result, the shot’s effectiveness isn’t as robust. Boosters are needed every 10 years.
And research published by the CDC in 2019 suggested that the bacteria behind the disease had mutated. In 2024, the Food and Drug Administration met to discuss the need for more robust and longer-lasting versions of the whooping cough vaccine.
As of April 2025, nothing has come of those discussions.
There isn’t any real treatment for whooping cough. Like in Joe Moor’s case, cough drops and over-the-counter cough suppressants don’t work. Antibiotics, such as azithromycin or Z-Pak, are given, but they don’t cure the cough. They’re meant to protect others.
“By the time you’ve got the symptom of the cough, which is what prompts the diagnosis to be made, the cascade of immune response that causes that spasmodic coughing is underway, and there is no treatment for that,” she said. “We use antibiotics to clear the bacteria from the nasal passages so that you don’t spread it.”
The CDC says that babies should begin their first round of pertussis vaccines at 2 months, with follow-up shots at 4 and 6 months.
Another shot is given before the child reaches age 2, and again around the start of kindergarten. Because the vaccine wanes, it’s recommended that preteens, around 11 or 12 years, get a booster.
It's middle and high schoolers whose immunity has waned that's driving outbreaks, O'Shea said. She sees cases year-round in this age group.
The Moors felt they’d done all they could to protect Joe and his two younger brothers from vaccine-preventable illnesses. All three boys had received the recommended childhood vaccines, including a pertussis booster for Joe, a week after he turned 11.
While the vaccine isn’t 100% effective — no vaccine is — symptoms are generally less severe in vaccinated people, according to the American Lung Association.","Erika Edwards, Erika Edwards","April 22, 2025, 3:51 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-breakthrough-infections-causes-vaccine-symptoms-rcna201799,What causes breakthrough measles infections even if someone is vaccinated?,Measles Outbreak,"More than 800 people in the U.S. have had measles since the beginning of the year, according to NBC News data. The majority of cases are in West Texas, where an outbreak that shows no signs of abating began in January.
Nearly all of the cases are among people who haven’t been vaccinated, but 3% of the identified cases are so-called breakthrough infections. People got sick despite being either partially or fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot.
Infectious diseases doctors are at pains to emphasize that the MMR vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines on the market, but as Rodney Rohde, a professor at Texas State University explains, a small number of people who are fully vaccinated may get sick during a large outbreak.
One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, with the second dose increasing that to 97%.
“The vaccine is highly effective,” said Rohde. “But it means that after two doses, while 97 out of 100 people will develop strong immunity and be protected if exposed to measles, the remaining three out of 100 could still be vulnerable.”
The latest outbreak has seen claims circulating on social media from people who say they are fully vaccinated and still contracted a breakthrough infection, making them seriously unwell, something Rohde said is “slightly possible.” “They could fall into one of those small percentages that got the full vaccine but just didn’t respond,” he says.
However, he said, it’s also plausible that those people may not have realized they weren’t fully vaccinated against measles. Research suggests that when breakthrough infections occur, the MMR vaccine still tends to provide some partial protection. “If someone vaccinated does get measles, it’s often a milder version, sometimes called modified measles,” says Rohde. “A rash can still occur, but it may be less widespread [across the body], fainter or atypical, meaning it doesn’t follow the classic pattern of starting at the hairline and spreading downwards. Fever is also less common or lower-grade. In classic measles, fevers can spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, but in modified cases, it’s often milder or absent.”
According to Rohde, the same is true for other common measles symptoms:
“They may still occur, but are often less intense,” he says. “Koplik spots, which are tiny white spots in the mouth, are less commonly seen. Breakthrough cases are also generally less contagious, but still a potential source of transmission.”
People are contagious four days before and four days after the rash begins, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The rash usually appears 14 days after exposure.
Rohde also suggests that people experiencing severe symptoms from a breakthrough infection may have just had a single vaccine dose, which still offers significant protection, but not quite as much as the full two-dose regimen. “These cases can be closer to classic measles than in two-dose breakthroughs, with a high fever which may last longer,” he says. “The rash is usually a more typical measles rash and can be more extensive than in fully vaccinated breakthrough cases. They are also more likely to get possible complications.”
There’s still the question of why these infections happen.
As Rohde and others explain, there may be a number of reasons, ranging from the timing of vaccination to genetic variability in the immune response.
While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for the public to get vaccinated against measles, he also claimed in an interview with CBS News that “the vaccine wanes very quickly.”
Vaccine experts counter that the MMR shots offer lifelong protection.
“If immunity waned a lot, you would see a lot of cases in vaccinated people in older age groups, and we’re not seeing that in this Texas outbreak or any others in the recent past,” said Scott Weaver, a microbiology and immunology professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who also works with the Global Virus Network coalition of experts. “People seem to be solidly protected, and almost everybody for life, as far as we can tell.”
Unlike influenza or Covid, measles is a very stable virus that has evolved little to evade vaccine-induced immunity over time. In 2021, Mayo Clinic researchers published a study concluding that there’s a near-zero probability of a novel measles virus naturally emerging with the capability of circumventing the MMR vaccine.
While the virus isn’t changing, it appears that in some rare cases, the body’s own immune system can slowly stop producing antibodies against the virus. Based on international studies, scientists have concluded that it is possible for some children vaccinated against measles to lose their protection over the course of two decades.
“Because measles is highly infectious, this waning is expected to cause some breakthrough infections,” said Alexis Robert, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who authored a paper on long-term vaccine protection in 2024.
All people respond to either vaccines or natural infections a little bit differently, according to Weaver.
The MMR vaccine, which works by presenting the immune system with a live but weakened version of the measles virus, trains the body’s immune cells to recognize different parts of the virus’ proteins called epitopes and generate antibodies against them in the future, he said.
An epitope refers to small segments of amino acids on a protein’s structure that the immune system’s antibodies learn to recognize and bind to, should the virus attempt to invade again in future.
It’s not unexpected that a few people respond poorly to any vaccine, Weaver said.
“Some people have a very robust response because they respond to many different [viral] epitopes, and some people, just by chance, have immune cells that can’t recognize as many of those epitopes,” he said. “Differences in our genetic makeup determine how many different epitopes we respond to and develop immune memory against.”
After measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 and no longer considered a public health threat, research into the virus slowed. With vaccine hesitancy rising and the U.S. close to losing its measles elimination status, some scientists see the need to study and monitor the rare cases of breakthrough infections.
“While transmission patterns show measles outbreaks are driven by groups of unvaccinated individuals, especially among children, a potential risk of infection years after vaccination still impacts what strategy is most effective and the coverage needed to eradicate measles,” Robert said.
Timing can also make a difference. A child who had just received the MMR vaccine will still be vulnerable to measles within the first couple of weeks, especially during an intense outbreak where a lot of virus is circulating, Rohde said.
“In most cases, the human immune system takes roughly two weeks to develop enough protection against the measles virus and many other pathogens,” he said. “If you were exposed just before or after getting the vaccine, your body may not be at full strength.”
In some cases, for example people who are either born with a weakened immune system or develop conditions such as autoimmune diseases or blood cancers, the body may not mount as effective an immune response against measles, resulting in breakthrough infections.
“There are people who just have an overall immune system that’s just not as effective against many different infectious agents,” Weaver said. “We know about people who are immune compromised for certain reasons, like they’re HIV-infected, they’re under chemotherapy for cancer, things like that, but there are some people who are just born with immune systems that don’t function quite as well.”
Another plausible explanation is that people may have received a defective MMR vaccine, although Weaver said this is unlikely in the United States, where quality controls tend to be fairly stringent.
“In the cases of measles, it’s a live virus, so that virus could become less infectious if it’s not stored properly and that could lead to less [immune] response,” he said.
Whether you’re more vulnerable to developing a breakthrough measles infection could also depend on when you were born. Before the first measles vaccines were developed in the 1960s, virtually everyone contracted the virus during childhood, providing those who survived with lifelong immunity.
However, people who were born between 1957 and 1968 received a first-generation measles vaccine made using an inactivated virus that did not work so well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone born within this time frame should get at least one MMR dose.
Between 1968 and 1989, most people received only a single MMR dose, making them slightly less well protected compared with people who got the standard two doses in the past 36 years.
Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, suggested that if someone who got only a single dose is near a current measles outbreak or is traveling internationally to a country where the virus is endemic, it could be worth checking with with a doctor about getting another dose.",Unknown,"April 20, 2025, 6:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/white-house-replaces-covid-resource-page-lab-leak-website-rcna201925,White House replaces Covid resource page with lab leak website,Health news,"Anyone who tried to access Covid.gov, a federal website once dedicated to Covid resources, found something drastically different in its place Friday.
The page now redirects to a White House website suggesting that Covid originated in a research laboratory in Wuhan, China, before infecting humans. This much-debated “lab leak theory” emerged in the early days of the pandemic and has since gained popularity among some right-wing media outlets and conservative politicians.
Before Friday, Covid.gov was a tool to connect people to information about Covid vaccines, treatment, testing and long Covid. The website also formerly helped people find pharmacies and community health centers that offered Covid tests, medical visits and medications at once.
Its sister site, Covidtests.gov, allowed people to order free Covid tests to their homes. That now redirects to the White House’s lab leak website as well.
“The Trump administration has been very clear that, in contrast to the previous administration, we WILL be the most transparent administration in U.S. history,” White House spokesman Kaelan Dorr said in a statement. “Nothing will stop us from innovating and finding creative ways to uphold our end of the bargain.”
The new website's content is largely based on a House of Representatives report released in December, which concluded that Covid “likely emerged because of a laboratory or research related accident.” The report was issued by the Republican-led Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, which had been probing the virus’s origins for about two years.
The subcommittee was created in 2020, when Democrats had control of the House, to scrutinize the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic. But its focus shifted to investigating the lab leak theory and the value of vaccine and mask mandates in early 2023, once Republicans assumed the House majority.
House Democrats released their own report in December, claiming the subcommittee “failed to find the virus’s origin or advance our understanding of how the novel coronavirus came to be.” While they acknowledged that a lab leak was possible, they also said the virus may have spilled over from animals to humans, like all other viruses that have caused pandemics in the past.
Both the Republicans’ report and the new White House site claim that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had a role in suppressing the lab leak theory. However, the Democrats’ report deemed that false and accused subcommittee Republicans of lobbing “baseless attacks” on Fauci and other public health professionals.
Fauci voluntarily appeared at multiple subcommittee hearings last year and denied concealing any relevant information about a potential leak. Despite leaving his position at the end of 2022, he has remained the subject of frequent ire from conservatives and supporters of President Donald Trump.
Many independent scientists have said the lab leak theory has a lower likelihood of being true compared with a natural spillover event from animals to humans. That was the consensus of a survey of 168 scientists last year conducted by the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.
Similarly, a 2023 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine determined that “of the three possibilities — natural, accidental, or deliberate — the most scientific evidence yet identified supports natural emergence” of the virus. The authors noted that the issue had become “embroiled in politics” and that the true origin may never be known.
In 2023, a declassified report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence determined that both the lab leak and animal origin theories were plausible. However, in January, the CIA said the lab leak was more likely — though the agency noted it had “low confidence” in that judgment.

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obamacare-supreme-court-preventative-care-challenge-rcna201794,Supreme Court to hear challenge to Obamacare rule on free preventive care,Health news,"The Supreme Court on Monday is set to hear arguments in a case challenging a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires private insurers to cover health care screenings, tests and checkups for free.
Experts say the court’s ruling in the case, called Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, could have sweeping consequences for patient access to preventive health care across the United States.
Since the ACA was passed in 2010, most insurers have had to cover a wide range of prevention services at no cost to patients — including cancer screenings, mammograms, statins for heart disease and HIV prevention medications.
About 150 million people are currently enrolled in private health insurance plans that cover free prevention services, according to KFF, a nonpartisan group that researches health policy issues. A KFF analysis found that 1 in 20 people — about 10 million people — received at least one prevention service in 2019.
“This is a really crucial case,” said Arthur Caplan, the head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, noting that many Americans say they can’t afford the high out-of-pocket cost of medical care. “The price will be paid in dead bodies if the court rules against.”
The lawsuit was filed in 2022 by a group of conservative Christian employers in Texas.
They argued that the ACA rule requiring them to cover the HIV prevention pill PrEP in their employee health plans violated their religious rights.
They also challenged the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — an independent panel that recommends which preventive services insurers must cover — calling it unconstitutional because its members aren’t appointed by the president or confirmed by Congress.
Last year, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the employers, but limited the decision to just the eight Texas companies involved in the case. The court declined to make the ruling apply nationwide.
The federal government, under the Biden administration, appealed the case to the Supreme Court. The Trump administration then told the court in February that it intended to defend the requirement.
The Supreme Court is expected to make a decision sometime in June.
If the court strikes down the ACA rule, it would mean insurers could deny coverage for preventive services recommended by the task force, said Laurie Sobel, an associate director for women’s health policy at KFF.
“The recommendations would go back to March 2010,” Sobel said, referring to the year the ACA was enacted. Notable changes, she added, could include the starting age that most insurers cover colorectal cancer screens as well as coverage of PrEP. The current recommended age for colon cancer screening is 45, which the task force lowered from age 50 in 2021 and is credited with saving thousands of lives.
If the free preventive services requirement goes away, Richard Hughes, a health care attorney for Epstein Becker Green and lead counsel for the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, said coverage could vary by insurance company.
“I think you’ll see some gradual erosion across the board,” Hughes said, referring to the services that insurers cover. “I think you’re going to see some restriction of access, you’re going to see cost sharing applied to certain services, and that’s been shown to be a barrier, because people are more inclined to walk away from a service when they’re presented with an out-of-pocket cost.”
It’ll also be harder to get people into the doctor’s office to seek preventive care, Sobel said. “Right now we can say, if you’re on a private health insurance plan … then you’re entitled to no cost sharing,” she said.
Even if the Supreme Court sides with the Trump administration, Sobel said, there are concerns about what Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could do to the task force.
In a court filing, the Trump administration said task force members “are inferior officers, because the Secretary of HHS — a quintessential principal officer — remains responsible for final decisions about whether Task Force recommendations will be legally binding on insurance issuers and group health plans.”
“Even a ruling in favor of the federal government doesn’t necessarily assure that the preventative services will remain how they are right now,” Sobel said.
Chronic conditions such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes are the leading causes of death and illness in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A 2024 report from the Center for American Progress found the ACA rule has been linked to more Americans with better blood pressure, blood sugar levels and overall heart health. Other studies suggest it increased early-stage cancer diagnosis.
Caplan said he hopes Kennedy himself weighs in on the case.
“It doesn’t make any sense to keep talking about Make America Healthy Again while taking away preventive services,” he said.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","April 18, 2025, 5:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hhs-eliminates-committee-newborn-health-screening-rcna201370,HHS eliminates advisory committee on newborn screening ahead of vote on rare disorders,Health news,"Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has  pledged in office to make Americans healthier, with a specific focus on reducing health burdens among children. But his department this month quietly eliminated an advisory committee on genetic disorders in newborns and kids.
For the last 15 years, the central role of the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children was to make recommendations to the health and human services secretary about which conditions to include on a universal screening panel for newborns.
Though Kennedy has been focused on identifying the origins of more pervasive childhood diseases like autism, asthma and obesity, rare diseases are collectively a large public health concern. Around 15 million children in the United States have rare diseases, most of which are genetic.
Newborn screenings identify around 14,000 babies every year who have potentially life-threatening or life-altering conditions, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD). Getting a diagnosis around the time of a child’s birth gives parents a valuable window to seek treatment, which is usually most effective before symptoms set in.
It’s up to states to decide which conditions to test for, but most follow the federal government’s Recommended Uniform Screening Panel, which suggests looking for 38 conditions, including cystic fibrosis and Pompe disease, a disorder that causes muscle weakness. The screening panel is largely shaped by recommendations from the advisory committee’s volunteer scientists and medical experts.
The committee has “gone a long way in helping to ensure that newborns across the country, regardless of where they’re born, are screened for these certain conditions,” said Allison Herrity, a senior policy analyst at NORD.
According to an internal HHS email reviewed by NBC News, the committee was terminated, without explanation, on April 3. It had been scheduled to meet next month to discuss adding two conditions to the RUSP: metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Herrity said there had been an expectation that one or both conditions would be added.
“To have that wither on the vine because the committee has been dissolved is just sad and frightening,” said Dr. Shawn McCandless, head of genetics and metabolism at Children’s Hospital Colorado, who has served on the committee in the past.
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the department is complying with President Donald Trump's executive order to reduce the size of the federal government.
NORD estimates that up to 450 babies are born with MLD or DMD every year.
DMD, a genetic disorder that affects mostly boys, causes muscles to degenerate and weaken over time. Patients usually must use wheelchairs and die of respiratory or heart failure. MLD causes a decline in mental and motor functions, meaning patients often lose the capacity to eat, speak or swallow. Many die from secondary infections.
“What characterizes both of them, as well as many of the conditions that we identify through newborn screening, is a period of a relatively healthy baby — which makes it harder to diagnose clinically, but also it’s just that window of opportunity to give effective treatment,” McCandless said.
Both disorders have treatments that may extend a child’s life or improve its quality, one of the main factors that determines whether screening would be useful. The Food and Drug Administration approved a gene therapy (which modifies the genes causing a person’s illness) for Duchenne muscular dystrophy in 2023 and for metachromatic leukodystrophy in 2024.
But with the advisory committee gone, there is little chance the conditions will be added to the universal panel. Only two states, Illinois and New York, screen newborns for MLD. And two more states, Minnesota and Ohio, screen for DMD.
Jennifer McNary, whose son Austin died of DMD in February, called the decision to terminate the committee just before the vote “super disappointing.”
“It has been so long coming,” she said. “It’s been so many pilot studies and so much money spent.”
McNary knows firsthand about the benefits of an early diagnosis. Austin was diagnosed at age 3, when he was already having trouble walking. He died at age 26. Her second son, Max, was diagnosed with DMD at birth, allowing him to receive physical therapy and steroids for his muscles earlier in the course of his disease.
That early diagnosis and treatment likely improved his quality of life, McNary said. Max was better able to tolerate gene therapy and walked until he was 17, she said, whereas Austin stopped walking at age 10. At age 23, Max uses a wheelchair and needs help getting in and out of bed, but he lives semi-independently and goes out with friends, McNary said.
Doctors and advocates say it is not just screenings for MLD or DMD that are at stake now — the future of universal screening is also in jeopardy. Not all states have the resources to review evidence that could support screening for new conditions, Herrity said. Advocates fear a return to a patchwork system in which states with more money or political will offer comprehensive screenings and others do not.
McCandless said having an independent body make recommendations also reduces the odds that advocacy groups or pharmaceutical companies will have an outsize influence on which conditions are evaluated or prioritized.
“The committee has created a rational and scientific approach to adding conditions based on evidence, not just based on passionate advocacy,” he said.
It has also helped re-examine whether screening recommendations reflect the latest scientific knowledge. Ten years ago, the committee helped change the federal recommendations for tyrosinemia type I, a metabolic disorder that can be treated with a pill, allowing some patients to live normally. At the time, states were missing the majority of cases by screening for tyrosine, a chemical in the blood. The committee recognized the need to look for a different chemical, McCandless said, and the disorder is now widely picked up by screening.
McCandless and a dozen other doctors who treat rare disorders sent a letter this month urging Kennedy to reinstate the advisory committee, saying it “aligns with your vision for a healthier America.”
But some advocates, like McNary, hope for even more.","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","April 17, 2025, 11:24 PM GMT+8"

The experimental pill, called orforglipron, is a GLP-1 drug — the same class of medicine as the blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro.
Orforglipron is taken orally, however, not as a weekly injection.
“Everybody knows GLP-1s now, and they’re sort of famous as injectable peptide drugs, but we’ve engineered this now into a new kind of molecule that can be taken as a pill form,” Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Lilly’s chief scientific officer, said in an interview.
If it is approved, Lilly’s drug would be the second oral GLP-1 drug available in the United States. The first, Rybelsus, made by Novo Nordisk, contains semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Rybelsus is approved for Type 2 diabetes.
Lilly said in a news release that in a phase 3 clinical trial, orforglipron lowered A1C levels by 1.6% after 40 weeks compared with a placebo. The full results of the trial were not available to review.
A1C is a measure of a person’s average blood sugar levels over the previous two to three months, according to the American Diabetes Association. An A1C below 5.7% is considered normal; a result of 6.5% or above is in the range for diabetes. Results that fall between those values are in the prediabetes range.
More than 65% of the participants taking orforglipron had A1C readings equal to or less than 6.5% after 40 weeks.
Participants who received the highest dose of the drug lost up to 16 pounds, or 7.9% of their body weight, over the study period.
Lilly said the results of the clinical trial will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at the American Diabetes Association conference in June.
Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, called Lilly’s results “very encouraging.”
The reduction in A1C “is comparable to what we see with injectable GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, though perhaps slightly less than what’s seen with dual agonists like Mounjaro,” said McGowan, who was not involved in the trial.
A pill, McGowan added, has several advantages over an injectable drug. For the drugmaker, it is easier to manufacture and distribute. For some patients, it may be less intimidating.
“Some patients are hesitant to start an injectable therapy, no matter how effective it is,” he said. “Having a pill as an option could reduce that barrier.”
Lilly is also researching how well orforglipron works for weight loss alone in people without Type 2 diabetes. In phase 2 clinical trial — the findings of which were published in 2023 in the New England Journal of Medicine — daily orforglipron was found to reduce body weight by an average of 9.4% to 14.7% after 36 weeks, depending on the dose.
Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director at Duke Health who was not involved in the trial, questioned whether orforglipron had any drug-drug interactions — as is the case, she said, with Rybelsus, which can interact with certain thyroid medications.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Sara G.

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-autism-studies-environmental-toxins-rising-rates-rcna201582,RFK Jr. plans autism studies aimed at identifying 'environmental toxins' linked to rising rates,Health news,"WASHINGTON — Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Wednesday that the agency will announce, within three weeks, a series of studies aimed at identifying “environmental toxins” he claims are responsible for a dramatic rise in autism rates in children in the U.S.
Kennedy spoke a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report that found in 2022, 1 in 31 kids in the U.S. were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder by their 8th birthday — up from 1 in 150 kids in 2000, when the agency began collecting data.
Autism diagnoses among 4-year-olds in the new report were estimated at 1 in 34.
Pediatricians and other health experts have attributed the increase largely to greater awareness and better surveillance of the disorder. Autism’s definition has also broadened to identify milder cases, which has contributed to more diagnoses.
Despite evidence that suggests there is no one single cause of autism, Kennedy is vowing to uncover an underlying reason by September.
During a news conference Wednesday, Kennedy claimed, without evidence, that environmental exposures — such as the nation’s food supply, water or medicine — are likely contributing to rising autism rates in kids. He called autism a “preventable disease,” an assertion pushed back on by health experts.
“We know what the historic numbers are,” Kennedy told reporters, “and we know what the numbers are today, and it’s time for everybody to stop attributing this to this ideology of epidemic denial.”
He also dismissed conclusions from the CDC report’s authors, who attributed the rise to more awareness and better surveillance. The report also reaffirmed evidence suggesting that genetics likely plays a role.
“We know it’s an environmental exposure. It has to be,” Kennedy said. “Genes do not cause epidemics. It can provide a vulnerability. You need an environmental toxin.”
Kennedy said the agency will look at mold, food additives, pesticides, water, medicines, ultrasound and obesity.
He didn’t provide guidance as to which outside groups, if any, would support the agency’s research or how the studies would be conducted and when.
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Alison Singer, the president of the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit group for families with autism, said the CDC’s report Tuesday “is the most convincing evidence yet that changes in factors like access to services and de-stigmatization” are leading to the increases in prevalence of autism.
Singer said Kennedy made a series of false assertions about autism  during Wednesday’s news conference, including that the disorder is caused by something in the environment.
An overwhelming amount of evidence points to a genetic cause, Singer said, adding that in about 20% of autism cases, one genetic variant can explain the disorder.
In other cases, she said, there may be multiple genetic mutations interacting to cause autism.
At the same time, most researchers acknowledge that genes don’t explain every case of autism and that when people develop autistic traits, it may be because of a combination of genetics and environmental exposures. Some research has indicated that a mother's exposure to air pollution may be linked to an increased risk of autism in children.
The health secretary’s remarks on environmental exposures echo his previous comments about the disorder.
Kennedy has repeatedly suggested that vaccines are linked to autism — a connection that has been widely debunked.
Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said he isn’t persuaded that Kennedy’s studies will uncover anything new, saying that the health secretary has already come to a predetermined conclusion.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","April 17, 2025, 5:17 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-measles-cases-missed-texas-us-rfkjr-rcna201426,CDC says measles cases are most likely underreported as outbreak swells in Texas,Measles Outbreak,"Measles cases are most likely being underreported in the United States as public health officials scramble to find resources to address a ballooning outbreak in the Southwest, according to a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
So far this year, 747 cases have been recorded in the United States, according to NBC News’ tally. Two unvaccinated children in Texas and an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico have died. The adult tested positive for measles, but the official cause of death is still under investigation.
Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist leading the CDC’s measles response, said Tuesday at a meeting of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee that more than 90% of the cases are “related to the Southwest outbreak, driven by transmission in close-knit, undervaccinated communities.” The other cases have largely been imported from other countries, he said.
“We do believe that there’s quite a large amount of cases that are not reported and underreported,” Sugerman said Tuesday as he updated the committee on measles. “In working very closely with our colleagues in Texas; in talking with families, they may mention prior cases that have recovered and never received testing, other families that may have cases and never sought treatment.”
Sugerman said the CDC has deployed 15 people to Texas to help manage the outbreak and is sending seven more this week. It continues to make measles vaccines available to health departments at their request, he said, and it is helping standardize and expand wastewater surveillance.
However, the CDC slashed $11.4 billion in Covid funding last month, some of which helped state health departments respond to disease outbreaks. Sugerman said the loss of Covid grant money has created “funding limitations” in Texas, where state officials are redirecting staffers to work on the measles response or moving them from other regions to help support efforts in the outbreak area.
“We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions,” Sugerman said.
As of Tuesday, 561 cases had been confirmed in the West Texas outbreak, according to the state’s Department of State Health Services. Each measles case may cost $30,000 to $50,000 to address, which “adds up quite quickly,” Sugerman said.
Before this year, the United States had not had a measles death in a decade, and a child had not died of measles since 2003. Many public health experts have criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s approach to the outbreak. While Kennedy has called for people to get the measles vaccine, he has framed vaccination as a personal choice and emphasized unproven treatments like steroids or antibiotics. He has also repeatedly claimed that immunity from measles vaccines wanes quickly, despite robust evidence that two doses of the vaccine offer lifelong protection.
At a media event Tuesday in Indiana, Kennedy said the CDC has “done a very good job at controlling the measles outbreak,” pointing to higher case numbers in Europe. However, the figure he cited — 127,000 cases — was the total last year across 53 countries. Disease experts say that is an apples-to-oranges comparison with the current outbreak in the United States.
Kennedy also suggested Tuesday that “healthy children should not die of measles” if doctors know how to treat it. In reality, no specific treatment is approved for measles, and unvaccinated children are vulnerable to severe complications, such as pneumonia and swelling of the brain. Roughly 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles die from respiratory and neurological complications, according to the CDC.
The CDC’s vaccine advisory committee met Tuesday for the first time since Kennedy took office on Feb. 13. The meeting was originally scheduled for late February, but the Department of Health and Human Services postponed it. A senior HHS spokesperson said at the time that the delay was intended to allow time for public comment.
Kennedy has previously accused the committee members of having conflicts of interest, citing ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Most scientists say it is appropriate for members to accept industry funding for vaccine research, as long as it is disclosed.
Helen Keipp Talbot, who chaired the committee Tuesday, lamented that the group had to discuss rising measles case numbers.","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","April 16, 2025, 5:00 PM GMT+8"

The finding, based on an analysis of medical records from 2022, reflects a dramatic rise in autism over the past two decades. Previous CDC reports showed that 1 in 54 8-year-olds had been diagnosed with autism in 2016. In 2000, it was 1 in 150.
“The most striking piece of this is how unbelievably common presentations of autism are,” said Zachary Warren, an author of the new report.
Warren, also the executive director of the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD) in Nashville, Tennessee, largely attributed the increases to improvements in detecting the developmental disorder.
Doctors are better than ever at identifying autism, with awareness at an all-time high. “Without a doubt, we’ve become exceptionally efficient in this surveillance work,” Warren said.
In a statement Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that “the autism epidemic has now reached a scale unprecedented in human history.”
The phrase “autism epidemic” doesn’t sit well with Dr. Alex Kolevzon, who’s been working with people with autism for more than two decades.
Kolevzon, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and clinical director of the Seaver Autism Center at Mount Sinai in New York City, agreed that the increase is likely to stem from increased awareness and diagnostic criteria of autism spectrum disorder. He was not associated with the new report.
“Parents shouldn’t panic,” he said. “We’re not seeing an epidemic with autism.”
The report comes from the CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, a biennial surveillance program that takes a snapshot of prevalence and characteristics of how doctors identify autism spectrum disorder among kids at ages 4 and 8.
Data was collected from 16 sites in 14 states, including Arizona, California, New Jersey, Tennessee and Texas, and Puerto Rico.
Autism diagnoses among 4-year-olds in the new report were estimated at 1 in 34. Boys were three times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with autism.
Diagnoses were also more common among Black and Hispanic children compared with white children, most likely reflecting increased awareness.
Answers are both inconclusive and wildly complicated. Potential causes have been scrutinized for decades, and there doesn’t seem to be a single smoking gun. The leading theory lies in genetics.
“We have pretty compelling data that there are causes of autism, not a single cause,” Warren said. “We may have hundreds, if not thousands, of different neurogenetic factors that influence presentations of autism.”
Despite proven research to the contrary, Kennedy has repeatedly suggested that vaccines — specifically the shots that protect against measles, mumps and rubella — are linked to autism.
That link has been widely debunked, but it continues to contribute to a decline in vaccine uptake across the U.S. — even amid a growing measles outbreak that’s sickened hundreds and killed two young children in Texas.
“There’s a lot of things that we do not understand as of yet about autism, but one thing for certainty is that vaccines do not cause autism,” Kolevzon said. “This has been studied extensively among multiple continents, and it’s been well established in the scientific community.”
The disorder appears to be a focus of the Trump administration. President Donald Trump and Kennedy have said it’s critical to find what’s causing autism in kids.
“President Trump has tasked me with identifying the root causes of the childhood chronic disease epidemic — including autism,” Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday. “We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September.”","Erika Edwards, Erika Edwards","April 16, 2025, 1:00 AM GMT+8 / Updated April 16, 2025, 2:55 AM GMT+8"

Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and the weight loss drug Wegovy, told the FDA on April 3 that counterfeit 1-milligram injections were being distributed outside its authorized supply chain in the U.S., the agency said in a news release. That means it likely entered the market through unofficial means, like unauthorized distributors or resellers.
The FDA said it seized the counterfeit products — labeled with lot number PAR0362 and serial numbers starting with the first eight digits 51746517 — on April 9.
The agency said it’s aware of six adverse event reports linked to the lot — however, none of them appear to be associated with the counterfeit product. The agency and Novo Nordisk are testing the fake products to identify whether they’re safe. Genuine Ozempic can come with side effects, including stomach problems, so it's not clear whether the adverse events were caused by typical use.
The fake versions underscore the soaring popularity and demand for the diabetes drug Ozempic, which is often used “off label” for weight loss, as well as similar GLP-1 drugs.
In December 2023, the agency said it seized thousands of units of fake Ozempic and warned that some may still be available for purchase.
The fake products are different from compounded versions of the drug, which have also grown in popularity across the U.S.

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-antibiotic-drug-resistant-gonorrhea-treatment-study-rcna201053,A new type of antibiotic is effective against gonorrhea as drug resistance surges,Health news,"A pill developed by GSK was found to be safe and effective in treating gonorrhea in a late-stage clinical trial, according to a study published Monday in The Lancet. If approved, it would become the first new class of antibiotic for the sexually transmitted infection in more than two decades.
The pill, called gepotidacin, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and girls 12 and up — the most common type of infection in women. The drug is sold under the name Blujepa.
A new treatment option is important, experts say, because bacteria that commonly cause STIs are increasingly becoming resistant to the standard antibiotics, making treatment more difficult.
There are an estimated 82 million new cases of gonorrhea globally each year, according to GSK. In the United States, rates of reported gonorrhea have increased 118% from 2009 to 2021, with more than 640,000 cases being reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2022.
Gonorrhea has developed resistance to nearly all the antibiotics used for its treatment, according to the CDC.
If left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to serious health complications, including swollen and painful joints, liver inflammation, and heart and brain damage. It can also increase the risk of infertility in women.
Gepotidacin is part of a new class of antibiotics called triazaacenaphthylenes, which work by targeting two key enzymes that gonorrhea needs to copy itself and survive.
In a Phase 3 clinical trial of more than 600 adults and teens, gepotidacin was shown to successfully treat about 92% of patients when taken twice daily, compared with about 91% in a group of patients who got a standard treatment.
The most common side effect was gastrointestinal issues, with almost all reported being “mild or moderate.”
Crucially, the study authors wrote, the pill was effective against strains of gonorrhea bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics.
Dr. Sovrin Shah, an associate professor of urology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who was not involved in the study, called the GSK pill “a welcome addition.”
“Antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea is a public health concern,” Shah said. “The rate of STIs is significant in the U.S.”
David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said that “we desperately need effective cures to combat gonorrhea” but noted that widespread job cuts at the federal health agencies, including at a lab that tracked STIs, could make it challenging.
“The recent closure of the CDC’s key STI lab — which helps us understand which antibiotics are still effective and when we need to engage new drugs like this — poses a significant new obstacle,” Harvey said.
A spokesperson for GSK said the company plans to file approval with the FDA “in the coming months” with a regulatory decision expected in the second half of the year.
The company said it's seeking approval for gepotidacin as an alternative to first-line therapy when such treatment is inappropriate — such as when the patient is intolerant to the existing treatment or unwilling to use it.
In an editorial that accompanied the study, Magnus Unemo, director of the World Health Organization’s division that oversees gonorrhea, said GSK’s pill is “promising” but added that challenges to keep gonorrhea as a treatable infection will continue.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","April 14, 2025, 10:58 PM GMT+8 / Updated April 15, 2025, 12:21 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/one-countrys-leading-alzheimers-projects-jeopardy-rcna199788,One of the country's leading Alzheimer's projects is in jeopardy,Health news,"SEATTLE — Andrea Gilbert thought she knew what would happen to her brain.
The 79-year-old retired attorney, who has Alzheimer’s disease and receives care at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, agreed to donate it for research in 2023. She hoped to help scientists unlock the keys to a disease that had left her writing notes to remind herself if she’d already brushed her teeth.
The fate of that program is now in limbo because the Trump administration has upended the system that funds biomedical research.
“It’s going to go one way or another. I’m not taking it with me,” Gilbert said from a hospital bed as she received an infusion of a drug designed to prevent the disease from worsening. “I hope it gets used well. But, you know, you can’t guarantee anything.”
Thousands of grants, including many at public universities and on topics as politically benign as Alzheimer’s, have been caught in what critics say is an unprecedented slowdown of the American research system that is threatening to upend universities and halt progress toward medical innovations, treatments and cures.
Even the temporary slowdown threatens to hamper or scuttle programs that have been decades in the making — and some of which are also actively treating patients.
The National Institutes of Health has been the primary funder of the University of Washington’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) since 1985. The program supports a brain bank that accepts more than 200 donations yearly and is preserving more than 4,000 brains. The center’s grant funding, which is waiting for renewal, expires at the end of April. But grant decisions across the nation have slowed to a crawl, according to court filings.
The program has focused on unraveling the basic biology of the disease and factors that counter it. It discovered or helped identify three genes in which mutations cause Alzheimer’s.
The situation has left Gilbert’s neurologist, Dr. Thomas Grabowski, confused and scrambling. What will happen to patient care and the brains banked for research at Harborview?
“We’ve gone through a bunch of contingency planning,” said Grabowski, who is also the director of the ADRC. “When it starts to look like multiple, multiple, multiple months, then there’s not a good answer to your question.”
Dr. Dirk Keene, a professor and the director of neuropathology at UW Medicine who leads the brain bank, said if federal funding dries up, he’ll go to almost any end to “honor the gift” of people’s donation.
“I’ll beg, I’ll borrow. I don’t think I’ll steal, but I’ll do whatever I can to find money,” Keene said.
Universities are reeling. The Trump administration has executed a flurry of research grant terminations at large, private institutions like Johns Hopkins and Princeton University. In a recent court case against NIH, the American Civil Liberties Union argued that the administration targeted cuts to grants about topics it disfavors like diversity, LGBTQ issues and gender identity.
Among public universities, the University of Washington is one of the hardest hit, and researchers and students have said the fallout from the cuts has upended their careers and forced some to consider leaving the U.S.
“We’re going to have a big brain drain in the U.S. of these really talented folks,” said Shelly Sakiyama-Elbert, the vice dean of research and graduate education at UW Medicine. “It’s not just a switch that you flip, right? If people move out into another direction with their careers, they often don’t come back.”
In a statement to NBC News, NIH said it was dedicated to restoring “gold-standard, evidence-based science.”
“NIH is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities,” the federal agency said. “As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again.”
A legal battle is ongoing over the cuts and funding pauses, but any permanent resolution is likely months away. The state of Washington is one of 16 that filed a lawsuit against NIH and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, alleging that the Trump administration has terminated hundreds of grants through “shoddy justifications” and delayed decisions on billions of dollars in research funding. The attorneys general have asked for a preliminary injunction to quickly restore the flow of funding. A judge is slated to hear arguments in early May.
The University of Washington is one of the top public universities for biomedical research and a place where basic science discoveries are translated into clinical trials and hospital care.
In a court filing, the university said it receives more federal research dollars than any other public university. Many of those dollars go toward UW Medicine, the university’s hospital system and its clinical research hub.
The university said it had received about 1,220 grants from NIH and about $648 million in funding last fiscal year.
But this year, the grant approval process came to a sudden halt.
As of April 1, the university said more than 600 grant proposals were waiting for review or stuck at some juncture in that process. Another 12 grants or subgrants have been canceled outright, including one for studying the prevention of chlamydia infections and another about the recovery of sexual assault victims, court documents say.
The grant slowdown has forced the university to implement furloughs, plan for layoffs and reduce graduate admissions by 25%-50% for next year, according to the filing. The university has implemented a hiring freeze, and researchers across campus are feeling the effects.
David Baker, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington School of Medicine, won the Nobel Prize in 2024 for his research on protein design. But Baker, who is the director of the Institute for Protein Design, said about 15 of his graduate students and postdoctoral researchers within his group are now seeking positions outside the U.S.
“There’s so many amazing people who want to come in, and we can’t take them,” Baker said. “The Nobel Prize was just a little blip. But things have gotten quite bleak.”
Dr. Rachel Bender Ignacio, an infectious disease researcher and physician at UW Medicine and a partner institute called the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, cut her own salary down to 60%, choosing to distribute the rest among junior scientists and other staffers within her 15-person clinical research group.
“Right now, due to the funding cuts, we are unable to enroll any more participants into federally funded studies, or start new studies, or do really any new work,” said Bender Ignacio, who said she was concerned for patients enrolled in HIV clinical trials. “We often are conducting research with people who are in clinical care and they’re receiving state-of-the-art treatments as part of research.”
For Alzheimer’s disease, research breakthroughs are increasingly being evaluated in clinics, which means disruptions to funding could have an effect on patient care.
Gilbert, who is chatty and eager to laugh, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in late 2023, soon after lecanemab, a new therapy designed to slow the disease’s progress, became available.
In December 2023, Gilbert was one of the first patients at Harborview Medical Center to receive a dose of lecanemab, the first disease-modifying drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use against Alzheimer’s in people with mild cognitive impairment.
Gilbert visits the hospital, part of the UW Medicine system, twice a month for an infusion of the drug, which is designed to clear amyloid protein, one driver of Alzheimer’s disease, from her brain.
“They said, ‘This is not going to reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s, but hopefully it will slow it down,’” said Chris Gilbert, her son. “All things considered, she’s doing pretty well. She still lives home alone, independently.”
On a sunny April morning in Seattle, Andrea completed her 36th infusion, greeting nurses and fellow patients as if they were old friends.
Andrea and Chris Gilbert said they believed the drug, and her excellent care at Harborview, had prevented her symptoms from worsening. They noted that since her diagnosis, Andrea had increased her score by one point on a 30-question cognitive assessment used to evaluate Alzheimer’s patients.
Grabowski, the neurologist, said other, newer Alzheimer’s drugs are in the pipeline, in part because of NIH’s commitment to addressing the disease.
“They were all at some point funded by NIH in the development stages, preclinical work,” Grabowski said. “So, if you took away NIH funding altogether, you would find this whole pipeline to therapy kind of drying up.”
But over the past few months, Grabowski said he’s grown increasingly worried about his center’s funding.
Grabowski said the center had applied for a grant renewal of $15 million in direct costs over the next five years, but he was uncertain if, or when, the funding might be approved. He said the center receives roughly 85% of its funding from the federal government.
It’s not uncommon for NIH to renew a grant after it expires, but Grabowski said “unprecedented uncertainty” at NIH has left him largely in the dark about his center’s future.
When the Trump administration took office, it temporarily paused communications from health agencies, including scientific advisory council meetings in which grants are reviewed.
Grabowski said he’d received little communication from NIH about his 940-page application until late March, when staffers asked for a revised grant application to address DEI, or diversity, equity and inclusion.
He worries about the fate of the center and its long-term studies, including one that is following 450 people, including Gilbert, until death. Ideally, each participant will receive a yearly evaluation of their health and memory loss until their autopsy and brain donation.
As researchers search for new treatments, the brain bank at Harborview Medical Center is an invaluable resource. Last year, it shared about 11,000 tissue samples with researchers.
It’s a busy operation. Teams are on call around the clock to retrieve brains within 24 hours after a donor’s death. Each year, between 200 and 240 people donate their brains for research at Harborview.
Once collected, a brain is dissected and a portion is frozen in a freezer that’s minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The remainder is sliced into thin samples and analyzed with a microscope for abnormalities.
“We have brains that were donated 40 years ago that we still use very frequently,” Keene said.
In addition to the concern about the ADRC, Keene said another federal NIH grant that supports research to find the brain cells most vulnerable to disease expired at the end March. That grant, which totals nearly $7 million in direct costs for several projects, also helps to fund the brain bank.
“If all of our funding collapses, the most important thing is being able to still honor the commitment that we’ve made to these people,” Keene said. “That’s our priority, is to get these brains in the lab and preserved, and they can sit for 10 years if that’s when the funding comes back.”
Chris Gilbert said he didn’t understand how research into Alzheimer’s could be on such shaky ground.
“Drugs like Leqembi give people promise and hope, and it’s the same thing with the brain tissue study,” Gilbert said, referring to a brand name of lecanemab. “All those things contribute to finding cures and ways to prevent this and treat it. The fact that they’re cutting these things or putting them in limbo is really upsetting, and you know, I feel like they’re doing surgery with a chainsaw at the federal level.”
The University of Washington hosts one of 35 Alzheimer’s research centers funded by the the National Institute on Aging. The centers operate as part of a cohesive network and share data.
Grabowski said 14 centers are seeking grant renewals this year.","Evan Bush, Evan Bush","April 13, 2025, 6:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-calls-fda-sock-puppet-industry-private-speech-agency-staff-rcna200910,RFK Jr. calls FDA a 'sock puppet' for industries in private speech to agency staff,Health news,"Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in a speech Friday to Food and Drug Administration staff, derided their past decisions, at one point saying that the agency had become “a sock puppet” for the industries it was meant to regulate.
NBC News obtained a recording of Kennedy’s address, his first joint appearance with the new FDA commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary. The event was meant to welcome both men and highlight the agency’s priorities moving forward.
Those priorities include determining the causes of autism and reforming the FDA’s “GRAS” pathway, which allows food companies to add ingredients without prior approval.
Kennedy claimed that the FDA’s proximity to the food industry has resulted in its failure to address food contamination.
“Like every agency,” he said, the FDA “at one point really became a sock puppet for the industry it was supposed to regulate.”
Kennedy has long alleged that the federal health agencies are too close with the industries they regulate. It’s not an uncommon critique of the FDA — in 2021, for example, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., denounced President Joe Biden’s FDA pick, citing close ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Some have also taken issue with the fact that the FDA’s review of products, like drugs, is funded by user fees from industry.
Kennedy, however, has suggested that overly cozy relationships with vaccine makers led to lax oversight of vaccines. In a 2015 interview with the Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded, he called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical industry.” He also claimed that “virtually all the institutions that are supposed to stand between a rapacious industry and vulnerable children have been compromised.”
Just before the last election, Kennedy wrote on X: “If you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you: 1. Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags.”
On Friday, Kennedy told FDA staff that the “deep state is real.”
“President Trump always talks about the deep state, and the media disparages him and says that he is paranoid or a conspiracy theorist,” Kennedy said. “But the deep state is real and it’s not George Soros or Bill Gates and a bunch of nefarious individuals sitting together in a room and plotting the destruction of humanity. It’s more insidious than that. It’s institutional pressures.”
One FDA staffer who watched Kennedy’s speech said: “Sadly, the rhetoric is likely to continue for his entire tenure because he believes that we’re all sellouts for industry,” adding, “In reality, many industries dislike the level of safety that we hold submissions to.”
Another staffer said that at least one person walked out of the room when Kennedy mentioned the “deep state.”
Both staffers were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
The speech came less than two weeks after the administration decided to lay off about 3,500 FDA employees as well as thousands of workers at other health agencies. The layoffs included several of the FDA’s top vaccine regulators.
Kennedy didn’t address the layoffs.
During the speech, he also encouraged agency staffers to speak out against their managers.
“If your boss is making a mistake, if they’re approving something that shouldn’t be approved, we want to hear it,” he said.
“We want to honor whistleblowers in this administration,” he continued. “I want to really empower you.”
The FDA directs all media inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services.
In an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for HHS, said Kennedy “is telling the truth that many Americans already know.”","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","April 12, 2025, 4:47 AM GMT+8 / Updated April 12, 2025, 5:00 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/video-captures-woman-stroke-tiktok-live-one-scariest-things-rcna200888,Video captures woman having stroke on TikTok Live: 'One of the scariest things',Health news,"As Kristie Kaluza started a TikTok livestream to advertise some jewelry, she suddenly felt as if she fainted. But she remained awake and upright.
“I didn’t fall. I wasn’t on the floor, but I realized I had dropped the jewelry, and my brain was really confused,” Kaluza, 43, of El Campo, Texas tells TODAY.com. “I look up at the camera because I knew my husband was (watching), and I tried to say, ‘I need help,’ and it wouldn’t come out. I couldn’t turn my body. I felt super heavy. I couldn’t really lift my arms.” Her husband recognized that his wife was having a stroke and called 911. But when she got to the hospital, staff didn’t consider that she’d had a stroke at first.
“The people at the hospital ... said, ‘You’re so young,’” she recalls. “I come to find out when we finally get to the neurologist … it was a stroke.”
On January 10, 2025, Kaluza returned home in the early evening and prepared for a TikTok Live to sell her jewelry. She had a normal Friday until she sat down in front of the camera and started feeling strange. When she tried to speak, she couldn’t.
“There’s a miscommunication, a misfire there somewhere, and I couldn’t get out that, ‘Hey I don’t feel good,’” she says.
Luckily, her husband rushed in and recognized the signs of a stroke.
“He said, ‘I knew then something was not right,’” Kaluza says. “If he hadn’t have looked down when he did and seen that I dropped the jewelry and I wasn’t acting right, I wouldn’t have been able to call out for help.”
Soon after he called 911, Kaluza started experiencing tremors in her head and hands.
“That was one of the scariest things, not being able to say my words and not having control of my head or my hands,” she says.
Bradley Kaluza, her husband, knew the signs of stroke because his mother recently experienced one.
According to the American Stroke Association, the signs of stroke, which spell out FAST, are:
While Kaluza arrived at the nearby hospital quickly, it didn’t have an MRI machine, so she couldn’t undergo the scan to see if she’d had a stroke. Her CT scan looked normal, but doctors transferred her to another hospital so she could get an MRI.
But that hospital wouldn’t perform an MRI because she has a spinal cord stimulator implanted in her back to relieve pain, and they worried it would be unsafe in the MRI, she says. She had the remote to put it in MRI safety mode with her, but they still refused, Kaluza adds.
The hospital injected her with a blood-thinning medication, which can break up a blood clot. She was released and underwent an outpatient MRI. The doctor who performed it determined what was wrong.
“The neurologist says, ‘Well, we see in the MRI with the contrast you had a stroke,’” Kaluza says. “My husband says, ‘Wait, you are saying she had a full-blown stroke?’ And the neurologist said, ‘Yes, she did have a small one.’”
More specifically, she’d experienced a transient ischemic attack, also known as a mini stroke, which occurs when the blockage of blood flow to the brain is brief and doesn’t cause lasting symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic.
The neurologist sent Kaluza to a cardiologist to understand why she had a stroke at a young age. After a variety of tests, she learned she had a hole between the upper chambers of her heart, what’s known as a patent foramen ovale (PFO).
“A PFO is something we all have when we’re in our fetal development,” Dr. Daniel Hermann, director of structural cardiology at Memorial Hermann Memorial City, who treated Kaluza, tells TODAY.com.
For most people, “probably about 90-95%,” the hole closes, he says. For the remaining patients, the hole remains open. Most people are unaware of it and live a symptom-free life. But in some, like Kaluza, that opening allows a clot to pass through and cause stroke.
“For 43 years, I’ve lived with the hole in my heart and never knew, never had any symptoms,” Kaluza says. “Just a hole in (my) heart from being born caused a stroke.”
While some people might experience migraines from a PFO, most people have few signs that they have one.
“It’s not something you have symptoms from,” Hermann says. “It causes no structural issues.”
When younger patients, people typically under 60, experience stroke, doctors sometimes find a PFO as the cause. Patients can take blood thinners to reduce clots, but that can cause people to bleed excessively if they injure themselves, for example. Doctors like Hermann often perform an outpatient procedure to fix the PFO instead.
“In the last decade or so, it’s become clear that the most effective way of reducing stroke risk related to a PFO is actually closing it,” he explains. “That’s typically done using a catheter-based approach.”
In the minimally invasive procedure, a doctor threads a catheter through a vein in the groin and inserts a “small plug” into the catheter, which they use to block the opening between the heart chambers.
“It’s not something that typically takes too much time and it’s something that’s very effective as far as closing the hole and preventing further strokes,” Hermann says.
Kaluza should be able to do everything she enjoys without any worry of a future stroke.
“Her risk of stroke after having this taken care of it essentially returns her back to any other person … that is of her age,” Hermann says.
After Kaluza underwent her PFO closure on March 4, she has been feeling better.
“I can do everything that I could do before,” she says.
Still, she struggles cognitively at times, and she can’t find the right words or says in the wrong order.
“When my brain works a lot … it starts to get tired,” she says.
Sometimes Kaluza wonders what would have happened if her husband didn’t see she was having a stroke.
“(It’s) very, very scary,” she says. “I don’t know how long I would have sat here not being able to move and not being able to call out (for help).”
Kaluza hopes that her story encourages others to act quickly if they see someone experiencing stroke.",Unknown,"April 12, 2025, 12:43 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636,RFK Jr. falsely claims measles vaccine protection 'wanes very quickly',Measles Outbreak,"Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called for people to get the measles vaccine while in the same breath falsely claiming it hasn’t been “safety tested” and its protection is short-lived.
Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist now overseeing federal health agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had shied away from a full-throated endorsement of measles vaccinations, instead claiming the vaccine is the “most effective way” to prevent the virus’ spread.
In an interview Wednesday with CBS News, Kennedy said the Trump administration was focused on finding ways to treat people who choose not to get vaccinated. However, there are no approved treatments for measles, which kills almost 3 out of every 1,000 people diagnosed.
Many medical experts have taken issue with his approach to the current measles outbreak, which has included emphasizing unproven treatments and framing vaccination as a personal choice (which some doctors view as a nod to his anti-vaccine supporters).
Kennedy also suggested that measles cases are inevitable in the United States because of ebbing immunity from vaccines — a notion doctors say is false.
“We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,” Kennedy said.
Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine offer lifelong protection. That’s because the vaccine stimulates the production of memory cells, he said, which can recognize the virus over a lifetime.
“We eliminated measles from this country. That could never happen if immunity waned,” said Offit, who serves on an independent vaccine advisory committee for the FDA.
Aside from occasional outbreaks, measles hasn’t been constantly present in the United States since before 2000. It is introduced locally by international travelers, and from there it can spread among undervaccinated communities.
“The federal government’s position is, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But the government should not be mandating those,” Kennedy told CBS News.
The federal government doesn’t mandate childhood vaccines; rather, all 50 states require them for children attending public school. The FDA approves vaccines based on safety and efficacy, and the CDC makes recommendations about who should get them, which states often choose to follow.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, all 50 states have exemptions to vaccine mandates for medical reasons, and all but five have additional exemptions for other reasons, such as religious or personal objections.
The current outbreak was fueled by transmission in a primarily Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, where vaccine hesitancy is prevalent. There have been 668 total cases since January, according to NBC News’ tally, including two pediatric deaths and one suspected death in an unvaccinated adult. Before those deaths, the United States hadn’t had a measles death in a decade, and a child hadn’t died of measles since 2003.
Kennedy has pointed to higher case numbers in Europe as evidence that the United States is responding appropriately to the outbreak. But the figure he has cited recently — roughly 127,000 measles cases in Europe — is the total for last year across 53 countries. Low vaccination rates in southeastern Europe were a major contributor, according to the World Health Organization.
“He has this way of kind of twisting things,” said Dr. William Moss, director of the Johns Hopkins International Vaccine Access Center. “We should be comparing measles in the United States this year to measles in the United States in prior years. To say Europe has more cases over one year than we’ve had in three months this year, it’s just a false comparison.”
This year’s count in the United States is the highest since 2019, when there was a major outbreak in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. Doctors fear the United States could be on the verge of losing its measles elimination status as Kennedy continues to sow doubt about vaccine safety.
“Right now we don’t know the risks of many of these products because they’re not safety tested,” Kennedy told CBS News. “Many of the vaccines are only tested for three or four days with no placebo group.”
Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, said vaccine development usually takes 10 to 20 years, with the notable exception of Covid shots, which were brought to market in less than a year thanks to mRNA technology and a coordinated, worldwide effort. (Even then, the foundational research behind mRNA vaccines dates to 1997.)
When it comes to childhood immunizations, many of which were approved decades ago, there may not have been placebo controls or long-term safety follow-ups for each one, Levy said. However, he noted that even after vaccines are approved, various government-led surveillance systems monitor for adverse reactions. And in the rare case they find anything, that vaccine is pulled from the market, he added.
Moss agreed that the types of clinical trials for vaccines have changed over time. However, “I don’t think there’s any other product we use that’s more rigorously evaluated for both safety and efficacy,” he said.
Offit said Kennedy “just keeps picking and picking” at vaccine safety with statements that aren’t scientifically valid — for instance, by suggesting that all childhood vaccines weren’t tested against placebos, when, in fact, many were.
“The problem with RFK Jr. is his definition of ‘placebo,’” Offit said. “His definition of placebo is either water or saline, meaning just normal sodium chloride, but that’s not the FDA’s definition. The FDA’s definition is something that’s inert.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said Kennedy “raised valid concerns about vaccine trial practices, including the use of active comparators instead of inert placebos and short observation windows — issues backed by public data.”
But doctors said there’s a legitimate reason to use active comparators — vaccines that have already been approved for given infections — instead of placebos: It would be unethical to withhold the benefit of a vaccine from study participants, so trials often test new vaccines against older versions.
Levy said there’s always room for more safety studies or longer-term follow-up.","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","April 11, 2025, 5:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-says-hhs-will-determine-cause-autism-september-rcna200768,RFK Jr. says HHS will determine the cause of autism by September,Kids' Health,"The nation’s top health agency will undertake a “massive testing and research effort” to determine the cause of autism, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Thursday.
Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic who has pushed a discredited theory that routine childhood shots cause the developmental disability, said the effort will be completed by September and involve hundreds of scientists. He shared the plans with President Donald Trump during a televised Cabinet meeting.
Trump suggested that vaccines could be to blame for autism rates, although decades of research have concluded there is no link between the two.
“There’s got to be something artificial out there that’s doing this,” Trump told Kennedy. “If you can come up with that answer, where you stop taking something, eating something, or maybe it’s a shot. But something’s causing it.”
Autism is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. It presents with a wide range of symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills.
There’s scientific consensus that childhood vaccines don’t cause autism. Leading autism advocacy groups, including Autism Speaks, agree.
Research, including studies of twins, shows genes play a large role. No single environmental factor has been deemed a culprit. The National Institutes of Health, which already spends more than $300 million yearly researching autism, lists some possible risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or low birth weight, certain maternal health problems or parents conceiving at an older age.
Kennedy has offered no details on how his study will be different or what researchers will be involved. Leading autism organizations, such as the Autism Society of America, have not been included in discussions about the research, said ASA spokeswoman Kristyn Roth.
Roth said many agree that more research is needed to determine what causes autism, but Kennedy’s approach has raised alarms.
“There is a deep concern that we are going backward and evaluating debunked theories,” Roth said.
Trump and Kennedy have both expressed concerns about rising autism diagnoses rates.
Some of that increase is due to increased awareness and a change in how the disability is diagnosed. For decades, the diagnosis was given only to kids with severe problems communicating or socializing and those with unusual, repetitive behaviors. But around 30 years ago, the term became shorthand for a group of milder, related conditions known as ″autism spectrum disorders.” Milder autism cases are far more common than severe ones.
With improved screening and autism services, diagnosis is increasingly happening at younger ages, too. And there’s been more awareness and advocacy for Black and Hispanic families, leading to an increase in autism diagnosed among those groups.
Still, anti-vaccine advocates, including Kennedy, have claimed that vaccines are to blame. The theory largely stems from a 1998 paper that was later retracted.
Scientists have since ruled out a link between vaccines and autism, finding no evidence of increased rates of autism among those who are vaccinated compared to those who are not.
Kennedy has hired David Geier, a man who has repeatedly claimed a link between vaccines and autism, to lead the autism research effort. The hiring of Geier, who the state of Maryland found was practicing medicine on a child without a doctor’s license, was first reported by The Washington Post.",Unknown,"April 11, 2025, 5:39 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mens-health/peptides-explained-supplements-claim-boost-athletic-performance-rcna198890,Does peptide therapy actually work?,Men's Health,"Dr. Jesse Mills regularly sees men who want to improve something about their body.
Mills, the director of the Men’s Clinic at UCLA Health, usually offers advice like diet, exercise — maybe physical therapy to help recover from an injury.
In recent months, however, some patients have come to him with a solution already in mind: peptide therapy.
“Week by week more people are asking about peptides,” Mills said.
Peptide therapy has become a mainstay online and in fitness communities. Popular figures including Andrew Huberman and Joe Rogan have discussed them on podcasts. On Reddit, one group focused on peptides has 100,000 subscribers, where users are flocking to them looking to tone their physique, recover faster from injuries, sleep better and even improve skin tone. In February, the telehealth giant Hims & Hers announced it had acquired a peptide facility in California to help “deliver personalized medications.”
“Everybody’s looking for that edge and everybody’s looking to build the perfect Hollywood body,” Mills said. “I think the thought is that they look at it [peptide therapy] as a more natural way of doing either growth hormone replacement or testosterone replacement.”
However, while there are some small studies suggesting certain peptides may have benefits, there’s no strong evidence that peptide therapy provides any meaningful difference in performance and recovery, experts said.
“You have to do your research to know what actually has undergone human trials and what has undergone podcast trials,” Mills said.
Peptides are short chains of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Long peptide chains will fold onto themselves and link with other peptide chains, forming proteins.
A huge range of molecules found in the body are peptides, including insulin, oxytocin and endorphins. Many other synthetic peptides — made in a lab — are approved as drugs, including semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic) and linaclotide (the active ingredient in Linzess, a drug for irritable bowel syndrome).
But a number of peptides — not approved by the Food and Drug Administration and entirely unregulated — have grown in popularity, pitched as solutions to shorten recovery time from injuries, enhance athletic performance and improve libido.
“The ones that are getting attention in the gym are what we call ‘secretagogues,’” Mills said, which are popular because of the belief they can aid in muscle growth and repair.
This includes a synthetic peptide called sermorelin. Sermorelin is meant to act on the pituitary gland in the brain, telling it to release human growth hormone, which, in turn, leads to higher levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, a molecule that’s believed to help stimulate muscle growth and repair.
Dr. Larry Lipshultz, chief of the division of male reproductive medicine and surgery at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that his patients who take sermorelin primarily take it because they want to lose body fat and have a more defined physique.
“People who take it claim they feel better, they sleep better, they wake up more refreshed,” Lipshultz said. “But a lot of the problem with your peptides is there’s very little scientific evaluation of what they do and of their side effects.”
Another peptide popular in the fitness community is body protection compound-157, or BPC-157, Mills said. In lab studies, it’s been shown to promote wound and tissue healing, leading some to call it the “wolverine peptide.”
It’s thought to work by promoting activity of fibroblasts, said Dr. Travis Dekker, an orthopedic surgeon at the United States Air Force Academy in Monument, Colorado. These are cells that can help to restore connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments after an injury. It’s also believed to help with synthesizing proteins, which could help with recovery, he said.
He added that BPC-157 is the peptide he gets the most questions about from patients.
“Athletes ask me, ‘Hey, I injured my rotator cuff. Can I get this online and then therapeutically injected into my rotator cuff?’” Dekker said.
The demand — and lack of strong evidence supporting the peptide’s use — led him to write a letter to the editor in the Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery calling for more research into these compounds.
BPC-157 and sermorelin are both banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, and, as of 2024, BPC-157 was listed as a prohibited substance by the NCAA.
“If you have a drug that is manufactured by a big-brand pharmaceutical company, they won’t even bring it to the public until the due diligence is done with efficacy and side effects,” Lipschultz said. Peptides, he added, “just come out from these peptide laboratories with little or no studies.”
Most of the studies on popular peptides have largely been conducted in animals and there isn’t much data in humans.
However, a handful of human studies suggest that some peptides might be worth exploring further in larger, more rigorous studies.
A small study of 16 patients found that an injection of BPC-157 directly into the knee may help alleviate knee pain. Another small study, with just 12 participants, found that the compound helped reduce symptoms in women with interstitial cystitis, a painful bladder condition, after traditional treatment stopped working. No adverse events were reported in either study, but the small number of participants makes it difficult to draw broader conclusions.
Another peptide, kisspeptin, has shown promise in improving libido in both men and women in two small randomized trials in the United Kingdom. The peptide is naturally occurring in the body, but synthetic versions also exist.
Lipschultz said that if he has patients who are trying to lose weight or having trouble sleeping, he will sometimes prescribe peptides through a compounding pharmacy, but only in addition to regular FDA-approved treatments.
“I don’t treat people just with peptides,” he said.
The lack of rigorous human studies also means that data about side effects is missing as well as proper dosing regimens, Dekker said.
“We don’t know the duration or concentration of the drug that needs to be delivered,” he said. “We don’t know the timing during the day or the timing of when it is administered in the setting of an injury.”
As a result, patients often try a variety of doses at various intervals with unclear benefits.","Akshay Syal, M.D., Akshay Syal, M.D.","April 11, 2025, 3:00 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/skinnytok-weight-loss-trend-tiktok-rcna200484,What is 'SkinnyTok'? The weight loss trend preaches tough love but comes with risks,Culture & Trends,"Warning: This article discusses eating disorders. If you or a loved one is struggling with an eating disorder, the National Eating Disorders Association offers a free and confidential screening tool, support, resources and treatment options.
As an anti-diet culture influencer in recovery from an eating disorder, she says, Phaith Montoya prefers not to engage with body-shaming social media posts. She tells TODAY.com she’d retired from battling people in the comments on TikTok — until last month, when so many of her 3 million followers started asking her about #SkinnyTok that she decided to take a look.
The content posted with the hashtag reminded her of the 2010s-era “pro-anorexia Tumblr” and “eating disorder Twitter,” so she decided to speak out in a TikTok that’s since gotten over a million views.
Montoya, 27, was about 9 years old when she was first put on a diet. She ate less than her brother but weighed more, and her doctor was concerned. Without any referrals to counselors or dietitians, she says her parents did the best they could.
Montoya cycled through restrictive fad diets and their emotional fallout for years, and eventually was diagnosed with hypothyroid disease, which can lead to weight gain, among other symptoms, according to Mayo Clinic. In college, she started seeing mental health and nutrition professionals who gave her science-backed tools and support. She also learned she’d been struggling with binge-eating disorder.
Now years into her recovery, Montoya says she was still “so jarred, so taken aback” by what she saw on SkinnyTok.
“I know that if I had seen that (advice) when I was younger, I would have thought I needed it, too,” she says. “I felt inclined to speak for the girl that I was.”
In her response video, Montoya explained that her mental health was at its lowest when her eating disorder peaked, and her “life completely changed when I just stopped hating myself.” She said she wanted to reject the message she observed in so many SkinnyTok videos — that thinness leads to happiness.
“SkinnyTok” is hugely successful by the numbers, with thousands of posts and millions of views across several platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and a popular Reddit thread. A Google search estimates there are about 38,000 TikTok posts with the hashtag.
The results page for “SkinnyTok” on the platform that inspired the name shows a message that reads, “You are more than your weight,” which, if tapped on, shares links to help find support for disordered eating, including the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA). TikTok’s health resources were developed in collaboration with experts like Cleveland Clinic, National Institute of Mental Health, World Health Organization and more, a spokesperson says.
But beneath this banner are thousands of videos displaying weight-loss advice, body checks and before-and-afters packaged with words like “discipline,” “tough love” and “hard truths.”
Creators in the SkinnyTok world, most of whom appear to be women in their teens and 20s, often reshare their favorite “SkinnyTok” sayings. Some common ones are:
“If your stomach is growling, pretend it’s applauding you.”
“To be small, eat small. To be big, eat big.”
“You don’t need a treat. You’re not a dog.”
On a given day, SkinnyTok devotees — and there are plenty — may be exposed to videos recommending calorie counts so low that I, as a registered dietitian, would almost never suggest them, not for a petite woman nor a still-growing teen. Research shows that extreme weight loss and fad diets don’t work in the long term, typically ending in regain, and the changes in metabolism and hormones may leave a person struggling more than before.
I also encountered little to no content about important nutrients like calcium, iron or vitamin D in my time searching the hashtag. Another theme noticeably missing? Joy, whether from moving your body, a tasty, nutritious meal, or achieving a non-scale victory.
According to TikTok’s community guidelines, it does “not allow showing or promoting disordered eating and dangerous weight loss behaviors.” However, content “that shows or promotes potentially harmful weight management” is allowed but restricted to people 18 or older and doesn’t appear on the For You Feed.
The TikTok algorithm also blocks repetitive content patterns, which can prevent videos about weight loss, extreme exercise and similar topics from being viewed too often, according to a spokesperson.
Much of the advice on SkinnyTok boils down to eating less and moving more as the only way to lose weight, and it ignores the complexity of the science around weight loss and the relationship between health and weight. (TikTok says it works with independent fact-checkers and public health authorities to verify the accuracy of content and may apply warning labels when it cannot be verified.)
But the main concern of the experts I spoke to was that many videos were encouraging viewers to feel shame around certain habits, which can have lasting, dangerous effects, research shows.
Scrolling through SkinnyTok, “I hear, ‘You’re not good enough. You’re not trying hard enough,’” Paula Edwards-Gayfield, licensed professional counselor and NEDA board member, tells TODAY.com. “If we remove the external behaviors, what’s underlying eating disorders is this core belief that I’m not good enough.”
Feelings of shame can make weight loss and implementing healthier behaviors more difficult, research shows, whereas self-compassion makes them more likely. That’s why I often tell my clients that their bodies deserve respect right now because shame-style coaching is based on bias, not science.
Dietitian Andrea Mathis of the Beautiful Eats and Things blog recently wrote about SkinnyTok’s “dangerous rise” and how she understands why people are clamoring for content that claims to help you become the ideal body type.
“Intentional weight loss is sometimes the right thing to suggest, and I’ve seen people say (SkinnyTok) has made them more aware of what they put into their body,” Mathis tells TODAY.com.
While there’s nothing wrong with that on the surface, she worries there’s too much emphasis on restriction. “Maybe it starts one way, but the more you do it with that mindset, it can turn into obsession,” she explains.
According to NEDA, exposure to weight stigma, in particular the message that “thinner is better,” can lead to disordered eating behaviors or a diagnosable eating disorder. People who struggle with depression and anxiety have a higher risk of eating disorders, and research links social media use to these conditions.
People with eating disorders, about 9% of the U.S. population, often get trapped in a lifelong recovery process and sustain physical damage, including heart problems, gastrointestinal issues, cognitive declines, organ failure and more.
For many, the struggle turns fatal. Eating disorders, especially anorexia, are among the deadliest mental health conditions, alongside substance use disorders. People of color are especially at risk because they’re less likely to receive care, according to NEDA.
If you’re interested in losing weight, it’s best to talk to a dietitian or other health professional. The most effective approach for you will depend on your age, medical history and more, and you can’t get that specificity from an influencer online.
“Even if some of the creators have good intentions, they are sometimes giving nutrition advice, which they should not do,” Mathis says.
Liam Fisher-Layton, a fitness content creator, tries to combat shame-fueled weight loss tactics on social media, in particular for men and boys, who are also at risk of eating disorders. He prefers to highlight the benefits of protein, fiber and other nutrients, as well as fun activity, instead of restriction and punishing gym routines.
“What I see a lot of (men and boys) saying is, ‘I need the toxic motivation,’” which he finds unfortunate, he tells TODAY.com. “Maybe it helps this small percentage of people, and it doesn’t cause an eating disorder, but how many others are going to be harmed? Is the benefit worth the cost? To me, absolutely not.”
Mathis says seeing the SkinnyTok trend “broke my heart. I felt like we were going backwards.”
But body-shaming never really left us, according to Martha Laham, author of “Made Up“ and an expert on body image and marketing.
“SkinnyTok is just another version of something we’ve seen in the past,” she tells TODAY.com.
Citing the 1920s flapper diet, the 1960s obsession with supermodel Twiggy and 1990s “heroin chic,” Laham says, “The types of media and how we pursue it may be new, but the thin ideal has always been there when we take a historical look at Western beauty.”
Edwards-Gayfield agrees that SkinnyTok is just an extension of the already prevalent, restrictive “diet mentality.”
“It just really (embodies) the entirety of what my patients experience,” she adds. “It is so ever-present that it’s difficult for people to acknowledge that it’s dieting. It’s easy to normalize it because people don’t think there’s a problem with the behavior.”
Laham points out in her book that decades of research show clear ties between consumption of “appearance-focused media” and disordered eating and body image, especially for young women. She hopes more people can learn to see through it.
If you’re worried you or a loved one might be at risk of an eating disorder due to social media, keep in mind the warning signs, Edwards-Gayfield says.
For example, are your thoughts increasingly consumed with diet and exercise routines? Are you withdrawing from meals with friends and family because you need to adhere to a strict regimen?
“This is where things start to go into disordered territory,” and it’s time to get help, she says. That’s especially true when a person turns to other harmful, “emotionally driven” behaviors, such as exercising when injured or substance use, she adds.
The bottom line? You may be able to learn some tips on social media that can help you meet your fitness goals, especially if you’re focused first on caring for yourself, but experts agree you can’t hate yourself healthy.
For example, I often recommend unsweetened sparkling water as a replacement for soda to reduce added sugar and foster an appreciation for less sweet tastes. What I don’t do is suggest it as a replacement for a meal.
You may also want to try curating your feed. On TikTok, it’s possible “to filter out videos with words or hashtags (you) don’t want to see from (your) For You or Following feed,” the website notes. Just go to your content preferences, and add the keyword you no longer want to engage with.
Following creators and groups who nourish your mind, body and soul can also make your feed more positive. Here are a few suggestions from the experts, as well as my own:
Recovering from an eating disorder can take years, as Montoya can attest.","Heather Martin, RD, Heather Martin, RD","April 10, 2025, 3:43 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085,RFK Jr. draws from misinformation playbook by touting an inhaled steroid to treat measles,Measles Outbreak,"The measles outbreak in West Texas has reignited familiar anti-vaccine tactics: claiming there are readily available treatments for the disease while sowing doubt in the safety of vaccines.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Sunday touted two particular medications that have not been shown to work as first-line treatments for measles: the steroid budesonide and the antibiotic clarithromycin.
Although experts say there are no specific treatments proven to help people recover faster from measles, Kennedy claimed on X that the medications had been instrumental in treating around 300 children in Texas, and told Fox News that doctors prescribing them had seen “very, very good results.” Kennedy has been sharply criticized by medical experts for weeks for spreading misinformation about the measles vaccine and failing to encourage parents to vaccinate their children. (He has since said that the vaccine is the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles, and on Wednesday said that people should get it.)
Since January, measles has taken off in a primarily Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, where vaccine hesitancy is prevalent. Families in the community have turned to questionable remedies like budesonide to treat their illnesses — in some cases, at the recommendation of two Texas doctors, Dr. Ben Edwards and Dr. Richard Bartlett.
On Sunday, Kennedy called Edwards and Bartlett “extraordinary healers” who have “treated and healed” hundreds of children with budesonide and clarithromycin, sharing a photo of himself and the doctors with three Mennonite families whose children had become ill. Two of the families had each recently lost a daughter to measles: 6-year-old Kayley Fehr died in February and 8-year-old Daisy Hildebrand died last week. Neither child was vaccinated.
Edwards, a conventionally trained doctor who has shifted to promoting natural remedies and prayer, has been operating a makeshift clinic in Seminole, offering children these unproven treatments — including, according to a video posted by an anti-vaccine group, while he said he was sick with measles. Edwards has allied himself with the anti-vaccine movement in recent months, hosting influencers and activists on his podcast, including Barbara Loe Fisher of the National Vaccine Information Center, Brian Hooker of Children’s Health Defense and Andrew Wakefield, the discredited British doctor behind a retracted study that fraudulently linked autism to the MMR vaccine.In addition to the two measles deaths in Texas, an adult in New Mexico died in early March. While the death is still under investigation, the individual tested positive for measles after death. There have been 657 measles cases so far this year, the highest total since 2019 when there was a major outbreak in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York, according to NBC News’ tally of state health department data. Most are tied to the Texas outbreak, which has spilled into several neighboring states. The vast majority of patients were not vaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.
There are no treatments for measles itself, although children may need medical care to treat complications, such as pneumonia. Because of this, public health experts emphasize the importance of getting two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which are 97% effective at preventing the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“There is no evidence to support the use of either aerosolized budesonide or clarithromycin for treatment of children with measles,” said Dr. Adam Ratner, a spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Prescribing treatments that have not been vetted in clinical trials amounts to experimenting on patients, added Dr. Susan McLellan, a professor in the infectious diseases division at the University of Texas Medical Branch.
“It is very understandable that people want to grasp onto a hopeful remedy,” McLellan said. “It is unfortunate when trusted providers of advice, such as those in higher levels of our government, are not very clearly stating what is upheld by scientific evidence and what is not.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said Kennedy has offered clear guidance that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent measles.
Edwards declined to comment. Bartlett did not respond to requests for comment.
During the Covid pandemic, fringe doctors hyped unproven cures like ivermectin — an antiparasitic drug typically used for worm infections — while making unsubstantiated claims about the dangers of mRNA shots. Kennedy himself told podcaster Joe Rogan in 2023 that ivermectin was discredited because various groups stood to make money off Covid vaccines.
Edwards and Bartlett, the doctors treating measles patients in Texas, have a similar history of questioning vaccine safety. Edwards shared dubious claims about injuries and deaths related to Covid vaccines at a Texas state legislative hearing in 2021. And Bartlett touted budesonide as a “silver bullet” to treat Covid during the pandemic.
During the measles outbreak, they have each warned of risks associated with the MMR vaccine: Edwards claimed, falsely, that it causes “potentially” hundreds of deaths a year and Bartlett has said that the complications caused by measles, including brain swelling and pneumonia, can also be caused by the vaccine. In reality, the MMR vaccine, which is only given to children with healthy immune systems, has been overwhelmingly safe since its approval more than five decades ago, and has saved an estimated 94 million lives worldwide. Some people may experience temporary side effects such as a fever, rash or joint pain, which are expected after vaccination.
Measles, on the other hand, is highly contagious and can be life-threatening for the unvaccinated. On average, measles kills almost 3 out of every 1,000 people diagnosed.
But anti-vaccine activists have tried to link the two recent pediatric deaths to medical malpractice instead, which NBC News could not verify. On an episode of Edwards’ podcast, “You’re the Cure,” on Monday, Bartlett attributed at least one measles death in the U.S. to “medical error,” claiming that a child had not been treated with the appropriate antibiotic for a secondary bacterial infection.
Covenant Children’s Hospital, which treated the first child who died, called such claims circulating online “misleading and inaccurate.” University Medical Center Children’s Hospital, which treated the second child, said in a statement Sunday that the patient had no known underlying health conditions and was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized.
Dr. Robert Malone, an anti-vaccine activist, similarly suggested in his newsletter over the weekend that the two pediatric deaths were due to medical error, and that budesonide could have saved at least one child’s life.
Budesonide is normally used to treat inflammatory diseases. In capsule form, it’s an effective treatment for Crohn’s disease. And its inhaled form can reduce asthma symptoms.
Bartlett said on Edwards’ podcast that he realized, through divine intervention in March 2020, that budesonide could help save the lives of people who were critically ill with Covid.
“While I was asleep, an answer to prayer came to me,” he said. “It will shut down the release of the cytokines, the inflammatory chemicals from the lung lining.”
He pointed to trials out of the University of Oxford that he said supported that claim. The trials showed that budesonide could shorten recovery times in nonhospitalized patients, but there’s no firm evidence that it can reduce the risk of hospitalization or death from Covid.
Steroids should not be given early in the course of a viral infection like measles, because they inhibit the immune system, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
“That’s not what you want to do,” he said. “Your immune system works for you” to fight measles.
Doctors do use steroids in people with Covid who have late-stage pneumonia if their immune system has become overactive, Offit said.
Doctors prescribe budesonide, administered by either an inhaler or nasal spray, to reduce wheezing in people with asthma, he added. While people with measles develop a cough, they don’t really wheeze.
Kennedy’s suggestion that measles patients could benefit from clarithromycin similarly lacks context, pediatricians and infectious disease doctors said.
Antibiotics are designed to kill bacteria, not viruses, so they don’t work against measles itself. But measles can weaken the body so much that people develop a bacterial infection such as staphylococcus or streptococcus.
Offit said doctors typically treat such infections with a combination of antibiotics called vancomycin and ceftriaxone. These medications are given intravenously, he said, whereas clarithromycin usually comes in pill form. Studies show it’s more effective to treat severe infections, such as bacterial pneumonia or sepsis, with intravenous antibiotics, which help ensure that adequate levels of the antibiotics make it into the bloodstream. Patients who take antibiotics by mouth may not receive a high enough dose to combat a serious infection, because the medication has to go through the intestines, where it may not be fully absorbed.
“You don’t treat severe infections orally,” Offit said. “It would be too risky.”
Clarithromycin is also a broad-spectrum antibiotic, meaning it targets a wide range of bacteria, said Dr. Paul Kilgore, a professor at Wayne State University’s Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.
“If we treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics, we don’t know exactly what we’re treating [and] we run the risk of increasing antibiotic resistance,” he said.
Public health experts said touting these medications as first-line treatments sends the wrong message.","Aria Bendix, Brandy Zadrozny, Aria Bendix, Brandy Zadrozny","April 10, 2025, 12:34 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ousted-fda-vaccine-chief-us-measles-elimination-status-threat-rcna199966,Ousted FDA vaccine chief says U.S. measles elimination status under threat as cases climb,Measles Outbreak,"Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “tepid endorsement” of measles vaccination puts the U.S. at risk of losing its elimination status of the disease as early as January, the Food and Drug Administration’s former top vaccine regulator said Tuesday — as experts warn the Texas outbreak may become among the biggest on record.
“Given the current measles outbreak, anything less than a wholehearted full-court press to get many more children vaccinated against measles, above 90% across the country, is a public health failure,” Dr. Peter Marks, the former director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, who was ousted last month, told NBC News in an interview.
At a press briefing Tuesday, Texas health officials said the state’s outbreak had spread to 22 counties and continues to spread in Lubbock, where cases had jumped from 10 to 36. As of Tuesday, the number of measles cases in the state reached 505, up from 481 cases Friday. About 70% of the cases are children, said Katherine Wells, Lubbock’s director of public health. Six or seven kids at a day care in Lubbock have tested positive for measles, she added.
At least 57 people have been hospitalized in the area. On Saturday, a school-age girl being treated for measles-related complications died in Lubbock, becoming the second pediatric death in the fast-growing outbreak. Both children were unvaccinated.
More than 650 cases of measles have been reported in 21 states and the District of Columbia this year, more than double the number of U.S. cases in all of 2024, according to an NBC News tally.
On Sunday, Kennedy, who went to Texas to visit with the family of the child who died, posted on X that growth rates for new cases and hospitalizations had flattened.
However, the case count is likely an underestimate, experts say, since many people are likely not getting tested and illnesses are going undetected.
During the Tuesday press call, Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said, “If you already have two deaths in Texas, it tells you it’s in the thousands.”
“I suspect this is probably one of the biggest on record,” Adalja said.
Wells said on the call, “We’re in this for the long haul.”
Marks said Kennedy needs to push parents to get their children vaccinated more than ever, which he says Kennedy isn’t doing.
In a post on X, Kennedy wrote, “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”
Kennedy did not, however, encourage people to get vaccinated. He also pushed remedies, including a steroid called budesonide, an antibiotic called clarithromycin and cod liver oil, a supplement high in vitamin A. None are proven treatments for the measles, experts say. High doses of vitamin A can cause nausea, vomiting and liver damage, especially in small children.
“He comes out with the most tepid endorsement of vaccination he possibly could,” Marks said.
Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has one of the state’s highest vaccine exemption rates, at nearly 18%, compared to 3% nationally, according to state data.
If more children don’t get vaccinated, more of them will die, Marks said, and the U.S. will lose the measles elimination status it’s held since 2000. A country loses its status once an outbreak extends longer 12 months, he said. The Texas Department of State Health Services issued its first alert on measles in January. Adalja, of Johns Hopkins, said the outbreak is going to be “really something that pushes us to the deadline for elimination for the United States, as well as the Americas.”
“I think we’re well on our way,” said Marks, referring to the nation’s measles status.
An official at the Department of Health and Human Services said Mark's suggestion that the administration's endorsement of vaccination has been ""tepid"" is inaccurate.
""Contrary to Dr. Mark's claims, the department has been aggressively working to address the current outbreak, increase vaccination rates, and provide support to states in need,"" the official said.
Losing elimination status doesn’t actually carry any legal force, according to Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco.
“It’s a blow to our achievements,” Reiss said. “Measles still comes into our country and always has from people from abroad, but we don’t have domestic grown outbreaks. Losing the status means that’s no longer true.”
Without it, Marks said, people may find they need to prove their immunization status before traveling outside the U.S.
“Although that is trivial, it underlies the importance of getting this outbreak under control and protecting our children,” Marks said.
Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective in preventing infection.
Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said communities with low vaccination rates have been previously spared from outbreaks, as the U.S. hasn’t experienced the same level of measles activity seen 50 or 60 years ago, thanks to the MMR vaccine.
However, with the disease starting to spread again in the U.S., people may need to reconsider the risks of not getting vaccinated.
“I think that’s where people are challenged right now,” Creech said. “People haven’t thought about measles for maybe a generation or two, and they made a calculus about vaccines because they heard or read something.”
Measles is dangerous, Reiss said — a fact that should be repeatedly acknowledged by government health officials.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","April 9, 2025, 8:21 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/parenting/parents-are-worried-day-cares-giving-kids-melatonin-rcna200223,Parents are worried about day cares giving their kids melatonin,Parenting,"Laura Putnam never thought her sons would receive melatonin supplements at day care.
She enrolled them at Apple Blossom Childcare in Falmouth, Maine, when they were 1 and 2 years old. She said she hasn’t given them melatonin and hasn’t granted anyone else permission to give them the supplement, which mimics a hormone produced in the brain that makes people sleepy.
But in August, Putnam said, she learned from a former employee at the day care center that he and others had given melatonin gummies to children, including her older son, who was 4 years old at the time. She said she saw text messages between the former employee and the day care center’s owner about melatonin use.
Putnam asked her older son about it. “He said, ‘Oh, it makes the babies go’ — and then he made a snoring sound,” she said. “He told me he got them when he was younger and they made him very sleepy. And then I asked if his younger brother got them, and he looked at me and said, ‘Yes.’ And I said, ‘How often does he get them?’ And he said, ‘Every day.’”
Putnam showed her younger son a photo of a bottle of melatonin gummies. “He immediately saw it and said, ‘That’s’ — and then he inserted the name of the day care provider,” she said.
Lindsay Corcoran said her daughter was also at Apple Blossom from ages 15 months to nearly 4. She said she also learned from texts between the former employee and the owner that her daughter received melatonin. “I was shocked to see her name and that there was this substance given to her without my consent,” she said.
Several parents, doctors and lawmakers nationwide are raising concerns, saying giving melatonin to young kids isn’t well-studied and shouldn’t be done without parental permission. Last year, child care staff members in New Hampshire and Washington made headlines for dispensing melatonin to children. An Indiana day care center’s director was sentenced to six months in jail after having pleaded guilty to giving melatonin gummies to kids without their parents’ consent.
In Maine, it isn’t illegal for day care centers to give children melatonin or other nonprescription medications, but they need parental consent. In August, after it received a complaint, Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services launched an investigation into allegations of abuse, neglect and licensing violations at Apple Blossom Childcare. Four months later, Putnam said, the agency informed her in a letter that her older son was “a victim of abuse/neglect.”
“I think I felt that, you know, I let my kids down,” Putnam said. “Anyone who is a parent, your No. 1 job is to protect your kids above all else. And getting that letter that said my son has been named on the record as a victim of abuse slash neglect, I feel like I let him down.”
Apple Blossom’s owner, Alison Lakin, appealed the December findings. Last month, the Department of Health and Human Services overturned its findings of abuse and neglect, indicating “there is insufficient information in the case record to support” them.
Lakin told NBC News, in part, “Apple Blossom Childcare has earned and enjoyed an impeccable reputation for years, which has been and always will be based on conscientious care and a love of helping children unlock their unique potential.”
Lakin is also appealing the findings that she violated day care licensing rules.
Putnam is frustrated with the reversal: “How is giving a nonverbal toddler melatonin in the middle of the day without parental consent not abuse or neglect? It doesn’t make any sense in my mind.”
Researchers say melatonin use in kids is on the rise. Calls to poison control centers from kids taking too much melatonin have also steadily increased over the last 10 years, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2022 found. While low doses of melatonin supplements may be given to children safely, Dr. Rebecca Fisk, a pediatrician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, doesn’t recommend melatonin use in kids under 5.
“We’re putting something unknown in a toddler’s body,” Fisk said. “We have no long-term studies on what is going on with melatonin in children, especially that young. We don’t know what it does to growth and development.”
Maine state Sen. Teresa Pierce is introducing a bill that would require day care operators to notify parents if their centers are under investigation.
“We need to protect kids, and parents need to be informed,” said Pierce, a Democrat. “My bill will create more transparency when an investigation starts at a day care or a child care area so that the parents that are in that day care can be informed of the investigation going forward.”
Putnam is pushing for stiffer penalties.","Kayla Steinberg, Vicky Nguyen, Kayla Steinberg, Vicky Nguyen","April 9, 2025, 6:47 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/eating-food-additives-together-may-increase-diabetes-risk-study-sugges-rcna200163,"Eating some food additives together may increase diabetes risk, study suggests",Health news,"Eating combinations of common food additives may be tied to a slightly increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine.
A growing body of evidence has linked certain food additives to cancer, diabetes, heart disease and changes to the gut microbiome. Many of these studies, however, were focused on single ingredients.
“In real life, we ingest a mixture of additives,” said Mathilde Touvier, director of the nutritional epidemiology research team at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, who co-authored the new study.
Touvier and her team looked at about eight years of data from more than 108,000 adults from the French NutriNet-Santé cohort, a long-running study that looks at the links between food and health.
Poring over the participants’ reported diets, the researchers identified five mixtures of additives people commonly consumed together. The combinations don’t look unlike an ingredient list you might find on the label of an ultra-processed food.
“It’s relatively uncommon for all of them to appear in a single product, however, it’s entirely possible to consume all of them across different foods throughout the day, especially when eating a variety of processed or ultra-processed foods,” said Mengxi Du, a research associate at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who studies nutrition and health and wasn’t involved with the study.
Carrageenan and potassium sorbate, two additives in Mixture 2, are found together in sweetened condensed milk. Xanthan gum is commonly found in mayonnaise and gluten-free prepared foods. Pectin is in cream cheese.
“These are pretty common products in someone’s fridge and a lot of times we combine them,” Du said.
Two groups — Mixture 2 and Mixture 5 — were linked to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, the researchers found. People with more of these combinations in their diet were more likely to develop the disease, regardless of how healthy their diet was overall.
Mixture 2 was heavy in emulsifiers and thickening agents, including carrageenans, which are found in plant-based milks and processed meats, and modified starches, which thicken and stabilize packaged sauces, soups and baked goods. Mixture 5 contained ingredients commonly found in sugary and artificially-sweetened drinks, and included artificial sweeteners, natural dyes and acidifiers.
Still, the study was observational, meaning it doesn’t show cause and effect. Studies that require participants to recall their diets are also notoriously tricky. The limitations make it difficult to draw strong conclusions from the study, which Touvier and her team said will require more research.
“The additives may be markers of something else, rather than causing Type 2 diabetes themselves,” said Dr. Tom Rifai, an internal and lifestyle medicine doctor in Cleveland Clinic’s department of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism. Rifai owns a lifestyle coaching company that includes nutrition counseling. “These could be a marker for what we call calorie density.”
Food additives are ubiquitous in ultra-processed foods, which usually pack in many more calories in much smaller amounts of food than minimally and unprocessed foods.
“At the very least, these additives are markers of ultra-processing, which we know makes people eat more without realizing they are taking in a lot more calories,” Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, said in an email.
The same is true for the three groups of additives that were not found to be linked to diabetes risk. Nestle said that while the study cannot show causation, the results are consistent with “present thinking that additives may well be anything but benign.”
Some food additives do play an important role in food safety. Potassium sorbate, for example, stops yeast and fungus from growing in packaged food. Others — including emulsifiers, which create certain textures, and artificial dyes — have come under scrutiny.
Last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. directed the Food and Drug Administration to review its rule on “generally recognized as safe,” or GRAS, ingredients. The rule allows manufacturers to add certain additives to food without FDA review. It was originally intended for common ingredients such as salt or vinegar but has come to cover an expansive range of additives.
In 2023, California became the first state to ban four food additives: brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben and Red Dye No. 3. In March, West Virginia banned seven food dyes.
In the first three months of this year, 20 states — including Illinois, Missouri, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania — introduced similar bans, but not on any of the additives included in the new study.
It’s too early to tell whether food additives, when eaten together, can have a synergistic effect, Du said. It’s possible that one ingredient, safe on its own, may be linked to health problems when combined with other ingredients, for example. Or an ingredient’s mild health effects could be amplified when mixed with other additives.",Unknown,"April 9, 2025, 3:23 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/mediterranean-diet-bone-density-loss-older-adults-exercise-rcna199968,How the Mediterranean diet and exercise can protect bone health in older adults,Women's Health,"A lower-calorie Mediterranean diet, combined with regular exercise, helped older women lose weight without causing bone density loss, new research suggests.
Weight loss, especially quick or significant weight loss, is known to reduce bone mineral density and increase risk of fracture. Older women are more prone to bone loss due to drops in estrogen during menopause.
Of the 10 million Americans with osteoporosis — a “silent” disease that weakens bones and rarely causes symptoms — more than 80% are women, a quarter of whom are aged 65 or older, according to the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Women’s Health.
Lifestyle changes, however, could offset those negative effects by preventing muscle loss, which plays a major role in overall bone strength, said Jesús García Gavilán, co-first author of the study and biostatistician at the University of Rovira I Virgili in Spain.
The research, published in the journal JAMA Network Open, builds on a 2023 study that found a similar low-calorie diet and exercise regime lowered total body and visceral fat (fat that surrounds organs) in the same study group.
In the new research, 924 Spanish adults ages 55–75 who are overweight or have obesity, and have metabolic syndrome — a cluster of conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar — were separated into two groups.
One group followed a Mediterranean diet with a 30% calorie reduction and gradually increased their physical activity to meet international recommendations for their age group.
The exercise routine consisted of:
People in the control group followed a Mediterranean diet with no restrictions or exercise recommendations.
A Mediterranean diet consists mostly of plant-based foods, fish and healthy fats like olive oil.
Each participant had their own daily calorie intake based on their weight, height and sex, Gavilan said. They reduced their calories by cutting down on meats and sausages, sugars, white bread, packaged fruit juices and sugary drinks.
All participants received special X-rays that measured their bone mineral density in their femur and lumbar spine at the start of the study and then a follow-up after three years.
Overall, bone density improved the most in the lumbar spine among those in the lower-calorie diet and exercise group, Gavilán said. Women received the most benefits with a 1.8% improvement in lumbar spine bone density.
Dr. Dolores Shoback, an endocrinologist with UCSF Health who was not involved in the study, called this a “very modest effect” compared to improvements you see with drugs used to treat osteoporosis. Studies have found increases in bone density in the lumbar spine anywhere from 3–13% after a year of treatment with these medications.
She said this is likely because the study participants didn’t have a lot of bone loss from the start, and they also didn’t lose that much weight. People in the intervention group lost 3% of their total body weight over three years, which equals to about three pounds on average, Gavilán said.
Still, experts say the study sheds light on the crucial roles diet and exercise play in mitigating the effects that rapid weight loss has on bone health— a phenomenon more people are experiencing with the use of weight loss drugs.
The risk of bone loss increases when a person drops a lot of weight in a short period of time, said Dr. Kristi Tough DeSapri, an internal medicine physician and osteoporosis expert with the Bone Health & Osteoporosis Foundation. Quick weight loss means there's less resistance on the bone as someone loses muscle along with fat, said DeSapri, who was not involved in the study.
Risk for bone loss depends on many factors, such as age, body weight, physical activity levels and diet. Hormonal changes associated with weight loss, as well as a lack of calcium and vitamin D in calorie-restricted diets, can also contribute to bone loss, research shows.
A 10% weight loss can result in a 1% to 2% bone loss in different areas of the body, research indicates. The bone loss numbers may double or triple in people who undergo bariatric surgery or use weight loss drugs such as semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy, DeSapri said.
A study published last year found that people who used GLP-1 medications without exercising experienced a significant decrease in bone density in their hip and spine; when exercise was added to the mix, bone mass was protected.
Shoback said the exercise regime in the new study may “be a big commitment every day” for older adults to realistically follow, but it could be valuable for younger adults who are at high risk for metabolic syndrome and may experience rapid weight loss with medications.
Although the study was conducted in Spain, experts say the diet and exercise plan could benefit adults in the U.S.
In the United States, there’s a big push now for protein and supplements, DeSapri said.
“But when we’re talking about obesity, metabolic syndrome and weight loss, the Mediterranean diet has already been validated as a lifestyle that can make a difference,” she said.
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of experts who recommend health screenings, says that women 65 years and older should receive a bone density scan for osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis risk can be lowered by staying physically active, not smoking, limiting alcohol use and getting enough vitamin D and calcium in the diet via milk and salmon, or supplements, Shoback said.
Hormone therapy is another effective way to reduce bone loss after menopause.",Unknown,"April 9, 2025, 1:55 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-says-plans-tell-cdc-stop-recommending-fluoride-drinking-water-rcna200127,RFK Jr. says he plans to tell CDC to stop recommending fluoride in drinking water,Health news,"SALT LAKE CITY — Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention soon to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide, adding that he’s assembling a task force to focus on the issue.
Also on Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing “new scientific information” on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.
Kennedy told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.
Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.
Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by May 7.
Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as “the leader in making America healthy again.” He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state’s fluoride law. “I’m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,” he said.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who appeared with Kennedy at the news conference, said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards.
“When this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency’s future steps,” Zeldin said. “Secretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water.
Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” and said also it’s been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.
Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.
About one-third of community water systems — 17,000 out of 51,000 across the U.S. — serving more than 60% of the population fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.
But over time, studies have documented potential problems. Too much fluoride has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. Studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development.",Unknown,"April 8, 2025, 6:55 AM GMT+8 / Updated April 8, 2025, 8:23 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/invasive-strep-infections-doubled-us-cdc-study-finds-rcna199759,"Invasive strep infections have more than doubled in the U.S., CDC study finds",Health news,"Severe, possibly life-threatening strep infections are rising in the United States.
The number of invasive group A strep infections more than doubled from 2013 to 2022, according to a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Prior to that, rates of invasive strep had been stable for 17 years.
Invasive group A strep occurs when bacteria spread to areas of the body that are normally germ-free, such as the lungs or bloodstream. The same type of bacteria, group A streptococcus, is responsible for strep throat — a far milder infection.
Invasive strep can trigger necrotizing fasciitis, a soft tissue infection also known as flesh-eating disease, or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, an immune reaction akin to sepsis that can lead to organ failure.
“Within 24 to 48 hours, you could have very, very rapid deterioration,” said Dr. Victor Nizet, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego. Cases can transition from “seeming like a routine flu-like illness to rushing the patient to the ICU, fearing for their recovery,” he added.
The data came from 10 states, with roughly 35 million people total, that track the infections.
In 2013, around 4 out of 100,000 people were diagnosed with invasive strep. By 2022, that rate had risen to around 8 out of 100,000. The number of cases rose from 1,082 in 2013 to 2,759 in 2022.
The study identified more than 21,000 total cases of the infection over the nine-year period, including almost 2,000 deaths.
“When you see this high number of deaths, extrapolate that across the country — we’re probably well into more than 10,000 deaths,” Nizet said.
Dr. Christopher Gregory, a CDC researcher and an author of the study, said the threat of invasive strep to both the general population and high-risk groups has “substantially increased.”
The study calls for “accelerated efforts” to prevent and control infections. It also offered a few possible explanations for the rise in cases.
First, rising rates of diabetes and obesity, among other underlying health conditions, over the study period made some people more vulnerable to invasive strep. Both diabetes and obesity can lead to skin infections or compromise the immune system.
Second, invasive strep is increasing among people who inject drugs, which can allow the bacteria to enter the bloodstream. Infections have also increased in people experiencing homelessness — in 2022, the rate of infections among this population was 807 out of 100,000. Gregory said the rate was “among the highest ever documented worldwide.”
Finally, strains of group A strep appear to be expanding and becoming more diverse, which could create new opportunities for infection. Strains that have expanded in recent years seem more likely to cause skin infections than throat infections, according to the study.
Those strains may also be driving resistance to antibiotics used to treat certain cases of invasive group A strep, macrolides and clindamycin. While penicillin is the go-to antibiotic to treat strep infections, it can be used in combination with clindamycin to treat toxic shock syndrome, and doctors sometimes prescribe a macrolide if a patient has a penicillin allergy.
Overall, the study found that the rate of infections was highest in adults ages 65 and older, and rose in all adults from 2013 to 2022. But it did not detect an increased rate in children.
“That was, to me, the most shocking part of the study,” said Dr. Allison Eckard, division chief for pediatric infectious diseases at the Medical University of South Carolina. “Because clinically, we really are seeing what feels like an increase.”
In late 2022, there were widespread reports from children’s hospitals of a spike in pediatric cases of invasive strep. The CDC issued an alert at the time, noting a possible link to respiratory viruses such as flu, Covid and RSV, which can make people susceptible to strep infections.
Eckard said pediatric cases have also started to look different in recent years.
“We are just seeing more severe cases, more unusual cases, more necrotizing fasciitis, and cases that do raise concern that there is something going on more nationally,” she said.
Eckard added that more research should explore whether certain strep strains are becoming more virulent, or if severe strains are becoming more prevalent.
Doctors said the rise in group A strep infections also points to the need for a vaccine, especially given the rise in antibiotic resistance. However, Nizet questioned whether that would be feasible now, with top vaccine scientists leaving the Food and Drug Administration.","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","April 7, 2025, 11:02 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/second-measles-death-texas-child-kennedy-rcna199882,Second measles death reported in Texas amid a fast-growing outbreak,Measles Outbreak,"Another child with measles in Texas has died, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed late Saturday.
The school-age girl was recently diagnosed with the viral disease and died at University Medical Center Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, the hospital said in a statement Sunday morning.
""The child was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized,"" the statement said. ""It is important to note that the child was not vaccinated against measles and had no known underlying health conditions. This unfortunate event underscores the importance of vaccination.""
It is the second pediatric death in a fast-growing outbreak that has infected nearly 500 people in Texas alone since January. An adult in New Mexico is also suspected of having died from measles. The deaths are the first from the disease in the United States in a decade.
As of Friday, the Texas Department of State Health Services said, 481 cases of measles had been confirmed, a 14% jump over last week.
They include six infants and toddlers at a Lubbock day care center who tested positive within the past two weeks.
Two of those children are among 56 people who have been hospitalized with measles in the area since the disease started spreading in late January, health officials said.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Sunday on X that he was in Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, to meet with families in the community. He said he had spoken to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to offer continued support and that teams from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention teams had been sent back to the state.
Kennedy said in the post that ""the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.""
Kennedy had been expected to attend the child’s funeral Sunday, according to a person familiar with the plans.
Around 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children infected with measles die from respiratory and neurological complications, according to the CDC. And about 1 of every 20 children with measles get pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in young children. The disease can also wipe out the immune system, a long-term complication called ""immune amnesia.""
The outbreak that began in Texas in January has spread to at least two other states.
Nationally, 628 measles cases have been reported in at least 21 states and Washington, D.C., this year, according to an NBC News tally.
The number is likely to be a vast underestimate, considering that many people aren’t getting tested for the virus, according to Lubbock’s public health director, Katherine Wells.
Wells and other health officials are imploring families to get their kids vaccinated against measles. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are safe and 97% effective in preventing infection, according to the CDC.
The first dose is generally given at 12 to 18 months, and the second is offered around age 5, when children enter kindergarten.","Erika Edwards, Erika Edwards","April 6, 2025, 12:31 PM GMT+8 / Updated April 7, 2025, 4:10 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-daycare-outbreak-confirmed-cases-rcna199631,Texas measles outbreak nears 500 cases as virus spreads among day care kids,Measles Outbreak,"Six young children at a Lubbock, Texas, day care center have tested positive for measles — a dreaded scenario with the potential to accelerate an already out-of-control outbreak that has spread to at least two other states.
More than a dozen other states and Washington, D.C. are dealing with cases of measles unrelated to Texas.
On Friday, the Texas Department of State Health Services said the toll rose to 481 confirmed cases, a 14% jump over last week. Fifty-six people have been hospitalized in the area since the disease started spreading in late January.
At the Tiny Tots U Learning Academy, a center with approximately 230 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, the outbreak began on March 24, when a little girl who had been sick with fever and vomiting tested positive. She later needed to be hospitalized for pneumonia and trouble breathing.
Kids who have tested positive at the day care so far are between the ages of 5 months and 3 years old, said Maegan Messick, a co-owner of the center. None was fully vaccinated against measles.
For nearly two weeks, Messick has been working with local health officials who are in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the situation. Messick said she’s not been given clear guidance on how to handle measles in such a large day care with so many vulnerable kids.
“From what I’m being told, the CDC doesn’t have a playbook for this,” Messick said. “We’ve just had to make judgment calls.”
The U.S. is facing the largest measles outbreak in six years, but the CDC has remained relatively silent on the public health threat, providing just weekly updates on its website and sending an alert to doctors last month. The agency sent 2,000 doses of the MMR vaccine to Texas health officials at their request, but hasn't held a news briefing about measles since 2019, when two large outbreaks in New York threatened to reverse the United States’ status of having eliminated the virus.
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which is over CDC, did not respond Friday to a question about whether any briefings were in the works to address the current measles outbreak.
It was unclear whether mass layoffs at HHS and CDC this week might stymie such efforts. But steep funding cuts to community health departments announced last week have already forced some areas to cancel vaccine clinics.
Dallas County, for example, had to cancel more than 50 clinics. Many had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates.
According to an NBC News tally, 628 measles cases have been reported nationally in 2025. Other states with outbreaks include Kansas with 23 cases, Oklahoma with 10 cases, and New Mexico with 54 cases. Public health officials in Ohio have identified 17.
The cases at the Lubbock day care center are likely linked to the epicenter of the outbreak, Gaines County, said Lubbock's public health director Katherine Wells.
Wells said she’s been concerned about cases spreading in child care centers since the beginning of the outbreak.
“I think we’ll have additional outbreaks in other day care centers,” she said. “This isn’t going to be the only one.”
Messick, of the Tiny Tots U Learning Academy, said she and her staff are trying to reduce risk of further spread by watching kids closely for symptoms and isolating certain classrooms.
They’re also urging other child care facilities to encourage their families to get the MMR vaccine. Families who choose not to vaccinate their children have been asked to keep them home for at least 21 days.
Two doses are almost always enough to give lifetime protection against measles, according to the CDC. Unvaccinated people who are exposed to the virus are almost certain to become infected.
The first dose isn’t usually given until after a child’s first birthday, but can be offered early, at 6 months.",Erika Edwards,"April 5, 2025, 6:07 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/top-vaccine-regulators-fda-threatening-new-approvals-rcna198898,"More top vaccine regulators out at FDA, threatening new approvals",Health news,"More top vaccine regulators at the Food and Drug Administration have either left or been forced out following the resignation last week of Dr. Peter Marks, the agency’s top vaccine official, according to four former and current government officials familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.
Experts say the exodus of top talent at the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research could hobble the agency’s ability to approve new vaccines and a wide range of other drugs — especially in the wake of the mass layoffs by the Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday.
It also leaves a void of experienced staff at a time when distrust in vaccines and health institutions is growing.
“It represents a hollowing-out of the agency, and especially a tremendous loss of institutional memory,” Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania, said of the departures. “I’m not sure people realize how important that is, and we will suffer from this.”
Offit serves on an independent vaccine advisory committee for the FDA that convenes at CBER’s request.
CBER is responsible for assuring the safety and effectiveness of a number of medical products, including vaccines and gene therapies. It played a key role in authorizing the first Covid vaccines in late 2020 and approving the first RSV vaccine in 2023. CBER also approved a cure for sickle cell disease that uses the gene-editing technology CRISPR.
Julia Tierney, who was deputy director of CBER under Marks, and her staff were cut as part of the sweeping layoffs at HHS, three of the officials said. (As of early Thursday afternoon, an agency directory still listed Tierney as acting director of the division.)
Christopher Joneckis, the director of the office of regulatory operations at CBER, which ensures vaccines and drugs are safe, was also purged on Tuesday, along with his staff, the sources said.
Sheryl Lard-Whiteford, the associate director for product management at CBER, responsible for monitoring vaccines and drugs once they’ve been approved, was also let go, the officials said. Although, according to one person, HHS may rescind her termination and try to bring her back.
Michelle Limoli, who worked with international partners on regulatory issues as associate director for international affairs at CBER, plans to retire, the officials said.
Tierney, Joneckis, Lard-Whiteford and Limoli did not respond to requests for comment.
The departures come as HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. works to reshape the public health infrastructure.
Kennedy has previously been critical of CBER’s decisions, filing a citizens petition in 2021 requesting that the FDA revoke the authorization for the Covid vaccines. The same year, he falsely described the Covid vaccine as the “deadliest vaccine ever made.”
A former official described the bleak state of CBER during the mass layoffs.
“It’s been an absolute disaster,” the official said. “Websites weren’t covered. Mailboxes weren’t being read. We had no one in document control to receive our papers. It was just a complete s---show.”
Now, the official said, the administration “has left us decapitated.”
“Staff are very concerned that additional risk will be coming,” the official said.
Last week, Marks, who has led CBER since 2016, was forced out.
In a resignation letter obtained by NBC News, Marks wrote that undermining confidence in vaccines is “irresponsible, detrimental to public health, and a clear danger to our nation’s health, safety, and security.”
The layoffs and resignations will have “real direct implications for every American,” said Arthur Caplan, the head of the division of medical ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City.One affected area is cancer vaccines. In February, for example, researchers reported that an mRNA vaccine for pancreatic cancer had promising results in an early-stage trial. Research is also underway on mRNA vaccines for melanoma and colorectal cancer.
Approval of those vaccines would fall under the purview of CBER.
At the World Vaccine Congress in 2024, Marks said the FDA was “open for business” on novel vaccines, including mRNA cancer vaccines.
With Marks’ departure and Kennedy’s disdain for mRNA technology, much of that progress on those treatments is threatened, Caplan said.
“I think that’s really going to slow down and people are going to die,” Caplan said. “The vaccines that might have been useful are not going to be moving fast because regulators aren’t there to approve them.”
The departures also come as the U.S. is in the midst of a bird flu crisis.
As of Tuesday, the virus had infected 998 dairy herds across 17 states, according to the Agriculture Department. It has led to the culling of more than 160 million poultry. At least 70 people, most of whom had direct contact with sick animals, have been infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One person has died.
In the event that the bird flu virus starts spreading from human to human, Offit said, CBER would be responsible for approving a vaccine.
A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.
Top officials within the division haven’t entirely been eliminated. Dr. David Kaslow, the director of CBER’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review, is still said to be at the agency following the mass layoffs Tuesday, two officials said.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Berkeley Lovelace Jr.","April 4, 2025, 5:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-children-weakening-system-hhs-budget-cuts-rcna199188,How Kennedy is already weakening America's childhood vaccine system,Health news,"Last week, Jackie Griffith showed up at her office at the Collin County Health Care Clinic in north Texas ready to start her day — answering emails from local doctors before heading to a nearby high school to go over the latest vaccine record requirements.
Instead, the 60-year-old registered nurse was called into her director’s office and told to pack up her belongings. The federal government had yanked funding, she learned, and her position — supporting vaccination efforts for uninsured children through a network of more than 60 providers — was gone.
Across the country in New Hampshire, Kayla Hogan, 27, was hearing the same. She worked for the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, onboarding clinics and hospitals into a data system that would help them administer free childhood vaccines. Now that project was in jeopardy, threatening the process of getting children vaccinated.
The cuts that ensnared Griffith, Hogan and many others whose work touches vaccines in dozens of states were part of $11.4 billion in funds that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Department of Health and Human Services pulled back from state and community health departments last week, included in the larger slashing of federal government under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. More than $2 billion was taken from “Immunization and Vaccines for Children” grants, which support the delivery of vaccines to children whose families may not be able to afford them,  according to a list HHS published.
Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist with a well-documented history of promoting misinformation, promised ahead of his confirmation as HHS secretary that he would not take away vaccines. Since taking office, however, he has repeatedly downplayed the severity of measles currently sweeping the country — outbreaks that have hospitalized scores of children and left at least two dead. He has publicly pushed unproven treatments, including vitamin A regimens that have reportedly sickened children, and offered limp public support for vaccines themselves — despite vaccines offering the safest, most effective way to prevent many infectious diseases. Under his leadership, HHS has overseen mass firings across federal health agencies, including staff responsible for outbreak response and vaccine access; canceled or postponed meetings of independent vaccine advisory committees; and ended vaccine education campaigns.
The funding cuts under his watch go further, turning his rhetoric into reality and weakening the systems that deliver lifesaving preventative care. Through sweeping reductions to state and local health agencies, the new administration is quietly dismantling the fragile, interconnected infrastructure that moves childhood vaccines from the federal government to providers and, ultimately, to children.
The cuts have hit health departments and medical providers, the data systems that track immunizations and the nonprofit coalitions that make the whole system run. They come at a moment when public health officials and advocates say that despite federal assurances, childhood vaccines are under attack.
“It will impact every aspect of immunization: community outreach, education, health fairs, mobile clinics and public health nurses,” said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. “It’s catastrophic.”
Twenty-three states and Washington, D.C., sued HHS and Kennedy this week over the funding takebacks. A federal judge blocked the cuts on Thursday, citing “voluminous” harms to the health departments. A hearing is scheduled for April 16.
HHS did not respond to a request for comment.
Ostensibly, the federal cuts were aimed at Covid-era projects that were no longer necessary.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” the department’s director of communications, Andrew Nixon, said last week.
While an early wave of Covid funding focused on testing, vaccines and addressing health disparities, as the pandemic waned, state health departments were allowed to shift that money to other underfunded programs — including grants that support childhood vaccinations.
Those grants supplement Vaccines for Children, a federal entitlement program established by Congress in 1994 in response to a deadly measles epidemic, which remains intact. But its successful operation relies on the “Immunization and Vaccines for Children” funding, which received a temporary boost from reallocated Covid dollars — until that money was pulled back last week.
Now, the cuts have forced public health departments across the country to lay off staff, cancel vaccine clinics, shut down education and outreach programs, and halt critical physical and virtual infrastructure upgrades, according to news reports, declarations filed in the federal lawsuit against HHS and results from a survey conducted by the National Association of County and City Health Officials and shared with NBC News.
In Dallas County, Texas, the health director said the cuts compelled the cancellation of 50 community vaccination events — including many in schools with low measles vaccination rates amid a rising outbreak.
In Minnesota, the Health Department announced it would lay off 170 employees after losing more than $220 million in federal funds. Among the casualties is the state’s immunization registry, which will no longer be upgraded — leaving Minnesota with one of the most outdated tracking systems in the country.
In California, the Health Department said in a federal filing that it would be unable to provide childhood vaccines, including for measles, to millions of children, roughly half of the state’s youth.
And in Washington state, the Health Department announced that in response to $20 million in grant cuts targeting immunization programs, it would furlough or lay off 46 workers and suspend its mobile clinic operation, known as the Care-a-Van. The 104 canceled clinics were expected to administer 2,000 vaccines to vulnerable kids, including those in rural areas and homeless populations.
“We’re just going to have to think strategically about how we reach those really difficult-to-reach populations,” Lacy Fehrenbach, Washington’s chief of prevention, said at a media briefing.
The National Association of County and City Health Officials survey captured further impacts: A department in Ohio said it plans to halt training on vaccine hesitancy. One in Indiana will lose two nurses who travel to schools to vaccinate children, so parents don’t have to miss work. A Texas agency will not be able to replace old equipment as planned.
The cuts also threaten a less visible but critical part of the vaccine infrastructure: the data systems that public health departments use to record and share immunizations. Vaccines for Children relies on these systems to order doses, approve and track distribution, and monitor safety.
Health departments in Pennsylvania and elsewhere said in declarations filed in the federal case that the cuts would prevent them from operating or upgrading these systems, forcing states to rely on outdated, cumbersome platforms. Poor data systems can leave parents and providers without access to vaccination records and increase the risk of missed or duplicate doses.
Rebecca Coyle, executive director of the American Immunization Registry Association, noted that these systems were born out of a measles outbreak that claimed the lives of 89 children in the early 1990s, including an 11-year-old girl who died after being denied a vaccine — despite her father’s efforts to get her immunized — because the clinic couldn’t locate the right records.
While much attention is given to parents who hesitate or outright refuse to vaccinate, it is the children without access to vaccines who offer the clearest path to closing immunity gaps, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
“The way we get from 60% of our population vaccinated to over 95% is by focusing on people who, for a variety of reasons, have difficulty getting vaccinated,” he said. “That includes the homeless, low-income individuals, and people without a primary care provider.”
These funding cuts, Benjamin said, degraded the ability to reach those populations “literally overnight.”
Immunization coalitions — nonprofits that connect public health departments with communities to improve vaccination rates — play a key role, too. Now their work mostly supported by state and federal dollars is at risk.
The cuts caused “immense damage” to Indiana’s Immunization Coalition, according to its executive director, Lisa Robertson, who said in a statement that its budget — funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention via the state Health Department — was slashed entirely for this year and reduced by 75% for the next fiscal year.","Brandy Zadrozny, Brandy Zadrozny","April 4, 2025, 3:11 AM GMT+8 / Updated April 4, 2025, 8:04 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hhs-cut-quit-smoking-programs-tips-cdc-fda-rcna199251,HHS gutted programs to help people quit smoking. The impact could be deadly.,Health news,"Smoking rates in the United States are at historic lows and fewer people are dying from tobacco-related lung cancer — in part because the federal government has pumped millions of dollars into research and attention-grabbing anti-smoking campaigns, as well as resources to help smokers quit.
Public health experts were stunned this week when the Department of Health and Human Services dismantled several key groups that had been hugely successful in helping to curb smoking rates in the U.S. for decades. The groups also tracked youth smoking and vaping rates as well as the appeal of nicotine pouches for teens.
The Office on Smoking and Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which had been crucial in investigating a deadly wave of lung injuries linked to contaminated vaping devices in 2019 — was gutted.
Dozens of staffers at the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Tobacco Products — which oversees warning labels and restrictions on marketing — were placed on leave, including the center’s director, Brian King.
HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in an email that “important work will continue” related to tobacco research and cessation efforts despite cuts meant to “streamline operations, enhance responsiveness to the American people, and ultimately improve the nation’s health as part of the Make America Healthy Again initiative.”
Dr. Tom Frieden, who was CDC director under President Barack Obama, called the cuts a “gift to Big Tobacco.”
“The only winner here is the tobacco industry and cancer cells,” said Frieden, president and chief executive of Resolve to Save Lives, a global health initiative.
The FDA’s King had long pushed for e-cigarette makers to remove flavorings that appealed to children. In January, he proposed slashing nicotine in cigarettes to levels that would make them almost totally nonaddictive.
It’s too soon to know how the changes might affect smoking rates in America. Cigarette smoking remains the No. 1 cause of preventable death from multiple chronic diseases, such as heart disease and lung cancer. It kills more than 480,000 Americans each year, according to CDC data collected by the group that has now been axed.
Nonprofit anti-smoking groups like Truth Initiative and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Children are still assessing the damage.
At a minimum, the cuts will temporarily stop tobacco research. At worst, experts fear, smokers will no longer have access to resources to help them quit.
“If we take our foot off the gas, what do we think will happen?” said a CDC employee fired this week from the agency’s Office on Smoking and Health. “Tobacco use rates will increase among youth and fewer adults will quit. Because of that, people will die.” The employee asked not to be identified publicly for fear it could affect government severance packages.
At risk is one of the most successful public health campaigns in CDC history: Tips From Former Smokers. The ads, which began in 2012, feature graphic and often cringe-worthy stories of real people whose health suffered greatly because of cigarette smoking. They end with encouraging smokers to call 1-800-QUIT-NOW.
A study published in January found that every time the ads run on television, calls to quit lines spike. Researchers estimated the ads have generated more than 2 million additional calls to quit lines.
“With Tips not being on the air, fewer adults will quit,” the CDC employee said.
Callers to the national quit line are funneled to resources in their own state. The CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health provides millions of dollars to state health departments each year — more than $84 million last year alone — to staff their own quit lines and other tobacco control measures like medications to help smokers quit.
It’s unclear what will happen to that money. Thirteen states stand to lose at least 30% in funding, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
And 75% of the funding for quit lines in five states — Connecticut, New Jersey, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia — came from the CDC.
Kevin Caron, another ousted employee at the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health, said at least five major tobacco research projects will end “unless people just independently decide in their free time that they’re going to try to work on them.”
Caron, who’d worked with the CDC for more than a decade, was one of the researchers who discovered that it was vitamin E acetate in bootleg THC vape products that sickened thousands and killed 68 people in 2019.
It’s also unknown what will become of the National Youth Tobacco Survey, an annual snapshot of how many U.S. middle and high school students are using tobacco and what products are most appealing to them. The report comes from both CDC and FDA.
“It’s going to be harder for us to identify what the trends are that public health needs to focus on, like the products that are going to addict children to nicotine and turn them into a lifelong smoker” if that survey ends, said the CDC employee who wished to remain anonymous.
It was the youth survey, for example, that first signaled a growing youth vaping epidemic in 2018, and that kids were turning to Juul and other vaping products.
Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, didn’t provide specifics on funding or the future of the Tips campaign and related programs at CDC or FDA.","Erika Edwards, Erika Edwards","April 4, 2025, 4:19 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/doesnt-take-much-microplastics-leach-food-researchers-warn-rcna198975,"It doesn't take much for microplastics to leach into food, researchers warn",Health news,"Scientists are finding microplastics everywhere from brain tissue to arteries and warning of the health risks posed by their buildup inside our bodies. They’re also discovering just how easily the tiny particles get there.
Microplastics don’t just shed off of plastic items from overuse, like when a water bottle breaks down over weeks or months of being washed and refilled. They also leach into our food and drinks with even the brief use of a product with plastic components, alarming scientists.
“We’re talking about cardiovascular mortality,” said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of the Grossman Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards at New York University. “We’re also talking about hormone-sensitive cancers — breast, thyroid, ovarian, not to mention kidney cancer — that have been associated with these chemical exposures.”
Microplastics are tiny fragments of plastic less than 5 millimeters in diameter, some a fraction of the width of a strand of human hair. And nanoplastics, even tinier plastic particles measuring less than a millionth of a meter, are too small to see with standard light-based microscopes.
Scientists have found these particles across the globe, from Antarctic snow to coral reefs and throughout our bodies, including in babies. They’re raising concerns about how quickly microplastics can build up in humans and ecosystems. And while much remains unknown about their impacts, researchers increasingly fear these contaminants are fueling ecological and health crises.
Microplastics are constantly coming off of everyday items like containers and cups, including products we don’t always think of as plastic, according to Victoria Fulfer, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Rhode Island studying how microplastics get into water.
“We’re storing a lot of our food in plastic,” said Fulfer, who also works for the 5 Gyres Institute, a nonprofit group researching plastic pollution.
“Not only is it packaged in plastic when we buy it from the store, but then we cook it, and we often put it in plastic containers to store it in our fridge, because it’s easy and it’s cheap,” she said. “And that plastic is leaching into our food.”
Fulfer’s research has shown that even tiny plastic particles can amass in large volumes over relatively short periods, reflecting just how widely used plastic materials have become — and how easily they break down. A paper she published in 2023 found more than 1,000 tons of microplastics have built up on the floor of Rhode Island’s Narragansett Bay in just the last two decades.
Fulfer gave NBC News a demonstration of how easily microplastics can shed into food and drinks at her university laboratory. She chopped up just two slices of a white onion on a red plastic cutting board, rinsed the slices, filtered the rinsing water and put the filter under a microscope. The slide showed tiny red specks of plastic that had come off the cutting board and onto the onion.
When Fulfer put hot pasta in a black plastic takeout container and followed the same procedure, she again saw microplastics under the microscope. Even more came off the container and leached into the pasta when she microwaved it in the same vessel.
“Mostly, when a container says ‘microwave safe,’ it means it’s safe for the container to be in the microwave — it’s not going to melt,” said Fulfer. “But that doesn’t mean that it’s safe for you as a person, because microwaving plastic particularly changes the chemical bonds — they make them more weak. And that allows any chemicals that are in those plastics, and also nanoplastics, to leach from that container into the food that you’re heating up.”
A recent study at the University of Nebraska found heating a plastic container in the microwave caused more microplastics and nanoplastics to leach into food than refrigerating the container or keeping it at room temperature.
The problem isn’t just with single-use containers that are meant to be thrown out — already a major source of plastic pollution worldwide. Fulfer also found microplastics when she microwaved peas in a plastic container that was designed to be reusable.
Even products people might not think of as plastic can shed microplastics, Fulfer has found. When she microwaved hot water in a paper cup with a laminated interior, stirred it briefly, filtered it and ran an analysis using lasers, she found polyethylene fragments, a type of microplastic.
Other researchers have even flagged chewing gum as a potential culprit, with one very small study finding a single piece could release hundreds to thousands of microplastics into saliva.
Researchers say the plastic in our food and drinks is likely to be building up in our bodies.
In a study published this year, researchers with University of New Mexico Health Sciences found “alarmingly high” levels of microplastics in human brains. There appeared to be more in people with dementia, though scientists don’t know whether more plastic actually caused those symptoms. A separate study published last year by a group of Italian researchers found people with microplastics in the plaque in their arteries had a higher risk of heart attack, stroke or death — though that finding also doesn’t prove a direct cause.
Plastic producers insist their products are safe and say there are few materials that can rival plastics for versatility, cost and convenience.
“There is nothing more important to our industry than safe products and materials,” said Plastics Industry Association President and CEO Matt Seaholm. “These materials are not only safe but also essential to our daily lives — keeping food fresh, ensuring medical supplies remain sterile, and enhancing overall quality of life.”
Trasande said consumers don’t need to cut out all plastics but recommended using them less. “We need to take the safe and simple steps now to reduce our plastic footprint,” he said.
That could involve switching to more glass or stainless steel containers, or swapping out plastic cutting boards with wooden ones. For heating food and drinks up in the microwave, glass or ceramic might be a better option.","Kayla Steinberg, Vicky Nguyen, Kayla Steinberg, Vicky Nguyen","April 4, 2025, 1:03 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-immigration-crackdowns-threaten-health-caregiving-us-families-rcna199383,Trump immigration crackdowns threaten health caregiving. U.S. families are paying the price.,Health news,"Alanys Ortiz reads Josephine Senek’s cues before she speaks. Josephine, who lives with a rare and debilitating genetic condition, fidgets her fingers when she’s tired and bites the air when something hurts.
Josephine, 16, has been diagnosed with tetrasomy 8p mosaicism, severe autism, severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, among other conditions, which will require constant assistance and supervision for the rest of her life.
Ortiz, 25, is Josephine’s caregiver. A Venezuelan immigrant, Ortiz helps Josephine eat, bathe, and perform other daily tasks that the teen cannot do alone at her home in West Orange, New Jersey. Over the past 2½ years, Ortiz said, she has developed an instinct for spotting potential triggers before they escalate. She closes doors and peels barcode stickers off apples to ease Josephine’s anxiety.
But Ortiz’s ability to work in the U.S. has been thrown into doubt by the Trump administration, which ordered an end to the temporary protected status program for some Venezuelans on April 7. The order is tied up in the courts. If the termination goes through, Ortiz would have to leave the country or risk detention and deportation.
“Our family would be gutted beyond belief,” said Krysta Senek, Josephine’s mother, who has been trying to win a reprieve for Ortiz.Americans depend on many such foreign-born workers to help care for family members who are older, injured, or disabled and cannot care for themselves. Nearly 6 million people receive personal care in a private home or a group home, and about 2 million people use these services in a nursing home or other long-term care institution, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis.
Increasingly, the workers who provide that care are immigrants such as Ortiz. The foreign-born share of nursing home workers rose three percentage points from 2007 to 2021, to about 18%, according to an analysis of census data by the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston.
And foreign-born workers make up a high share of other direct care providers. More than 40% of home health aides, 28% of personal care workers, and 21% of nursing assistants were foreign-born in 2022, compared with 18% of workers overall that year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
That workforce is in jeopardy amid an immigration crackdown President Donald Trump launched on his first day back in office. He signed executive orders that expanded the use of deportations without a court hearing, suspended refugee resettlements, and more recently ended humanitarian parole programs for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.
In invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans and attempting to revoke legal permanent residency for others, the Trump administration has sparked fear that even those who have followed the nation’s immigration rules could be targeted.
“There’s just a general anxiety about what this could all mean, even if somebody is here legally,” said Katie Smith Sloan, president of LeadingAge, a nonprofit representing more than 5,000 nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other services for aging patients. “There’s concern about unfair targeting, unfair activity that could just create trauma, even if they don’t ultimately end up being deported, and that’s disruptive to a health care environment.”
Shutting down pathways for immigrants to work in the United States, Smith Sloan said, also means many other foreign workers may go instead to countries where they are welcomed and needed.
“We are in competition for the same pool of workers,” she said.
Demand for caregivers is predicted to surge in the U.S. as the youngest baby boomers reach retirement age, with the need for home health and personal care aides projected to grow about 21% over a decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those 820,000 additional positions represent the most of any occupation. The need for nursing assistants and orderlies also is projected to grow, by about 65,000 positions.
Caregiving is often low-paying and physically demanding work that doesn’t attract enough native-born Americans. The median pay ranges from about $34,000 to $38,000 a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and home health agencies have long struggled with high turnover rates and staffing shortages, Smith Sloan said, and they now fear that Trump’s immigration policies will choke off a key source of workers, leaving many older and disabled Americans without someone to help them eat, dress, and perform daily activities.
With the Trump administration reorganizing the Administration for Community Living, which runs programs supporting older adults and people with disabilities, and Congress considering deep cuts to Medicaid, the largest payer for long-term care in the nation, the president’s anti-immigration policies are creating “a perfect storm” for a sector that has not recovered from the covid-19 pandemic, said Leslie Frane, an executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, which represents nursing facility workers and home health aides.
The relationships caregivers build with their clients can take years to develop, Frane said, and replacements are already hard to find.
In September, LeadingAge called for the federal government to help the industry meet staffing needs by raising caps on work-related immigration visas, expanding refugee status to more people, and allowing immigrants to test for professional licenses in their native language, among other recommendations.But, Smith Sloan said, “There’s not a lot of appetite for our message right now.”
The White House did not respond to questions about how the administration would address the need for workers in long-term care. Spokesperson Kush Desai said the president was given “a resounding mandate from the American people to enforce our immigration laws and put Americans first” while building on the “progress made during the first Trump presidency to bolster our healthcare workforce and increase healthcare affordability.”
Until Trump suspended the refugee resettlement program, some nursing homes in Wisconsin had partnered with local churches and job placement programs to hire foreign-born workers, said Robin Wolzenburg, a senior vice president for LeadingAge Wisconsin.
Many work in food service and housekeeping, roles that free up nurses and nursing assistants to work directly with patients. Wolzenburg said many immigrants are interested in direct care roles but take on ancillary roles because they cannot speak English fluently or lack U.S. certification.
Through a partnership with the Wisconsin health department and local schools, Wolzenburg said, nursing homes have begun to offer training in English, Spanish, and Hmong for immigrant workers to become direct care professionals. Wolzenburg said the group planned to roll out training in Swahili soon for Congolese women in the state.
Over the past 2½ years, she said, the partnership helped Wisconsin nursing homes fill more than two dozen jobs. Because refugee admissions are suspended, Wolzenburg said, resettlement agencies aren’t taking on new candidates and have paused job placements to nursing homes.
Many older and disabled immigrants who are permanent residents rely on foreign-born caregivers who speak their native language and know their customs. Frane with the SEIU noted that many members of San Francisco’s large Chinese American community want their aging parents to be cared for at home, preferably by someone who can speak the language.
“In California alone, we have members who speak 12 different languages,” Frane said. “That skill translates into a kind of care and connection with consumers that will be very difficult to replicate if the supply of immigrant caregivers is diminished.”
Caregiving is the kind of work that makes other work possible, Frane said. Without outside caregivers, the lives of the patient and their loved ones become more difficult logistically and economically.
“Think of it like pulling out a Jenga stick from a Jenga pile, and the thing starts to topple,” she said.
Thanks to the one-on-one care from Ortiz, Josephine has learned to communicate when she’s hungry or needs help. She now picks up her clothes and is learning to do her own hair. With her anxiety more under control, the violent meltdowns that once marked her weeks have become far less frequent, Ortiz said.
“We live in Josephine’s world,” Ortiz said in Spanish. “I try to help her find her voice and communicate her feelings.”
Ortiz moved to New Jersey from Venezuela in 2022 as part of an au pair program that connects foreign-born workers with people who are older or children with disabilities who need a caregiver at home. Fearing political unrest and crime in her home country, she got temporary protected status when her visa expired last year to keep her authorization to work in the United States and stay with Josephine.
Losing Ortiz would upend Josephine’s progress, Senek said. The teen would lose not only a caregiver, but also a sister and her best friend. The emotional impact would be devastating.“You have no way to explain to her, ‘Oh, Alanys is being kicked out of the country, and she can’t come back,’” she said.
It’s not just Josephine: Senek and her husband depend on Ortiz so they can work full-time jobs and take care of themselves and their marriage. “She’s not just an au pair,” Senek said.
The family has called its congressional representatives for help. Even a relative who voted for Trump sent a letter to the president asking him to reconsider his decision.
In a March 31 court order, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen wrote that canceling the protection could “inflict irreparable harm on hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives, families, and livelihoods will be severely disrupted.”
News of immigration dragnets that sweep up lawfully present immigrants and mass deportations are causing a lot of stress, even for those who have followed the rules, said Nelly Prieto, 62, who cares for an 88-year-old man with Alzheimer’s disease and a man in his 30s with Down syndrome in Yakima County, Washington.
Born in Mexico, she immigrated to the United States at age 12 and became a U.S. citizen under a law authorized by President Ronald Reagan that made any immigrant who entered the country before 1982 eligible for amnesty. So, she’s not worried for herself. But, she said, some of her co-workers working under H-2B visas are very afraid.
“It kills me to see them when they talk to me about things like that, the fear in their faces,” she said. “They even have letters, notarized letters, ready in case something like that happens, saying where their kids can go.”Foreign-born home health workers feel they are contributing a valuable service to American society by caring for its most vulnerable, Prieto said. But their efforts are overshadowed by rhetoric and policies that make immigrants feel as if they don’t belong.
“If they cannot appreciate our work, if they cannot appreciate us taking care of their own parents, their own grandparents, their own children, then what else do they want?” she said. “We’re only doing the work that their own people don’t want to do.”
In New Jersey, Ortiz said life has not been the same since she received the news that her TPS authorization was slated to end soon. When she walks outside, she fears that immigration agents will detain her just because she’s from Venezuela.She’s become extra cautious, always carrying proof that she’s authorized to work and live in the U.S.
Ortiz worries that she’ll end up in a detention center. But even if the U.S. now feels less welcoming, she said, going back to Venezuela is not a safe option.",Unknown,"April 3, 2025, 9:57 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdcs-ivf-team-gutted-even-trump-calls-fertilization-president-rcna199261,CDC's IVF team gutted even as Trump calls himself the 'fertilization president',Health news,"A team that tracked how well in vitro fertilization worked across the U.S. was abruptly cut Tuesday as part of the sweeping layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services.
The elimination of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance team — a group of six epidemiologists, data analysts and researchers — shocked public health experts and IVF advocates who said they had felt encouraged by President Donald Trump’s comments supporting access to the infertility treatment.
Just last week, Trump declared himself “the fertilization president” while touting efforts to expand IVF.
“Fertilization,” Trump said at a White House event on March 26 to commemorate Women’s History Month. “I’m still very proud of it, I don’t care. I’ll be known as the fertilization president and that’s OK.”
But Barbara Collura, the president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, a nonprofit group for reproductive health, said one of Trump’s best assets to address IVF was now gone.
“This is a big handicap for the administration as they embrace IVF and want to expand coverage,” Collura said. “These are the right people to have at your side.”
Aaron Levine, a professor of public policy at Georgia Tech who has worked with the CDC team over the last decade, called it an “immediate loss” for patients who want to make a well-informed decision.
“The data was produced at the clinic level every year, so you could say, ‘Is this clinic successful 15% of the time, 20% of the time, 25% of the time,’” he said. “And you can imagine that is super valuable information for patients considering IVF, or maybe considering IVF at multiple clinics, and trying to make their choices.”
Dr. Brian Levine, founding partner and practice director of CCRM Fertility of New York, said about 1 in 6 people experience infertility both globally and in the U.S.
IVF was first used in the 1970s. It involves combining eggs and sperm in the lab to create embryos. Those embryos are then implanted in a woman’s uterus.
IVF is the most common type of infertility treatment in the U.S., according to the CDC. More than 8 million babies have been born via IVF since 1978, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
The success rate varies, with age being the strongest factor. Women younger than 35 have a success rate of around 46%, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That drops to 22% for women at age 38.
Patients deserve to know the success rates of each clinic, and the elimination of the CDC group gives them one less resource, Brian Levine said.
“Patients are highly motivated for treatments because they want a family, but they’re also walking in a state of sometimes despair,” he said.
Knowing the success rates also helps keep clinics accountable, forcing them to make changes that could help improve the quality of care.
“When you have a pervasive disease like this, it gives a lot of women angst,” Brian Levine said, referring to infertility. “We typically report to the CDC, so I know that my colleagues across the country are practicing to the same standards.”
The Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance team was mandated by Congress in 1992. It worked under the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health, which was also gutted Tuesday.
The team was responsible for monitoring and tracking outcomes related to IVF, including whether women gave birth to multiples or delivered prematurely, to ensure both the safety and success of the procedure.
It also provided tools to the public, including an “IVF success estimator” that allowed people to plug in information about themselves and get an estimate of how well IVF would work. People could also look up each individual clinic’s success rates across the U.S.
It also did research on different IVF topics, including how to make it more efficient with fewer side effects, and how to make the extremely expensive procedure more accessible.
“They’re a tremendous resource within the government,” Collura said. “They’re also public-facing. All the content is on the CDC website; they’re putting out all the information for patients.”
“I rely on their information and their data to do my work,” she added. “I’m not sure what that’s going to look like now going forward.”
One CDC worker on the team who was terminated Tuesday tried to reconcile Trump’s comments on IVF and the mass layoffs.
The worker, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak with the media, said the group was preparing to publish new data on the success rates of IVF across states, but now that work has stopped indefinitely.
“It’s surprising to me,” the worker said. “President Trump said he was the fertility president. How does cutting this program support that?”
An official at the Department of Health and Human Services said that “the work will continue” — although they didn’t provide details on how or when the administration would continue to track and collect data on IVF.
“We are focused on implementing and bringing Secretary Kennedy’s high-level vision of HHS’ transformation to life,” the official said in. an emailed statement. “The Department is mapping out what each of the 15 redefined divisions will look like at a detailed level and will share more information soon.”
Aaron Levine, of Georgia Tech, noted that there are other groups that track IVF outcomes, such as the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, a professional group, although the data appears to be more limited.
In a statement, Micah Hill, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, called the cuts to the IVF group  “dangerous and devastating.”","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Abigail Brooks, Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Abigail Brooks","April 3, 2025, 6:05 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/not-even-wealth-saving-americans-dying-rates-seen-poorest-europeans-rcna198929,Not even wealth is saving Americans from dying at rates seen among some of the poorest Europeans,Health news,"Fifty years ago, life expectancy in the U.S. and wealthy European countries was relatively similar.
That began to change around 1980. As European life expectancy steadily increased, the U.S. struggled to keep pace — and its life expectancy even began declining in 2014.
Today, the wealthiest middle-aged and older adults in the U.S. have roughly the same likelihood of dying over a 12-year period as the poorest adults in northern and western Europe, according to a study published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Some medical and health policy experts say the trend is a sign of deep-seated issues not just within the U.S. health care system, but with the typical American lifestyle of overconsuming junk food, not getting enough exercise and facing loneliness or financial stress.
“It’s really concerning because, to me, what it’s saying is that the set of stressors that are harming the health of Americans is very widespread, to the point where even being wealthy or rich, you’re not going to be able to escape them,” said Dr. Atheendar Venkataramani, an associate professor of health policy at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, who reviewed the study but wasn’t involved in it.
The study looked at the relationship between wealth and mortality among nearly 74,000 adults from 2010 to 2022. More than 19,000 of the adults were in the U.S., and roughly 54,000 were spread across 16 countries in Europe. All were ages 50 to 85.
The researchers divided the participants into four groups based on their overall assets (not including their homes). In both Europe and the U.S., the group with the most assets — the wealthiest — had a 40% lower mortality rate than the poorest group.
The poorest people in the U.S. had the highest mortality rate of any group, which is consistent with previous research showing that health outcomes are worse in America.
“We were expecting to find greater inequity in the U.S. But what was surprising was how the richest in the U.S. compared to the richest in Europe,” said Irene Papanicolas, the study’s lead author, who directs the Center for Health System Sustainability at Brown University’s School of Public Health.
The wealthiest group in northern and western Europe had mortality rates about 35% lower than the wealthiest group in the U.S., she said.
Venkataramani said the findings can’t be generalized to the entire U.S. population, but he added that he “would not be surprised if these patterns held up in other age groups.”
Poor health outcomes in the U.S. are often attributed, in part, to a lack of access to affordable health care, which can result in high out-of-pocket costs for medication or procedures — or in some cases, not seeing a doctor at all.
However, several experts said social and economic factors — such as loneliness or stress — are more likely to affect mortality rates in wealthier adults.
“It’s hard to pin what’s happening on health care access,” Venkataramani said. “Certainly health care must have something to do with it, but it cannot be even a dominant part of the story if we’re seeing wealthier Americans having similar or worse outcomes than poor individuals in other wealthy countries.”
In addition to universal health care, many European countries offer free or heavily subsidized higher education and more comprehensive unemployment benefits compared with the U.S.
“A lot of these countries have social welfare programs that don’t prevent people from losing their jobs or experiencing poverty, but when they go through those tough times, it doesn’t threaten their health,” said Dr. Steven Woolf, a professor of family medicine and population health at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine.
People in the U.S. also consume more ultra-processed foods and have higher rates of obesity compared with Europeans, which can increase their risk of diabetes or heart disease — an issue Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to address in office.
Kennedy has frequently pointed to the fact that Americans have worse health outcomes compared with peer countries.
“Our lifespan has dropped. So Americans now live six years shorter than Europeans. We are the sickest nation in the world and we have the highest rate of chronic disease,” he said last week in a video post on X announcing layoffs of around 20,000 HHS employees.
But Woolf said the Trump administration’s recent gutting of federal health agencies and termination of research grants puts the U.S. on the wrong trajectory when it comes to lowering risk factors for mortality.
“The thing that’s alarming us so much in the health and medicine world is that the policies that are now being pursued in a pretty muscular way are the opposite of what you would want to do to make America healthy again,” he said, referring to Kennedy’s agenda.
“In all likelihood, my prediction will be that the gap in health between Americans and people in other countries is now going to widen even more dramatically,” Woolf said.
According to HHS, the consolidation and cuts are meant to make the branch more efficient and work toward ending chronic disease. White House spokesman Kush Desai added that “the United States is by far the largest funder of scientific research and is home to the world’s largest ecosystem for innovation and research.”","Aria Bendix, Aria Bendix","April 3, 2025, 5:00 AM GMT+8"

The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts district court on behalf of four researchers and three unions with members who rely on NIH funding, says that the federal science agency “abruptly cancelled” hundreds of research projects “without scientifically-valid explanation or cause.”
The lawsuit says NIH has justified its cancellations with “ideological purity directives” about research related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), vaccine hesitancy and gender identity, among other topics.
“The new arbitrary regime is not codified in any law or policy,” the lawsuit says, adding that NIH has “failed to develop any guidelines, definitions or explanations” that explain “the parameters of the agency’s prohibitions against research with some connection to DEI, gender, and other topics that fail Defendants’ ideological conformity screen.”
The new lawsuit lists the NIH; its director, Jay Bhattacharya; the U.S. Department of Human and Health Services; and its director, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as defendants. Both federal agencies said they would not comment on pending litigation.
The Center for Science in the Public Interest and Protect Democracy Project are working with the ACLU on the lawsuit.
It is one of several legal challenges the Trump administration now faces as it attempts to cut research funding, change how it is allocated or reduce academic emphasis on diversity, among other issues.
After several legal complaints, a Massachusetts judge in February halted an NIH effort to limit its funding for indirect costs, which would have dramatically slashed how much funding the federal government provides to research agencies for things like equipment, maintenance, utilities and support staff. Other lawsuits have challenged funding freezes across the federal government and the administration’s ban on DEI programs.
“Our case is specifically addressing NIH’s lawless grant terminations and their upending of the grant review process for applicants,” Olga Akselrod, senior counsel at the ACLU Racial Justice Program, said in a phone interview. “These sweeping actions have disrupted hundreds of research grants, derailed really crucial research and are upending the careers of the most promising scientists in the United States with really no clear rationale.”
The lawsuit says at least 678 research projects have been terminated by NIH, including work on breast cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and HIV prevention, among other topics.
The lawsuit says the canceled grants amounted to more than $2.4 billion. Of that total, about $1.3 billion had already been spent. Another $1.1 billion was expected to be distributed to grantees by NIH before it was revoked.
“NIH’s cancelling of research midstream effectively discards an enormous amount of money in investments and years of work dedicated to answering some of the most pressing biomedical questions of our time,” Akselrod said. “You can’t just turn research on and off like a faucet.”
The plaintiff researchers include Brittany Charlton, a professor at Harvard Medical School, who founded the LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Charlton, whose research focuses on LGBTQ health inequities in cancer and reproductive health, among other topics, has had five grants terminated by NIH since February, according to the lawsuit.","Evan Bush, Evan Bush","April 3, 2025, 4:20 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/shingles-vaccine-dementia-risk-older-adults-rcna198952,"This vaccine may protect against dementia, as well as a painful herpes zoster flare-up",Aging,"Getting vaccinated against shingles — a painful and debilitating condition that can flare up years after infection from varicella zoster — not only lowers the risk of developing the rash, but may also offer some protection against dementia, a provocative new study suggests.
The new research, published Wednesday in Nature, analyzed data from more than 280,000 older adults in Wales and found that people who received the original shingles live virus vaccine were 20% less likely to develop dementia of any type than those who were not vaccinated.
Previous research has found an association between the Shingrix shingles vaccine, which replaced the live virus version in 2020, and a lower risk of dementia, especially in women. But that link wasn't considered as strong because that study design couldn’t account for potential differences between those who were vaccinated and those who were not, such as the possibility that the vaccinated people might have been healthier overall. Shingrex, which targets a tiny bit of viral DNA, turned out to have a longer lasting effect than the original vaccine.
The new study was possible because of an unusual public health policy in Wales that provided a “natural experiment” to explore the potential impact of the vaccine on dementia risk. With the rollout of the vaccine on Sept. 1, 2013, in Wales, shots were offered to people who were 79 on that date but not given to people who had turned 80.
That allowed the German and Stanford University researchers to compare two groups of people with similar health characteristics who differed only by one week in age, making them essentially the same except that the vaccine was available to the younger population but not the older, said Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University and senior author of the study.
What’s exciting about the study is that it’s essentially like a randomized controlled trial, considered the gold standard in research, he said.
The way the original vaccine was rolled out in Wales provided a unique opportunity, said Allison Aiello, a professor of epidemiology at the Columbia University Aging Center in New York City.
“It’s like having a control group compared to a treated group,” said Aiello, who was not associated with the new research. “What’s interesting is the finding of 20% protection. That is a pretty strong effect, which does fit with other research suggesting that herpes viruses might have an influence on dementia.”
Scientists don’t know exactly how the chickenpox virus raises the risk of dementia. It’s been shown that reactivation of the virus can lead to the accumulation of aberrant proteins associated with Alzheimer’s, for example, Geldsetzer said. It’s also possible that the virus might spark a reactivation of herpes simplex, which earlier research has linked to dementia.
Herpes viruses never completely go away, but instead lurk in the body until the immune system weakens. Aging leads to a natural weakening of the immune system that can allow the virus to resurface as shingles, a nasty side effect of chickenpox.
The age effect is why the shingles vaccine has been offered only to people ages 50 and older in the U.S. It's given as two doses, two to six months apart.
Herpes viruses, including oral and genital herpes simplex, appear to have the ability to get into the central nervous system, experts said.
In fact, a 2024 study found that among 70-year-olds without dementia at the outset, older adults with a herpes simplex diagnosis were more than twice as likely as uninfected people to develop dementia over a 15-year follow-up.
Herpes simplex can wreak havoc if it passes through the blood-brain barrier. It can cause inflammation of both the meninges (meningitis) and the brain (encephalitis). Both can be fatal.
Bolstering the case for the shingles vaccine protecting against dementia were the findings from a study published in Nature Medicine in 2024 that analyzed medical records from more than 100,000 patients. That analysis suggested the newer shingles vaccine was associated with even better protection against dementia.
In that study, researchers also investigated whether two other vaccines — for influenza and tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis — had any impact on the risk for dementia. They did not.
The most important take-home message from the Stanford study is that getting vaccinated might lower the risk for dementia, said Dr. Aarati Didwania, a professor of medicine and medical education at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.
Exactly how the vaccines might protect against dementia isn’t clear, Didwania said. “But it’s an intriguing question,” she added. “Is it by decreasing inflammation or preventing the virus from reactivating?”
There’s certainly a good reason for getting vaccinated, Didwania said.
“Shingles is a terrible, painful and debilitating condition that can lead to horrendous long-term pain,” she said.
There are limitations to the new study. While it indicates the benefit of the vaccine in a real-world setting, it's not the same as a randomized controlled trial, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. But it wouldn't be ethical to randomly assign people to get the vaccine or not, he said.
“It’s provocative, interesting and exciting,” he said of the research.
It’s possible that the Food and Drug Administration could review research linking shingles vaccines to a lower risk of dementia and allow the drug company to add that indication to the label, Schaffner said.
Even if that doesn’t happen, doctors can use the study findings to convince patients to choose to be vaccinated.",Unknown,"April 3, 2025, 2:24 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-outbreak-dallas-vaccines-hhs-funding-cuts-rcna199144,Dozens of free measles vaccine clinics close in Texas as federal funding is cut,Measles Outbreak,"Steep federal funding cuts have forced public health officials in one of Texas’ most populous counties — Dallas — to cancel dozens of vaccination clinics and lay off 21 workers on the front lines of combatting the state’s growing measles outbreak.
“I just had to tell our commissioners this morning that we’ve had to cancel over 50 different clinics in our community,” said Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. Many of the clinics had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates, he said.
The vaccines, which included measles, mumps and rubella shots, were meant to be given free to families.
The money being cut — $11.4 billion nationwide — was originally allocated to aid community health departments during the pandemic. Local public health officials have more recently been using the Covid funds for other public health initiatives, such as measles prevention, surveillance and testing.
Last week however, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would “no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”
“That’s very short-sighted and not understanding of the way public health works,” Huang said. “Being prepared for Covid helps build our capacity to be able to respond to other issues.”
Huang said his team was still assessing the exact amount of money slashed in his budget, but estimated it to be in the millions.
As of Tuesday, 422 measles had been reported by the Texas Department of State Health Services. None are in Dallas County, but Huang said the cuts would leave his community vulnerable to cases.
Eleven full-time and 10 part-time staffers were let go, he said. The majority were health care providers giving vaccines, epidemiologists and lab staff involved with measles surveillance and prevention.
Staff operating vaccine clinics in West Texas, which remains the epicenter of the measles outbreak, said those clinics are continuing as planned for now.","Erika Edwards, Erika Edwards","April 2, 2025, 5:33 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/widespread-job-cuts-begin-health-agencies-rcna198859,Widespread job cuts begin at health agencies,Health news,"The Trump administration carried out mass layoffs across the Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday, aiming to slash around 10,000 full-time jobs from the federal agencies long tasked with regulating food and drugs and overseeing the nation’s public health policies.
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is trying to reduce HHS’ workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 across several agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health.
The drastic job eliminations are part of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s wider plan to reshape the federal public health infrastructure and dismantle traditional institutions. Kennedy repeatedly promised to hollow out the CDC and the NIH during his failed presidential bid last year.
The administration made deep and wide-ranging cuts to divisions responsible for tackling HIV, improving minority health and preventing injury, such as gun violence. Jobs were eliminated at offices overseeing the approval of new drugs, providing health insurance and responding to infectious disease outbreaks.
A number of lesser-known divisions — including several focused on the safety of mining workers — were cut entirely.
Many current and former staffers spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.
“It’s a terrible dark day,” a CDC staffer said.
On Tuesday afternoon, as the scale of the cuts became clear, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., the chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the ranking member, called Kennedy to testify before the committee to discuss his “proposed reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services.”
Cassidy and Sanders' letter notes that Kennedy made a commitment during his confirmation process that he would testify before the HELP committee each quarter.
The CDC’s Freedom of Information Act Office, which allows the public to request access to information, has also been eliminated, according to two CDC officials. As of Tuesday afternoon, its FOIA webpage displayed an error message stating, “This page isn’t working right now.”
In a statement, a spokesperson said HHS is investigating the website outage.
Eliminating the office doesn't mean the agency can ignore FOIA requests.
“They need someone to handle FOIA requests; they can’t stop answering FOIA requests,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Law San Francisco. But, she added, FOIA “doesn’t have to have its own office.”
In a speech in February introducing himself to HHS staff members, Kennedy invoked FOIA as he underscored his commitment to what he called “radical transparency.”
“We will make our data and our policy process so transparent that people won’t even have to file a FOIA request,” Kennedy said.
Communications offices were gutted, too: The entire team at the FDA’s office of media affairs was axed, according to sources familiar with the matter. Most of the communications team of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research — about 50 people — was also cut, a senior staffer said.
That office’s work included managing public databases on drug approvals, such as information about potential risks of FDA-approved drugs and labeling, which are required by law to be published. The office was also responsible for managing the drug shortages database.
“These cuts to agency experts and programs leave our country less safe, less prepared and without the necessary talent and resources to respond to health threats,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, who was CDC director in the Biden administration.
The layoff notices, which started going out late Monday and continued into Tuesday morning, ended days of anxiety for many employees, some of whom said they spent the weekend wracked with worry about whether they still had jobs. (The notices didn’t go out Friday as originally planned so “all the data could be triple-checked over the weekend,” a source familiar with the matter said.)
On Monday, employees had been encouraged to take their laptops home each evening, according to a memo obtained by NBC News, in case they were terminated overnight and lost access to the campus facilities. (They would still be expected to work remotely, the memo added.)
At the FDA, some employees who hadn’t realized they’d been let go were refused entry onto campus by security Tuesday morning, a source said. Outside the HHS building in Rockville, Maryland, employees were being turned away and could be seen crying in the street, according to an employee at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.
One employee said the performance scores — given annually by supervisors to rate employees overall performance — cited in their termination notices were incorrect or inaccurate.
A senior CDC official said certain directors were offered transfers to the Indian Health Service and possibly remote work locations as a way to force them to leave — potentially because those postings would require them to uproot their lives and move far away.
“I don’t think the intent is benevolent,” said the official, who had direct knowledge of the reassignments.
The list of center directors reassigned to the Indian Health Service, which provides medical care for American Indians and Alaska Natives, included the heads of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention; and the Global Health Center, according to CDC officials.
In total, HHS said it’s seeking to eliminate about 2,400 full-time jobs at the CDC, 3,500 jobs at the FDA, 1,200 at the NIH and 300 at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Around 80 people from the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response were cut — including people at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the Strategic National Stockpile. The strategic preparedness agency will be folded into the CDC.
Federal health officials have said the responsibilities of some departments that are eliminated or downsized may be shifted over to a new entity, the Administration for Healthy America.
Among the agencies set to be folded into the Administration for Healthy America include the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration, which includes a program focused on HIV treatment.
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson at HHS, has said the cuts will affect neither Medicare or Medicaid services nor the FDA’s review of drugs, medical devices and foods.
Nixon said last week that the agency planned no additional job cuts.
Public health advocates and some Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticized the sweeping cuts, saying they could jeopardize public health efforts.
On Monday, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., former chair of a Senate health committee that oversees the agency, along with Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., sent a letter to Kennedy demanding answers about his plans to “gut” staff and reorganize HHS.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Daniel Arkin, Brandy Zadrozny, Erika Edwards, Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Daniel Arkin, Brandy Zadrozny, Erika Edwards","April 1, 2025, 7:59 PM GMT+8 / Updated April 2, 2025, 3:44 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/one-dose-experimental-drug-nearly-wipes-stealthy-cholesterol-remarkabl-rcna198014,One dose of experimental drug nearly wipes out stealthy cholesterol in 'remarkable' trial,Health news,"A single dose of an experimental drug dramatically reduced levels of a deadly form of cholesterol, often thought to be untreatable, for up to one year.
Lipoprotein(a) is a type of cholesterol that lurks in the body, undetected by routine tests and undeterred by existing drugs, diet or exercise.
The findings, cardiologists say, are a critical step toward treating the millions of Americans genetically predisposed to abnormally high levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a).
“It’s remarkable,” said Dr. Eric Brandt, director of preventive cardiology at the University of Michigan Health Frankel Cardiovascular Center in Ann Arbor, who wasn’t involved with the new research. “These drugs have the potential to nearly eliminate that lipoprotein.”
People with high levels of Lp(a) — some 64 million adults in the U.S. — are at extremely high risk of cholesterol buildup in their arteries. That buildup raises their odds of heart attack, stroke and early death from cardiovascular problems.
Findings from an earlier trial of the Eli Lilly drug, called lepodisiran, showed the drug was safe.
The latest study, a Phase 2 clinical trial funded by Lilly, included 320 people. One injection, researchers found, cut Lp(a) levels by 93.9% after six months. After a year, the effects waned, but only slightly, with levels measured at 88.5% lower than the baseline. People in the trial who got a second dose at six months had a 94.8% reduction at the one-year mark.
“This is a major source of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, chief academic officer of the Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute at the Cleveland Clinic and lead researcher of the lepodisiran trial. “We have never been able to treat lipoprotein(a) until now,” he said.
Lepodisiran works by targeting the mRNA, or messenger RNA, that tells the body to make Lp(a). Messenger RNA carries instructions to proteins in the body to produce certain substances, in this case, Lp(a). The drug works by essentially shooting the messenger.
Nissen’s findings were presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Lipoprotein(a) is dangerous in three ways: It sticks to LDL (the “bad” cholesterol), making it more likely to clog arteries; it’s particularly good at causing inflammation; and it tends to lead to blood clots.
Routine blood cholesterol tests could look for Lp(a) but do not — largely because there’s never been an effective treatment for it.
A diagnosis of high Lp(a) was a shock to Donald Kosec, 61, of Stow, Ohio. Kosec said he never had any of the typical risk factors for heart disease: He exercised regularly, kept a healthy weight, and checkups with the doctor showed normal cholesterol and blood pressure levels.
Eight years ago, when he was 53, Kosec went to his doctor after feeling a little short of breath. It was only then that he learned all of the major arteries pumping blood to and from his heart were blocked. Elevated Lp(a) was the culprit.
Within three weeks, he was having quintuple bypass surgery.
“Going from not having the care in the world to all of a sudden  facing your own death, your own mortality,” Kosec said. “It caught me off guard, big time.”
He entered a clinical trial for a treatment similar to lepodisiran, from drugmaker Amgen. Early results showed that drug, called olpasiran, drove down Lp(a) by at least 95% within nine months.
It turns out, however, that Kosec got the placebo in the trial — not the real deal. He doesn’t know whether his Lp(a) remains elevated. Without further treatment, it likely is.
All he can do now is wait for one of these promising Lp(a) therapies to become available.","Erika Edwards, Erika Edwards","March 31, 2025, 2:30 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/bird-flu/bird-flu-in-cats-rcna198374,It's time to worry about bird flu in cats,Bird Flu,"Bird flu wasn’t on Tim Hanson’s mind when he fed his cats specialty pet food containing raw chicken.
“You go to the pet shop and it was the premium raw food,” he said. “It was finely ground to a consistency that I thought was beneficial to my cats.”
But in early February, one of his cats, Kira, developed a fever and stopped eating. A test ordered by a veterinarian came back positive for bird flu. Within days, Kira’s condition had deteriorated — she became lethargic and had trouble breathing.
After several trips to the vet and emergency room in Portland, Oregon, where Hanson lives, he made the painful decision to put Kira down.
“She was the happiest cat I’ve ever had,” he said. “You’d walk past her and she’d do a little backflip and get on her back so you could rub her belly. She did that in the hospital the last night. … She just very lethargically flopped on her back so we could rub her belly.”
The manufacturer of the pet food, Wild Coast Pet Foods, subsequently recalled lots of the formula Kira had consumed due to potential bird flu contamination.
Hanson filed a lawsuit against the company earlier this month, alleging that it had failed to disclose the risk of bird flu in its raw pet food. He is seeking roughly $8,000 to cover the cost of Kira’s veterinary bills. Wild Coast did not respond to a request for comment. In a letter to customers, the company said it had “transitioned to fully cooked poultry recipes to eliminate any potential risk.”
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 126 domestic cats in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu since 2022. Around half of those cases were recorded this year, and many were exposed through food or milk.
“We see continued reports of cats with bird flu infection from across the country, and it’s kept increasing in the past months,” said Suresh Kuchipudi, a professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.
In cats, bird flu tends to be swift and lethal. Although the overall risk to indoor cats is low, Kuchipudi and other experts who study or diagnose the infections say the threat is mounting. With bird flu running rampant among poultry and cattle, there is a constant opportunity for the virus to enter the raw food supply. And while there’s no evidence yet that cats can transmit bird flu to people, the potential increases as more cats get sick.
“We don’t have the evidence, but it doesn’t mean that it may not have happened, or it can’t happen,” Kuchipudi said.
Most pet food is heated to a high enough temperature to kill pathogens before it’s packaged, but bird flu can linger in raw food if it’s sourced from infected poultry — for instance, from chickens that were culled due to an outbreak.
“The animals that were depopulated could potentially have ended up in the food chain for pets,” said Laura Goodman, an assistant professor at Cornell University’s Baker Institute for Animal Health. “It’s not uncommon for substandard meat to end up in the pet food chain.”
In the last four months, at least three pet food manufacturers have recalled batches containing raw poultry. The Food and Drug Administration in January warned manufacturers using uncooked meat to reassess their food safety plans in light of the recent cat illnesses and deaths.
Other cats have been exposed to bird flu on dairy farms, likely from drinking raw milk from infected cows. And in some instances, outdoor cats have picked up the virus directly from dead birds.
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in February also described two indoor cats that lived with dairy farm workers and contracted bird flu. The research suggests that “individuals who are working on dairies or hauling milk have the potential to carry virus into their house on their clothing or on their shoes, and in turn the cats then are exposed,” said Kimberly Dodd, dean of the Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine, who co-authored the report.
There is no active surveillance for bird flu in healthy cats, so cases could be underreported. A study of stray cats in the Netherlands found that nearly 12% were positive for bird flu antibodies.
“We may be only testing the sickest cats or one cat from a household. It’s very likely that there have been many cases out there that the cat was not brought to a veterinarian or testing wasn’t done,” said Kristy Pabilonia, director of veterinary diagnostic laboratories at Colorado State University.
Pabilonia oversaw the diagnostic testing for a hairless cat named Leonardo DiCaprio, who was found to have bird flu in January. Leo’s owner, Steve Werfelmann, said his cat had eaten chicken-based raw pet food from the company Savage Pet, which recalled dozens of batches earlier this month.
“When we adopted him, that was the recommended food” for his skin, Werfelmann said. “But then talking to the vet and going through this process, they actually told us there’s no real scientific evidence to back up raw food being better.”
Savage Pet referred NBC News to an online statement, which says “all of our poultry ingredients are USDA inspected and passed for human consumption.”
The current bird flu strain, which began spreading among wild birds and poultry in the U.S. in 2022, often causes severe neurological symptoms in cats, such as seizures and blindness, as well as difficulty breathing and discharge from the eyes and nose.
“Cats may be seen circling or having a head tilt or just acting very abnormally. Some of those clinical signs are very similar to what we see in rabies,” Dodd said.
Leo didn’t show neurological symptoms, aside from wobbliness in his back legs, Werfelmann said. Instead, his main symptoms were fever, lethargy and not eating.
“We thought he was going to die,” Werfelmann said.
The Colorado Department of Agriculture announced this month that 11 domestic cats there had gotten bird flu from raw poultry or pet food. Leo was the only one to survive.
Scientists are still trying to understand what makes bird flu so deadly in cats. The virus is highly fatal to birds but seems to affect cats more severely than some other mammals. Far fewer cases have been recorded in dogs, and though nearly 1,000 dairy herds have been affected, the disease tends to be milder in cows. In people, only one of the 70 cases recorded in the U.S. has been fatal.
Kuchipudi’s research has identified receptors throughout cats’ bodies that allow them to be infected by a broad range of flu viruses, including H5N1.
“When you examine these animals, the virus is everywhere in the body,” he said. “It causes a systemic infection that is potentially very severe.”
Joseph Journell lost two of his cats, Alexander and Tuxedo, to bird flu just days apart in November. He had been giving them raw milk, believing it to contain extra nutrients. A third cat, Big Boy, also got sick after drinking the milk and wound up in critical condition.
“I said, ‘Whatever’s wrong with Big Boy is the same thing wrong with Tuxsie and then obviously the same thing wrong with Alexander,’” said Journell, who lives in San Bernardino, California. “It’s the milk.”
Big Boy tested positive for bird flu via a urine sample in December. He has since recovered.
The milk the three cats consumed came from a California dairy farm called Raw Farm LLC, according to Journell’s lawyer. The farm issued a recall after California health officials said samples were positive for bird flu. The farm did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment, but in an online statement last month, it said the recall had been “unfounded” and that there was “no evidence of adulterated product connecting to any consumer illness.”
Like Hanson in Oregon, Journell decided to pursue legal action. His lawyer sent a letter in January to the owner of Raw Farm, indicating Journell’s intent to recoup more than $16,000 in veterinary expenses, lost wages and caretaker fees for Big Boy. They hope to mediate the situation with the company outside of court but plan to file suit if that’s not possible.
When the veterinary office learned about Kira’s raw food diet, Hanson said, they suspected bird flu right away.
“They immediately put on their PPE,” Hanson said. “I was taken aback.”
Although there’s some evidence that cats can pass bird flu to each other, there’s no evidence so far that they have transmitted the virus to people. However, the more the virus spreads in cats, the more opportunities it has to mutate and get better at spreading to humans. Outdoor cats, in particular, could serve as a transmission “bridge” between wild animals and domestic pets or humans, Kuchipudi said.
In 2016, a veterinarian at a New York City animal shelter tested positive for a different strain of bird flu, H7N2, after contact with sick cats.
“We need to be aware of these ongoing circulations that could potentially complicate the disease transmission and also [pose] a risk to human health,” Kuchipudi said.
Hanson said he was tested for bird flu after Kira died and was negative. In his cat’s final days, he said, he wore an N95 mask around her and washed his clothes upon returning home from the animal hospital.

In a pivotal Phase 2b clinical trial, patients who took the experimental medication lorundrostat along with two or three currently available hypertension drugs saw a decrease in systolic blood pressure (the upper number) that was 8 points greater than what was seen in patients who got a placebo. The study will be published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
“This new potential therapy for hypertension is exciting,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Luke Laffin, co-director of the Center for Blood Pressure Disorders at the Cleveland Clinic’s Heart, Vascular and Thoracic Institute. “We do a poor job controlling blood pressure in the U.S.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of adults in the U.S. have hypertension; among them, less than 1 in 4 have their blood pressure under control.
Hypertension is diagnosed when a person has a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or higher. A systolic measurement between 120 and 129 mm Hg is considered to be elevated. A normal measurement is 120/80 mm Hg or below.
Uncontrolled hypertension — which Laffin defined as a measurement of 130/80 mm Hg or higher even with medication — is linked to a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and kidney failure.
Among patients taking medication for hypertension, the rate of control is 60% to 70%, said Dr. Ajay Kirtane, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, who wasn’t involved with the research. That leaves 30% to 40% of patients who need another option.
Lorundrostat is meant for this group of patients. The drug, part of a class called aldosterone synthase inhibitors, works by blocking the adrenal glands’ synthesis of a hormone called aldosterone, which controls the amount of salt retained by the body. When aldosterone is reduced, so are salt levels and therefore blood pressure.
To test the safety and efficacy of lorundrostat, Laffin and his colleagues recruited 285 adults with uncontrolled hypertension whose average age was 60. More than half (53%) of the participants were Black.
Black patients are among those most at risk, Laffin said. About 55% of Black adults have high blood pressure, according to the American Heart Association.
Dr. Oscar Cingolani, director of the hypertension program at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the inclusion of so many Black patients is “a big, big thing,” noting that “African Americans … tend to be more responsive to this pathway.”
All of the patients in the trial were already taking a mix of blood pressure drugs. When the trial began, the researchers standardized those treatments by putting all of the patients on two or three specific medications. Three weeks later, they randomly assigned the participants to get either a placebo or one of two doses of lorundrostat for the next 12 weeks.
At three points, the participants wore a blood pressure cuff for a 24-hour period: at the beginning, four weeks after treatment started and then again at 12 weeks.
Participants taking the lower dose of lorundrostat, 50 milligrams, plus standard medications saw an average systolic blood pressure decrease of 15.4 points, while the group receiving the placebo plus standard drugs saw a decrease of 7.4 points — so the drug-related decrease in blood pressure after accounting for the placebo response was 8 points.
Increasing the dose of the drug didn’t improve the results.
While the placebo response may seem high, it’s most likely due to people being in a study and having the attention of health professionals, making them more scrupulous about taking their medications, experts said.
With a decrease of 8 points, say from 170 to 162, “that is the range where you would in a longer-term study see reductions in heart attacks and strokes,” said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, director of the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City.
Aldosterone synthase inhibitors are a new class of drugs, some of which are closer to being considered for approval by the Food and Drug Administration than others, Bhatt said. One other, baxdrostat, is currently in Phase 3 trials.
Lorundrostat has shown promise in the three levels of clinical trials needed for approval. The last one, the Phase 3 trial, is completed, though the results haven’t been published yet, Laffin said. The researchers are working on the trials with drugmaker Mineralys Therapeutics, which funded the trials.
The drug could potentially be available within 12 to 18 months, Laffin said.
Patients in the trial who got lorundrostat were more likely than those who got the placebo to develop high potassium levels. That’s something patients’ doctors would need to keep an eye out for, Bhatt said, because it can lead to abnormal heart rhythms.",Unknown,"March 30, 2025, 2:30 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/measles-what-to-do-if-you-think-you-have-it-rcna198596,What should you do if you think you have the measles?,Measles Outbreak,"As measles spreads across the country, sick children and adults are exposing other patients — including newborn babies — when they seek care at hospitals, pediatrician’s offices and urgent care centers.
Medical experts say that to help control the spread of measles, one of the world’s most contagious viruses, people with suspected cases should take precautions before visiting a doctor’s office or the emergency room.
“I never want to discourage anyone from seeking care,” said Dr. Alison Haddock, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians. But “measles is highly contagious, and it is dangerous to expose others.”
Walking into a crowded clinic or emergency department, especially without a mask, can infect others in the waiting room, including patients who are pregnant, medically vulnerable or immunocompromised, said Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Austin, Texas, and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics. An unvaccinated child with measles, who had been infected while traveling abroad, sparked an outbreak in San Diego in 2008 that included children in the waiting room of a pediatrician’s office.
“If you have any concerns” about being infected with measles, “do not just show up at the pediatrician’s office. Do not just show up at the ER,” Brown said. “Call first so they can be prepared.”
As of Friday, the U.S. has seen upward of 500 measles cases in at least 20 states and Washington, D.C. since the beginning of the year. The majority are in Texas, where an outbreak on the western edge of the state has grown to 400 cases and spilled into New Mexico and Oklahoma. Two people have died, including a 6-year-old girl.
While anyone who is unvaccinated can be infected with measles, patients in hospitals and clinics may be especially vulnerable to complications, especially if they are pregnant, immunocompromised or in fragile health, Brown said. The measles virus can survive in the air for two hours after an infected person leaves the room, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, suggested alerting ER staff that someone with measles is on their way.
Schaffner also advised people to bring a second adult to the ER along with the sick patient. While one adult waits outside the building with the sick patient, the second adult should go inside, notify the ER staff and find out what precautions to take before bringing a potentially infected patient inside.
ER staff may need time to prepare an isolation room for someone with measles. These rooms have specialized airflow and filtration systems to prevent airborne viruses from drifting into public areas, Haddock said.
Given the overcrowding in most ERs, however, “staff may need to rearrange patients to make this room available to you,” Haddock said.
Measles patients and their family members or caregivers should wear masks when in any health care facility, Haddock said. ER staff may ask people with measles to enter through a special door, such as the ambulance bay, to reduce the risk of exposing other patients.
Few primary care practices have isolation rooms, also known as negative air pressure rooms, Brown said.
Doctors may prefer to see people with suspected measles cases by telehealth. Other doctors may choose to see patients in the parking lot — a common practice during the Covid pandemic, Brown said. Alternatively, doctors may see patients with suspected measles infections at the end of the day, after other patients have left the clinic.
Even mild cases of measles can make people feel miserable.
“It’s not just a normal fever and a rash,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “These kids are sick.”
About 20% of people who get the measles are hospitalized. In children, the most common causes of hospitalization are pneumonia or dehydration, caused by diarrhea, Offit said.
There’s no specific treatment for measles, Offit said, other than supportive care, such as fluids and fever-reducing medications. Antibiotics don’t help a measles infection because it’s caused by a virus, although doctors may prescribe antibiotics for children who develop secondary bacterial infections. Doctors recommend that children get a lot of rest. Children may feel better in a dark room, because measles can make them sensitive to light.
Although many children with the measles can be safely treated at home, parents should call a doctor if their child appears short of breath or dehydrated, Offit said. It’s easy for children with fevers to become dehydrated, especially if they have diarrhea and aren’t able to drink enough fluids.
Offit, who has treated many measles patients, said he has diagnosed the illness on the basis of symptoms — including a fever, cough, runny nose, pink eye, sensitivity to light and white spots on the inside of the mouth. Many younger doctors have never seen the measles, however, and may miss the diagnosis. Doctors can make a definitive diagnosis with a blood test or by swabbing a patients’ nose or throat. It can take several days to get results back from a hospital or public health lab.
Brown notes that many people don’t realize they have measles and may believe they have a bad case of the flu. That’s because the characteristic red measles rash doesn’t show up for four days after symptoms start. The rash follows a pattern, beginning on the face at the hairline and gradually spreading down the body. People are contagious for four days before the rash appears and four days after; patients should stay home during this time to avoid infecting others.",Unknown,"March 29, 2025, 6:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fdas-top-vaccine-scientist-dr-peter-marks-rcna198682,"FDA's top vaccine scientist is out, citing Kennedy's 'misinformation and lies'",Health news,"Dr. Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration’s top vaccine regulator, has resigned, an official at the Department of Health and Human Services said Friday.
“If Peter Marks does not want to get behind restoring science to its golden standard and promoting radical transparency, then he has no place at FDA under the strong leadership of Secretary Kennedy,” a spokesperson at HHS said, referring to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
A person familiar with the matter told NBC News that Marks was forced out.
In a resignation letter to acting FDA Commissioner Sara Brenner, Marks wrote that undermining confidence in vaccines is “irresponsible, detrimental to public health, and a clear danger to our nation’s health, safety, and security.”
He said he had been willing to work with Kennedy to address any concerns about vaccine safety and transparency.
“However, it has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,” Marks wrote.
Marks did not respond to a request for comment.
Marks had led the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research since 2016. The division is responsible for assuring the safety and effectiveness of a number of medical products, including vaccines.
Marks helped lead the nation through the Covid pandemic, playing a key role in authorizing the first Covid vaccines in late 2020, from first Pfizer-BioNTech and then, shortly after, Moderna. He helped launch Operation Warp Speed, the first Trump administration's private-public partnership to quickly develop the vaccines.
Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist who has been critical of the Covid vaccines, filed a citizens’ petition in 2021 requesting that the FDA revoke the authorization of the vaccines. The same year, he described the Covid vaccine as the “deadliest vaccine ever made.”
Kennedy has also worked to undermine confidence in the measles vaccine amid the largest outbreak in the United States since 2019. While he has said vaccines protect children from the measles, he has also said the decision to vaccinate is a “personal” one.
In a recent interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, Kennedy said the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine “does cause deaths every year.”
No deaths have been linked to the MMR vaccine in healthy people, according to the Infectious Disease Society of America. The vaccine is not recommending for immunocompromised people.
“The ongoing multistate measles outbreak that is particularly severe in Texas reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined,” Marks wrote in his resignation letter.",Berkeley Lovelace Jr.,"March 28, 2025, 10:40 PM EDT"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hhs-kennedy-health-agencies-mass-layoffs-rcna198549,Mass layoffs expected to begin at health agencies as RFK Jr.'s agenda takes shape,Health news,"Thousands of federal workers were bracing for pink slips Friday as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. begins dismantling the sprawling federal agency responsible for protecting America's health.
Some 10,000 full-time jobs were on the chopping block as part of the White House’s “reduction in force” plan to effectively shutter or downsize a number of divisions under the HHS umbrella, including virtually eliminating some offices tasked with tackling HIV and improving minority health.
HHS oversees 13 agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. Overall, the cuts will shrink the health department’s workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 when combined with its earlier layoffs, Andrew Nixon, a senior spokesperson for HHS, said Thursday.
Federal health workers, who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, said it’s likely to get ugly.
“No matter what happens, this is going to be a bad day,” one CDC official said. “It feels like we’re participating in the ‘Hunger Games’ reaping.”
An endangered FDA worker said they were told that if they’re not laid off on Friday to take their laptops home in the event they get a termination notice over the weekend.
“Our director said our center would be heavily impacted and the RIF (reduction in force) notices are going out this afternoon into the weekend,” a CDC worker in the Division of HIV Prevention said.
And a worker at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said employees were told to expect “layoffs of large number” at the agency’s Office of Minority Health, a division focused on eliminating health disparities.
The layoffs add to growing evidence that Kennedy, who tried to strike a moderate tone during his Senate confirmation, is set to pursue an agenda that could radically reshape public health across the U.S.
Kennedy has long talked about dismantling the federal public health infrastructure. During his failed run for president, he vowed to hollow out the CDC and the NIH. Elon Musk’s project, the Department of Government Efficiency, has provided a Trump-endorsed plan to make that dream a reality and set the stage for him to remake the health agencies in his image.
The cuts come as Kennedy has begun to exercise his influence on HHS priorities. Earlier this week, NBC News reported that the CDC was preparing to hand vaccine safety data to a discredited researcher who has spread misinformation regarding vaccines and autism. The FDA recently canceled a meeting about flu shots, and Kennedy has downplayed the importance of vaccination in Texas amid a measles outbreak.
But even before the first HHS worker was sent packing Friday, the reduction rollout had been marked by chaos, CDC officials said.
Requests from center directors for early or even simultaneous notice of the cuts were ignored by HHS, according to one senior official, who said leadership was learning about layoffs and division closings from reports in the media and relying on their staffers to let them know if they received termination notices.
Experts warned that wholesale staffing cuts would be hazardous to maintaining public health.
“Making America Healthy Again sounds great, but that’s not possible when HHS is hollowed out with major staff and funding cuts,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.
“Loss of career scientists will have long-term consequences for public health and safety,” Gostin said. “It will be very difficult to rebuild the public health workforce. In my view, these cuts are dangerous and shortsighted. Public health is invisible but it saves lives every day.”
Earlier, NBC obtained a memo that revealed that HHS workers would be notified as early as Friday whether they would be laid off.
HHS said Thursday that 28 divisions in the health department contain “redundant units,” and that the restructuring plan will consolidate them into 15 divisions.
“We will eliminate an entire alphabet soup of departments, while preserving their core functions by merging them into a new organization called the Administration for Healthy America or AHA,” Kennedy said in a post on X.
Among the agencies set to be folded into the AHA include the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration, which includes a program focused on HIV treatment.
Meanwhile, the divisions being eliminated or reduced at the CDC include those focused on global health, domestic HIV prevention and injury prevention, such as gun violence, HHS said Thursday.
In total, the CDC will decrease its workforce by about 2,400 employees, Nixon said Thursday. The administration will also move the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which manages the nation’s emergency stockpile, from HHS to the CDC, he said.
Also facing big cuts are the FDA, NIH and CMS.
The FDA will decrease its workforce by about 3,500 full-time employees; the NIH headcount will be reduced by 1,200 employees; and CMS will lose about 300 workers.
Nixon said the reorganization of CMS will not affect Medicare and Medicaid, nor will it affect the timeline for the FDA’s review of drugs, medical devices and food.","Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Brandy Zadrozny, Corky Siemaszko, Berkeley Lovelace Jr., Brandy Zadrozny, Corky Siemaszko","March 28, 2025, 10:49 PM GMT+8 / Updated March 29, 2025, 5:31 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-us-cases-rcna198557,Growing measles outbreak in Texas pushes U.S. cases above 520,Measles Outbreak,"Fueled by the ongoing measles outbreak in Texas, cases in the United States this year now exceed 500, according to NBC News’ tally of state health department data.
The 523 cases recorded in less than three months represent the second-highest annual total the country has seen in a decade. In the only year with more cases, 2019, the United States nearly lost its measles elimination status.
Since the Texas outbreak began in late January, 400 cases have been confirmed in the state, the Department of State Health Services said in an update Friday. Forty-one patients have been hospitalized, and a 6-year-old child has died.
All but two of Texas' confirmed infections have been in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown.
The outbreak has spread to three other states: New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas, where the World Health Organization reported on Thursday that a DNA sequence of the virus in one case was identical to those from Texas.
The outbreak originated in Gaines County, Texas, which has recorded 226 cases, according to the state health department. The county has one of the state’s highest school vaccine exemption rates at nearly 18%, according to health department data.
Katherine Wells, director of public health for nearby Lubbock County, told NBC News last week that efforts to increase vaccination there have gotten a lukewarm response and suggested that it could be a year until the outbreak is controlled.
Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 92.7% of kindergarteners have had two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The two-shot regimen is 97% effective at preventing measles.
However, the rate may be lower among children younger than 5, who are not fully captured in surveillance data. A study last month calculated, based on a survey, that the share could be as low as 72%.
In large part thanks to the success of the MMR vaccine, measles has been considered eliminated in the U.S. since 2000, meaning the virus is not continuously spreading, though there are occasional outbreaks.
Infants usually get their first measles shot at 12 to 15 months, followed by the second when they are 4 to 6 years old. But the Texas Health Department said earlier this month that it may consider vaccinating babies as young as 6 months. The CDC says health departments can offer earlier vaccinations in areas experiencing outbreaks.
Measles is highly contagious — the virus spreads through the air and can linger for up to two hours after an infected person leaves a space, according to the CDC. Up to 90% of people without immunity from a vaccine or prior infection can contract the illness if they come into contact with an infected person.",Randi Richardson,"March 29, 2025, 4:26 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rabies-organ-transplant-death-michigan-rcna198265,"After Michigan patient dies of rabies from a transplanted kidney, donor's other recipients get preventive shots",Health news,"A Michigan resident who received a transplant in December died after having been infected with rabies from the new organ, the state health department said Wednesday.
“A public health investigation determined they contracted rabies through the transplanted organ,” Lynn Sutfin, a spokesperson for the state's Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.
A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the same donor also provided corneal grafts for three patients in different states.
“Based on the concerning symptoms of the kidney recipient who died, CDC worked with Missouri health officials to intercept a fourth corneal graft before it could be implanted into a Missouri resident — even before rabies was confirmed in the donor,” the CDC said. “All corneal tissue recipients have gotten post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) shots to prevent rabies and are currently healthy.”
The Michigan patient died in January, after receiving a kidney transplant at a hospital in Ohio, the CDC said.
The donor did not show traditional rabies symptoms, according to the agency, so the infection was not detected until the recipient's illness was discovered. After that, ""public health officials learned the organ donor was exposed to a wild animal in Idaho five weeks before death"" — likely a skunk, the CDC said.
The agency said it has notified close contacts of both the donor and the kidney recipient and that ""those with potential risk for getting rabies have been advised to start rabies PEP.""
Sutfin said the Michigan and Ohio health departments “worked closely” together and with the CDC to investigate the death. The CDC’s rabies laboratory confirmed the diagnosis.
The Michigan Health Department declined to provide additional information. The Ohio Health Department said the kidney transplant patient was hospitalized in Toledo, and that health care workers who may have been exposed have been offered rabies shots accordingly.
Potential organ donors in the United States are screened for viruses, bacteria and other infections; however, rabies is not usually among those tests, in part because the test for it takes too long (organs are only viable for a limited window of time) and because the infection is so rare in people. The responsibility for those screenings falls on organ procurement organizations.
The CDC has conducted four investigations since 1978 related to rabies transmission from organ and tissue donors to recipients.
A patient who received a kidney transplant in 2013 died after contracting rabies through the organ. The donor was found to have died of rabies in Florida but, like the recent Michigan case, the cause of death was discovered only after an investigation into the recipient’s death. Three other patients also received organs from the donor.
In 2004, three transplant recipients died of rabies after they received organs from an infected donor in Arkansas.
Rabies can spread to humans if they come into contact with saliva or blood from infected animals, such as bats, raccoons, skunks or stray dogs. It is not always clear right away that a person has contracted rabies, as the initial symptoms are similar to those of the flu, including fever, headache and nausea. As the illness progresses, patients then experience difficulty swallowing, excessive salivation and hallucinations.","Randi Richardson, Randi Richardson","March 27, 2025, 9:36 AM GMT+8 / Updated March 29, 2025, 1:14 AM GMT+8"

The cuts, part of the White House’s “reduction in force” plan, were expected to effectively shutter or downsize multiple departments at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies, potentially jeopardizing public health efforts.
HHS oversees 13 agencies, including the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health.
HHS said Thursday that 28 divisions in the health department contain “redundant units,” and that the restructuring plan will consolidate them into 15 divisions.

The administration will also make cuts to divisions at other agencies tasked with responding to approving new drugs, providing health insurance and responding to infectious disease outbreaks.
The FDA will decrease its workforce by about 3,500 full-time employees; the NIH headcount will be reduced by 1,200 employees; and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will lose about 300 workers.
Overall, the cuts will shrink the health department's full-time workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 when combined with its earlier layoffs.
According to a memo obtained by NBC News, employees will be notified on whether they've been laid off as early as Friday.
Nixon said the reorganization of CMS will not impact Medicare and Medicaid services, nor will it affect the timeline for the FDA's review of drugs, medical devices and food.
He added that ""no additional cuts are currently planned.""
Larry Levitt, executive vice president of health policy at KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues, said government agencies tend to sprawl over time and benefit from occasional reorganization, but he criticized the Trump administration's approach.
""This is not just a reorganization of HHS,"" he said. ""It's also a slashing of the federal workforce, which will ultimately affect government services. People and health care providers may find themselves waiting longer to get help and get their questions answered, and that will cause frustration and delays in services.""
An FDA employee who received notice of the agency's planned cuts Thursday morning worried that reviews of medical products including drugs and devices could be delayed, despite the administration's assurances.
""The cuts to FDA will still adversely affect our mission, it doesn't matter if they're not directly cutting reviewers,"" said the employee, who asked not to be identified for fear of repercussions. ""We're only able to review because of a lot of back end support.""
Thursday's cuts were separate from earlier attempts by government officials to fire thousands of probationary employees at the CDC and other federal agencies. Two federal judges have since ordered the temporary reinstatement of many of those affected workers.
Leadership at the CDC was given notice of the plans Wednesday and were told to expect an announcement Thursday or Friday, according to an agency worker who was not authorized to speak on the matter.
Federal health officials had previously said they planned to shift responsibilities from some eliminated departments to other parts of HHS.
For example, the Trump administration was considering a plan to move the responsibilities of the CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention over to the Health Resources and Services Administration, which does its own HIV work under The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.
However, HRSA is primarily focused on the treatment of HIV rather than preventing it, leaving some HIV advocates concerned it could drive back progress on prevention.
It was unclear Thursday whether that was still the administration's plan. A spokesperson for HHS did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.
Much of the responsibility for the newly downsized agencies at the CDC will likely be left to Susan Monarez, Trump’s pick to lead the agency and its current acting director.
Earlier this month, The Associated Press reported that five CDC division leaders resigned as the agency prepared for cuts.

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-vaccination-rates-may-lower-thought-risking-us-elimination-sta-rcna198259,"Measles vaccination rates may be lower than thought, risking U.S.' 'elimination status'",Measles Outbreak,"Measles vaccination rates for young children may be far lower than publicly reported, a troubling development that could mean the United States is closer than expected to losing its “elimination status” for the extremely contagious disease.
“We are experiencing an extremely concerning decline in measles vaccination in the very group most vulnerable to the disease,” said Benjamin Rader, a computational epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and the author of a recent study that looked at children’s vaccination rates.
As of Wednesday, there have been over 420 cases of measles this year – already surpassing the total number of cases for 2024. Most are in West Texas, where a growing outbreak has spread into neighboring states, but a handful of cases, linked to international travel, have been reported in other states. The cases have mostly been in unvaccinated people or those with an unknown vaccination status, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world, so pockets of under-vaccinated areas can make it easier to gain a foothold and spread, Rader said.
“The worry is that once measles gains a foothold in the community, it’ll transition from isolated outbreaks to an endemic disease,” with consistent presence in the U.S., he said.
The CDC recommends two doses of MMR vaccine to protect against measles, mumps and rubella, first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second shot at ages 4 to 6 years before entering school. The agency estimates 92.7% of kindergarteners have had two doses of the vaccine.
That’s not high enough, said Dr. Brian Clista, a pediatrician who works in private practice in Pittsburgh.
“The 92% vaccination status reported by the CDC is still below the recommended rate of 95% to produce herd immunity — so it’s not where we need to be,” Clista said.
However, Rader said that the true MMR vaccination rate among young children can be misrepresented by publicly reported numbers, because MMR surveillance is drawn from older children who are already in kindergarten.
Younger children under the age of 5 are not fully captured in surveillance data because they have not reached kindergarten age — although a 2021 estimate from the CDC notes a subset of younger children, namely those who received at least one MMR dose by 24 months, were 90.6% vaccinated for measles.
In Rader’s study, published online in February in the American Journal of Public Health, his team surveyed approximately 20,000 parents of children under 5 from July 2023 through April 2024, finding only 71.8% reported that their children received at least 1 dose of MMR vaccine — much lower than CDC estimates.
The researchers used a digital surveillance platform that the CDC has used to estimate things like at-home Covid testing, he said.
Rader downplayed the difference in numbers between his findings and the CDC data, emphasizing that, while accurate, the CDC data does not provide a complete picture — despite its best intentions.
Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director of infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, who was not part of the research, called the findings “worrisome.”
“This was likely exacerbated by the Covid pandemic, especially because, as Rader notes, many kids catch up on the childhood vaccine schedule when they enter elementary school and the school requires it,” Roberts said.
He agreed with the findings that the true rate is lower than what the CDC reports, likely due to a “sampling bias.”
“With greater homeschooling and greater schooling absences, as occurred during Covid, the more likely there will be more of these kids who do not get the chance to catch up on the childhood vaccines,” Roberts said.
Clista noted that the study has limitations, as the research relied on parents self-reporting information compared to more objective data that the CDC gathers from kindergarten entry forms.
Rader acknowledged that not every child younger than 5 is eligible for the measles vaccine, and his study didn’t specify the exact ages of the children younger than 5 who were unvaccinated.
The pandemic disrupted health care access, which made it harder for people to get routine care and increased vaccine hesitancy over the Covid vaccine, which also spilled over and affected MMR vaccine rates, Rader said.
The study found 20% more children were vaccinated for measles when their parents were vaccinated for Covid.
“Unfortunately, routine vaccination is trending substantially lower, although there is the hope that it will catch up,” Rader said.
Katherine Wells, director of public health for Lubbock — the largest city in West Texas, where the current outbreak is centered — said school enrollment requirements should help many children catch up as they enter pre-K or kindergarten.
“However, in Texas, we’re seeing a growing number of parents opting out of vaccinations — a troubling trend that puts communities at greater risk,” she said.
Measles has been “eliminated” in the U.S. since 2000 — meaning that the country hasn’t had a chain of transmission extend for more than 52 weeks.
“With the absence of sustained measles virus transmission for 12 consecutive months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system, the United States has maintained measles elimination status since 2000,” a CDC spokesperson told NBC News.
“This temporal boundary, however, was nearly breached in 2019,” said Dr. Jonathan Temte, professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Temte was part of the team who declared measles eliminated in 2000.
When he served on a panel to recertify measles elimination in 2011-12, one of his greatest concerns, he said, was the rising rates of vaccine exemptions among children and the cases brought into the U.S. after international travel that could lead to endemic transmission.
Now additional factors might be creating a perfect storm for the U.S. to lose its elimination status, including declining vaccination rates, increasing pockets of unvaccinated individuals and greater ease in travel.
I would guess that the likelihood of re-establishment of measles in the United States is greater than 50%.
Measles is also contagious before its characteristic rash appears, often creating a delay in diagnosis and allowing it to spread before people know they are infected.
Combining this with the level of complacency toward the public health response and the lack of recognition that an illness from measles can be serious, Temte said, “I would guess that the likelihood of re-establishment of measles in the United States is greater than 50%.”
Other experts are also concerned.
“I believe we’re headed in that direction,” Wells said. “I can’t say for certain whether this will be the outbreak that causes it, but if we don’t take steps to increase vaccination rates nationwide, we will lose our measles elimination status.”
Dr. Michael Mina, vaccine expert and epidemiologist, whose research was the first to discover that measles can wipe out the immune system’s memory of previous illnesses, said he expected cases to continue almost exclusively among the unvaccinated.
“While we do have very many unvaccinated children, whether the virus burns through most of the susceptible or is slower and drives some level of endemicity is tough to say,” he said.
“My concern is the ‘bubbles’ of the unvaccinated are larger and larger and more plentiful and so they start to merge with each other, meaning that a case in one could ignite nationwide cases.”
A similar scenario occurred in Europe about 10 years ago and led to tens of thousands of cases, he said.",Unknown,"March 27, 2025, 5:00 PM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hhs-taps-anti-vaccine-activist-look-debunked-links-autism-vaccines-sou-rcna198214,"HHS taps anti-vaccine activist to look at debunked links between autism and vaccines, sources say",Health news,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to hand over multiple sets of vaccine safety data to a discredited researcher with a history of spreading misinformation that vaccines cause autism, according to two sources familiar with the plan. Both learned about the matter during recent meetings at the CDC but were not authorized to speak about it publicly.
David Geier, who shows up in the Department of Health and Human Services’ directory as a “senior data analyst,” will reportedly analyze the data. Geier has repeatedly claimed that vaccines cause autism — a link that’s already been fully debunked.
“If this individual is involved, then it draws into immediate question the validity of any analysis that comes out of this work,” said a former CDC official who was told of the plan before recently leaving the agency.
Dr. Richard Besser, president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting CDC director, called Geier a “deeply irresponsible choice” to lead this effort as he has “no medical degree and a long history of pushing discredited theories about vaccines and autism.”
“Families affected by autism deserve credible research efforts that explore legitimate potential preventable causes of and treatments for autism,” Besser said in a statement. “They are not helped when our tax dollars and research funds are wasted on rehashing a question that has already been answered.”
Geier’s hiring was first reported Tuesday evening by The Washington Post. It was unclear Wednesday whether the plans had since changed. Neither HHS nor Geier responded to requests for comment.
A growing measles outbreak is spreading in at least three states: Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. As of Wednesday, 377 cases had been confirmed in those states — the vast majority in unvaccinated children in Texas. It’s the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019. Two people have died, including a 6-year-old girl.
It was reported this month that the CDC would launch a new investigation looking at possible links between vaccines and autism. Instead, the Department of Health and Human Services, led by longtime anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., requested raw data from the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink and three other sources. The CDC is part of HHS.
David Geier and his father, Maryland geneticist Dr. Mark Geier, were a pair of researchers known for their poorly designed and retracted studies using government safety data that have long fueled widespread misinformation about vaccines.
According to an account in the 2005 book “Evidence of Harm,” then-congressman Dave Weldon — whose nomination for CDC director was abruptly withdrawn two weeks ago — intervened to help the Geiers access the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC-housed dataset containing patient health records. This raw data is available to researchers, but isn’t public because of concerns over privacy, misrepresentation of data, and manpower.
The Geiers claimed at an Institute of Medicine panel in 2004 that the CDC data showed vaccines were linked to autism, a claim that was refuted by scientists at the meeting and in scores of published studies since. At the same IOM meeting, a scientist explained how the Geiers’ findings had failed to factor for age — children with more vaccines only appeared to have higher rates of autism because they were older and had more time to be diagnosed. (Children on average are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder around age 5.)
The Geiers conducted research from a makeshift laboratory in their carpeted wood-paneled suburban Maryland basement; published several studies, many of which were retracted; and promoted an unproven treatment for autism that cost families tens of thousands of dollars and included injections of Lupron, a drug used for prostate cancer and early puberty. In children, it’s only approved for precocious puberty and comes with side effects including bone damage, heart issues and seizures. They diagnosed kids with precocious puberty without proper tests and misled parents into thinking they were signing up for an approved autism therapy. A 2011 Maryland Board of Physicians investigation found that the Geiers violated standards of care.
Mark Geier, who theorized that autism resulted from an interaction between mercury and testosterone, was stripped of his medical license by Maryland regulators in 2012. Maryland regulators also disciplined David Geier for practicing medicine without a license.","Erika Edwards, Brandy Zadrozny, Erika Edwards, Brandy Zadrozny","March 27, 2025, 2:56 AM GMT+8 / Updated March 27, 2025, 5:24 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/pig-liver-transplant-rcna196246,Chinese researchers report a pig kidney transplant and a first-step liver experiment,Health news,"Chinese researchers are reporting new steps in the quest for animal-to-human organ transplants — with a successful pig kidney transplant and a hint Wednesday that pig livers might eventually be useful, too.
A Chinese patient is the third person in world known to be living with a gene-edited pig kidney. And the same research team also reported an experiment implanting a pig liver into a brain-dead person.
Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike in hopes of alleviating a transplant shortage. Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. — two pig hearts and two pig kidneys — were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving — an Alabama woman who received a transplant in November and a New Hampshire man who received one in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin.
Nearly three weeks after the kidney surgery the Chinese patient “is very well” and the pig kidney likewise is functioning very well, Dr. Lin Wang, of Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi’an, told reporters in a briefing this week.
Wang, part of the hospital’s xenotransplant team, said the kidney recipient remains in the hospital for testing. Chinese media have reported she is a 69-year-old woman who was diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago.
But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation — learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin — important for basic organ function — although not as much as human livers do.
The liver is a complex challenge because of its varied jobs, including removing waste, breaking down nutrients and medicines, fighting infection, storing iron and regulating blood clotting.
“We do find that it could function a little bit in a human being,” Wang said. He speculated that would be enough to help support a failing human liver.
In the U.S. last year, surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania attempted that sort of “bridge” support by externally attaching a pig liver to a brain-dead human body to filter blood, much like dialysis for failing kidneys. U.S. pig developer eGenesis is studying that approach.
In China, Wang’s team didn’t remove the deceased person’s own liver, instead implanting the pig liver near it.
That “clouds the picture,” said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, a liver transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center who wasn’t involved with the work. “It’s hopefully a first step but it’s still, a lot like any good research, more questions than answers.”
Wang said his team later replaced the human liver of another brain-dead person with a pig liver and is analyzing the outcome.",Unknown,"March 27, 2025, 4:14 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006,CDC is pulling back $11B in Covid funding sent to health departments across the U.S.,EXCLUSIVE,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is pulling back $11.4 billion in funds allocated in response to the pandemic to state and community health departments, nongovernment organizations and international recipients, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed Tuesday.
""The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,"" HHS Director of Communications Andrew Nixon said in a statement. ""HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.""
HHS oversees 13 agencies, including the CDC, which is tasked with protecting the nation’s health. Notices began going out Monday, and awardees have 30 days to reconcile their expenditures. Figures are subject to change.
The funding slash comes on the heels of other cuts under new Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., including the canceling of hundreds of millions of dollars in grants for research into vaccine hesitancy, LGBTQ populations and supporting HIV prevention.
“Now that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative agreements are no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out,"" read notices of termination sent to grantees Monday and shared with NBC News.
The federal public health emergency ended May 11, 2023, but more than 1.2 million people in the United States have died from Covid, according to the CDC. Though infection has slowed and the disease has become milder, hundreds of people still die every week from Covid, and long Covid symptoms continue to cause debilitating medical problems in some cases.
The clawed-back funds were largely being used for Covid testing, vaccination, community health workers and initiatives to address Covid health disparities among high-risk and underserved populations, including racial and ethnic minority populations and rural communities, as well as global Covid projects, according to talking points CDC leadership emailed to agency departments Tuesday.
The CDC reviewed a list of HHS-provided Covid grants and cooperative agreements and identified the programs that were no longer needed, according to the talking points.
A list of projects for the rescinded funds was not immediately available.
In recent years, Covid funding had been used for other critical functions in state health departments, according to a CDC senior official who was not authorized to speak for the agency.
In a statement to NBC News, Kristina Iodice, a communications director for Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment, echoed the concern, noting cuts could affect more than just programs aimed at Covid.
""We are concerned that this sudden loss of federal funding threatens Colorado’s ability to track COVID-19 trends and other emerging diseases, modernize disease data systems, respond to outbreaks, and provide critical immunization access, outreach, and education—leaving communities more vulnerable to future public health crises,"" Iodice said.
Nine state health departments confirmed they had received notice of the recalled funds.
Greg Flynn, media relations director for the Mississippi State Department of Health, said the state was “currently working to assess the potential impacts to our agency.” Charla Haley, public information officer for Utah's Department of Health, said in an email, ""We are currently evaluating impact.""
So far, HHS has made the deepest budget cuts governmentwide under the Trump administration’s efforts to radically slash federal funding, according to a tally listed on the Department of Government Efficiency's website.","Brandy Zadrozny, Brandy Zadrozny","March 26, 2025, 3:18 AM GMT+8 / Updated March 26, 2025, 7:55 AM GMT+8"
https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-barrier-creams-rcna118121,Have you been damaging your skin barrier without knowing it?,SKIN CARE,"Does your skin feel or look dry, flaky, red, itchy or rough? You may have a compromised skin barrier, according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Terrence Keaney. Instead of grabbing your usual body lotion or face moisturizer, try a cream made to support and repair your skin barrier.
“Repairing the skin barrier means giving it what it needs, which is replenishing the essential lipids and increasing water hydration,” says Dr. Stacy Chimento, a board-certified dermatologist. Unlike your typical cream or lotion, barrier creams do more than just hydrate the skin; they also heal the barrier and protect against water loss and an influx of allergens and irritants, says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Stephen Suah.
Since I was young, I’ve been combatting eczema and focusing on how to repair and maintain my skin barrier to prevent my condition from worsening. This is why I spoke to dermatologists about how to shop for a barrier cream and rounded up their recommendations, as well as NBC Select staff-favorite creams to consider.
SKIP AHEAD How I picked the best barrier creams | The best barrier creams | How to shop for barrier creams | Why trust NBC Select?
When shopping for the best barrier creams for your skin, our experts recommend keeping in mind the following factors:

Below is a compiled list of our experts’ favorite barrier creams, including top-rated options and NBC Select staff favorites.
This fast-absorbing, non-greasy cream is great for both the face and body, and has three essential ceramides and hyaluronic acid, says Chimento. It’s also one of the few moisturizers my sensitive and dry skin can tolerate — it soothes my skin, adds moisture and reduces any rough, cracked eczema flare-ups.
The NBC Select Wellness Award winner is suitable for all skin types, including oily and acne-prone skin, because it’s noncomedogenic, meaning it won’t clog pores. Its formula is also hypoallergenic and fragrance-free, according to the brand. You can find this formula (which has the National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance) in two sizes, including 12 ounces and 19 ounces.
This cream comes recommended by board-certified dermatologist Dr. Stephen Suah, and it’s also one of my favorites. It has ingredients like ceramides to support the skin, panthenol to reinforce the barrier and prevent water loss and glycerin to add moisture to the skin, according to the brand. This combination of ingredients helps my skin during the winter months or if I have a flaky eczema flare-up on my face because its thick and creamy consistency is so hydrating and soothing on these patches. You can also purchase this moisturizer in a mini travel size.
This facial moisturizer helps mimic the natural levels of lipids in your skin, according to Keaney. It has ceramides to support and add moisture to the skin, cholesterol to help speed up the recovery of the skin barrier and fatty acids to improve elasticity, according to the brand. The brand recommends taking a small amount and warming it up between your fingertips for the most effective application. Then, you can apply it in patting motions to your face, neck and chest.
This Tower 28 moisturizer is another favorite of mine because it’s gentle enough for my dry, sensitive and eczema-prone skin. It has hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin, ceramides to support the barrier and allantoin to reduce any irritation and lock in moisture, according to the brand. Although you can apply this morning and night, I love using it in the morning because the lightweight cream feels hydrating all day and layers nicely under my sunscreen and makeup.
NBC Select editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez also loves this cream and applies it every morning for added moisture and protection. “It has literally saved my skin, especially in the winter when I am prone to eczema breakouts,” she says. “I haven’t had one so far this season.”
This moisturizer is a favorite of Chimento’s because it has ceramides to support the skin barrier and niacinamide to calm any redness and irritation. It’s also a favorite of NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin, who uses this moisturizer daily. “I usually think of barrier creams as too thick for daily wear and tend to apply them at night because of that,” she says. “But this one is just as hydrating as some of my night barrier creams, yet its lightweight feel and thinner texture help it dry quickly, so I can wear it under makeup.”
You can apply this cream in the morning and at night to both your face and neck. The fragrance-free and noncomedogenic cream is available in two sizes, including a travel-size. It is also available as a sunscreen.
This thick cream is a great option for those dealing with dry, flaky skin because it combines hyaluronic acid, ceramides and emollients to seal in moisture. I use this barrier cream twice a day and love that it leaves my skin feeling moisturized, soft and plump. I especially like using this during my eczema flare-ups because it has the National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance, and it immediately creates a thick layer of hydration and helps calm down any irritation. It also sits extremely well under makeup, which was a major problem I was having with my other moisturizers because they would pill every single time.
Infused with Avène’s signature Thermal Spring Water, this rich cream helps calm inflammation and reduce redness and irritation, according to the brand. “This is one of my top two favorite face moisturizers,” says former NBC Select managing editor Leah Ginsberg, who has rosacea and appreciates how moisturizing and gentle the cream is on her skin. “Last winter my skin got noticeably more dehydrated and very dull. Using this saved my skin complexion.” It also helps restore and hydrate skin within 48 hours, according to the brand. Ginsberg recommends using it at night or on makeup-free days since the balm feels thicker than her other daily moisturizers.
This multipurpose cream can be used to soothe dry, irritated skin on your face, body and lips, according to the brand. The cream, which has a 4.6-star average rating from over 15,000 reviews on Amazon, is infused with vitamin B5 and shea butter to soothe, glycerin to hydrate and centella asiatica (also known as cica) to moisturize, according to the brand. It’s suitable for all skin types and gentle enough to use on babies one week of age and older, according to La Roche-Posay.
The Skinfix face cream, which has a 4.2-star average rating from over 2,900 ratings at Sephora, combines humectants such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin, emollients like squalane and occlusives like shea butter. For the most effective results, apply one to two pumps in the morning and at night on clean and dry skin, according to the brand.
This rich barrier cream not only adds hydration and supports the skin barrier but also helps reduce the appearance of redness with ingredients like colloidal oatmeal, glycerin and niacinamide, according to the brand. NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio uses this to manage her moderate rosacea since it calms redness, bumps and dryness overnight.
You can apply this cream, which is another NBC Select Wellness Award winner, on your face morning and night. You can also use this as a spot treatment for areas that are dry, itchy or rough, according to Kiehl’s.
This Roc day cream combines a moisturizer and an SPF. The fragrance-free formula also has ceramides and prebiotics to help protect sensitive skin, according to Roc. Its formula also hydrates and balances your skin barrier while reducing the appearance of fine lines, dark circles and wrinkles, according to the brand. Apply 15 minutes before sun exposure to help protect your skin from UV rays.
If you’re looking to repair your body’s skin barrier, consider this moisturizer recommended by Keaney. The cream has ceramides to retain moisture and support the skin barrier, shea butter to hydrate and replenish the lipids in the skin barrier, glycerin for moisture and hydration and niacinamide to help calm the skin, according to the brand. You can use this in the morning and at night by massaging the product onto your skin until it fully absorbs, according to La Roche Posay.
If you have mildly irritated skin and are experiencing some acne outbreaks, Suah recommends this overnight repair cream because it’s noncomedogenic. The fragrance-free moisturizer has hyaluronic acid and ceramides to hydrate and support the barrier, Japanese indigo to reduce irritation and mondo grass to support the skin’s microbiome, according to the brand. For the final step in your nighttime skin care routine, apply a pearl-sized amount of this cream nightly to your face, neck and chest, according to Tatcha.
This SkinMedica moisturizer is a lightweight hyaluronic acid serum that should be applied before your daily face cream, according to Keaney. With five different types of hyaluronic acids, this product adds hydration back to the skin, according to the brand. Apply this moisturizer with wet fingertips all over your face, neck and chest, according to SkinMedica.
This fragrance-free cream is recommended by Suah as a great option for those with irritated skin that isn’t overly dry. The moisturizer has panthenol to support the barrier and maintain moisture; at the same time, the madecassoside helps reduce irritation and protects the skin from external aggressors and green tea extract acts as an anti-inflammatory, according to the brand. You can apply the noncomedogenic product in the morning before your sunscreen and at night as the last step in your routine, according to Etude.
This cream has zinc and copper sulfate, lipids and thermal water to soothe, hydrate and repair the skin and can go on both the face and body, according to Chimento. The rich, occlusive cream helps repair and hydrate the skin and protect it from external aggressors, according to Avène. Ginsberg says this cream is very rich and moisturizing. “I have rosacea, so I use it after my weekly at-home chemical exfoliant peel to help soothe my skin,” she says. “It’s a very thick consistency, so I warm it up with my fingers first to make it easier for my skin to absorb. It can feel a little greasy, so I use it at night, but it’s worth the results.”
To help repair her combination skin, especially after using a drying acne treatment, Malin says this thick and creamy balm is the only product that gets rid of her dryness overnight. “I also have sensitive skin, and I find this product particularly soothing when my skin is raw and stinging,” says Malin. A little goes a long way, so you can melt the balm with your fingertips and apply it to your entire face at night, according to Versed.
When shopping for a barrier cream, our experts recommend considering the ingredients and consistency of your product.
Although it’s important to find ingredients that directly target the skin barrier, like emollients, other types of ingredients need to be in your barrier cream to help maintain and support its function, including humectants and occlusives.
The consistency of your barrier cream may depend on your current skin condition and the season that you are living in, according to Keaney.
Everyone can benefit from using a moisturizer that focuses on supporting the skin barrier, according to our experts. However, some may need to use one more than others. Those with sensitive skin may not produce enough ceramides, one of the key essential lipids that create a healthy skin barrier along with cholesterol and fatty acids, says Chimento. Others with skin conditions like rosacea or eczema may also benefit from using one of these moisturizers because it helps fortify their barrier, creating less risk of infection, according to Chimento.
Yes. It is always best to take preventative measures to keep your skin in check and avoid premature aging, infections and rashes, says Chimento. It is also easier to prevent skin barrier disruption than it is to correct it, according to Keaney. If the barrier gets too disrupted, an over-the-counter moisturizer may not be enough and you may need a prescription, Keaney says.
For maximum protection, it is always best to apply your barrier cream twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, according to Chimento. Suah says it’s best to apply it after washing and when the skin is still slightly damp because it locks in moisture.
“I don’t really think you can truly over-hydrate yourself too much,” says Chimento. However, for those who are more oily or have acne-prone skin, too much hydration or occlusion with thick products can cause acne to worsen, according to Chimento.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-lip-balms-rcna179961,We tested over 50 lip balms — here are the best ones for dry lips,SKIN CARE,"Chapped lips aren't just a winter issue: I’m prone to dreadfully dry lips, and even after the colder months are long gone, they can still be painful and cracked.
Over the past few months, I’ve been on the hunt for a moisturizing lip balm that'll help me get rid of dry, chapped lips. NBC Select editors put over 50 lip balms to the test and I compiled the best ones for dry lips based on our reviews and findings. I also spoke to dermatologists about how lip balms work and how to find the best one for you.
Before our testing period, I spoke to four dermatologists about what to consider when selecting a good lip balm. Here’s what they recommend keeping in mind when shopping:
While testing, NBC Select editors kept the following factors in mind:
Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.
I rounded up the best lip balms for dry, chapped lips, all of which were tested and reviewed by NBC Select editors.
Aquaphor is a favorite among NBC Select staff and scored the highest marks during our testing period. It’s also inexpensive, soothing and fragrance-free, says Dr. Annie Chiu, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute. I use this formula, which has occlusives like petrolatum and lanolin, every night before bed, and I wake up with soft, hydrated lips in the morning. Plus, it’s multipurpose: I’ll usually apply it to the back of my hands or around my nose on extra dry days.
It’s also a favorite of Bianca Alvarez, former NBC Select associate reporter, who uses this ointment daily. “If it’s not within arms reach, something is wrong because I never go anywhere without it,” she says. “Nothing works as effectively as this one — it’s truly the most perfect lip product someone can have and is 10 times more moisturizing, softening and healing than any other option out there, in my experience.”
I reach for this budget-friendly lip balm when I’m dealing with severely dry, cracked lips during the harsher winter weather. It’s a medicated lip balm with 1% hydrocortisone, which is a topical steroid that has anti-inflammatory properties. The lip balm does feel slightly tingly on the lips at first due to the hydrocortisone, but that feeling goes away after a few minutes, in my experience. It also has a mix of occlusives and emollients to trap moisture and soften lips, including beeswax, petroleum jelly and mineral oil.
This lip balm was a favorite among several NBC Select editors, who say it’s extremely hydrating and long-lasting. Fernandez says the thick, rounded shape of the balm was easy to apply and the formula kept his lips hydrated and soft for over an hour. NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown agrees: “It’s not too thick or thin; it feels really nourishing and the texture is smooth,” she says. The lip balm has a combination of seed oils, which are emollients that keep lips smooth, hydrated and nourished, experts say.
This is my favorite untinted lip balm to wear daily — it’s perfectly glossy, hydrating and plumping, so I always feel confident when I step out of my house wearing it. It softens and moisturizes my lips even on the driest winter days, and it locks in moisture for over two hours before I need to reapply it. I notice that even when I’m eating or drinking, that moisturizing element sticks (though I do need to reapply it if I still want that glossy, plumping effect). A bonus: The applicator is small and smooth, so it easily glides on my lips without dispensing too much product.
This lip balm is one of the best long-lasting and lightweight lip balms our editors tested. “I love a glossy balm, but usually the trade-off is that the glossier a balm is, the less time it lasts. I was able to wear this one for long periods of time without noticing a drop in hydration,” says NBC Select associate SEO reporter Ashley Morris. “It almost immediately joined my regular rotation of lippies, especially when going to the gym — even while sweating and under a mask, the balm maintained its shine and kept my lips feeling soft and moisturized.”
The lip balm comes in a clear version and 18 tinted formulas. Our editors love using both clear and tinted versions on their own or on top of lipsticks (though the tint does transfer when sipping from a straw or cup, according to testers). “It’s super smooth and has a rich texture, but it feels lightweight when I have it on,” says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin, who puts this lip balm on first thing in the morning. It has a wide, angled applicator that makes applying the lip balm easy and mess-free, according to our reviewers. It is quite thick, so it’s slightly difficult to squeeze out of the tube (though a little goes a long way, editors say).
This non-sticky, sheer Vaseline lip balm is a favorite of NBC Select commerce editor Cory Fernandez, who says it’s extremely hydrating, long-lasting and heals dry, chapped lips instantly. “This is different from just plain vaseline, which I love because it isn’t as greasy,” he says. It’s packaged in a small, 0.6-ounce tin that fits comfortably inside your purse or work bag (though keep in mind you will have to use your fingers to apply it, which some of our editors find to be a nuisance). In addition to the original unscented version, the lip balm comes in three scents: rose (which Fernandez tested and says is strong but pleasant), aloe and cocoa butter. However, it is on the heavier side compared to an average lip balm, so it may be best to use at night before bed, experts say.
This Olehenriksen lip balm was one of the most hydrating and long-lasting options our editors tried — most editors say it left their lips soft and hydrated for at least two hours. “Unlike many others, it doesn’t make my lips chapped when I don’t use it,” says NBC Select commerce editor Lindsay Schneider, who tried the citrus-scented sheer tint version of this lip balm. The formula is very thick, glossy and feels almost like a lip mask, says Schneider — that may be a pro for those with very dry lips, but can feel heavier on the lips than other balms.
In addition to the sheer tint, the lip balm comes in three shades: chocolate brown (hot cocoa scent), mauve pink (strawberry scent) and beige nude (vanilla brown sugar scent). “I love a good chocolate brown shade, so I usually have a good basis of comparison and this one is superb,” says Alvarez. “The tint lasts a long time, and though it’s subtle, you can layer more on for a darker look.”
This is my go-to lip balm, and one I keep in my purse and work bag at all times. The angled applicator is super smooth and easy to squeeze out the product, and though I prefer the sheer, unscented version for everyday wear, the tinted balms give my lips a beautiful, subtle color and smell delicious. It’s also a favorite of Malin’s: “The balm is lightweight, smooth and very moisturizing. I love the raspberry-colored Wild Fig lip balm the most, but I also have the non-tinted one, which I use when I’m not wearing makeup or when my lips are super raw.”
If you’re looking for a lip balm that leaves your lips looking shiny and plump while also protecting them from the sun, this Supergoop option is a favorite among our testers and has the expert-recommended SPF 30 rating. This is one of the only SPF lip balms I’ve tried that feels smooth and doesn’t leave a white cast. It has a blend of shea butter and natural oils to keep lips feeling soft and hydrated for hours after you apply it, according to our editors. The sheer balm comes in two flavors: mint and acai.
This Avene lip balm is more like a cream due to its thick formula, which our reviewers say is good for more intense dryness and cracked lips. “This has a thick viscosity that might not be for everyone but I like this lip balm for especially windy weather,” says NBC Select commerce editor Jordan Bowman. “It does a good job of keeping my lips hydrated during especially dry days.” The lip balm has several expert-recommended hydrating ingredients, like beeswax, shea oil and glycerin, plus it’s great for those with sensitive skin, including infants and children, according to the brand. It’s unscented and unflavored, which is a bonus for sensitive skin.
This lip balm is viral for a reason: it’s hydrating, lightweight and comes in a variety of incredible scents and flavors. “I love that this lip balm is thick and glossy without feeling heavy or sticky on my lips,” says Alvarez. She particularly loves the sheer tints, which are buildable to create a subtle, glossy hue on the lips, says Alvarez. Most of our editors use this lip balm nearly every day — in fact, I have a shade in nearly every purse I own. “It’s slightly oily, which gives it a glossy look, and it’s on the thinner side, so it’s great for everyday wear,” says Malin, who wears it over matte lipstick to add some shine.
If you’re looking for a hydrating lip product that reduces pesky flakes, look no further than Eadem’s Le Chouchou lip balm. It has lactic acid (an exfoliating alpha hydroxy acid) and hibiscus enzymes to buff away dead skin and dryness on your lips. But if you struggle with sensitive lips, there’s no need to worry: Our editors say this lip balm is smoothing yet extremely gentle, and the formula has several emollients to lock in moisture and prevent them from drying out, according to the brand.
Alvarez says the angled metal applicator is one of her favorite parts about this lip balm: “The applicator is similar to an eye cream; it was cooling and easily gilded on my lips, evenly spreading out the product,” she says. Plus, it leaves a glossy finish, and the tints are vibrant and varied, editors say.
The Tower 28 LipSofties are some of our favorite tinted and non-tinted lip balms. It combines emollients like shea butter and jojoba oil to soften, hydrate and prevent moisture from evaporating off of your lips. Malin loves the sheer version and wears it nearly every night before bed (almost like a lip mask). “It moisturizes my lips and either prevents or heals dryness, depending on what shape they’re in,” she says. “It’s quite thick, which is why I apply it before bed.” The tinted LipSofties are some of my favorites to wear out because they leave a beautifully glossy, shiny finish.
I’m not a big fan of the thick, round applicator, which is tough to apply evenly on my lips compared to an angled end. Malin, on the other hand, doesn’t mind it: “I like the round ball shape — it massages the balm onto my lips, which feels great.” If you have sensitive lips, the lip balm has a National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance.
This lip balm feels cooling on my lips thanks to its natural mint flavor, which feels refreshing on cold, windy days when my lips are irritated and cracked. It has a combination of emollients like shea butter and avocado oil to soften and moisturize the lips, which I felt instantly when applying it. Antioxidants like vitamin E and green tea extract help protect lips from environmental damage, while SPF 25 shields lips from harmful UV rays. The lip balm lasts for at least two hours before I need to reapply, in my experience. It’s sheer and comes in additional flavors, including lemon, black tea and grapefruit and ginger.
The thick formula of this lip balm not only works to soothe very dry, chapped lips, but it can also relieve dryness on other parts of your body. “The best way to describe Lanolips’ 101 ointment is the luxe version of Aquaphor. It has a similar consistency and hydration level, and it’s multipurpose — I use it to heal cracked lips and dry cuticles, and sometimes I put it on dry patches on my hands during the colder months,” says Malin. The lip balm has lanolin, which is an occlusive moisturizing oil that comes from sheep’s wool and mimics the skin’s own oils, according to the brand. The tube applicator is easy to use (though be careful not to squeeze out too much), and it’s a great, basic lip balm to use at home or throw in your purse, according to our reviewers. The standard balm does not have a flavor or scent.
The Outset Lip Oasis has sold out multiple times at different retailers since it launched late last year — and that doesn't surprise our editors. ""The Outset's lip balm quickly became one of my favorites after just one day of using it because it's so hydrating, thick and just overall luscious,"" says Alvarez. I love the angled applicator (which looks like what you’d normally find on an eye cream) because it glides well across my lips and doesn’t dispense too much product. Plus, unlike other products labeled as ‘glossy,’ this one doesn’t leave behind a sticky or uncomfortable residue.
This lip balm is great for someone looking to keep it simple: it’s unflavored, unscented and easy to wear everyday on its own or on top of a lipstick. Though our editors found this to be slightly sticky, it managed to hydrate and soften lips better than most other lip balms we tried, plus it leaves a glossy finish without feeling heavy and uncomfortable. The angled applicator feels smooth on the lips and doesn’t dispense too much product at a time, so the lip balm lasts longer and doesn’t get too messy, according to our editors.
Farmacy’s Lip Smoothie has been an editor-favorite lip balm for quite some time — both Alvarez and I have used this product for years before testing. The silky, glossy texture of this lip balm is fantastic: It’s incredibly lightweight and has a glossy shine, so you can use this both day and night without it feeling heavy or sticky, editors say.
Since it’s not the easiest lip balm to apply throughout the day (I have to apply it with my fingers, which is not my favorite), I primarily use this as a nighttime lip mask when I feel extra chapped and flaky. I notice the hydration lasts throughout the night, and my lips feel soft and moisturized by morning. However, Alvarez prefers the tub packaging: “While the tube is more hygienic, I like this because I can really use all of the product before discarding the packaging,” she says. The lip balm comes in four delicious scents and flavors: apple, pear kiwi, honey vanilla and mango.
This lip balm uses emollients like shea butter, avocado oil and coconut oil. It delivers SPF 30 broad-spectrum protection using three key chemical sunscreen ingredients: avobenzone, octisalate and octocrylene. Our editors love that this lip balm’s sun protection is water-resistant (for up to 80 minutes, according to the brand), plus it doesn’t leave a white tint on their lips and is one of the more affordable options they tried. They also called out the plastic screw-on lid, which feels secure in their bags. Though it may be a bit stiff and waxy when you first apply it, it does nicely coat the lips and the hydrating benefits last for hours, according to our testers. However, don’t expect this lip balm to heal severe dryness or cracks, editors say.
L’Occitane’s lip balm has shea butter, beeswax, seed oils and vitamin E to moisturize and soften lips. This was a favorite among our editors because of its lightweight, ultra-hydrating formula. “This has a slightly thinner consistency than other lip balms I’ve tried, making it more lightweight — I barely notice the flavor or scent, and I feel it starts moisturizing my lips as I put it on,” says Malin. “Because it’s on the thinner side, it’s not as transfer-proof compared to other thicker lip balms I tried, but I don’t mind and honestly don’t have to reapply super often since it’s so intensely moisturizing.”
This Topicals lip balm is very thick, glossy and somewhat sticky, but provides a good amount of hydration on those harsher winter days, according to our testers. “Whenever I apply this balm, chapped lips and dryness are no longer an issue. Plus, it has a stimulating, tingly sensation that I enjoy,” says Morris. The lip balm has a combination of hyaluronic acid, ceramides, rice bran wax and glycerin to seal in hydration and soften the lips.
Few brands do tinted lip balm better than Fresh. If you can get past the hefty price tag, the brand’s lip balm is both hydrating and lightweight, plus has a wide shade range, including light pinks, dark mauves, corals and deep browns, to fit various skin tones. The formula applies smoothly on the lips, and a little goes a very long way, according to our testers. Plus, it has a thick, rounded top that’s easy to swipe on and go. The packaging is another bonus: It has a plastic cover that screws into place, so you don’t have to worry about it accidentally popping open in your bag.
Evolvetogether’s lip balm is simplistic and straightforward, down to its plant-based ingredients and minimalist, biodegradable packaging. Our editors found this lip balm to be incredibly effective: It has a combination of coconut oil, shea butter and jojoba seed oil to hydrate and soften lips, plus a calming, soft herbal scent of chamomile, lavender and vanilla. Best yet, its buttery texture feels smooth and silky on the lips. I keep this lip balm on my desk at all times so I can apply and reapply it throughout the work day. It hydrates my lips for hours, too, so the lip balm has lasted me for months even with nearly everyday use.
Smith’s Rosebud Salve comes in a tin with a screw-on cap, so it’s great to throw in a purse or travel bag. It’s a favorite of NBC Select commerce social editor Sadhana Daruvuri, who has used this lip balm for years. “It’s the only thing that actually keeps my lips hydrated for an extended period of time,” she says. “I love how it smells and the way it glides onto my lips so easily. The tin it comes in is also super cute, which is a nice bonus.” It’s glossy, non-sticky and you can use it to heal dry areas and minor burns on other parts of your body, including elbows, knees and hands.
This lip repair treatment is more like a cream than a traditional lip balm, and one I reach for when my lips are especially dry and irritated. I apply this one at night before bed, and it not only heals my flaky, chapped lips in the winter, but it also soothes the irritated skin on the sides of my mouth. It doesn’t apply as a typical lip balm, either — you pump the product out as you would a cream for your face or hands, and usee your finger to apply it since it doesn’t have a traditional applicator. It also takes a bit for the white cream to absorb into your lips; but once it does, it relieves any dryness and tightness in seconds. It has vitamin E (a natural antioxidant), allantoin (to reduce irritation) and hyaluronic acid (to lock in moisture).
It goes without saying that hydrating ingredients play a critical role in how effective a lip balm is at soothing and healing dry lips. If you’re looking to remedy dry, chapped lips with a lip balm, experts say the following hydrating ingredients are most important:
Generally, look for glossy formulas, which tend to leave a thick, shiny finish and usually feel more hydrating and moisturizing. “Glossy lip balms typically contain emollients that will moisturize the lips,” says Dr. Jeriel Weitz, a board-certified dermatologist at Diane Walder Dermatology. “While matte lip balms can also contain moisturizing ingredients, they may also have drying ingredients that absorb excess oil and moisture, thus creating the matte finish.”
Just like the rest of your skin, your lips can get sunburnt, causing redness, tenderness and blistering. It’s important to protect your lips from harmful UV rays just like any part of your body. Not only can UV exposure cause your lips to be more chapped, these harmful rays can cause skin cancer on your lips, as well as actinic cheilitis, a precancerous condition (also known as “sailor’s lip”) that creates rough, scaly patches on the skin, says Deignan. It’s important to look for lip balms that have SPF to physically block UV rays.
Many SPF lip balms have zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which are mineral sunscreen ingredients that are great for sensitive skin, or chemical actives like avobenzone and octisalate, which don’t usually leave a white tint, experts say. “Zinc oxide is especially great as a mineral ingredient, as with its ability to block UVB rays on top of the UVA rays, which helps prevent precancerous conditions and skin cancers including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma,” says DeRosa.
While most lip balms are supposed to make your lips feel and look more hydrated, that may be short-lived — and others can even have the opposite effect. If you have dry, cracked lips, avoid lip balms with fragrances and dyes, which can further irritate your lips, says Weitz. Ingredients in lip balms that claim to be “plumping,” commonly cinnamon and peppermint, can irritate your lips to create a fuller effect.
Menthol, phenol and camphor, which are common ingredients in medicated lip balms, are cooling agents and act as mild anesthetics to soothe irritated lips. However, they actually tend to dry out the lips, says DeRosa. “Alcohol, like phenol and menthol to a lesser degree, while not dangerous per se, can be associated with excessive dryness of the lips on some occasions,” she says. “[These ingredients] can feel soothing at first, but ultimately can be irritating,” says Deignan.
Keep in mind when a lip balm has only humectants, which draw moisture to your lips, you’ll likely only get short-term relief before your lips feel dry again, experts say. Consider lip balms with a combination of humectants, emollients and occlusive ingredients.
There are a few different factors that cause chapped lips, according to experts.
As long as you’re not using a lip balm that has drying ingredients, you can reapply your lip balm as often as you want, experts say. In terms of lip balms with SPF, you should apply it before you leave the house and reapply every two hours when you’re outdoors or exposed to the sun, even when you’re indoors near a window or driving in a car, says DeRosa.
“Don’t forget that, when you use your lips more often, such as kissing, eating/drinking, sweating or swimming, reapply more frequently than every two hours,” she says.

Tinted lip balms can help give your lips some color while also moisturizing and protecting them. “The tints do not generally make a lip balm less effective, but you just have to keep in mind that having a tinted balm on your lips does not necessarily mean that it protects your lips from damaging UVA and UVB sun rays,” says DeRosa. Try to avoid synthetic dyes and opt for iron oxides, plant-based colorants or fruit extracts to avoid irritation, says Deignan.
Below, experts I spoke to share a few tips for avoiding dry, chapped lips all year-round:
At NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience. We also take steps to ensure all expert advice and recommendations are made independently and without undisclosed financial conflicts of interest.
I’m an updates editor at NBC Select, where I’ve been writing about skin care since 2021, including treatments for rosacea, keratosis pilaris and scars. For this article, I spoke to four dermatologists to determine what to look for in a lip balm and how to prevent chapped lips. I also gathered popular and highly rated lip balms based on their guidance for our NBC Select editors to test using specific methodology. Once the testing period was complete, I rounded up the best lip balms that healed dry lips based on our editors’ feedback.",Unknown,Unknown
https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-skin-care-routine-rcna105133,How to layer your skin care products in the right order,SKIN CARE,"Skin care — and specifically the art of building a skin care routine — can be a form of self-care. But with hundreds of products on the market, figuring out the correct way to layer serums, moisturizers and eye creams can be tricky. To help you determine the correct order to apply your products for both morning and night, I spoke to five dermatologists, plus got their recommendations for the best items in each category.
SKIP AHEAD How to build a skin care routine | Morning skin care routine | Nighttime skin care routine | How to shop for skin care products | Why trust NBC Select?
When building a skin care routine, the general rule of thumb is to go from lightest to heaviest (in consistency), gradually layering on heavier products, like creams and lotions, as you go. This is because the skin absorbs lightweight products quickly, allowing you to layer on more products easily, according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Hadley King.
Below, I’m outlining dermatologist-recommended steps to creating an effective skin care routine along with their recommendations for each step. Even though experts I spoke to say that piling on extra products or following an extensive, multistep skin care routine does not actually yield more benefits, we got their insight on some optional steps, including how to incorporate devices like an LED mask or gua sha.

For many people, your morning routine will look similar to your nighttime routine. However, certain products, like face sunscreen, are most beneficial in the morning because they set you up for your day by protecting you from environmental factors.
In the morning, experts recommend using a cleanser, followed by a serum, moisturizer and sunscreen — in that order. When it comes to adding toners or eye creams to your morning routine, you can incorporate them if you choose, but they won’t really enhance the efficacy of a basic skin care routine in a major way, according to our experts. I’ll go into more detail on each step and what to know about the best products, below.
Facial cleansers are a crucial first step in any morning routine; they can remove dirt, oil and debris that your skin may have collected overnight — which isn’t possible with just a splash of water, says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Michelle Henry. By cleansing your skin, you’re also priming it so that it can absorb future products, says Henry.
When it comes to choosing the right cleanser for your skin, you’ll want to consider a formula’s consistency:
This creamy, hydrating formula does exactly what you’d want a cleanser to do: remove debris and excess oils from your skin, according to Woolery-Lloyd. Ingredients like niacinamide and glycerin help reinforce your skin barrier’s moisture levels, according to the brand. Protecting the skin barrier is especially key during the cleansing step because it protects your skin from losing too much water, while also keeping the barrier strong to defend against allergens in the air, says Woolery-Lloyd. It’s suitable for most skin types since it’s hypoallergenic, fragrance-free and noncomedogenic, so it shouldn’t cause unwanted breakouts or clog pores, according to the brand.
The salicylic acid in this oil-free facial cleanser makes it a great option for oily and acne-prone skin, says Woolery-Lloyd. (Salicylic acid is a key ingredient that helps treat and prevent breakouts.) Aside from helping with acne, it also unclogs pores and removes any excessive oil and dirt that has built up overnight.
I use this fragrance-free cleanser both morning and night, and I find that it’s great for dry, eczema-prone and sensitive skin. The cleanser has ceramides to help maintain the skin’s natural barrier and hyaluronic acid to add moisture, according to the brand. It’s also non-foaming, which helps prevent the skin from drying out, experts told us.
After cleansing, the next (optional) step is to add in a toner or essence. Toners are liquids with a high water content that typically have humectants (to hydrate the skin) along with active ingredients like vitamin C (to brighten and protect the skin) and beta hydroxy acids, like salicylic acid, (to help exfoliate), according to King. They help complete the cleansing process and refresh your skin.
Essences are similar to toners because they’re equally as lightweight, however they primarily focus on hydrating and plumping the skin using ingredients like hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, ceramides and squalane, according to experts in our guide to the best facial essences.
To apply, you can either pour some toner on a cotton pad and tap that into your face, or you can pat a toner or essence directly onto your skin using your fingertips. After applying, you should not wash your face again like you would with a cleanser. Toners and essences will absorb quickly and prep the skin for future products.
All of this is to say that experts do not consider this step a necessity. If you want to use one and have “normal” skin, consider using a formula with antioxidants; if you have dry or sensitive skin you may want to use a hydrating and gentle toner instead. Those with acne-prone or oily skin should opt for an exfoliating toner with ingredients like salicylic acid, glycolic acid or lactic acid since these chemical exfoliants penetrate the skin and remove any debris buildup, says Woolery-Lloyd. Though, you shouldn’t use an exfoliating formula twice a day — it can dry out your skin and cause irritation, according to experts I spoke with.
This expert-recommended toner is great for dry and sensitive skin types because it has ceramides that help hydrate, repair and support the skin barrier. It also has white leaf tea, which is rich in amino acids, to soothe your skin, according to the brand.
Another expert-recommended toner is this milky option from Paula’s Choice. It has hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and primrose oil to combat dryness and retain moisture. It’s especially helpful after washing your face since it continues cleansing the skin, while also adding back in lost moisture from the previous step. It also has antioxidants to fight external aggressors like UV light and protect the skin from environmental damage, according to the brand.
After cleansing, experts recommend applying a serum. Serums are lightweight liquids that typically have high concentrations of specific ingredients to help your skin function in different ways (depending on the ingredient). For example, you may find serums with high concentrations of hyaluronic acid for hydration, niacinamide for even tone and texture, vitamin C for protection and brightening or vitamin E for protection and moisture.
Certain ingredients, like vitamin C, are best in the morning, because of how they work with other ingredients to set you up for the day ahead of you. (Vitamin C helps protect the skin from free radicals, but it also helps your sunscreen perform better, according to Woolery-Lloyd.)
You’ll want to apply your serum by gently spreading it across your face in a patting motion or you can massage it very gently. They typically have a lightweight texture that spreads easily and absorbs quickly, says King.
This vitamin C serum, which comes recommended by Woolery-Lloyd, works to restore the skin barrier and hydrate your skin. Vitamin C also protects the skin from environmental aggressors like pollution, helps with brightening and evening discoloration, and improves collagen production, experts say. It’s fragrance-free, noncomedogenic and is suitable for all skin types.
This vitamin B3 serum, also known as niacinamide, improves the tone and texture of the skin as well as supports the skin barrier and prevents water loss, according to our experts. The serum, which has a 4.7-star average rating from over 900 reviews at Sephora, is suitable for various skin concerns, including fine lines and hyperpigmentation. Apply it to your face, neck and décolleté after cleansing and prepping the skin, according to the brand.
Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Karen Kagha recommends this fast-absorbing serum because it protects, firms and brightens the skin. It has both vitamins C and E, and ferulic acid, which brightens the skin, protects it from outside aggressors and neutralizes free radicals (molecules that damage the skin by weakening it), according to the brand.
Eye creams are moisturizers made specifically for the eye area that help brighten, depuff or smooth fine lines, experts say. They typically have a lighter consistency than moisturizers, so you should apply them before a day cream or SPF.
The best way to apply an eye cream is to gently pat the product around the eye from the innermost to the outermost areas. When done right, it helps moisturize the thinnest and most delicate part of your skin, though my experts say it’s not a necessity when building out a morning skin care routine.
This NBC Select-staff favorite eye cream has a plant-based retinol alternative to smooth the under-eye area. Compared to traditional retinol, this alternative is safe for sun exposure — so you can use it during your morning routine — and it also has a cooling tip to help aid in depuffing the area, according to the brand. It has a 4.3-star average rating from over 890 reviews at Sephora.
This is one of my favorite hydrating eye creams to use in the morning because it has a cooling ceramic tip that reduces any puffiness I wake up to. The tip also helps get every crevice of my under eye coated in the gel mess-free.
Next up: moisturizers. They help lock in all the products you previously applied and keep the skin barrier healthy by hydrating it, says King. Moisturizers come in different forms including lotions, creams, gels and ointments; daytime moisturizers are typically lighter in weight than evening ones, experts say.
If you have dry skin, you tend to lack sebum (an oily substance our skin produces). That’s why a thicker cream may be your best option since they are typically oil-based and can make up for any lack of natural oils, says Woolery-Lloyd. People with oily and acne-prone skin may want to consider a gel moisturizer since it’s water-based and will draw moisture to your skin without adding more oil or having the oil sit on top of the face.
Moisturizers usually have one or a combination of the following moisturizing groups, which you’ll often see listed on bottles: humectants, emollients and occlusives. Humectants hydrate the skin, emollients support the skin barrier and occlusives lock in moisture, says King.
This lightweight cream, which comes recommended by Woolery-Lloyd, has ceramides, niacinamide, glycerin and thermal water, which all help hydrate and moisturize the skin, according to the brand. Thermal water is especially good for those who have sensitive skin, including eczema, and a more delicate skin barrier, says Woolery-Lloyd.
This lightweight Senté facial moisturizer is a current favorite of Kagha’s. A great option for sensitive skin, this formula not only hydrates the skin, but the green tea extract in it also helps calm any irritation and reduce redness, according to the brand.
This NBC Select staff-favorite gel cream ranked in our top 10 from over 100 moisturizers we tested because of its lightweight, gentle and calming the formula. It works for all skin types, including acne-prone, dry and sensitive skin, according to NBC Select staff who tried this moisturizer. In my experience, this cream provides the same amount of hydration as a thick, rich cream, but without feeling heavy on the skin or clogging pores.
Sunscreen should be the final step in your morning skin care routine to protect your skin against harmful UVA and UVB rays that can cause cancer. (UVA rays can prematurely age your skin via wrinkles and dark spots, while UVB rays can cause sunburns, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association.)
Face sunscreens come in mineral or chemical form — one isn’t “better” than the other and choosing one comes down to a matter of personal preference, according to my experts. Mineral sunscreens sit on the surface of the skin and reflect UV rays, while chemical sunscreens absorb and filter out UV light.
You’ll also want to make sure to pick a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 that has broad-spectrum protection (which protects you against both UVA and UVB rays). Apply a nickel-sized dollop to the face in the morning before putting on makeup, says King.
This broad-spectrum SPF is suitable for all skin types and is a favorite among dermatologists, says Woolery-Lloyd. The sunscreen has two active ingredients that combine the benefits of both chemical and mineral sunscreens: titanium oxide, which you’ll typically see in mineral sunscreen, and octinoxate, which is one of six chemical filters.
The combination creates a cosmetically elegant formula that doesn’t leave behind a white cast (which is common with chemical-only sunscreens) and helps reflect both UVA and UVB rays, according to EltaMD. The formula also has niacinamide to help even tone and texture, and it can reduce redness and discoloration in people with skin conditions like rosacea, according to the brand. If you are worried about a white cast, this formula also comes in a tinted version.
This tinted sunscreen is suitable for all skin types and complexions including dark skin tones, according to Henry. It protects the skin from UV exposure and also hydrates it with ingredients like vitamin E, a humectant that absorbs water, and dimethicone, an emollient that retains water, says Henry. This broad-spectrum formula has SPF 50 and is water-resistant for 40 minutes.
The goal of a nighttime skin care routine is to clean your skin from any product or debris that piles up throughout the day and to add hydration that will last you through the night. Nighttime routines also help promote cell turnover (which replaces dead skin cells with healthy ones) and stimulate collagen production (to maintain the structure of your skin by keeping it firm), according to Henry.
At night, experts recommend including cleanser, serum, eye cream and moisturizer, which is very similar to an ideal morning routine, minus the SPF application. You can also add in a toner, acne treatment, face oil, and/or special devices or masks if you’re looking to enhance your routine. However, the more products you add in, the more risk there is for irritation, says Kagha.
Cleansers play a major role at night: They remove makeup, sunscreen, dirt, oil and products that have accumulated throughout the day from your face and neck, leaving your skin clean. At night, you may even want to double cleanse. That’s the process of washing your face twice — first with an oil-based cleanser, followed by a water-based cleanser. The oil-based cleanser breaks down products on the surface of your skin, including makeup and sunscreen, while the water-based cleanser removes leftover residue, pollutants, dirt, debris and excess oil, according to King.
Cleansers come in different formulations, including liquids, bars and balms. If you use a medicated cleanser in the morning, you’ll want to consider a gentler alternative (one that is free of exfoliating or drying ingredients) at night because it may be too harsh on your skin, according to experts.
Farmacy makes some of our favorite cleansing balms including an NBC Select Wellness Award winner and this NBC Select-staff favorite — Farmacy Green Clean Cleansing Balm. Dr. Sejal Shah, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of SmarterSkin Dermatology in New York City, recommends this option for those with normal to oily skin types. The balm includes papaya enzymes to gently exfoliate, glycerin to hydrate the skin and turmeric extract to soothe it. It also removes makeup while cleansing the skin, making it a great nighttime product.
This cleanser comes recommended by experts in our guide to the best cleansers for dry skin because it’s gentle, moisturizing and free of common irritants. Reviewers say it helps soothe the skin and ease any dryness they experience, regardless of whether or not it’s a result of naturally dry, irritated skin or medications that cause excessive dryness.
This foaming face wash for oily and acne-prone skin uses benzoyl peroxide to treat acne, according to Woolery-Lloyd. Since this product has the highest concentration of benzoyl peroxide available without a prescription, you should only use it once a day — otherwise, it can be drying or irritating. To combat these concerns, the formula also has ingredients like glycerin, which is a hydrating humectant, according to the brand.
If you are looking to further hydrate or exfoliate your skin, you may want to consider a toner. Experts say this is a completely optional step, but it is great for providing your skin with another round of ingredients to help cleanse and prep the skin for future steps. If you decide to use an exfoliating toner in the morning, consider a hydrating essence at night and vice versa.
This toner is suitable for all skin types including sensitive skin. The main ingredient is oats, which are very soothing and also offer anti-inflammatory benefits, according to Woolery-Lloyd. Plus, it has honey, which is a humectant with antioxidants to moisturize the skin, according to the brand. After drying your face, pat this milky toner into your skin with your fingers (or via a cotton pad) and let it seep into your skin.
This salicylic acid toner helps exfoliate the skin, reduce excess oil and minimize the appearance of blackheads and pores, according to the brand. To combat some of the dryness that using this may cause, it also has grape and rose water in its formula to calm irritation and hydrate the skin, according to Caudalie.
Serums are especially great to use at night since they’re reparative and restorative, says Henry. Common nighttime formulas have hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin or chemical exfoliants, like glycolic and lactic acid, to penetrate your pores, remove dead skin cells and unclog pores, according to my experts.
Other popular serum formulas have retinol, which can minimize the appearance of fine lines and increase collagen production. However, retinol is highly irritating when mixed with other actives, so our experts recommend avoiding it when also applying vitamin C, glycolic or lactic acid. Overall, retinols thrive at night because they benefit from the growth environment in which our bodies relax, says Henry. It also increases your chances of sun damage and sunburn, which is why it’s typically recommended for nighttime use.
If you want your retinol in serum form, this La Roche-Posay formula is recommended by Kagha. Not only does it use retinol to combat fine lines, but it also has hyaluronic acid for hydration and niacinamide to help reduce any potential irritation, according to the brand. Apply it to your face once or twice a week at first and gradually increase your usage.
To combat any dryness, consider this hydrating serum that is suitable for all skin types and is recommended by Kagha. It combines its namesake ingredient with glycerin and thermal water to give your skin some needed moisture, according to La-Roche Posay. Apply three to four drops to your face and neck, according to the brand.
One of the main functions of eye creams is to hydrate the delicate under-eye area. Since our bodies tend to lose more moisture at night, finding an eye cream to help retain and add moisture to that area is important, according to Woolery-Lloyd.
This formula, which has hydrating ingredients, including hyaluronic acid, ceramides and niacinamide, is suitable for all skin types, including those with eczema. Apply small dots around the eye and pat until fully absorbed — it should help reduce puffiness and dark circles, according to the brand.
If you want to combine a retinol and an eye cream, this RoC cream is a great option, says Woolery-Lloyd. The retinol works to smooth fine lines, while the niacinamide helps hydrate and improve the tone and texture of your skin. You can also use this in conjunction with a retinol serum because these products will generally affect different areas of your face. You can apply the serum on the face (avoiding the eyes) while the eye cream goes directly on the under-eye area, according to King. If you want to use a retinol eye cream and vitamin C serum, apply the antioxidant serum in the morning and the retinol at night so you can still use both products without using them at the same time and risking irritation, says King.
If you’re currently dealing with a breakout or are looking to prevent a future one from occurring, you may want to consider an acne treatment, experts say. Below, I share an over-the-counter option that may help.
This NBC Select Wellness Award-winning acne treatment uses a retinoid to target common concerns like breakouts and improve skin texture, according to Kagha. The main ingredient is adapalene, which helps treat and prevent acne and with the tone and texture of your skin, according to the brand. Apply the gel in a singular thin layer once a day for the best results, according to Differin.
This overnight spot treatment, which has a 4.5-star average rating from over 80,800 reviews on Amazon, has salicylic acid to decongest pores, azelaic acid to help even skin tone (especially hyperpigmentation from acne scars) and niacinamide to minimize the appearance of pores, according to the brand. Just apply a small amount directly on the area you want to target.
This overnight spot treatment has three key ingredients in its formula, including salicylic acid to decongest pores, azelaic acid to help even skin tone (especially hyperpigmentation from acne scars) and niacinamide to minimize the appearance of pores. All you have to do is apply a small amount directly on the area you want to target, according to the brand.
Moisturizers, which prevent water loss and lock in the products from your previous steps, should be one of the last steps of your nighttime skin care routine. You can use the same moisturizer day and night, though nighttime-specific options tend to have a thicker consistency (which is ideal since that’s when skin loses the most water), according to King.
This fragrance-free face cream is recommended by Henry. With ingredients like squalane and glycerin, it helps your skin retain moisture, and hydrates and softens it, according to the brand. Plus, it’s free of mineral oils, which often clog pores.
This moisturizer has all the components of a good moisturizer, says King. Because it’s a cream, it will have a thicker consistency than a lotion, which is why it’s a great option for nighttime. The Magic Night Cream has retinol, vitamin E and vitamin C in it to moisturize and strengthen the skin. Once you run out, you can pop in the refill container to continue your daily usage.
Face oils, as their name implies, are oil-based skin care products in liquid form that can add hydration and soften the skin overnight, says Woolery-Lloyd. Although the general rule of thumb is to apply skin care products from lightest consistency to heaviest, face oils are an exception. Despite oils feeling lighter in consistency than a moisturizer, they are strong enough to penetrate face creams; it’s also hard for products to break through them — which is why you should apply them last, according to experts.
Face oils work for a variety of skin types, including sensitive skin since specific oils (like sunflower seed oil) can help improve the skin barrier and decrease irritation, according to Woolery-Lloyd. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, however, you may want to be cautious incorporating one into your skin care routine because it could potentially lead to acne flares, says Henry.
If you’re concerned about breaking out from a face oil, look for noncomedogenic formulas that won’t clog pores.
This noncomedogenic formula has 16 different oils, one of which is sunflower oil, which Woolery-Lloyd recommends because of how hydrating it is and how much it decreases irritation. The best way to apply this facial oil is to smooth it over the skin as the very last step of your routine or add one to two drops into your nighttime moisturizer, according to Summer Fridays.
With peptides to strengthen the skin’s elasticity, oil for moisture and ceramides for hydration, this face oil is suitable for all skin types, including oily skin, according to Olehenriksen. When using it at night, apply five to six drops to the skin by pressing it into the face and neck, according to the brand. (You can also use this in the morning — just add a few drops to your moisturizer prior to putting on makeup or SPF.)
This antioxidant-rich face oil, which comes recommended by experts in our guide to the best face oils, can reduce inflammation caused by rosacea, acne, environmental conditions and more while also protecting it from daily damage. In addition to this, it also focuses on hydrating the skin and improving radiance by combatting dull, dry skin, according to the brand.
When creating a skin care routine, experts recommend keeping the following in mind:
Begin by taking your skin type into consideration when shopping. If you have dry skin, look for products that will add and lock in moisture to your skin. If you have sensitive skin or conditions like rosacea and eczema, avoid common irritants like fragrances and dyes. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, consider noncomedogenic products that won’t clog your pores or cause unwanted breakouts.
Your routine steps will likely stay the same no matter what issue you’re trying to resolve, though the products you use in each step will vary. If you’re looking to treat hyperpigmentation or dark spots, look for ingredients with brightening properties like vitamin C. To combat dryness, consider formulas with hyaluronic acid and ceramides. For those wanting to reduce the appearance of fine lines, try products with retinol or retinol alternatives depending on your skin’s sensitivity. If you’re looking to even tone and texture, you might want to choose a product with niacinamide or use a chemical exfoliant.
Experts recommend following the less is more rule. ""It's more important to invest your time and energy into products that have efficacy than to run the risk of irritation with an elaborate skin care routine,"" says Woolery-Lloyd.
Unless your dermatologist recommends it, you don't need an eight to 10-step skin care routine. Experts generally co nsider toners, eye creams and face oils optional.
It depends. Neck creams are specifically made to target the neck area, and while you can use a facial moisturizer or body lotion, they won’t have the specific concentration of ingredients, like retinol, for example, that will target concerns like crepey skin. That’s why dermatologists recommend applying a proper neck cream after finishing your facial skin care routine. Apply in an upward motion from your decollete to your neck, according to experts.
Exfoliating involves removing dead skin cells, oil and debris from the skin with either a chemical or physical product, according to Henry. Physical exfoliants are abrasive materials or tools that target the surface of your skin, like a cleansing brush or washcloth, while chemical exfoliants are products you apply, like face washes and toners, that rely on alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) or beta hydroxy acids (BHA) to penetrate and unclog pores.
Experts prefer chemical exfoliants rather than physical exfoliants because it’s safer for the skin since it doesn’t lead to over-scrubbing and tends to be more gentle overall, says Kagha. Since exfoliating can be quite harsh and irritating on your skin, they also recommend incorporating these products slowly. Once you’ve built up a tolerance, you can begin exfoliating more often. Weekly usage will vary depending on skin type but usually ranges from one to three times a week, according to experts.
Face masks, which serve different purposes depending on their ingredients, are an optional step you can take to add hydration, calm the skin or cleanse it throughout the week, according to Kagha.
Typically, you will apply a face mask after cleansing, but before you apply any other products. Think of it as step one and a half in your nighttime routine since they usually require a clean, dry face.
Currently, there are various skin care devices on the market that target acne, inflammation and other concerns — though they are not necessary, according to experts. If you plan to use one as an added step, here’s what to know:

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-eczema-lotions-ncna1298695,The best lotions for eczema relief,SKIN CARE,"Since I was born, I’ve had eczema all over my body and face. Eczema, a form of dermatitis, is a common skin concern affecting roughly 31 million people in the U.S. alone — about 10% of the population, according to the National Eczema Association (NEA). The condition can be anywhere from mild to severe, but it can be cumbersome trying to navigate ways to soothe the itchy, dry skin it causes. Trust me, my entire journey throughout these past 23 years has been full of trial and error to see which moisturizers can improve my eczema and minimize its effects.
I spoke to dermatologists to learn all about this condition, what causes it and, most importantly, what you should look for in a lotion. I also rounded up expert-recommended eczema lotions that can help, as well as ones I use on my own skin.

I found the best lotions safe for eczema-prone skin. Each product (except for the Eucerin treatment) has the National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance. Below, I included several options I’ve tested and regularly use to treat my eczema. Some of the products were recommended by experts, while others were chosen based on expert advice about what to look for.
This lotion from Cerave is a favorite among my experts because it has ceramides, which play a key role in protecting the skin barrier. “This lotion has a unique blend of high-quality moisturizing agents, including ceramides, hyaluronic acid and glycerin,” says Dr. Viktoryia Kazlouskaya, a dermatologist at Khrom Dermatology.
Cerave’s lotion is also great for those with an active lifestyle or worry about their pores clogging. I use this lotion on my face and body every morning during the hot summer months, as well as days when I plan on going to the gym. It’s so lightweight that it’s not melting off my face but still gets the job done by repairing and maintaining my skin without causing irritation or worsening it.
Key ingredients: Ceramides and hyaluronic acid | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes | Fragrance-free: Yes
This Eucerin cream works to soothe irritated skin and provides a cooling sensation, which can help calm ongoing flare-ups, says Kazlouskaya. Suitable for all eczema-prone skin types, this rich and cooling option is also safe for children and babies aged 3 months and older, according to Eucerin.
Key ingredients: Colloidal oatmeal, ceramides and licorice root extract | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: n/a | Fragrance-free: Yes
This cream comes recommended by Kazlouskay because it has eczema-soothing ingredients like avena sativa, or oat kernel extract, which is an occlusive ingredient (meaning it helps the skin hold onto moisture). The hero ingredient also plumps up the skin and restores its natural barrier, according to Dr. Elaine Kung, a board-certified dermatologist in New York. Plus, the cream reduces any dryness and redness, according to the brand.
Key ingredients: Colloidal oatmeal and ceramides | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes | Fragrance-free: Yes
To treat my dry, sensitive and eczema-prone skin, I apply this thick moisturizer every day on my face and body. My skin instantly feels more moisturized, appears less dull and all dry, itchy patches disappear.
“Often when I don’t know what skin care products may be irritating my patients, I advise them to stop using everything they have at home and substitute it with the Vanicream line of products until we can figure out what their irritants are,” says Kung. This is because Vanicream products, including this cream, are free of dyes, parabens and formaldehyde releasers. So, if you’re looking for something to re-introduce hydration back into your skin without further aggravating it, this is a gentle option, says Kung.
Key ingredients: Water, petrolatum and sorbitol | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes | Fragrance-free: Yes
This non-greasy balm has ceramides and vitamin C and is great for soothing itchy skin on both your face and body throughout the day, says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Gabriela Soza. “It also helps repair the skin barrier with a combination of humectants and occlusive moisturizers,” she says. Unlike other balms that tend to come in a tub, this one has a pump for easy and mess-free application.
Key ingredients: Glycerin and ceramides | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes | Fragrance-free: Yes
Kazlouskaya is a fan of Cetaphil’s moisturizer because it contains colloidal oatmeal, which restores the skin’s moisture barrier and reduces the uncomfortable side effects of flare-ups. The formula is hypoallergenic and is also free of parabens and steroids, according to Cetaphil.
Key ingredients: Colloidal oatmeal, Glycerin, hyaluronic acid and ceramides | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes | Fragrance-free: Yes
This formula is so gentle that it’s safe for newborn skin, says Soza. “As a mother, this is huge and what I use to hydrate my baby’s eczema-prone skin,” she says. The pump keeps the balm sterile as you use it, so it doesn’t need preservatives to prolong its shelf life, according to the brand. This is great for those with sensitive skin: Preservatives in skin care products can sometimes trigger allergic contact dermatitis, says Soza.
Key ingredients: Avène thermal spring water, glycerin, cer-omega and I-modulia | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes | Fragrance-free: Yes
This thick, non-greasy formula is fit for newborns and adults alike, according to the brand. It’s free of common eczema irritants like sulfates, dyes and parabens, and uses colloidal oatmeal and prebiotic moisturizers to strengthen the skin barrier and minimize itchiness and dryness, according to Dove. It’s also highly rated, with a 4.7-star average rating from over 3,200 reviews on Amazon.
Key ingredients: Colloidal oatmeal, glycerin and shea butter | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes | Fragrance-free: Yes
This moisturizer comes recommended by Kazlouskaya and Mamina because of its hydrating combination of ingredients. One of the many ingredients in the formula is thermal water, which is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, says Mamina. You can use this cream on both your face and body, and it’s suitable for everyone of all ages, including those as young as two weeks old, says Mamina.
Key ingredients: La Roche-Posay thermal spring water, ceramides, shea butter, niacinamide and glycerin | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes | Fragrance-free: Yes
This Theraplex option has a combination of petrolatum and colloidal oatmeal and, as a whole, has a minimal number of ingredients, making it great for those with very sensitive skin, says Mamina. The cream, which is designed for eczema, dry skin and dermatitis, protects the skin barrier, soothes the skin and hydrates it all at once, according to the brand.
Key ingredients: Petrolatum, cyclomethicone, ozokerite wax and colloidal oatmeal | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes | Fragrance-free: Yes
This balm is a favorite among Soza’s patients because of its soothing ingredients like colloidal oatmeal. The thick balm helps moisturize your skin throughout the night while also relieving itchiness, according to the brand. You can also keep your tub in the fridge because the cooling effect will help soothe irritated and itchy skin, says Soza.
Key ingredients: Colloidal oatmeal, glycerin and ceramides | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes | Fragrance-free: Yes
If you’re looking for a dual-purpose moisturizer for the face and body, consider this option recommended by Kazlouskaya. This cream has Endolysin SA, which is “a small protein that fights ‘bad’ bacteria on the skin and balances the microbiome, helping to reduce itching in patients with eczema,” says Kazlouskaya.
Key ingredients: Glycerin, petrolatum, mineral oil and colloidal oatmeal | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes | Fragrance-free: Yes
This balm moisturizes and soothes irritated, chafed, cracked and dry skin, and protects it from further irritation with the help of hydrating ingredients like panthenol, glycerin and shea butter, says Mamina.

This thick cream helps combat dryness and irritation for those with eczema-prone, sensitive and damaged skin, according to the brand. It has a combination of ingredients that focus on treating eczema, repairing the skin barrier and moisturizing and calming the skin, according to First Aid Beauty. This moisturizer has a 4.6-star average review from 4,500 reviews at Ulta, and you can use it on both your face and body.
Key ingredients: Colloidal oatmeal, shea butter, allantoin and glycerin | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes | Fragrance-free: n/a
This thick moisturizer, which has a 4.1-star average rating from over 2,700 reviews on Amazon and is suitable for all skin types, can temporarily relieve any discomfort associated with eczema, including irritation and itchiness, according to the brand. Apply a small amount on your skin and massage it until it melts, allowing it to condition your skin and create a moisturizing, protective barrier.
If you have a nut sensitivity, consider Eczema Honey’s Nut-Free Skin-Soothing Cream, which functions in the same manner as the original formula and is also approved by the NEA.
Key ingredients: Colloidal oatmeal, organic honey and beeswax | National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance: Yes
Though eczema can be finicky to treat, lotions can help make the condition more manageable, experts say. There are two main formula types to look out for: ones that reduce and soothe symptoms of eczema (like inflammation, dryness and itchiness) and ones that work to repair and maintain the skin barrier.
If you suffer from eczema, you’ll want to opt for thicker moisturizers, including creams, balms and ointments, says Soza. Ointments and balms will be more occlusive, meaning they retain water and minimize transepidermal water loss. This is especially important for those dealing with eczema who may need to repair the damaged skin barrier and soothe irritated skin, says Soza. Options with a more liquid-like consistency may not be as hydrating as thicker, creamier moisturizers because they tend to have a higher alcohol content, says Soza.
One common ingredient among products geared toward healing eczema is colloidal oatmeal. The ingredient, which is made of ground-up oat kernels, helps relieve the common side effects of eczema, such as inflammation and itchiness, as well as keep your skin barrier intact to prevent future damage and moisture loss. One study found that even low amounts of colloidal oatmeal helped soothe inflammation and strengthen the skin barrier among eczema patients.
Other ingredients to look for include humectants like hyaluronic acid, glycerin and panthenol that work to attract and hold water in the skin, says Kazlouskaya. You’ll also want to find moisturizers with emollients like butters, oils and ceramides can also help make the skin smoother by filling in the “gaps” between skin cells, says Kazlouskaya. These ingredients are ideal for inflammatory skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis because they can help relieve itchiness, dryness and scaling on the skin.
To strengthen your skin barrier, look for occlusive ingredients like lanolin, squalane and petrolatum jelly because they will help create a film on the skin’s surface and prevent transepidermal water loss, experts say.
Just as important as what’s inside an eczema lotion is what’s not in it. Avoid irritants, allergens, solvents, surfactants and sensitizing preservatives if you’re battling eczema, which can all trigger a flare-up, says Kung. Specifically, the National Eczema Organization recommends avoiding products containing fragrances (a common contact allergen), essential oils and plant extracts (which can lead to skin rashes), and ethanol (or alcohol, which can cause drying, stinging or burning in people with sensitive skin).
When choosing a product for your eczema-prone skin, keep in mind the time of year. “While lotions are good for summer and hot weather, thicker, richer textures such as creams, ointments and balms should be used in the winter time,” says Kazlouskaya. And if moisturizing alone doesn’t help control your eczema, you may find it helpful to visit your dermatologist.
""Eczema is an inflammatory skin condition that, in its mildest form, causes redness, itching, irritability and dry skin,"" says Dr. Elaine Kung , dermatologist and founder of Future Bright Dermatology. ""For more severe forms of eczema, the skin can weep, blister, scale, crust or harden.""
There are seven types of eczema, some more common than others (like atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis). Each type of eczema has its unique form of treatment, but in all cases, the condition isn't contagious. Make sure to consult your dermatologist before trying any lotions for symptom relief.
Eczema results from a complex interplay between a person's genetics and their environment, says Kung. ""Eczema involves an overactive immune response to environmental triggers like pollen, sun exposure and prolonged exposure to hot water,"" she says. It doesn't help if your skin barrier (the outermost layer of skin responsible for shielding the skin against such factors) isn't in tip-top shape. “An impaired skin barrier makes people more susceptible to these environmental irritants and allergens,"" says Kung.
Extreme weather conditions can also trigger or worsen eczema. Extremely hot or cold temperatures can irritate and weaken the skin barrier, making it less apt to protect your skin and lock in moisture, experts say. This also applies to water temperature, so stick to lukewarm water when you bathe or shower (versus piping hot or freezing cold).
Some research suggests that eczema's genetic component is connected to other inflammatory conditions. Studies have found that atopic dermatitis (one form of eczema) is linked to other conditions like asthma, allergies, and hay fever, according to the NEA . This means that if you have eczema, you may be at a greater risk of developing one of these conditions and vice versa (but not in all cases).
Generally, moisturizers help skin retain moisture, so they are most effective when you apply them on damp skin after a shower, says Kung. That being said, you should also treat dry, irritable, cracked skin as often as needed — applying a lotion shouldn’t just be limited to post-shower.
How can you keep your skin barrier intact so that it can actually perform its skin-protecting duties and keep eczema at bay? For one, keep exfoliation, especially physical exfoliation, to a minimum. Products that fall into the category of physical exfoliation include cleansing scrubs with solid particulates, mechanical facial brushes, sonic devices and micro-exfoliating rollers, says Kung. While these may remove the top layer of dull-looking skin, they can be too abrasive and may cause more irritation, she says.
Chemical exfoliants (including those that have alpha-hydroxy acids like lactic and glycolic acid, and beta-hydroxy acids like salicylic acid) should also be kept to a minimum. If you're eczema-prone, aim for exfoliating acids in lower concentrations (under 8%) and use them no more than a few times a week, experts say.
Aside from applying OTC creams, balms and ointments, your dermatologist may suggest a bath treatment like the Aveeno soothing Oatmeal Bath Treatment or wet wraps. Wet wrap therapy is when fabric wraps or gauze are soaked in water and applied to eczema areas after once is finished bathing, moisturizing and applying medication, according to the National Eczema Association. “While wet wraps can be annoying to commit to, I have seen near miracles thanks to consistent use, and they can make a significant impact in less than a few days,” says Soza.
If other OTC options are not helping or are making your eczema worse, consult with your board-certified dermatologist for a different treatment route, which may include a prescription product if necessary, says Soza.

If you’re constantly feeling like your skin is stripped of its natural oils, dry or flaky post-washing, chances are you’re using the wrong cleanser for your skin type. “Those with dry skin need to strike a balance between cleansing and hydration,” says Dr. Lela Lankerani, a board-certified dermatologist at Westlake Dermatology in Texas.

Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.
I spoke to dermatologists about their favorite cleansers for dry skin types and compiled their recommendations below. I also included cleansers NBC Select staff love that are in line with expert guidance.
This fragrance-free cleanser from La Roche-Posay is excellent for cleansing dry skin while also keeping the skin hydrated and retaining moisture, says Green. It has glycerin that pulls moisture to the skin along with ceramide-3 and niacinamide to repair and maintain the skin’s natural moisture barrier, according to the brand. The pump applicator makes it easy to disperse product out, and it’s available in a hefty 13.52 fluid ounce bottle so it should last a while.
NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio loves this fragrance-free cleanser for its lightweight consistency, saying that it’s one of the only cleansers she’s tried that doesn’t leave her skin feeling dry or tight. “It’s also really gentle, which is great when you have reactive skin like I do,” she says.
Key ingredients: niacinamide, thermal spring water, glycerin, ceramide-3 | Formula type: cream | Fragrance-free: yes
Green recommends this foaming cream cleanser from Cerave for those with dry skin who are struggling with acne. It’s made with 4% benzoyl peroxide, an ingredient that clears acne and prevents new pimples from forming, she says. Typically, benzoyl peroxide can lead to increased dryness for those with already-dry skin, but this cleanser is also formulated with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and three essential ceramides to help the skin retain moisture, says Green.
Key ingredients: ceramides, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide | Formula type: foam-cream | Fragrance-free: yes
Godio is a fan of this gentle face wash on days when her sensitive skin needs a break. “During the colder months, my skin gets very cracked, red and irritated due to my rosacea, especially on my cheeks and around my nose. I usually use this cleanser when I need something gentle and soothing — it’s one of the only products that doesn’t cause more dryness or redness when my skin is at its worst,” says Godio. The cleanser has a lightweight gel consistency that easily melts into the skin and it makes Godio’s face feel both clean and hydrated. “My skin feels super soft and smooth afterward, too,” she says.
Key ingredients: glycerin, panthenol, niacinamide | Formula type: gel | Fragrance-free: yes
While Eucerin recommends this cleansing gel for all skin types (even oily, since it’s noncomedogenic), it’s especially great for those with dry, sensitive skin types, says Lankerani. It doesn’t have any fragrance, alcohols or soaps that would otherwise dry the skin out — instead, it’s made with hyaluronic acid and glycerin to help keep the deep layers of the skin moisturized.
Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, glycerin | Formula type: gel | Fragrance-free: yes
Lankerani recommends this mild cleanser for extremely dry, sensitive skin types and even those with eczema since it has the stamp of approval from the National Eczema Association. It’s made without common irritants like fragrance and harsh cleansing agents (like sulfates), and because it’s oil-free you shouldn’t run the risk of clogged pores.
Key ingredients: glycerin | Formula type: cream-gel | Fragrance-free: yes
To deep clean a day’s worth of sunscreen and heavy makeup, this oil cleanser from Fig 1 is up for the task. With antioxidant-rich grapeseed oil and hydrating squalane, it’s especially good for those with sensitive skin, according to the brand. NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin says it doesn't burn when she applies it, even when her skin is dry and raw. Use it as the first part of your double cleansing routine to remove stubborn sunscreen and makeup.
Key ingredients: grapeseed oil, squalane | Formula type: oil | Fragrance-free: yes
NBC Select associate reporter Bianca Alvarez is a fan of this hydrating gel cleanser and makeup remover, which turns foamy once you lather it on your face. “Normally, as someone with dry, sensitive skin, I avoid foaming cleansers, but I can’t pass up this option from Tower 28. It easily removes makeup, grime and sunscreen and leaves my skin feeling soft, hydrated and balanced,” says Alvarez. “The best part is that it deep cleans my skin to the point where I don’t have to go in with another cleanser or makeup remover.” It also has the National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance, so it gives Alvarez peace of mind that it won’t trigger her eczema.
Key ingredients: aloe vera, oat | Formula type: gel-to-foam | Fragrance-free: yes
This cleanser is packed with antioxidants like blueberry, raspberry and apple extract, so your skin doesn’t just feel clean after washing, it feels soothes and hydrated, according to the brand. It’s a favorite of Malin's, who says it doesn’t strip her skin and feels super gentle even on days her skin is feeling sensitive.
Key ingredients: blueberry, raspberry, apple and cucumber extracts | Formula type: gel | Fragrance-free: yes
This creamy cleanser and makeup remover hybrid comes recommended by Alvarez because it’s gentle, softening and fragrance-free. “I love this cleanser because my skin is left softer, smoother and calmer than when I first started using it,” says Alvarez, who received a sample from the brand. The cleanser has a blend of moringa antioxidants (to gently cleanse and soften), oats (to soothe and lock in moisture) and vitamin F (to support your skin barrier). It also has the National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance, so it’s great for sensitive, eczema-prone skin.
Key ingredients: glycerin, moringa oleifera seed oil, oat | Formula type: cream | Fragrance-free: yes
Lankerani recommends this cleanser from Cerave, saying that its hyaluronic acid, ceramides and glycerin help increase hydration in the skin. Alvarez also loves this cleanser. “My favorite thing about this is the creamy, silky consistency, which feels incredible on my dry, eczema-prone skin,” she says. “ It never leaves my skin irritated or dried out — I’ve repurchased it multiple times and even bought the mini version for travel.”
Key ingredients: glycerin, ceramides, hyaluronic acid | Formula type: cream | Fragrance-free: yes
This face cleanser from Fresh is part of the brand’s soy line, which is infused with soy proteins to improve hydration and improve texture and dullness, according to the brand. The fragrance-free formula, which has a 4.4-star average rating from more than 9,000 reviews at Sephora, has soothing aloe vera and cooling cucumber extract, making it great for those with sensitive skin, according to Fresh. It also comes in three different sizes (mini, standard and jumbo) for those who are traveling or like to stock up.
Key ingredients: aloe vera, cucumber extract, borage seed oil, soy proteins | Formula type: gel | Fragrance-free: yes
This mild cleanser from SkinCeuticals comes recommended by Green and is great for those who need to slough away dead skin cells. It has glycolic acid, an exfoliating alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that’s considered milder than a beta hydroxy acid (BHA) since it works more on the surface of the skin and is less likely to be drying, says Lankerani. Aside from this, the cleanser has a creamy formula that soothes irritated skin with orange oil, says Green. It also has ingredients like allantoin and glycerin that soften and hydrate the skin, says the brand.
Key ingredients: orange oil, allantoin, glycerin | Formula type: gel-cream | Fragrance-free: yes
When shopping for a dry skin cleanser, consider factors like key ingredients and function, experts say. Below, I highlight their suggestions of things to consider:
Look for hydrating ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, avocado, glycerin, ceramides, jojoba, aloe vera and olive oil, says Lankerani. It’s important for those with dry skin to be wary of certain ingredients, like fragrance.
“Fragrances can disrupt the skin’s ability to retain moisture and impair the skin’s natural moisture barrier,” says Green. “When the skin’s barrier is damaged, tiny cracks can form, allowing for moisture to leave the skin and irritants to enter, which can lead to redness, itching and the worsening of dryness.”
You should also steer clear from harsh cleansing agents like alcohol and sulfates, as well as highly active ingredients like retinols and certain acids like salicylic acid because they can potentially strip away natural oils and have a drying effect on the skin, says Lankerani. Additionally, those with dry skin should avoid cleansers with parabens (chemicals like methylparaben and butylparaben, which are used as preservatives) because they can sensitize the skin and lead to irritation and itchiness, says Green.
Cleansers are primarily made to wash away dirt and oil on the skin, but some products have benefits beyond this. Exfoliating cleansers work to remove dead skin cells to improve cell turnover and bring new, healthy skin cells to the surface, says Green. That said, while they can help brighten up a dull complexion and unclog pores, certain acids can be quite drying on dry skin types, so it’s important to choose them carefully.
“For dryer skin, AHAs are recommended as they are milder and work more on the surface of the skin,” says Lankerani.
There are also cleansing oils, which are oil-based cleansers that help dissolve makeup and sunscreen in addition to clearing away dirt and sebum on the skin. Many cleansing oils are formulated with hydrating ingredients that won’t leave the skin feeling dry once rinsed.
Facial cleansers get rid of dirt, oil and sometimes makeup. There are several cleanser types available on the market, but not all are suitable for dry skin.
“While foam cleansers can deeply penetrate pores to offer a deep clean, they can be overly drying and strip the skin’s natural oils,” says Green. Gel cleansers can cleanse the skin without irritation, but they may not be made specifically for dry skin and will therefore not have the hydrating ingredients that you need. Cream cleansers, on the other hand, are typically made with moisturizing ingredients, and because they’re naturally milky in texture, they’ll leave the skin feeling hydrated after cleansing.
When using a facial cleanser, you should first wet your face with lukewarm water and apply the cleanser to your fingertips, says Green. “Gently massage the cleanser into your skin in circular motions across the face, making sure not to use too much pressure, as harsh scrubbing can irritate the skin.” Rinse the cleanser off with lukewarm water and pat your face dry with a towel. While there isn’t an exact length of time you should cleanse your face, a general rule of thumb is to cleanse for a minimum of 20 to 30 seconds, says Green.
Dermatologists recommend cleansing twice a day: once in the morning and once at night. “Washing your face in the morning will remove any dirt or bacteria on your skin that was transferred from your pillowcase or hair as you were sleeping,” says Green. “Washing your face at night is extremely important for cleansing the skin of any dirt, pollution, oil or sweat that was accumulated throughout the day.” Additionally, you should wash your face after swimming or any activity that causes excessive sweating, notes Green.
Using an exfoliating cleanser requires different guidelines — you should use one less frequently since over-exfoliation can disrupt the skin’s natural pH, lead to irritation and cause tiny cracks in the skin that can further exacerbate inflammation and dryness, says Lankerani. You should follow the instructions on the specific product you’re using, but generally speaking, you can use an exfoliating cleanser once or twice a week if you have dry or sensitive skin, says Lankerani.
Another method of cleansing, called double cleansing, can be effective in the evening to get rid of makeup and prep the skin for your other skin care products like serums and moisturizers. The process involves using light pressure to massage a cleansing oil (the first cleanse) into dry skin, focusing on any areas that may have residual makeup such as the lips and eyes. After working the cleansing oil into the skin for a few minutes, rinse with lukewarm water, making sure not to pat the skin dry in order to prep it for the water-based cleanser (the second cleanse). For the second part of the cleanse, apply your cleanser of choice on wet skin, working in circular motions and using light pressure to get rid of any excess makeup or impurities. Rinse with lukewarm water and gently pat dry before moving on to the rest of your skin care routine.

Plus, a consistent moisturizing routine can help keep your skin healthy and make every day feel like a spa day.
The benefits of a good lotion extend beyond its ability to soften your skin: It’s important to help lock in moisture and support the skin barrier, says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Hadley King. “An impaired barrier will leave the skin more vulnerable to damage, dryness, irritation, inflammation and infection,” she says.
I spoke to dermatologists about the importance of moisturizing, what to look for in a quality body lotion (including ingredients) and which lotions you should pick based on your skin type. I also gathered some expert-recommended lotions to consider, as well as options NBC Select staffers have tried and loved.

With this expert guidance in mind, I rounded up a handful of dermatologist-recommended lotions and creams, plus ones NBC Select staff have tried, to help your dry skin heal.
This NBC Select Wellness Award winner, which is formulated with hyaluronic acid and ceramides to heal dry skin, comes recommended by Dr. Shoshana Marmon, a board-certified dermatologist and assistant professor at New York Medical College. Former NBC Select managing editor Leah Ginsberg also swears by it: “The two things I love most are its soft texture and I notice more of a moisturizing effect on my skin that lasts longer compared to other creams I’ve used and definitely more than when I use lotions,” she says. Ginsberg also appreciates that it doesn’t have a strong scent or a hefty price tag.
Type: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, ceramides | Fragrance-free: yes
“I’ve been using La Roche-Posay products for years and love their gentle scent and the fact that they’re lightweight, providing deep moisture without leaving behind a greasy residue,” says former NBC Select editor Christina Colizza. The moisturizer is also a favorite of Marmon’s because it is formulated with ceramides, shea butter, glycerin and niacinamide.
Type: cream | Skin type: dry, sensitive | Key ingredients: ceramides, shea butter, glycerin, niacinamide | Fragrance-free: yes
This highly rated body lotion helps keep skin moisturized for up to 48 hours, according to the brand. The formula relies on ceramides, an emollient our experts recommend, to hydrate the skin and prevent dryness. Eucerin’s Advanced Repair Body Lotion is fragrance-free and has a 4.8-star average rating from over 28,800 reviews on Amazon.
Type: lotion | Skin type: very dry | Key ingredients: lactic acid, ceramides | Fragrance-free: yes
Vanicream is by no means a new, splashy brand, but it’s a stalwart in the world of skin and hair care and comes recommended by Marmon. Out of all my body lotions, this is a standout because it gives me more moisture than any of the other ones I’ve tried and doesn’t cause any eczema flare-ups. In fact, it actually helps treat my eczema and soothes any itchy, dry, red patches. If you prefer a thicker consistency, consider the cream version, which I also use daily, if not weekly.
Type: lotion | Skin type: sensitive | Key ingredients: water, petrolatum | Fragrance-free: yes
Marmon also recommends Amlactin’s moisturizer for dry skin. It’s formulated without parabens or fragrances and relies on humectants like glycerin to hydrate the skin. Also, the lotion contains 12% lactic acid, which the brand says is both a powerful humectant and gentle exfoliant that can relieve skin issues like keratosis pilaris.
Type: lotion | Skin type: dry, sensitive | Key ingredients: lactic acid, glycerin | Fragrance-free: yes
King also recommends this option from Vaseline, which contains humectants (like glycerin) to hydrate the skin, emollients( like shea butter and sunflower seed oil) to support the skin barrier and occlusives (like petrolatum) to lock in moisture. It’s formula also includes colloidal oatmeal, which helps to soothe and protect the skin, she says.
Type: lotion | Skin type: dry, sensitive | Key ingredients: colloidal oatmeal, glycerin, shea butter | Fragrance-free: yes
This body lotion combines key hydrating ingredients like shea butter to help improve tone and texture and protect and moisturize the skin, according to the brand. It’s the perfect all-in-one cream, in my opinion. I see and feel a difference in how my skin looks, but I also love how fast-absorbing it is, and despite its lightweight feel, I feel like my skin is hydrated from morning to night.
Type: lotion | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: B vitamins, glycerin, niacinamide, omega fatty acids | Fragrance-free: yes
When it comes to treating her itchy, dry, and sensitive skin, NBC Select Reporter Zoe Malin reaches for this lotion. “I apply this hydrating cream whenever I start to feel uncomfortable, and it soothes my skin,” she says. “The skin on my legs tends to get dry and cracked in the winter, and if I use this before I go to bed, it’s significantly more moisturized in the morning.”
Type: lotion | Skin type: dry, sensitive | Key ingredients: glycerin, vitamin C and vitamin E | Fragrance-free: yes
2024 was one of the worst years for my eczema, and since September, this cream has kept my skin moisturized and soothed. Made for dry or sensitive skin or those who live in colder areas and need intense moisture, this cream uses ingredients like squalane and ceramides to repair and strengthen the skin barrier and hydrate and lock in moisture, according to the brand. My skin feels more comfortable and less tight, appears way less dry, and any cracks I have are reduced overnight. I cannot recommend this body moisturizer enough.
Type: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: squalane, glacial glycoprotein, ceramides | Fragrance-free: yes
Although this NBC Select Wellness Award winner has a thicker consistency than your typical lotion, it leaves skin soft and hydrated without feeling heavy or greasy, in our experience. “The hydration I got from the lotion lasted all day, and I didn’t feel like I needed to reapply it all the time,” says former NBC Page Alexa Casanueva. Suitable for all skin types, this noncomedogenic moisturizer also has a subtle coconut scent.
Type: cream | Skin type: very dry, dull | Key ingredients: shea butter, coconut oil, peptides, vitamin C | Fragrance-free: no
This is a body butter you don’t have to stop using in the summer because it’s nourishing without being heavy or greasy, says NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown. The moisturizer focuses on improving dry and damaged skin and increasing firmness and tightness, according to the brand. “A little goes a long way, which is always nice when you don’t want to sacrifice a huge chunk of money for quality products,” says Brown.
Type: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: ceramides, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide | Fragrance-free: no
NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz is a fan of Cetaphil’s lotion as both a body and face moisturizer. “It’s totally unscented, it comes in a large, affordable bottle, and I’ve seen it recommended by many dermatologists,” he says. Cetaphil is formulated with hydrating glycerin and is noncomedogenic, meaning it shouldn’t clog pores or cause breakouts.
Type: lotion | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: avocado oil, vitamin E, niacinamide | Fragrance-free: yes
It took me forever to find a moisturizer that worked for everyone in my family until I tried this one. My younger brothers (both under the age of 10) swear lotions make them itchy and their skin uncomfortable, but this is the first one they haven’t complained about and don’t mind applying. It’s not too thick or thin, has a subtle scent that doesn’t cause any irritation on all our skin types and is super fast absorbing.
Type: lotion | Skin type: dry | Key ingredients: coconut oil, sea moss, aloe and shea butter | Fragrance-free: no — has natural fragrance
This moisturizing, eucalyptus-scented body lotion has five peptides in its formula to help regulate cellular activity for improved skin health. These peptides also focus on firming and strengthening the skin, according to the brand.
“This body cream’s eucalyptus scent is present but not overpowering, and it reminds me of the cream a spa would use for an aromatherapy massage,” says Malin, who is cautious about fragrances in her lotion because she has sensitive skin. “I apply it post-shower to lock moisture into my skin, and while it takes a little blending to fully absorb, it’s lightweight and doesn’t leave behind a greasy residue.” This lotion is available in three additional fragrances (Santal, Olibanum and Hinoki) and a fragrance-free option, which has the National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance.
Type: lotion | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: peptides, niacinamide, vitamin C, vitamin E | Fragrance-free: no
This Curél body lotion is fragrance-free and specifically targets extra dry, tight skin, according to the brand. It has hydrating ingredients like ceramides, shea butter and oatmeal that lock in moisture for up to 24 hours, according to the brand. The lotion has a 4.8-star average rating from over 10,300 reviews on Amazon.
Type: lotion | Skin type: very dry | Key ingredients: ceramides, shea butter, oatmeal extract | Fragrance-free: yes
This Summer Fridays body lotion, another NBC Select Wellness Award winner, combines humectants, emollients and occlusives like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, glycerin and natural oils to hydrate and soften the skin, according to the brand. The lotion, which has a coconut, vanilla and almond scent, is in constant rotation for former NBC page Mikhaila Archer because it has a great texture that doesn’t feel too thin or thick on her skin, she says.
Type: lotion | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: ceramides, shea butter, hyaluronic acid, glycerin | Fragrance-free: no


Former NBC Page Hannah Fuechtman reaches for Illiyoon’s Ceramide Ato Lotion to moisturize her dry skin during the winter. “I have incredibly dry skin, especially when the cold weather hits, and this is one of the only lotions that protects my skin,” she says. “I love how this lightweight, fragrance-free formula goes on smoothly and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky.” Illiyoon has products specifically for sensitive skin, so it’s a great pick if you fall into that skin type, too, says Fuechtman.
Type: lotion | Skin type: normal, dry | Key ingredients: glycerin, perilla seed, ceramides, ginseng root extract | Fragrance-free: yes
This body lotion, which has a 4.5-star average rating from over 470 reviews on Amazon, uses an encapsulated retinol complex to improve skin texture, tone and firmness, according to the brand. The silky, fast-absorbing formula also reduces irritation and redness while providing overall moisture and hydration, according to Naturium. The lotion is available in a larger version with pump packaging and is also sold in a bundle.
Type: lotion | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: retinol, glycerin, shea butter | Fragrance-free: yes
Not quite a lotion, not quite a cream, but deserving of an honorable mention from Marmon is Aquaphor’s healing ointment. The balm won’t spread across your skin like the other recommendations on this list, but it’s great for spot treating rough patches on your skin and other itchy spots. It also ranks in NBC Select’s guides on how to heal dry, chapped lips and the best hand creams to heal dry skin.
Type: ointment | Skin type: dry, cracked | Key ingredients: petroleum | Fragrance-free: yes
Though you should proceed with caution when it comes to heavily-fragranced moisturizers, King uses this Eos lotion and says she’s very happy with it. Plus, it’s packed with humectants, emollients and occlusives like shea butter, glycerin, cocoa seed butter and petrolatum, she says.
Type: lotion | Skin type: sensitive | Key ingredients: glycerin, shea butter, shea oil | Fragrance-free: no
“Moisturizer is a catch-all term for something that hydrates the skin,” says Marmon. Whether a product is sold as a lotion, cream, body butter or a similar product (more on what distinguishes each below), they should contain humectants to hydrate the skin, emollients to support the skin barrier and occlusives to lock in moisture, says King. Some lotions also have additional ingredients for specific concerns, like lactic acid to gently exfoliate rough or bumpy skin, or retinol to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, she says.
Lotions, creams, and body butters are all moisturizing products, but they have different consistencies and properties, says Marmon:
Lotions are typically water-based, lightweight and “have a thinner consistency that makes them easy to apply and quick to absorb,” says Marmon. They provide lighter hydration and are ideal for normal to oily skin.
Creams, on the other hand, are richer and are typically formulated with higher oil content, says Marmon. They are “ideal for normal to dry skin and great for aging skin,” notes Marmon, especially during menopause, when lowered estrogen levels can cause the skin to become dryer and thinner.
Body butters or other balms are often thicker and more concentrated. They typically contain the highest proportion of oil and natural fats and are great for “very dry or rough skin, and areas like the elbows, knees and heels,” says Marmon.
If you struggle with skin conditions like rosacea or eczema, King recommends avoiding potentially irritating ingredients like hydroxy acids or retinol. “Stick with good moisturizers that contain humectants, emollients and occlusives,” she says.
Both King and Marmon recommend applying lotions or moisturizers after showering to lock moisture in, but “people with eczema, psoriasis, severely dry skin or other skin barrier issues may need more frequent moisturization,” says Marmon.

Though they can worsen in the wintertime due to lower humidity levels, board-certified dermatologist Dr. William Huang says several factors, including hot showers and harsh soaps, may contribute to dry heels year-round.

Below, I compiled dermatologist-recommended moisturizing and exfoliating products to help treat dry, cracked heels year-round.
This gentle, skin-repairing ointment is a favorite among the dermatologists I spoke to because it creates a barrier on your heels to seal in moisture and prevent infection. The formula has ceramides to restore your skin’s barrier and hydrating hyaluronic acid, according to the brand. The ointment has the National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance, which means it’s suitable for sensitive skin.
If ointments feel too thick on the skin, this thick foot cream from O’Keeffe’s is a favorite of Dr. Samer Jaber, a board-certified dermatologist at Washington Square Dermatology in New York City. The formula contains allantoin, a hydrating ingredient that penetrates thick, rough skin and creates a protective layer of moisture, according to the brand.
Olive & June is a favorite brand among NBC Select editors, and this overnight treatment is a quick and convenient way to get relief. The balm comes in a stick form that you rub on your heels directly, so you don’t have to apply your foot cream with your hands or squeeze it out of a tube. Roll on the balm once a week as a nighttime foot treatment and wear socks afterward to lock in moisture, according to the brand.
This Aveeno foot mask comes recommended by Dr. Nkem Ugonabo, a board-certified dermatologist at Union Derm in New York City. It’s shaped like a slipper, so you can easily slip it on and off, plus, it includes a fastening strap to keep it in place. The fragrance-free formula contains shea butter and prebiotic oat, both expert-recommended ingredients that help moisturize the skin. The brand recommends leaving the foot mask on for 10 minutes, and you don’t have to rinse off your feet afterward, according to Aveeno.
“This ointment contains petrolatum and glycerin, which work together to hydrate and protect dry, cracked skin,” says Dr. Annie Chiu, a board-certified cosmetic and general dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute in California. Formulated for sensitive skin, you can use this preservative- and fragrance-free ointment as a foot cream, lip moisturizer, hand cream, minor wound treatment and more.
Huang recommends this Amlactin cream, which has 15% lactic acid that gently exfoliates and removes dead skin cells. In addition to smoothing out dry, flaky skin, this fragrance-free cream softens calluses and improves splitting and cracking heels, according to the brand. You can apply this cream twice a day — remember that it has exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), like lactic acid, which means it can increase sun sensitivity, experts say.
This Gold Bond cream has a blend of moisturizing vitamins, including vitamins C and E, plus aloe vera to soothe irritated, cracked skin, says Chiu. The foot cream locks in up to 24 hours of moisture and is fragrance-free and non-greasy, according to the brand.
This spot treatment has a high concentration of urea (30%) to exfoliate the skin, plus ceramides that provide a good amount of moisture, says Dr. Barry Goldman, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Goldman Dermatology in New York City. According to Eucerin, it also contains lactic acid, which works in conjunction with the urea to remove dead skin cells.
Goldman recommends this foot cream to his clients because it has salicylic acid to loosen dead skin and hyaluronic acid to retain moisture. The cream absorbs quickly into the skin, is non-greasy and helps reduce roughness or cracks on feet, according to the brand. It also has the NEA Seal of Acceptance for sensitive skin. You can use this cream daily, but wear an SPF on top of it since the AHAs in the formula can increase sun sensitivity, according to the brand.
This Kerasal ointment is a favorite of both Chiu and Jaber. It has salicylic acid and urea, which work together to exfoliate and soften rough, dry skin on the heels, says Chiu. By loosening dead cells, moisturizing ingredients like petrolatum can better penetrate the skin, according to the brand. The foot cream is also approved by the American Podiatric Medical Association, which means it was reviewed by a group of podiatrists to make sure it’s effective for dry, cracked heels.
“If you have painful cracks in your feet, a liquid bandaid can be very helpful to reduce the pain and allow the area to heal,” says Jaber. He recommends these liquid bandages from New-Skin, which create a tough barrier on cracks and cuts to prevent infection and speed up healing. The bandages are water-resistant and flexible and dry clear so they can match your skin tone, according to the brand.
Dry, cracked heels are very common and can occur at any time of the year. Below, our experts highlight a few main causes of dry, cracked heels:
When it comes to dry heels, prevention is key. When the weather gets colder, a humidifier in your room may help, says Huang. Instead of long, hot showers, which can dry out your skin more, opt for short, warm showers or baths. Plus, use fragrance-free moisturizing products that can help repair your skin’s moisture barrier. Our experts note a few tips below to keep in mind.
To help treat dry, cracked heels, wash your feet with non-foaming hydrating cleansers (preferably with a cream or milk consistency) to prevent skin drying. After your bath or shower, you should apply a moisturizer immediately to help retain some of the water on your skin; you should moisturize your heels at least twice a day, says Goldman.
Huang recommends using products with moisturizing ingredients like glycerin, ceramides, hyaluronic acid and colloidal oatmeal to help lock in moisture. For relieving pain and inflammation, Chiu recommends aloe vera — a natural anti-inflammatory that soothes dry, cracked skin — and vitamin E, an antioxidant that promotes healthy cell growth and protects the skin from damage.
After moisturizing and exfoliating (more on that below), apply a thick, occlusive emollient like petroleum jelly to lock in moisture. “I recommend applying right before bed and under cotton socks,” says Ugonabo. You can lock in moisture with breathable socks made from either natural cotton or wool, which are usually less irritating than synthetic materials, says Jaber.
Our experts say to get rid of dead skin, soak your feet in warm water for 15 minutes and gently scrub with a loofah, pumice stone or foot file. “This will help remove dead skin cells and make it easier for moisturizers to penetrate the skin,” says Chiu. Follow that with moisturizers that have exfoliating ingredients like ammonium lactate, salicylic acid, and urea, says Huang.
“Liquid bandages can be very helpful to seal up cracks,” says Ugonabo. They can also ease the pain of walking on torn skin while keeping the wounds clean.
Foot peels have a blend of exfoliants to soften and remove dead skin that sits on the thick surface of your feet. They’re usually good for those who want smoother skin on their feet and people with calluses due to running or standing for long hours, according to experts in our guide to foot peels. However, if you have any open wounds or cracks, you should avoid foot peels because exfoliating acids can irritate and slow down the wound healing process, experts say. That’s the same for bacterial, viral and fungal infections like athlete’s foot.
Cracks in your heels typically result in wounds that can get infected if not treated. If you have a compromised immune system or diabetes, an infection can become a serious health risk, says Jaber.

Below are the facial moisturizers our experts count as their favorites for dry skin, along with recommendations from NBC Select staff, who are skin care experts in their own right.
Not only is this moisturizer an NBC Select Wellness Awards winner and one of our top 10 moisturizers out of 100, but it’s also accepted by the National Eczema Association, which means it’s suitable for sensitive skin. NBC Select associate reporter Bianca Alvarez loves how effective this cream is at healing eczema on both her face and body. “Although it’s a cream, it’s very easy to spread, and a little goes a long way, so one tub will last you a long time,” she says.
Formula: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, ceramides | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes
Despite having different skin types, both NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin (who has acne-prone skin) and Alvarez (who has dry, sensitive and eczema-prone skin) use this as their daily morning moisturizer. “It has a medium thickness, so it’s moisturizing enough to prevent dry, flakey skin, yet thin enough that it absorbs quickly,” says Malin. “It never makes me look oily or shiny, and it never exacerbates irritation when I’m experiencing it.”
Alvarez loves how gentle and soothing it is on her skin. “It’s a game changer during my eczema flare-ups because any itchiness or roughness I’m experiencing goes away in a few days,” she says. “I never want to stop using it because it’s the perfect maintenance tool for keeping my skin moisturized, calm and happy.”
Type: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: ceramides, glycerin, niacinamide, La Roche-Posay prebiotic thermal water | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes
This thick, fragrance-free moisturizer combines colloidal oatmeal and allantoin, which are great for sensitive, reactive skin (including rosacea- and eczema-prone skin) since they work together to soothe redness and irritation, according to experts we spoke to. It also has shea butter, which moisturizes and protects the skin barrier, according to the brand. You can use the moisturizer, which has a 4.4-star average rating from over 10,300 reviews at Sephora, on both your face and body, making it a versatile choice. (Keep in mind the brand recalled over 2,700 jars of the Ultra Repair Cream in the coconut vanilla scent earlier this year, so we are recommending the fragrance-free option.)
Type: cream | Skin type: dry | Key ingredients: colloidal oatmeal, shea butter, allantoin | Fragrance-free: yes
Dr. Barry Goldman, a dermatologist at New York City’s Goldman Dermatology and a clinical instructor at Cornell NY Presbyterian Hospital, recommends Vanicream for dry skin, and it’s also an NBC Select staff favorite, ranking number 11 on our top 100 list. “This is one of the very few products that I will always buy again when it runs out — my skin practically craves it when it’s gone,” says NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson. The facial moisturizer is made with a blend of emollients and humectants, and it doesn’t have common irritants like dyes and fragrances, according to the brand.
Type: lotion | Skin type: sensitive | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, ceramides, glycerin, squalane | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes
Goldman and Jean Dachnowicz, a licensed aesthetician at New York City’s Goldman Dermatology, call Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream the best overall moisturizer for dry skin, and it took the number one spot on our 100 moisturizer list. “It feels thick and rich as it comes out of the jar, with an aroma barely registering on my nose. Everyone on our staff who tried this found it simple, reliable and nourishing, regardless of their skin type,” says NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz.
Type: cream | Skin type: sensitive, dry | Key ingredients: glycerin, niacinamide, panthenol, vitamin E | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes
Petroleum jelly is the occlusive moisturizer behind the popular skin care trend “slugging” — people put the product on their face after their skin care routine to lock in moisture. The American Academy of Dermatology says that petroleum jelly products have several skin care benefits, including helping dry skin; however, both Goldman and Dachnowicz warn it may clog pores on some skin types.
Type: ointment | Skin type: dry, normal, sensitive | Key ingredients: petroleum jelly | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: no
Aquaphor is an occlusive moisturizer that can be helpful for skin that tends to be flaky, cracked or scaly, according to Goldman and Dachnowicz. The fragrance-free ointment, which you can use as a lip mask and hand cream in addition to a face moisturizer, includes several occlusive ingredients, like mineral oil and glycerin. Compared to lotions or creams, Aquaphor works best to create a barrier that keeps moisture in; however, Goldman and Dachnowicz warn that Aquaphor may be too heavy for some skin types and can clog pores.
Type: ointment | Skin type: dry, sensitive, normal | Key ingredients: glycerin | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: no
This soothing balm, our pick for best occlusive night cream, has a jelly-like consistency that Malin loves applying to “lock everything in” at the end of her evening routine. The balm uses plant-based oils and lipids to create a layer over your skin that helps to prevent water loss and allow for better absorption of your other products, according to the brand.
Type: balm/jelly | Skin type: dry, sensitive, normal | Key ingredients: hydrogenated vegetable oil, citric acid | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: no
This moisturizer is made with colloidal oatmeal, which targets extreme dryness and eczema, according to the brand. It’s one of NBC Select associate SEO reporter Ashley Morris‘ go-to winter moisturizers — she says it keeps her skin feeling hydrated and plump without any excess greasiness, and soothes dry patches right away.
Type: lotion | Skin type: sensitive, very dry, combo | Key ingredients: colloidal oatmeal | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes
This balm from First Aid Beauty boosts your moisture barrier using 1% dimethicone, which is a skin protectant that creates a layer which helps to relieve irritated skin, according to the brand. The addition of colloidal oatmeal gives the formula soothing properties that’s great for redness and dry patch flare-ups, and also contains glycerin, a humectant that keeps skin hydrated throughout the day.
Type: balm | Skin type: dry, sensitive, normal | Key ingredients: 1% dimethicone, colloidal oatmeal, glycerin | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes
Most of our experts recommend Neutrogena’s Hydro Boost line for people with dry skin. Plus, it’s an NBC Select staff favorite: “When my skin is raw — like red, inflamed, flaky and uneven in texture — this is the only moisturizer I can tolerate,” says Malin. “I first started using it when I began treating acne with Tretinoin, which severely dried out my skin for the first few months. It was the only moisturizer I found that didn’t sting or burn when I applied it, and I used it multiple times a day. I always keep some with me wherever I go just in case my dry skin starts flaring up.”
Type: gel | Skin type: dry, acne-prone | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, ceramides, glycerin | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes
An NBC Select Wellness Awards winner for dry skin, this moisturizer has colloidal oatmeal and beta-glucan, which work together to soothe redness and repair the skin’s moisture barrier. NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio loves this thick moisturizer for the wintertime when her rosacea-prone skin is driest. “It’s super thick, and most of my dry patches disappear overnight when I use it,” she says. It is also lightweight and gentle on sensitive skin, according to the brand.
Type: cream | Skin type: sensitive | Key ingredients: colloidal oatmeal, beta-glucan | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes
Though it took her some time to warm up to, NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown loves the milky liquid texture of this option, which merges the hydration benefits of a cream with the lightweight feel of a toner. “It almost feels like water yet it has some weight to it that makes it look like a serum,” she says. Still,  potential shoppers should be wary of how much they apply — “A little goes a long way, so you risk looking greasy when you go overboard,” says Brown.
Type: liquid | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: white tea leaf water | Fragrance-free: n/a | Water-based: yes
This moisturizer is a favorite of  Alvarez and NBC Select page Emma Satin because it’s thick and creamy without being greasy, heavy or sticky. “It is my go-to for New York winters when my skin needs a moisture boost, but I truly use it year-round, especially when I’m doing my makeup for a special occasion and want my skin to glow,” says Satin. “It is a bit pricier in the States but is worth every penny if you struggle with dry skin.”
Type: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: shea butter, beeswax, aloe vera, soy proteins | Fragrance-free: no
This fragrance-free moisturizer, another NBC Select Wellness Awards winner, has niacinamide and hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin. It’s also occlusive, so it creates a barrier on the skin to prevent moisture loss and improve its ability to heal, experts say. Malin finds this to be very similar to Neutrogena’s moisturizer, which is why she loves it. “I find it even more cooling, and it has aloe in it, which is super soothing when my skin is red and inflamed,” she says. “It absorbs into my skin quickly and is so lightweight I forget I’m wearing it. You can also use it as a body cream, so I’ve applied it to dry patches on my neck, chest, arms and legs as needed.”
Type: cream | Skin type: sensitive | Key ingredients: niacinamide, hyaluronic acid | Fragrance-free: yes
When it comes to moisturized skin, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream is the first product that comes to mind for Brown. “The texture is so rich, but it doesn’t sit on top of the skin and I just love how glowy I look and feel after applying it,” she says. The cream has a slew of hydrating ingredients, including aloe vera, hyaluronic acid and camellia oil, and is also available in a lighter, gel-cream version, which has soothing niacinamide.
Type: cream | Skin type: dry | Key ingredients: niacinamide, aloe vera, hyaluronic acid | Fragrance-free: n/a
When her skin is experiencing a few breakouts but is still combatting its typical dry and eczema concerns, Alvarez reaches for this moisturizer. “My skin rarely experiences breakouts, but lately, it’s in that transition of summer heat to cooler early fall, so it’s all over the place. This cream is my saving grace,” she says. “It’s very rich and thick, but it won’t clog my pores, so my breakout isn’t worsening, and it’s alleviating those dry, somewhat rough patches I have overnight.”
Type: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: avène thermal spring water, shea butter, glycerin | Fragrance-free: no
For people who want a quick-absorbing moisturizer, Dr. Annie Chiu, a board-certified cosmetic and general dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute in California in Redondo Beach, recommends this one from Biossance. It has ingredients like squalane oil and probiotics to help hydrate your skin, reduce redness and shrink pores, according to the brand. “I love using this in the summer months or when I’m about to be really active because it gives me the same amount as a thick, creamy moisturizer without being heavy or potentially clogging my pores,” says Alvarez. “I usually try not to spend too much money on a moisturizer, but this is worth it and I will buy a new one every time I run out.”
Type: gel | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: squalane, probiotics | Fragrance-free: yes
Tatcha’s The Dewy Skin Cream couples antioxidant ingredients with deep moisture in an elegant, non-greasy formula, says Chiu. The cream has a blend of Okinawa algae and hyaluronic acid, which work together to restore water levels to the skin and replenish ceramides, according to the brand. Other nourishing ingredients in the moisturizer include glycerin and dimethicone.
Type: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: glycerin, dimethicone, hyaluronic acid | Fragrance-free: yes
“I’m obsessed with Summer Fridays’ Jet Lag Mask because when I apply it, it truly feels like my skin is drinking a giant cup of water,” says Malin. “I lather it all over my skin before I go to bed once or twice a week on nights when I’m not using my acne medication — it gives me that glazed donut look I aim for when I really need to hydrate my skin.” Plus, you only need to use a little at a time since it has a rich consistency that spreads easily, says Malin. Since it does leave your skin looking very dewy and glowy, Malin recommends using it only at night.
Type: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: niacinamide, glycerin, hyaluronic acid | Fragrance-free: yes
If you have a little bit more in your budget to spend, Chiu recommends Skinbetter’s Trio Rebalancing Moisture Treatment to repair dry skin. “[It] has urea and provides deep moisture without the heaviness,” she says. It has hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin and ceramides and squalane to lock in moisture, according to the brand.
Type: lotion | Skin type: dry, damaged | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, ceramides, squalane | Fragrance-free: no
If you have highly sensitive skin or have multiple allergies, including gluten and nuts, consider this lightweight allergy-tested moisturizer. “It’s so incredibly gentle on my skin, and instead of worsening my ongoing symptoms, it helps soothe, heal and repair them,” says Alvarez. “Seriously, all it takes is two pumps, and my skin automatically feels 10 times better and more moisturized.”
Type: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: squalane, glycerin, avocado oil, plum oil | Fragrance-free: yes
When your skin is super dry, consider using a moisture mask, like this one from Eve Lom, a few times a week to help calm dry, flaky and irritated skin, says Chiu. During sleep, our skin loses more moisture because our body temperature slowly increases throughout the night, says Chiu. This mask has several moisturizing ingredients, including the humectant hyaluronic acid. “It also has an occlusive effect that still manages to feel light and soothing,” says Chiu.
Type: cream | Skin type: dry, flaky | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, black oat, lecithin, red seaweed | Fragrance-free: yes
When shopping for a moisturizer for dry skin, our experts recommend considering factors like ingredients and formulation.
Humectants, emollients and occlusives all work together to hydrate the skin and lock in moisture. Our experts break down these three types of ingredients below:
Moisturizers formulated for dry skin typically have a heavier, thicker texture to create a barrier on the skin, experts say. The type of formulation you choose depends on your skin’s needs:
According to Dr. Serena Mraz in our best night creams roundup, hydration is the process of adding water to your skin, while moisturizing is what happens when that moisture is locked into the skin, creating a barrier to shield from dryness. The best moisturizers will keep your skin both hydrated and moisturized, however products like hydrating serums and barrier creams can also help with combatting everyday dryness.
A few indicators of dry skin include:
After cleansing, apply your moisturizer on damp skin because it will help seal in the water, according to Young. After applying your moisturizer, you can go in with other products, including sunscreen and makeup. If you have very dry skin, consider reapplying your moisturizer throughout the day because once may not be enough, says Young.
Moisturizers bring moisture into the skin, not just to the surface, says Chiu. Typically, they come in the form of lotions or creams, but can be gels or ointments, too. Creams provide a heavier barrier to keep your skin moisturized and are ideal for dry or sensitive skin, while lotions tend to be lighter and less greasy, making them better for normal to lightly dry skin, says Chiu.
According to Goldman, once outdoor temperatures drop below freezing, the water in water-based moisturizers runs a risk of freezing on your skin, which could allow ice to form. This could also put you at risk for frostbite, which he says could pose “a much bigger problem” for your skin in the long run.
Though this is only a risk during sub-zero temps, you can exercise caution by switching to thicker, humectant- and occlusive-heavy, or non-water based, moisturizers in cold weather. Both water- and non-water-based options are included in our roundup.

For a lot of us, chapped lips are inevitable in the cold weather and dry air. “In the winter there’s way less humidity in the air and so the cold air pulls moisture from the skin,” says Dr. Kiran Mian, a board-certified dermatologist at Hudson Dermatology and Laser Surgery in New York City.
The best way to prevent and get rid of chapped lips is to target the causes by keeping your body and environment hydrated whenever possible, dermatologists say. (That includes drinking lots of water and using a humidifier.) But not all lip hydrators are created equally: “One of the most important things is making sure that you are applying the correct type of lip care,” says Dr. Carmen Castilla, a board-certified dermatologist at the New York Dermatology Group in Manhattan.
Below, we rounded up everything you need to know about treating chapped lips and keeping them smooth all year long.

No one is immune to chapped lips, even those who have oily skin. To prevent and treat chapped lips this winter, experts stress the importance of finding a lip product that works well for you. Below, we gathered dermatologists’ tips to consider when you shop.
To heal damaged lips, experts recommend looking for formulas that have the following types of moisturizers:
To treat chapped lips, you’ll want to look for products with emollients and/or occlusives, says King. “Humectant ingredients need to be combined with emollients and occlusives to be effective,” she says. Without these key components, any water pulled into the skin by humectants can evaporate, leaving lips even dryer.
As a general rule of thumb, simpler is better. Paradoxically, many popular lip balms and chapsticks have ingredients that irritate lips and cause further dryness. “There’s a lot of products on the market and some of them can be very irritating,” says Castilla.
Added ingredients can increase the risk of putting your lips in contact with something that might be irritating to already damaged skin. Castilla says cooling ingredients like camphor and menthol (a type of alcohol) as ones to watch out for. “They give a nice cooling sensation but they can end up leading to more dry, irritated skin,” she says. If you have sensitive skin and/or skin conditions like eczema, Castilla recommends avoiding fragrances and certain irritating flavorings like cinnamon and peppermint, which are all more likely to cause allergic reactions.
Finding a nonirritating balm may require a little trial and error. “Some people might be totally fine using Burt’s Bees, which has menthol in it, but for other people, that product might cause more irritation,” says Mian. If you’ve been using a balm for several days and see no improvement (or worsening dryness), consider switching to something gentler.
For any product to be effective, you have to actually want to use it regularly. There’s room for personal preference in choosing the best lip treatment. Mian, for example, tends to like waxy, stick-based formulas that are easy to reapply throughout the day and don’t require the use of your finger, “which may or may not be dirty,” she says. Castilla, on the other hand, avoids chapsticks since they typically have beeswax, which can be irritating to some people. Appearance may also be important to you — choosing a balm with a matte finish over a glossy formula may make you more likely to reapply.
Lip masks , lip balms and chapsticks can all treat and prevent dry chapped lips. While you can use them interchangeably, there are differences worth noting. Lip masks are typically the heaviest formulas and are generally designed for overnight use, says Mian. “Lip masks tend to have more occlusive ingredients that are going to act like a shield,” she says. Lip balms, which are designed to be reapplied throughout the day, are lighter formulas. Chapsticks tend to have a waxier texture.
It’s important to apply SPF every day, including on your lips. In fact, lips are particularly vulnerable to sun damage. In addition to lip skin being thin, lips have little melanin, which gives skin its pigment and protects it from sun damage, says King. That makes them more prone to UV damage, which can cause signs of aging, skin cancer and actinic cheilitis (a precancerous condition also known as “sailor’s lip” that creates rough, scaly patches on the skin).
“Skin cancers of the lip have a higher risk of becoming invasive compared to most other areas,” says King. She recommends wearing a lip balm with at least SPF 30.
Castilla recommends taking it a step further for optimal protection. “It's really hard to protect your lips from the sun by just using a lip balm that has sunscreen because we're constantly talking and licking our lips,” she says. “It's better to protect your lips using a wide-brim hat,” she says.
Below, experts list their tips for avoiding dry, chapped lips:
One hack Mian frequently tells her patients about is lip slugging, which is the process of applying a thick layer of an occlusive moisturizer as a final step in your evening skin care routine to help seal in moisture overnight. Use lip balm with ceramides first and then apply a highly occlusive layer such as Vaseline . “What you're doing is you're using something with ceramides to help heal the lip barrier and then you're applying a protective layer over it to help lock everything in,” says Mian.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-hyaluronic-acid-serums-creams-ncna1290282,"All the glow, none of the grease — the best hyaluronic acid products",SKIN CARE,"If you suffer from chronically dry skin, odds are you’re familiar with hyaluronic acid. The popular ingredient absorbs moisture and draws it into your skin to hydrate it, dermatologists say. Though it’s especially useful for dry skin, it’s a great hydrator for all skin types, says Dr. Mary Stevenson, assistant professor of dermatology at NYU Langone Health. “We don’t have a lot of products like that,” she says.
I spoke to dermatologists about how to use hyaluronic acid in your skin care routine. I also gathered their specific recommendations for the best creams and serums to buy, plus NBC Select staff favorites.
Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring chemical your body produces that cushions and moisturizes the skin. It’s found in our skin, eyes, joints and connective tissue, says Stevenson. It acts as a humectant, drawing in water like a sponge, she says.
Despite its name, hyaluronic acid should work for virtually all skin types since it isn’t an actual acid. “It’s not like salicylic acid or some of the other acids that can be more exfoliating or abrasive on our skin,” says Stevenson.
Hyaluronic acid is generally well-tolerated by most skin types. Experts recommend looking at the following factors to determine the best products with hyaluronic acid:

Below, we rounded up dermatologist-recommended products with hyaluronic acid, as well as highly rated NBC Select staff picks.
For a lightweight hyaluronic acid serum, board-certified dermatologist Dr. Barry Goldman likes this option from The Ordinary. It’s fragrance-, alcohol- and oil-free, which is beneficial for those with sensitive skin, experts say. “I’ve been using this hyaluronic acid serum every day for about six months and my skin soaks it right up. It’s super lightweight and dries quickly, and has a slight cooling effect, which I love,” says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. “Since I’ve started using it, I’ve noticed that my skin dries out less often, and looks more hydrated overall.”
This gel moisturizer is an NBC Select Wellness Awards winner and a favorite among NBC Select staff. It works as an occlusive, which creates a barrier on the skin and locks in moisture, according to the brand. Malin says the moisturizer’s gel-like consistency feels very lightweight on her skin, and NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio appreciates how it keeps her skin soft and hydrated for hours after applying, even during dry winter months.
NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson has used this serum for years. “I became obsessed with Skinceuticals back during my beauty editor days,” says Swanson. “This serum is great on its own or in addition to other hydrators.” She says it also helped keep her skin moisturized while on Accutane.
This serum is a favorite of NBC page Ella Morrissey, who struggles with dry skin. She applies one to two pumps on her face and neck at night before bed, and wakes up with smooth, hydrated skin that doesn’t look too shiny, she says. “Especially in the winter, I don’t have those red flaky dry spot flare ups as much anymore after using this product,” says Morrissey.
This serum is a favorite of NBC Select associate SEO reporter Ashley Morris, who purchased it after her esthetician recommended it. She says it’s especially effective during winter when her skin feels drier than normal. In addition to hyaluronic acid, this Dermalogica booster, which has a lightweight oil consistency, also has ingredients like panthenol and algae extract that help reduce the appearance of dehydration lines, according to the brand. Dermalogica recommends using the serum before your moisturizer or adding a few drops to your favorite cream or lotion.
Goldman recommends this Vichy serum because it has mineral water to help hydrate the skin. This oil- and fragrance-free serum is noncomedogenic (which means it won’t clog pores) and has a non-greasy formula that you can wear comfortably on its own or underneath your favorite moisturizer, according to the brand. It has the National Eczema Association seal of approval, so it’s suitable for sensitive skin.
NBC Select editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez uses this gel mask twice a day and says it works wonders on her skin. It has a hyaluronic acid complex and Pentavitin (a plant extract) to moisturize, plus vitamin E and aloe to hydrate dry skin. Rodriguez recommends storing the gel in the fridge “for an added cooling effect.” (If you prefer a serum, Peter Thomas Roth makes one, too.)
Cosrx’s Snail Mucin line is arguably its most popular, but if Morris could only use one hydrating product from the brand, it would be this essence, which she’s been using for years. It’s made from a highly concentrated natural hyaluronic acid, according to the brand, and is hydrating enough to work in both summer and winter. Morris likes massaging it into her skin twice daily — it has a lightweight feel that absorbs quickly, and it blends well with her other products. Plus, one bottle lasts for months, says Morris.
This Tatcha cream “couples antioxidant ingredients with deep moisture in an elegant, non-greasy formula” says Dr. Annie Chiu, a board-certified cosmetic and general dermatologist. The noncomedogenic cream uses a mixture of Okinawa algae blend and hyaluronic acid to capture water and hydrate the skin, according to the brand.
This popular Glossier serum, which has a 4.5-star average rating from 784 reviews at Glossier, has both hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5 (also known as pantothenic acid) for added hydration, according to the brand. It also has a non-sticky formula that you can wear underneath makeup, according to Glossier.
This daily moisturizer has broad-spectrum SPF 30 to protect skin from sun damage. The noncomedogenic lotion has ceramides to help restore the skin’s barrier and niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3 that can calm irritated skin, according to the brand. “Like most people, I’ve heard that you are supposed to use sunscreen everyday, regardless of the weather. This CeraVe AM lotion makes that as painless as possible for me,” says NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who has used the lotion for over three years. “Each pump is just enough lotion to cover my entire face comfortably, not too much, not too little.” Plus, the lotion feels more like a thick, hydrating moisturizer than a sunscreen you might keep nearby for beach day, says Rabinowitz.
Korean skin care brand Glow Recipe, which makes one of our favorite blackhead treatments, also makes a highly rated hyaluronic acid serum. It uses five molecular weights of hyaluronic acid to hydrate each layer of the skin, according to the brand. The serum has a 4.6-star average rating from 1,236 reviews on Amazon.
NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown recommends this hydrating serum for people who want a short yet effective skin care routine. “What I love most about this serum is that it absorbs crazy fast — I just hate making the process longer than it needs to be,“ she says. Lately, she’s been using this serum to combat the dryness of New York winters and although she hasn’t been using it for very long, she says she can already tell it’s helping to boost the effectiveness of her moisturizer because her skin feels normal again, and it looks moisturized too.
Several dermatologists have previously recommended La Roche-Posay as a great drugstore skin care brand, and it’s a favorite among NBC Select staff. This serum has glycerin and vitamin B5 for added moisture in addition to hyaluronic acid, according to the brand. It’s also highly rated, with a 4.6-star average rating from 29,808 reviews on Amazon.
Ilia’s vegan face moisturizer and serum hybrid, which has a 4.6-star average rating from 1,065 reviews at Sephora, is designed to be lightweight and calming, according to the brand. Formulated with lipids, fatty acids and antioxidant extracts, it also addresses uneven texture and redness, according to Ilia, and you can use it both day and night.
NBC Select editor Lindsay Schneider tried this serum after being sent a bottle by the brand, and says it “feels heavenly” on her skin. The serum is lightweight (“not in a sticky way,” she says) and helps to reduce signs of damage by addressing uneven skin tone, fine lines and texture using hyaluronic acid and licorice extract, according to the brand. “I’ve been wearing every day in the morning under my moisturizer, but I really love to put it on right after I wash my face or get out of the shower when my skin is so thirsty and really dry,” says Schneider. “It immediately restores some hydration.”
Hyaluronic acid is most often found in serums and creams. While water-based serums typically have a higher concentration of the active ingredient and are therefore a better option, creams can be great for those who don’t have time to wait for their skin to absorb a serum, experts say.
“I think you get the best bang for your buck with a serum just because you’re getting the most concentrated hyaluronic acid with water and it’s going straight into your skin,” says Stevenson. “[But] sometimes you need a one and done deal [and] for those patients, I think a cream is just fine.”
Serums will often advertise what percentage of hyaluronic acid is in the product. Anywhere from 1% to 2% is a reasonable concentration, says Stevenson. Some products are formulated with hyaluronic acids at different molecular weights — that’s because “different weights penetrate differently, so you want a combination,” according to Stevenson.
“In general, low and medium [molecular weights] penetrate deeper into the lower levels of skin while high molecular weights hydrate the top or surface of the skin,” she says.
Hyaluronic acid is good for anyone who wants to plump and hydrate the skin, according to experts. It’s also great when used in conjunction with more drying ingredients like retinol. “Hyaluronic acid creams work well with retinol and vitamin C products to decrease the irritation that sometimes occurs,” says Goldman. “Hyaluronic acid matched with a retinol is a match made in heaven.”
Though hyaluronic acid gives the skin a healthier and more hydrated appearance, Stevenson says that it isn’t a “permanent fix” for wrinkles and fine lines. “Hyaluronic acid can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles because it’s basically plumping up the cell,” she says. “It will just kind of add moisture back immediately because it’s holding on to these water molecules around your skin cells. It’s basically like blowing up a float toy.”
Stevenson suggests using hyaluronic acid first, followed by an emollient moisturizer (like First Aid Beauty’s Ultra Repair Cream, which has ingredients that bring moisture to the skin) or an occlusive moisturizer like Vaseline, which creates a physical barrier to lock in hydration. If you decide to use hyaluronic acid in conjunction with a product like retinol, Stevenson says you should sandwich the retinol in between the hyaluronic acid and a moisturizer to limit the amount of irritation.
There’s no limitation to how many times you can use hyaluronic acid in a day since it acts as a great hydrator, says Stevenson. She warns that some people may experience a reaction if they’re using hyaluronic acid products in conjunction with harsh ingredients like essential oils or fragrances. “People with eczema, rosacea or extremely sensitive skin might want to apply a product either behind the ear or on their inner wrist for a few days in a row before putting it all over their face,” she says.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-sunscreens-oily-skin-ncna1305286,"The best sunscreens for oily skin, according to derms",SKIN CARE,"Dermatologists tell us time and time again that sunscreen is the most important part of a daily skin-care routine — more than cleansers, serums, or even moisturizers. But some sunscreens may leave an uncomfortable, greasy feeling on the skin, which can be a nightmare for those who are oily or acne-prone. Experts say sunscreens with heavier oils and occlusive ingredients like petrolatum and silicones, which create a physical barrier on top of the skin to hydrate it, can actually feel greasy and heavy on their own or underneath makeup.
I’ve been writing about skin care and sunscreens for over three years, and I spoke to four dermatologists about how to find the best sunscreen that won’t feel greasy or heavy on the skin. To help you narrow down your options, I also gathered their recommendations for the best sunscreens to shop if you have oily skin, as well as NBC Select staff favorites.
When shopping for an oily skin-friendly sunscreen, experts recommend keeping in mind the following:

Listed below are expert-recommended sunscreens for oily skin and NBC Select staff picks.
Experts told me powder sunscreens are lightweight, provide a good amount of coverage and are great for reapplication and touch ups throughout the day, especially if you are wearing makeup. “It absorbs excess oil so it can serve a dual purpose as a finishing powder, actually extending the life of your makeup, and providing sun protection. It’s also portable and won’t leave a white residue on your clothes,” says Dr. Hadley King, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.
This is a mineral sunscreen containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, as well as antioxidants to protect from the sun and free radicals, according to the brand. “It’s great for the body, too, and easy to apply to acne-prone areas like the shoulders and chest without having to worry about leaving white residue on your clothing,” says King.
Type: mineral | SPF: 30 | Active ingredients: zinc oxide and titanium dioxide | Water-resistant: yes (up to 80 minutes)
Former NBC Select manager of editorial operations Shari Uyehara uses this oil-free, mineral sunscreen from Alastin on her combination skin. “I like using this product under makeup or for a day in the sun,” she says. Though it’s a bit thicker and creamier than other sunscreens she’s tried, Uyehara says it rubs in nicely and leaves a soft finish on the skin. It’s fragrance-free, noncomedogenic and has a fast-absorbing formula that protects against ​​UVA/UVB rays, pollution, and blue light, according to the brand.
Type: mineral | SPF: 30 | Active ingredients: zinc oxide | Water-resistant: no
This oil-free formula has broad-spectrum SPF 50 protection, as well as a proprietary antioxidant blend of vitamin E and vitamin C to brighten the skin, according to the brand. The lotion absorbs oils and leaves a matte finish on the skin, according to Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital. Keep in mind, however, that this is a chemical sunscreen containing avobenzone and homosalate, which might irritate sensitive or acne-prone skin, experts told us.
Type: chemical | SPF: 50 | Active ingredients: avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, octocrylene | Water-resistant: yes (up to 80 minutes)
This Neutrogena sunscreen is one of our favorites for acne-prone skin and recommended by Zeichner for those who are prone to breakouts. The lotion is oil- and fragrance-free, plus it’s noncomedogenic, so it won’t clog pores and worsen your acne, says Zeichner. Keep in mind this is a chemical formula, so you’ll want to proceed with caution if you have very sensitive skin, according to our experts.
Type: chemical | SPF: 50 | Active ingredients: avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, octocrylene | Water-resistant: Yes (up to 80 minutes)
Great for sensitive, acne-prone skin types, this oil-free, tinted sunscreen has everything: SPF over 30, broad-spectrum protection and a tint. Plus, “it’s so lightweight that it immediately dries,” says Gmyrek. It has zinc oxide, a mineral compound, and a chemical UV filter called octinoxate — so, though it’s not an all-mineral sunscreen, the sunscreen is still suitable for sensitive skin, according to our experts. Its fragrance-free formula also includes niacinamide, which has natural anti-inflammatory effects, our experts say. If you’re looking for an untinted version, consider EltaMD’s original mineral sunscreen.
Type: mineral and chemical | SPF: 46 | Active ingredients: zinc oxide and octinoxate | Water-resistant: no
This sunscreen from Colorescience, recommended by both King and Farber, is a powder option that you can wear on its own or underneath makeup. It is a mattifying, oil-absorbing and all-mineral formula that’s hypoallergenic and noncomedogenic. The brush’s bristles are also antimicrobial, meaning they can help prevent bacteria or mold from growing, according to the brand. It’s also fragrance-free, untinted and protects the skin against UVA, UVB, infrared, blue light and pollutants, according to Colorescience.
Type: mineral | SPF: 30 | Active ingredients: zinc oxide | Water-resistant: yes (up to 40 minutes)
Another chemical option recommended by Farber, Supergoop’s Unseen Sunscreen is a lightweight, oil-free option that provides broad-spectrum UVA/UVB and infrared protection, and filters harmful blue light, according to the brand. The gel formula, which has a natural finish, also doubles as a face primer to use underneath makeup, according to the brand. If you have sensitive skin, consider the mineral version of this Supergoop sunscreen, which is a favorite of  NBC Select associate reporter Bianca Alvarez thanks to its lightweight consistency and mousse-like texture.
Type: chemical | SPF: 40 | Active ingredients: avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, octocrylene | Water-resistant: yes (up to 40 minutes)
This tinted mineral sunscreen comes recommended by Farber because it’s lightweight, doesn’t leave a white cast and rubs easily into the skin. It’s oil- and fragrance-free, noncomedogenic and leaves a matte finish. It’s also formulated with antioxidants to protect your skin from free radicals caused by UV rays, according to the brand.
Type: mineral | SPF: 50 | Active ingredients: titanium dioxide, zinc oxide | Water-resistant: yes (up to 80 minutes)
This Charlotte Tilbury option combines the benefits of a makeup primer and sunscreen. It has hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin, minimizes the appearance of pores and has a matte finish, says King. Its oil-free formula has SPF 50 protection and it’s infused with vitamins C and E to brighten your skin, according to the brand.
Type: chemical | SPF: 50 | Active ingredients: ‎octinoxate, avobenzone, octocrylene | Water-resistant: no
This SkinMedica sunscreen is another favorite of Uyehara because it feels like a moisturizer but doesn’t leave her skin oily like other sunscreens she’s tried in the past. “I like that it’s thick enough to feel like I’m getting a good base and coverage if I wear it under makeup,” says Uyehara. The sunscreen has antioxidants to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, plus hydrating ingredients like squalane, glycerin and niacinamide, according to the brand.
Type: mineral and chemical | SPF: 34 | Consistency: lotion | Active ingredients: zinc oxide, octinoxate, octisalate | Water-resistant: no
This Beauty Pie mineral sunscreen has the benefits of a primer and sunscreen all-in-one. “It blurs the pores and reduces shine while providing all-mineral UV protection in a non-irritating formula,” says Zeichner. The oil-free sunscreen is completely sheer, so you can wear it underneath makeup or on its own without worrying about a white cast or shiny finish, according to the brand. It’s also infused with soothing vitamin E and niacinamide.
Type: mineral and chemical | SPF: 30 | Active ingredients: ‎octinoxate, titanium dioxide | Water-resistant: no
NBC Select associate SEO reporter Ashley Morris was initially skeptical of how well this option would work on her skin tone because of its lightly-tinted coloring. However, after trying it for the first time, she was hooked: “The tint blended out almost immediately, and I was left with a smooth, grease-free finish for the rest of the day,” she says. The sunscreen uses vitamin C to help even out skin tone and prebiotics to help maintain the skin’s moisture barrier, according to the brand. Morris also loves how well the sunscreen sits under makeup and often uses it as a primer.
Type: mineral | SPF: 30 | Active ingredients: ‎zinc oxide, vitamin C | Water-resistant: no
Korean sunscreens are a favorite among our staff, and Morris especially loves this option from innisfree for her oily skin. “I’m far from a stranger to K-beauty, and this sunscreen is one of the best available, hands down,” she says. “Even when sweating, this sunscreen gives me a subtle, healthy glow that doesn’t devolve into full-on greasiness as the day goes on.” The sunscreen is made with green tea and sunflower seed oil to help hydrate and soothe skin, and has a lightweight formula suitable for all skin types, according to the brand. It’s also free of parabens and leaves no white cast, in Morris’ experience.
Type: chemical | SPF: 36 | Active ingredients: ‎avobenzone, homosalate, ocitsalate | Water-resistant: no
The key to finding the best sunscreen for your oily skin is paying attention to the product’s ingredients and formulation, our experts say. Below, we list their recommendations for what to consider when shopping for the best oily skin-friendly sunscreen.
Whether you choose a mineral or chemical sunscreen is based on your personal preferences. Our experts recommend either type as long as it’s oil-free, lightweight and, ideally, noncomedogenic. If you have very oily skin, mineral sunscreens — also known as physical sunscreens or sunblocks — can reduce some of the shine because they tend to be more drying, says King. “Mineral sunscreens may naturally be easier to tolerate for someone with oily skin because they just sit on top of the skin, it’s not absorbed,” she says.
But mineral sunscreens do have their downsides: They’re likely to leave a white cast on the skin and they can sometimes be too drying, especially when combined with topical acne medications, according to King. “They may also feel chalky, heavy or tacky on the skin, especially at higher SPF levels with higher concentration of zinc oxide,” says Zeichner. However, the latest generation of mineral sunscreens use “micronized particles that don’t feel as thick on the skin,” he says.
Chemical sunscreens rely on active ingredients like avobenzone, benzophenone and methoxycinnamate to protect you from the sun, but they can cause breakouts and irritation, which can be a major negative if your skin is already oily, acne-prone and sensitive, says King. However, they’re less likely to leave a white cast because they absorb into the skin. “Some people with oily skin may prefer the lighter texture of some chemical sunscreens that offer an ultralight feel and a matte finish,” says King.
You should apply a quarter-size amount of sunscreen on your face and a shot glass-size amount for your body at least 15 minutes before sun exposure, according to Gmyrek. “An easy rule to follow is to apply a line of sunscreen along the entire length of your middle and index fingers, and then apply that amount to the full face,” says Zeichner.
If you want the continuous SPF protection that’s promised on the bottle, you should reapply your sunscreen every two hours and after swimming or sweating, according to our experts. You should also wear sun-protective clothing, UV-shielding sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat for the best amount of protection against the sun’s rays, says King.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/sunscreen-dark-skin-tones-rcna96902,18 highly rated sunscreens that won’t leave a white cast,SKIN CARE,"Everyone, no matter your skin type or tone, should use sunscreen daily — including people with melanin-rich skin. That’s because the natural melanin in skin doesn’t provide enough standalone protection from UV rays, which can lead to other consequences, including sun damage, according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Michelle Henry. However, finding one that doesn’t leave a white cast and provides the necessary protection to prevent skin damage can be a journey — and historically speaking, can be difficult.
Below, we spoke to experts about how to shop for sunscreens for dark skin tones and how to best protect melanin-rich skin. We also highlight their recommendations and NBC Select favorites that complement darker complexions.
We only considered sunscreens that protect against both UVA rays (rays that age the skin) and UVB rays (rays that burn the skin). Our experts also recommend keeping the following characteristics in mind:

Below is a roundup of our experts’ favorite sunscreens for dark skin tones. We also included some top-rated sunscreens and NBC Select staff favorites we think you should know about. All of the sunscreens below have at least an SPF of 30.
This chemical sunscreen has a gel consistency and broad-spectrum SPF 50 protection. “I like the Supergroup Unseen because it’s absolutely clear,” says Henry. “It’s almost like a primer, but you’re still getting SPF.” NBC Select associate SEO reporter Ashley Morris loves how well the sunscreen absorbs into her skin, and says the smooth finish allows the sunscreen to double as a great makeup primer.
The sunscreen leaves a natural finish and has ingredients like red algae and frankincense to help soothe and moisturize the skin, according to the brand. Supergoop also makes a body version with SPF 40.
Type: chemical | SPF: 50 | Consistency: gel | Water resistance: 40 minutes
Black Girl Sunscreen, a Black-owned brand that makes sunscreens specifically for people of color, comes recommended by all four dermatologists we spoke to. “To me, Black Girl Sunscreen doesn’t feel like SPF,” says NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown. “It feels like a body lotion that just so happens to have sunscreen in it. The jojoba oil is key — it just feels so nourishing and absorbs relatively fast. It also leaves a really nice sheen on my skin,” says Brown.
Type: chemical | SPF: 30 | Consistency: lotion | Water resistance: 80 minutes
This sunscreen is suitable for all skin types and has active ingredients found in both chemical and mineral sunscreens — zinc oxide (mineral) and octinoxate (chemical). Therefore, it will blend into your skin like a chemical sunscreen, leaving no white cast behind, while giving the protection of a mineral sunscreen by shielding UV rays instead of absorbing and filtering them, according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Mona Gohara. It also has niacinamide, so it particularly helps with acne-prone skin, she says. It also comes in a tinted version with multiple shades and SPFs.
Type: mineral and chemical | SPF: 46 | Consistency: lotion | Water resistance: none
Although this is on the pricier end, it’s worth the money, especially if you want a more glowy complexion, according to Brown. “After a couple of months, my face definitely looked brighter and felt healthier in general,” she says. Start off using a small amount since a little goes a long way.
Type: mineral | SPF: 50 | Consistency: serum-like | Water resistance: n/a
This Colorescience tinted sunscreen comes recommended by board-certified dermatologist Dr. Jeanine Downie because its powder form makes it easy to reapply throughout the day. Although it comes in four shades — fair, medium, tan, deep — Downie says most of her patients (which have melanin-rich skin) are happy with the color match. “It works as a powder by just brushing it all over your whole face and neck and it complements your complexion,” she says. Her patients also like that it reduces shine and oil from their faces. This sunscreen has a hypoallergenic and noncomedogenic formula to avoid irritation and breakouts, according to the brand.
Type: mineral | SPF: 50 | Consistency: powder | Water resistance: 80 minutes
This Cerave mineral sunscreen looks great on dark skin because it has a sheer finish, says Henry. Its formula has a blend of yellow, red and black iron oxides, which creates a tint that’s blendable on all skin tones and helps minimize the chance of a white cast appearing, according to the brand. It’s suitable for those with sensitive skin since it’s noncomedogenic and fragrance-free — it also has ceramides, an emollient that helps improve the skin’s appearance and texture, in its formula, says Henry.
Type: mineral | SPF: 30 | Consistency: lotion | Water resistance: none
This serum-like, fast-absorbing mineral sunscreen blends in easily into my tan complexion and doesn’t create a white cast or cause irritation for my sensitive, eczema-prone skin. It’s one of the more hydrating options in my sunscreen rotation, so I would only recommend it for those with dry skin since it can be a bit too oily for other skin types. Overall, it gives me a dewy, hydrating glow and it sits nicely under my tinted moisturizer without pilling or disrupting my makeup.
Type: mineral | SPF: 50 | Consistency: lotion | Water resistance: none
Downie recommends this fast-absorbing sunscreen because it’s a chemical formula that blends in easily to skin, minimizing the possibility of a white cast. The sunscreen has SPF 34 and is suitable for all skin types; you should apply it as the last step of your skin care routine, according to the brand.
Type: chemical | SPF: 34 | Consistency: lotion | Water resistance: 80 minutes
This oil-free sunscreen is a great option for oily and acne-prone skin, according to Weinstein. It’s noncomedogenic and dries matte on the skin, so it doesn’t leave you looking oily or shiny throughout the day, according to the brand. The same formula also comes in SPF 30 and a sport version that has SPF 70 and is designed to resist sweating, water, rubbing and swiping, according to Neutrogena.
Type: chemical | SPF: 50 | Consistency: lotion | Water resistance: 80 minutes
Because of the tint, this sunscreen looks great on dark skin, according to Henry. It’s formulated with iron oxides, which are mineral pigments that create tint, and titanium dioxide to protect the skin from UVA and UVB rays, according to the brand. It also has vitamin E (a humectant) to keep your skin hydrated since it absorbs water as well as dimethicone, an emollient that helps retain water, she says.
Type: mineral | SPF: 50 | Consistency: lotion | Water resistance: 40 minutes
Suitable for all skin types since it’s noncomedogenic and hypoallergenic, this tinted sunscreen is a favorite of Weinstein’s because it’s hydrating and reduces the risk of a white cast. It’s also a great option for those who want blue light protection (in addition to UVA and UVB protection) since it has antioxidants, like ectoin, which help do so, according to the brand.
Type: mineral | SPF: 36 | Consistency: lotion | Water resistance: 40 minutes
“I’ve struggled with sunscreens leaving white casts, having super strong smells or just irritating my skin overall,” says former NBC Page Mikhaila Archer. “This one is super gentle, blends in seamlessly and smells very fresh, too.” The cream has a lightweight texture that makes it easy to spread, according to Hygee. It also has ingredients like marine algae and beet root extract to hydrate the skin, according to the brand.
Type: chemical | SPF: 50 | Consistency: lotion | Water resistance: N/A
“A little goes a very long way with this sunscreen,” says NBC Select commerce editor Cory Fernandez, who has a medium complexion. “A small squeeze of it covers my entire face without leaving a visible white cast,” he says “The bottle is flat in shape, so it’s also great for travel since it doesn’t take up space in your bag or Dopp kit, according to Fernandez.
Type: chemical | SPF: 70 | Consistency: lotion | Water resistance: 80 minutes
“I wasn’t expecting this sunscreen to work as well as it did, because upon first application, the color was looking very scary on my skin,” says Morris. “However, after giving it a minute or two to absorb, it proved to be a great option — no white cast, no excess greasiness, and no strong chemical smell, and it also held up against the scorching beachfront sun on my recent trip to Jamaica,” she says. Key ingredients in its formula include squalane for hydration and zinc oxide for sun protection.
Type: mineral | SPF: 30 | Consistency: lotion | Water resistance: none
Unlike a tanning oil, which stimulates the body to produce more melanin, sunscreen oils provide sun protection by absorbing rays, according to our experts. This formula from Vacation, which has a 4.8-star average rating from 241 reviews at Ulta, has jojoba oil to hydrate the skin and should dry clear on all skin tones, according to the brand. It’s also free of mineral oil, so it’s a great option for those who worry about clogging their pores. It does have a baby oil scent, so if you’re sensitive to fragrance this may not be your best option.
Type: chemical | SPF: 30 | Consistency: oil | Water resistance: none
I use Good Molecules’ Sheer Mineral Sunscreen daily and love that it’s not greasy and dries clear. It takes a second to rub in but afterwards, it gives me a dewy finish that sits well under my makeup. That dewiness, in part, comes from hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid that doesn’t dry my eczema-prone skin out. It’s also noncomedogenic, so it’s great for those with acne-prone skin.
Type: mineral | SPF: 30 | Consistency: lotion | Water resistance: none
NBC Select editorial operations associate Jem Alabi has been using this sunscreen for two years after initially trying the brand’s face wash, and says it “doesn’t leave a white cast, flake, or feel greasy.” It has a lightweight, non-sticky formula and is designed to work for all skin types, including sensitive skin, according to the brand. “The sunscreen (which is more like a gel) leaves my skin moisturized all day, has helped so much with my hyperpigmentation, and is the perfect consistency for my combination skin,” says Alabi.
Type: mineral | SPF: 50  | Consistency: gel | Water resistance: n/a
When shopping for sunscreen that’s suitable for darker skin tones, our experts recommend considering key factors like the sunscreen type and consistency. Here’s what else to keep in mind while shopping:
You should look for sunscreens with SPF 30 or higher regardless of skin tone, according to our dermatologists. For days where you are outside with more exposure, consider sunscreens with at least SPF 50 protection, says Henry.
That’s because SPF 30 only blocks 97% of UVB rays, while SPF 50 will give you slightly more protection by blocking 98% of UVB rays, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association. However, no sunscreen (regardless of how high the SPF is) can block 100% of the sun’s UVB rays, according to Henry.
Both mineral and chemical sunscreens come with their own benefits and limitations for those with darker skin tones — the choice is ultimately a personal one, according to our experts. Mineral sunscreens will reflect UV light, while chemical sunscreens will absorb it, convert it and then release it.
Chemical sunscreens typically have one of the following chemical filters in their formula: oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and/or octinoxate. Historically, chemical sunscreens don’t leave behind an ashen white appearance on the skin, making them a reliable choice for those with darker skin, says Henry.
A mineral sunscreen will typically have active ingredients like zinc oxide, titanium dioxide or both. It’s best for kids and those with sensitive skin because the skin won’t absorb it, so they can avoid irritation, which is commonly seen with chemical sunscreens. It’s also great for pregnant women because oxybenzone (one of the main filters in chemical sunscreen) is linked to birth defects, according to experts in our guide to pregnancy-safe skin care.
Mineral sunscreens will generally provide more protection against harmful indoor light from common household items like light bulbs and computer screens compared to chemical sunscreens, according to Gohara. If you don’t protect your skin, exposure to this light can lead to conditions like melasma, she says. (Melasma is mostly seen in women who have medium to dark skin tones, according to the AAD.)
The caveat with mineral sunscreens is that they typically leave white casts.
No sunscreen is sweat-proof or waterproof, according to Henry. However, some are water-resistant, which refers to how long the sunscreen will stay on and remain effective even after you get wet, according to the AAD. For example, if a sunscreen has 60 minutes of water resistance, you will need to reapply it 60 minutes after getting wet. If your favorite sunscreen isn’t water resistant, Henry recommends adding another sunscreen on top that is — especially if you plan on engaging in activities that will make you sweat or coming in contact with water.
If you have sensitive skin, our experts recommend using a mineral sunscreen. Since mineral sunscreens sit on top of your skin, they won’t absorb into the skin and, therefore, won’t trigger an unwanted, irritating reaction, according to experts. You should also avoid fragrances and other potential irritants, and when possible opt for a hypoallergenic sunscreen, according to our experts.
Dry skin types should look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin, while those with oily and acne-prone skin should look for noncomedogenic sunscreens because they are typically free of ingredients that would normally clog pores and cause further breakouts.
Some sunscreens have a tint to match your skin color. They will typically have iron oxide, which adds another layer of protection from UV rays or blue light emitted from your screens, says Weinstein. They also typically don’t leave behind white casts due to their pigmented formula.
One of the biggest misconceptions is that people of color, especially those with a darker complexion, don’t need sunscreen. People with darker skin tones have more melanin, which is not only responsible for the skin’s pigment, but also naturally provides sun protection. However, the protection you get from melanin alone is very minimal.
“Skin color is not sufficient protection from UV light to prevent burning or potential skin cancer in the future,” Henry says. Even though you may have melanin-rich skin, you’ll need external help in the form of sunscreen to avoid potential harm.
In fact, 90% of visible signs of aging come from unprotected daily sun exposure, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. These signs come in the form of wrinkles, but in black and brown skin tones it might appear as hyperpigmentation, according to Gohara. Blue light can also worsen hyperpigmentation, specifically in people with dark skin, according to Henry. To combat this, many sunscreen brands use iron oxides to shield against visible light, like blue light.
“Tinted mineral sunscreens tend to blend a little bit better on darker skin tones,” says Weinstein.
They provide the same amount of protection from UVA and UVB rays as nontinted sunscreens, and they also protect the skin from visible light, too, because they are usually formulated with 3% iron oxides, which is the most effective amount, says Weinstein.
Appropriately applying sunscreen is the key to getting the most out of your SPF. Henry recommends layering your SPF on top of your daily face moisturizer.
In line with all of our experts’ guidance, you should reapply sunscreen every two hours. If sweating or swimming, you may have to reapply earlier based on the water resistance of your sunscreen of choice, which typically varies from 40 to 80 minutes. Sprays, misting oils and brush-on powders are usually easier to reapply throughout the day compared to other types of sunscreens, experts told us.

Regardless, sunburns are uncomfortable, but plenty of over-the-counter products quickly soothe skin and encourage healing.
I talked to dermatologists about the best sunburn treatments you can buy and how to know when to see a doctor. I also rounded up their favorite sunburn treatments, like aloe vera gel, moisturizer and anti-itch cream.

Dermatologists recommend thinking about the following factors when shopping for sunburn treatments:
Using dermatologists’ guidance, I rounded up over-the-counter products you can use to treat sunburns. Experts say it’s crucial to stay hydrated while recovering from a sunburn, so be sure to drink plenty of water. If your sunburn is severe or you feel ill, be sure to see a medical expert for further treatment.
All of the experts I talked with recommend treating sunburns with aloe vera, an ingredient known for its cooling, soothing and moisturizing properties. You can use Fruit of the Earth’s aloe vera gel on your face and body, and it dries clear once you rub it into skin. The gel is free from fragrance, alcohols and added color.
If you don’t like the feeling of a gel, brands also offer aloe vera lotions like this one from Sun Bum. As aloe soothes skin, the lotion’s cocoa butter and vitamin E hydrate it to further promote healing. The lotion has a lightweight, non-greasy feel.
Stevenson prefers treating sunburns with creams that are typically sold in a pot, rather than lotions sold in a squeezy or pump bottle. Creams are thicker and more moisturizing than lotions, making them better for dry, inflamed skin, she says.
Cetaphil’s moisturizers are some of our favorites, and this one is great for sunburns since it has aloe vera. It’s also made with vitamin E to hydrate and soothe skin. The cream has a non-greasy feel and absorbs quickly, plus it’s fragrance-free and non-comedogenic, so it won’t clog pores.
Peeling skin is part of a sunburn’s natural healing process. It’s your body’s way of getting rid of cells damaged by UV rays, and while it’s tempting, the worst thing you can do is pick it. Instead, apply a plain, unscented moisturizer to help the skin repair itself, says Farber.
CeraVe’s Moisturizing Cream has ceramides to restore your skin barrier, plus moisturizing hyaluronic acid. The fragrance-free, non-comedogenic cream has a rich texture and you can use it on the face and body.
Moisturizers are also available as sprays, similar to spray sunscreen. Since moisturizer spray is more lightweight than a tub of cream, I find it easier to travel with. I keep a bottle in my beach bag in case my fair skin gets red after a day outdoors.
Vaseline makes a non-aerosol spray moisturizer with aloe vera that hydrates and soothes sunburned skin. After rubbing it in, the spray absorbs quickly and leaves behind a smooth, non-greasy, non-sticky feel.
Hydrocortisone creams help calm itching and irritation, and over-the-counter options are a great place to start when looking for sunburn treatments, says Farber. Cortizone 10’s cream is made with 1% hydrocortisone, the highest concentration allowed in over-the-counter products, and soothing aloe. It’s free from fragrances and dyes.
Like hydrocortisone cream, calamine lotion can relieve itching when applied to irritated skin, says Huang. It also has a cooling effect and may help with peeling skin. This calamine lotion has a liquid consistency and is pink, so be careful about where and when you apply it — the lotion does not dry clear, so you see it on your skin, and it can rub off on fabric. However, cleaning it off surfaces is easy, in my experience, and it’s never stained anything I own.
Farber says cold compresses can relieve inflammation caused by sunburns. This one has a nylon exterior, so you can apply it directly to your skin without wrapping it in a towel. The compress is flexible even when it’s frozen, allowing it to contour to multiple body parts.
If your sunburn blisters, don’t pop or pick at the skin — experts say that doing so can lead to infections or future scaring. Instead, dermatologists recommend trying the below treatments.
If your sunburn is just red and itchy, avoid bandages and stick to moisturizers, says Farber. But if your sunburn blisters, hydrocolloid bandages like these can promote healing. They have a water-resistant seal and can be worn for up to seven days after application, according to the brand. Hydrocolloid bandages can also help reduce scarring.
In addition to bandages, moist dressings like burn pads can help soothe and cool skin, as well as provide a barrier that keeps the area clean and moisturized, says Farber. Spenco’s 2nd Skin Moist Burn Pads have a high water content, and after placing them atop your blistering sunburn, you cover the pad with adhesive tape or stretch gauze. You can purchase the burn pads in small, medium and large sizes.
Petroleum jelly has occlusive properties, so it helps seal water into a disrupted skin barrier, says Farber. If blisters open into skin erosions, you can help prevent a secondary infection by applying Aquaphor to affected areas. The ointment is primarily made from petroleum jelly and is free from fragrances, preservatives and dyes.
While the occasional, mild sunburn may not be a big deal, studies show that a history of sunburns — especially blistering sunburns — can increase your risk for skin cancers later in life. That’s why it’s important to focus on preventing them. Here’s how:
A sunburn is damage to your skin from exposure to excessive UV radiation, says Cameron. It’s an inflammatory response that occurs because UV radiation from UVA and UVB rays damages the DNA inside skin cells, thus leading to a sunburn and sometimes pigment formation (a tan), says Stevenson. “It’s your body trying to defend itself,” she says. “Everyone’s skin type is different, but if you’re getting color or burning, you are getting UV damage.” You can get a sunburn from the sun, as well as tanning beds, says Huang.
Different degrees of sunburns are determined by the depth of damage to the skin. There are three degrees of sunburns — these degrees apply to other types of burns as well, like those from chemicals or a fire. The deeper the sunburn, the more severe it is and the longer it takes to heal, says Huang.
Yes — the more fair your skin is, the more prone you are to sunburns, says Huang. However, anyone can get a sunburn, regardless or how fair or dark their skin is, and anyone can be at risk for skin cancer.
Sunburns can be dangerous to your short-term and long-term health, experts told us.
Short-term: Mild sunburns appear as skin redness and tenderness, while more severe sunburns can lead to a fever, chills or nausea. Overall, sunburns are dangerous because certain symptoms can affect multiple systems in the body. For example, extensive blistering and fluid loss can lead to dehydration, which impacts the body’s circulatory and nervous systems. If you begin to experience a fever, chills, nausea or fatigue, it’s time to see a doctor about your sunburn.
Long-term: “Sunburns can significantly contribute to your risk of skin cancer and premature aging of the skin,” says Huang. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in medical care, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association, but consistently shielding yourself from UV rays can help prevent it, he says.
First thing first — try to avoid UV exposure as your sunburn is healing, says Huang. Don’t spend extended periods in the sun; if you have to, wear sun-protective clothing and sunscreen.
Next, stick to over-the-counter sunburn treatments and don’t experiment with home remedies, especially those that involve apple cider vinegar and witch hazel, which can irritate sunburned skin, says Farber. Also, don't pop blisters or pull at peeling, flakey skin as your sunburn heals.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-sunscreen-sticks-rcna155685,Are sunscreen sticks better than lotions? Experts explain,SKIN CARE,"Applying sunscreen is a crucial step in your skin care routine regardless of the formulation, whether it’s a spray, serum, lotion or stick. Without sunscreen, you risk damaging your skin from UV rays, according to our experts. But if you’re looking for a quick, mess-free and convenient option, sunscreen sticks are the best for you.
To help you find the best sunscreen stick for your skin care needs, I spoke to seven dermatologists about how to shop for one and everything you need to know about this specific type of sunscreen, including how much you need to apply for it to be effective.
SKIP AHEAD The best sunscreen sticks | How to shop for sunscreen sticks
I spoke to board-certified dermatologists about sunscreen sticks and what factors to consider when shopping for this formulation. Below, I share their recommendations:
We rounded up the best sunscreen sticks that our experts recommend. All of our options are SPF 30 or higher and offer broad-spectrum protection.
This stick sunscreen is recommended by Yang and board-certified dermatologist Dr. Morgan Rabach because it’s easy to apply, goes on well and glides over makeup. It’s also very lightweight and hydrating without leaving behind a residue, says Yang. Aside from its active ingredients to protect your skin from unwanted damage, it’s formulated with WetForce and HeatForce technology. WetForce combines negative ions and positive ions (from sweat and water) to create an additional layer of protection to make it more effective. At the same time, HeatForce becomes activated by external heat to strengthen the barrier, according to the brand.
Sunscreen type: Chemical | SPF: 50 | Key ingredients: Wetforce and Heatforce technology | Noncomedogenic: Yes | Water-resistance: 80 minutes
This sunscreen comes recommended by board-certified dermatologist Dr. Marnie Nussbaum for those with sensitive skin. It’s also a great option for multiple skin tones since the formula has microfine zinc oxide. By having this ingredient, the sunscreen dries with a clear finish to minimize white casts, according to the brand. Reviewers say the sunscreen is easy to blend and work into the skin if a white cast appears.
Sunscreen type: mineral | SPF: 50 | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid and ceramides | Noncomedogenic: yes | Water-resistance: 40 minutes
The formula’s hydrating ingredients include hyaluronic acid, aloe and coconut water, which make it especially great for those with dry skin, according to Yang. She says that the non-greasy and fast-absorbing sunscreen also has antioxidants for added protection from environmental stressors. Those skin-damaging stressors include blue light, infrared and pollution, according to the brand.
Sunscreen type: chemical | SPF: 50 | Key ingredients: aloe, glycerin, hyaluronic acid | Noncomedogenic: yes | Water-resistance: n/a
If you have dry or sensitive skin, consider this mineral option from Cetaphil, which Marmur recommends. It’s especially great for these skin types and individuals of all ages because its formula has hypoallergenic ingredients, including zinc oxide, beeswax and vitamin E, she says. However, it can produce a white cast on the skin, according to Marmur. To help offset this, you can use your fingertips to work the product in since it blends quickly, according to the brand.
Sunscreen type: mineral | SPF: 50 | Key ingredients: vitamin E | Noncomedogenic: yes | Water-resistance: 80 minutes
Dr. Jart+ is one of our favorite Korean sunscreens because it hydrates the skin and blurs pores, which makes it great to apply underneath makeup, according to the brand. I love using this sunscreen because it doesn’t leave a white cast on my medium-tan complexion and, since it’s a stick, it’s easy to apply and reapply throughout the day. It’s also travel-friendly.
Sunscreen type: chemical | SPF: 40 | Key ingredients: hyaluronic Acid | Noncomedogenic: no | Water-resistance: 80 minutes
According to Mraz, this sheer stick is easy to apply and provides weightless and transparent protection. When you first apply it, it has a silky smooth texture but then leaves your skin with a matte and blurring finish. You can apply this on your face, neck, and décolleté as a base layer, but it’s especially good for tricky spots like your ears.
Sunscreen type: mineral | SPF: 56 | Key ingredients: bisabolol and ginger root extract | Noncomedogenic: yes | Water-resistance: 80 minutes
If you’re looking for a sunscreen stick that will make applying your sunscreen much faster, consider this option from Nussbaum. This is because it provides wide coverage since the stick itself is bigger, she says. Reviewers say it is easy to apply, is great for preventing sunburns and damage and holds up throughout the day on their bodies and faces.
Sunscreen type: mineral | SPF: 50 | Key ingredients: vitamin E | Noncomedogenic: yes | Water-resistance: 80 minutes
This is a great stick for swimming, sweating and active days outdoors all summer long, says Mraz. The stick provides all-mineral protection from UVA/UVB rays, pollution, blue light and infrared radiation and also has hydrating ingredients that can soften the skin, she says. It also goes on smoothly and is easily blendable for an even, sheer and dry-touch finish without leaving behind a white cast, according to the brand.
Sunscreen type: mineral | SPF: 50 | Key ingredients: squalane, jojoba esters, iron oxides | Noncomedogenic: yes | Water-resistance: 80 minutes
This lightweight sunscreen is quick and easy to apply since its ergonomic curved shape helps cover hard-to-reach and difficult areas, according to the brand. It’s also great for those who want a hydrating and soothing sunscreen that leaves them with a matte finish. It sits nicely under and over makeup and does not leave a white cast or sticky residue, says Yang.
Sunscreen type: chemical | SPF: 50 | Key ingredients: ectoin, allantoin, sunflower seed oil and camellia seed oil | Noncomedogenic: n/a | Water-resistance: 80 minutes
This is great for those worried about their sunscreen leaving a white cast because it is very sheer while still protecting you from the sun, says Nussbaum. It’s also a good choice if you’re looking for a stick that can compliment your daytime events since it glides seamlessly over makeup, provides invisible coverage and reduces the appearance of oil & shine, says Mraz.
Sunscreen type: chemical | SPF: 40 | Key ingredients: marina bamboo extract, silica powder, meadowfoam estolide | Noncomedogenic: yes | Water-resistance: 40 minutes
This Neutrogena sunscreen is Rabach’s favorite to use and recommend. Reviewers say it’s suitable from head to toe and is especially great for travel since it’s safe for the whole body. This makes it easy when packing since you don’t need to bring multiple sunscreen options with you. Its wide face covers a lot of surface area in one pass and glides smoothly on your face and body, according to the brand.
Sunscreen type: chemical | SPF: 50 | Key ingredients: paraffin | Noncomedogenic: n/a | Water-resistance: 80 minutes
This non-sticky, non-greasy coconut milk-scented sunscreen is suitable for your face and body and leaves it looking glossy and dewy, according to Marmur. For the best results, swipe the sunscreen on your hand before applying it to your face and body. This will help distribute the mica evenly when you apply it.
Sunscreen type: chemical | SPF: 40 | Key ingredients: vitamin E, bisabolol, ginger root extract and mica | Noncomedogenic: n/a | Water-resistance: 40 minutes
“I hate getting sunscreen all over my hands because it makes them greasy, but this sunscreen stick solves that problem,” says NBC reporter Zoe Malin. “It glides onto my skin smoothly and doesn’t leave a white cast behind, so it’s great for wearing under makeup,” she says. The brand also has five other variations, including tinted options.
Sunscreen type: Mineral | SPF: 45 | Key ingredients: Aloe, sunflower seed wax and shea butter | Noncomedogenic: n/a | Water-resistance: 80 minutes
This sunscreen is great for children because its gentle formula protects their faces and is safe for all skin types. Its packaging is also a great way to have kids learn about the importance of protecting your skin from UV rays since the cap or bottle turns pink in harmful UV light, according to experts in our guide to the best sunscreens for kids. This sunscreen has a 4.6-star average rating from over 4,300 reviews on Amazon.
Sunscreen type: mineral | SPF: 50 | Key ingredients: aloe, shea butter, squalane and vitamin E | Noncomedogenic: yes | Water-resistance: 80 minutes
Aside from the type of sunscreen, minimum SPF and broad-spectrum protection, there are a few other characteristics to note. Below, our experts call attention to certain factors to consider when shopping for a sunscreen stick, including ingredients, skin type and aesthetics.
When shopping for a sunscreen stick, consider your skin type, as this will determine the ingredients and formula you want. Below, board-certified dermatologist Dr. Annabelle Garcia breaks down a few things to factor in.
Aside from paying attention to the active ingredient(s) listed, it’s important to look at the additional ingredients because there are some you want for skin care benefits and others you want to avoid to prevent irritation.
Consider how you want to look after applying your sunscreen. This is important to pay attention to because some options will leave your skin looking dewy and glowing, while others will have a matte finish, according to Mraz.
While water resistance in sunscreen isn’t a make-or-break factor, you definitely want to consider one that does have this if you plan on getting wet or anticipate sweating, according to Nussbaum.
“For day-to-day purposes, it’s not necessary. However, water resistance does tend to help sunscreen last longer, especially if you are in a humid climate or engaging in activities that cause you to sweat,” says Yang.
Although water-resistant sunscreens tend to last longer than those without, Rabach says it’s important to remember to reapply continuously throughout the day.
Yes. If you use stick sunscreen properly — apply it all over the surface and use enough — this is an effective product to protect your skin against potential damage from UVA and UVB light, according to our experts.
Stick sunscreens are great for children and those on the go because they are easy to apply and reapply, are mess-free and come in an easily portable formulation, according to our experts. They also offer a more targeted application to smaller surface areas like the face, says Yang.
Since it’s in stick form, it tends to have a more waxy consistency and is less likely to run (compared to liquid sunscreens), which is another reason it’s great for your face and, more specifically, the eye area, according to Yang. However, because of its waxy texture, it could feel thicker on the skin, says Nussbaum.
In addition to how it feels, there’s also a difference in one potential error — how much you use.  Compared to spray sunscreens, stick application can be easier since spray options are the most difficult to quantify coverage since there is a loss of aerosolized product during application, according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Jordan Carqueville. However, compared to lotion sunscreens, which are easy to apply and determine the amount of product, stick sunscreens can run a higher risk of missing a spot while applying, according to Carqueville and Nussbaum.
“I don't typically recommend sunscreen sticks as the primary form of SPF — not because they are ineffective, but because most people simply don’t apply enough,” Yang says. “I recommend using a sunscreen lotion or liquid as a base layer and using stick sunscreen as a form of re-application.”
According to Yang, when using a sunscreen stick, you should apply at least four passes to ensure sufficient protection. Rabach says the four-pass rule also aligns with the guidance from the AAD.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-sunscreen-acne-rcna203278,"The best sunscreens for acne-prone skin, according to derms",SKIN CARE,"You’ve likely heard it time and time again: Don’t skip sunscreen if you want to prevent dark spots, sun damage and signs of aging. But there’s one caveat: thick formulas can congest your pores, which may lead to pimples. Still, wearing sunscreen daily is essential, especially if you use products that treat acne, like retinol, Accutane and alpha-hydroxy acids.
“Many acne medications make your skin sensitive to sunburn,” says Dr. Joshua Zeichner, a board-certified dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital. “The right sunscreen can give a mattifying effect and protect the skin without worsening breakouts.”
I talked to dermatologists about how to buy the best sunscreen for acne-prone skin and their favorite options from brands like EltaMD, Neutrogena and La Roche-Posay. I also rounded up sunscreens NBC Select staff swear by while dealing with breakouts.

If you have acne-prone skin, experts told me to prioritize the following while shopping for sunscreen.
Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.
All of the sunscreens below have a SPF rating of at least 30 and offer broad-spectrum protection. They’re either recommended by dermatologists or NBC Select staff who have acne-prone skin.
EltaMD’s fragrance-free, oil-free sunscreen is a top pick among many of the dermatologists I spoke to, including Zeichner, Yoo and Wexler. It contains zinc oxide, a mineral UV blocker that offers a soothing effect on the skin, says Zeichner. It’s also made with niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, two hydrating ingredients.
The sunscreen leaves a transparent finish on skin and is safe for those with acne-prone skin, sensitive skin, rosacea and dark spots, according to the brand. In addition to its clear formula, EltaMD sells a tinted version of this sunscreen, which offers SPF 40. Cory Fernandez, NBC Select commerce editor, uses it daily.
SPF: 46 | Type: mineral-based | Water-resistant: no
I’ve struggled with cystic acne for my entire adult life and have been using prescription acne medication for about four years. Tower 28’s reef-safe, fragrance-free tinted sunscreen is my go-to for daily UV protection. It offers light to medium coverage, which tones down redness and reduces how noticeable my acne and acne scars are. The SPF has also never irritated my sensitive, combination skin or worsened breakouts.
The sunscreen (from one of our favorite AAPI-owned brands) is made with non-nano zinc oxide and soothing aloe vera, plus it’s approved by the National Eczema Association. It comes in 17 shades and has a natural finish — it’s not too dewy that it makes me look oily, and it’s not too matte either. One tube lasts me months since I only need to use a little sunscreen at a time.
SPF: 30 | Type: mineral | Water-resistant: no
Certain acne medications can be drying, so using a sunscreen that doubles as a moisturizer helps combat flaky, dull skin and cut down on your skin care routine. Strachan recommends CeraVe’s moisturizing SPF for daily use. It’s made with ceramides, hyaluronic acid and niacinamide, and is oil-free and fragrance-free. The sunscreen offers a clear finish.
SPF: 30 | Type: mineral-based | Water-resistant: no
I give my skin a break from makeup a few days a week, and instead of applying my tinted sunscreen, I use this one from Supergoop. It’s so lightweight that I forget I’m wearing it and it has a matte finish.
The sunscreen is white when it comes out of the tube, but it’s blendable and becomes totally sheer as I rub it into my skin. It also has a light smell due to the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide it’s made with — the smell goes away quickly, in my experience, and its formula is fragrance-free overall. While I don’t wear makeup on top of this sunscreen, it doubles as a grippy primer.
SPF: 40 | Type: mineral | Water-resistant: 40 min.
SPF powder is a great option for those with acne-prone, oily skin, says Dr. Hadley King, a board-certified dermatologist. “It absorbs excess oil, so it serves a dual purpose as a finishing powder, actually extending the life of your makeup and providing sun protection,” she says. This SPF from Brush on Block is available as a translucent powder or in a Touch of Tan shade. The built-in brush has a twist-open feature that ensures powder is only released when you want to use it. The brush is also refillable — when it runs out of powder, you can purchase refills online. In addition to a face sunscreen, Brush on Block’s powder makes a great scalp sunscreen.
SPF: 30 | Type: mineral | Water-resistant: Up to 80 min.
Cetaphil’s mineral sunscreen is another one of Strachan’s favorites for acne-prone skin. It’s a basic, no-frills option you can wear on its own or under makeup. The reef-safe, fragrance-free sunscreen is made with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. It offers a lightweight matte finish — the brand describes the SPF’s texture as serum-like. The sunscreen also has vitamin E in its formula to moisturize skin.
SPF: 50 | Type: mineral | Water-resistant: 80 min.
Ashley Morris, NBC Select associate SEO reporter, says this sunscreen doesn’t make her acne-prone skin greasy.
“The texture is so lightweight that it blends in well without giving me any added shine,” she says. “It also gives me a chance to use some of my more dewy moisturizers underneath.” The formula contains silica, a powder that absorbs excess oil. Morris also appreciates that the bottle is a portable size so she can bring it with her for constant reapplication.
SPF: 60 | Type: chemical | Water-resistant: 80 min.
Zeichner recommends this chemical sunscreen from Neutrogena because it’s specifically formulated for acne-prone skin. It’s made with avobenzone, an organic sunscreen filter that’s “extremely” effective in providing broad-spectrum UV protection, he says. The sunscreen has a matte finish, and it’s oil-free and fragrance-free.
SPF: 30, 50 and 55 | Type: chemical | Water-resistant: up to 80 min.
“This sunscreen keeps skin dry, even in heat and humidity, making it great for oily, acne-prone skin,” says Wexler. It’s made with perlite and silica, lightweight powders that help absorb excess oil on skin and reduce shine, according to La Roche-Posay. The oil-free, fragrance-free sunscreen has a non-greasy, dry touch texture.
SPF: 60 | Type: chemical | Water-resistant: up to 80 min.
Morris initially tried this sunscreen while on vacation in Jamaica last year, and loves how well it holds up in hotter, sunnier climates. “It applies without any white cast, and doesn’t get super oily even after spending hours on the beach,” she says. It has a non-comedogenic formula and broad-spectrum protection, according to the brand. Morris also likes the sunscreen’s lightweight texture, and how it doesn’t leave any sticky or stuff residue after applying.
SPF: 40 | Type: chemical | Water-resistant: no
Yes, sunscreen can cause breakouts in those with acne-prone skin. There are two main reasons why sunscreen-related acne occurs.
That said, wearing sunscreen every day is non-negotiable — you must wear it to protect your skin from UV rays. That’s why it’s important to find a sunscreen that works with your skin type.
Yes, some prescription and over-the-counter acne medications can make your skin photosensitive, meaning sensitive to sunlight and more likely to burn, says Strachan. This includes products that contain chemical exfoliants like alpha-hydroxy acids (including glycolic acid) and beta-hydroxy acids (including salicylic acid), as well as topical and oral retinoids like adapalene, Accutane (isotretinoin) and Tretinoin. Antibiotics used to treat bacterial acne like Tetracycline, particularly doxycycline, can also cause photosensitivity, says Strachan.
The first time you use a new type of sunscreen, spot test it on a small patch of skin before applying it to your entire face, says Yoo. Wear it for a few hours indoors — if you don’t notice any redness, stinging or small red bumps pop up, your skin likely won’t react to it long term.
Before applying sunscreen to your face, cleanse with a gentle face wash to remove excess oils and dirt, which can contribute to clogging pores, says Yoo. Then apply sunscreen and let it dry for about 15 minutes before you spend time outside. Note that sunscreen should always be the last step in your daily skin care routine.
At the end of the day, thoroughly wash your face to remove sunscreen before following the rest of your nightly skin care routine, says Yoo.
Regardless of which type you purchase, sunscreen is important to wear daily — Zeichner recommends applying a quarter-sized dollop of SPF to your face. If you’re spending time in the sun, you should reapply every two hours or immediately after heavy sweating or swimming.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-ingrown-hair-treatments-prevention-rcna101598,How to treat and prevent ingrown hair at home,SKIN CARE,"Finding an ingrown hair a few days after shaving, waxing or epilating is frustrating. It’s caused by hair curling into and getting trapped underneath the skin, and it can be itchy and painful. Thankfully, ingrown hairs, also commonly called razor bumps, are treatable at home, similar to razor burn. But don’t expect them to go away overnight. Being patient while using ingrown hair treatments is key to preventing infection and scarring later on.
To learn about how to treat and prevent ingrown hairs, I talked to four dermatologists. Using their guidance, I rounded up ingrown hair treatments and preventatives, all of which are either recommended by dermatologists or tested by NBC Select staff.

The best way to treat an ingrown hair is to free the trapped hair from underneath the skin in two steps (listed below).Consider the following while shopping for ingrown hair treatments:
To recommend the below ingrown hair treatments, I chose products that dermatologists recommend, we’ve used ourselves or are highly rated and meet expert guidance. Since ingrown hairs can occur in any hair-bearing area, I note whether each product is meant for your face or body. Make sure to avoid removing hair in the area where you have an ingrown until it’s fully healed, experts told me.
Neosporin is my go-to antibiotic ointment for ingrowns, cuts and burns. It contains bacitracin, an over-the-counter topical antibiotic you can apply to red and inflamed ingrown hair, says Dr. Joshua Zeichner, the director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology and an associate professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital. The ointment also has a blend of other antibiotics that protect against infection and help heal skin, plus it can minimize the appearance of scars if you use it one to three times daily, according to the brand.
Use on: Face and body
Hydrocortisone creams can help reduce inflammation and itching associated with ingrown hairs, says Chang. This option from Cortizone 10 is made with 1% hydrocortisone, which is the highest concentration of the ingredient found in over-the-counter products, according to our experts. In addition to ingrowns, I’ve used Cortizone 10 on bug bites, sunburns and razor burn, and you can apply it to eczema. The fragrance-free ointment is made with aloe, which helps soothe skin, according to the brand.
Use on: Face and body
This fragrance-free salicylic acid spot treatment comes recommended by Ashley Morris, NBC Select associate SEO reporter. “It stops my ingrowns from forming into bigger bumps and fades the dark spots left behind by old ingrowns,” she says. “The rollerball applicator is my favorite part. It applies really smoothly and the tonic dries almost right away.” The rollerball applicator also allows you to target the ingrown without touching your skin and potentially transferring bacteria from your hands to the affected area. Topicals’ clear tonic contains zinc, a mineral that can minimize irritation; glycolic acid to further exfoliate; and niacinamide to brighten the appearance of the bump, according to the brand.
Use on: Face and body
“I’ve used Prid’s Drawing Salve for everything — cystic acne, slivers and even ingrown hairs,” says Lauren Swanson, NBC Select editorial director. “It’s very tar-like and smells gross, but it truly is a miracle worker. I slap this stuff on over ingrown hairs, put on a Band-Aid and then go to bed. When I wake up, it’s gone.” The salve is made with natural ingredients like sulfur, which relieves itch, silicea, which draws out hair trapped underneath the skin’s surface, and arnica, which reduces pain and swelling, according to the brand. Make sure you cover the area you apply this drawing salve to with a bandage or gauze — it’s brown in color and can stain fabric.
Use on: Face and body
Fur’s Ingrown Concentrate contains tea tree oil, which has anti-inflammatory properties and helps prevent ingrown hairs from getting infected, says Chang. The treatment is also made with chamomile extract to minimize redness and coconut, tamanu and grape seed oils to hydrate and soften skin, according to the brand. Before applying the concentrate, Fur recommends exfoliating with the included finger mitt in the shower. Then, once you dry off, apply a few drops to bumps.
Use on: Face and body
Mario Badescu’s Drying Lotion is my favorite overnight treatment for ingrowns. It dries them up while I’m sleeping and makes them appear much less red and swollen in the morning. The lotion has salicylic acid to remove dead skin cells sitting on top of and around ingrown hairs, and calamine, an ingredient that reduces itching and irritation, according to the brand. You dip a cotton swab into the pink sediment at the bottom of the bottle and dab it directly onto the ingrown. The lotion dries quickly but leaves a light pink, chalky residue behind, which is why I prefer to use it at night.
Use on: Face and body
Your skin care routine matters when it comes to hair removal, says Weinstein. If your skin isn’t in good shape when you remove hair, new hair won’t grow back normally. Preventing ingrowns mostly centers around caring for your skin before, after and in between hair removal sessions. Here are some factors to consider when shopping for products that help you do so:
Anyone prone to ingrowns on their body may want to consider a salicylic acid body wash, which reduces the amount of bacteria on skin and ensures it’s clean before you remove hair, says Weinstein. This one is made with moisturizing ingredients like glycerin, shea butter and soybean oil. The fragrance-free body wash has a gentle, creamy, lotion-like consistency and it doesn’t get sudsy, in my experience. It comes in a pump, which I find helps me control how much body wash I’m dispensing.
Use on: Body
If you get ingrowns on your face (especially after shaving facial hair), experts recommend opting for a gentle acne face wash like this one, which contains salicylic acid. It has a jelly consistency when it comes out of the pump, but it gets foamy as you massage it into your skin with your fingers or a facial cleansing brush, in my experience. The face wash helps eliminate oil buildup on skin and unclogs pores, according to the brand.
Use on: Face
While experts say manual exfoliants can irritate ingrown hairs, you can use them on unaffected skin between shaves. Selfmade (one of our favorite AAPI-owned brands) sent me its True Grit Resilience Scrub to try, and it has a gentle yet gritty feel that makes my skin soft after I massage it in. The scrub contains chemical exfoliants like ascorbic acid, an AHA that’s the most powerful form of vitamin C. It also has tea tree oil to unclog hair follicles, according to the brand. I use this scrub on my legs and underarms once or twice a week, but you can use it daily so long as you don’t have dry or sensitive skin.
Use on: Face and body
I use Billie’s Ultimate Skin Solution to treat and prevent ingrowns on my legs and underarms. The spray contains salicylic acid and aloe vera to dissolve built-up dead cells while calming the skin, according to the brand. I find that the spray bottle makes this solution easy to apply to large and small patches of skin, and it dries quickly. The spray also doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue and never causes my sensitive skin to sting after application.
Use on: Face and body
After you shave, apply a BHA-based product to close the hair follicles that opened when they were exposed to warm water, says Weinstein. Doing so prevents bacteria or dirt from getting into the follicles. This chemical exfoliant from Paula’s Choice has salicylic acid (a BHA) and green tea extract to calm redness. The formula is lightweight and feels refreshing on my skin when I apply it using a cotton pad. It also absorbs into my skin quickly, so I can layer other products on top of it, like moisturizer. While the exfoliant is mainly meant for your face and neck, you can also apply it to other parts of the body post-shave.
Use on: Face and body
Those with very sensitive skin may not be able to tolerate BHAs to close hair follicles after shaving. Witch hazel is an alternative ingredient that does the same job, but it’s gentler on skin, says Weinstein. Thayer’s Witch Hazel Facial Toner comes recommended by Cory Fernandez, NBC Select editor. He applies it with a cotton pad immediately after shaving, and when he does so consistently, he notices that less ingrowns pop up on his face. The hydrating toner has an alcohol-free formula that minimizes the appearance of pores, as well as evens skin tone and texture, according to the brand. It’s available in different versions with additional ingredients like rose petal, coconut water, lavender and cucumber.
Use on: Face and body
Moisturizing should always be the last step of a hair removal session, experts told me. CeraVe’s cream is a noncomedogenic option for the body, face and hands. It’s made with hyaluronic acid to help skin retain moisture and ceramides to support the skin’s outer layer, according to the brand. The cream earned the National Eczema Association’s Seal of Acceptance, meaning it’s suitable for sensitive skin.
Use on: Face and body
Shaving is the most common type of at-home hair removal, and improper technique is often the culprit of razor bumps and burns. To help you avoid both, here are some expert shaving tips. Also remember that you shouldn’t shave (or do any type of hair removal) in the area where you have an ingrown until it’s fully healed, experts told us.
Ingrown hair — also known as razor bumps — curls back or grows sideways into the skin instead of growing upward like it’s supposed to, says Chang. Ingrowns are trapped underneath the skin’s surface, which can lead to inflammation. They also vary in appearance — some appear as skin-colored bumps with a black center (which is the trapped hair), others look like small red pimples or large, painful pus-filled bumps, says Chang.
Most people associate ingrown hair with shaving, but it’s actually more common after removing hair via waxing, plucking, threading or epilating, says Zeichner. That’s because the deeper the level of hair removal, the more likely you are to get an ingrown.
When you shave, you cut hair level with the skin, so it’s already above the surface. But waxing, tweezing, threading and epilating removes hair from the follicle, which is deep underneath the skin, says Zeichner. Hair then has to grow back from that follicle and make its way through the surface of the skin. If that process does not happen correctly, the free edge of the new hair can become trapped, grow into skin and result in an ingrown hair, he says.
That’s not to say you can’t get ingrowns from shaving. Cut hair can still curl back under the skin and start to grow beneath the surface, especially if you’re practicing improper shaving technique, including using a dull razor, shaving in the wrong direction or dry shaving (shaving without cream or gel to lubricate skin), says Weinstein.
You can get ingrown hairs on any hair-bearing region of the body, says Chang. But they’re more likely to occur in areas where hair is coarse, like the beard area on the face and neck, at the nape of the neck if you have short hair, the pubic area, the legs, the armpits and the chest.
Anyone can get ingrown hairs. However, those with naturally curly or wavy, thick and coarse hair are the most prone to ingrowns, says Weinstein. Wavy and curly hair is more likely to curl into the skin compared to straight hair.
No, you should never pop, pick, pluck or pull at an ingrown hair, our experts unanimously agreed. Doing so can make ingrowns worse and prolong the healing process. It can also lead to infections, discoloration and scarring. Picking, tweezing and squeezing ingrown hairs also commonly results in folliculitis, an inflammation and infection of the hair follicles that looks like a bumpy rash and can be itchy or painful, says Weinstein.
You should also never attempt to dig an ingrown hair out from under your skin, even if you clearly see it underneath the skin surface, says Change. Ingrown hairs should only be removed by your dermatologist in-office using a sterile needle or scalpel.
Avoid harsh, irritating ingredients while treating ingrown hairs, which can worsen irritation and inflammation, says Chang. This includes products with heavy fragrances and strong alcohols like rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide, as well as physical exfoliants and abrasive scrubs, says Weinstein. (Physical exfoliants are fine to use to prevent ingrown hairs, but not to treat an active ingrown hair.) She also recommends steering clear of homemade or DIY ingrown hair treatments like apple cider vinegar, which don’t work, in her experience.
Ingrown hairs range in severity. Mild ingrown hairs may not cause irritation, inflammation or pain, but more severe, painful ingrowns can become infected and look like pink bumps around the hair follicles (folliculitis) or pus-filled bumps. That’s when you should see a dermatologist for treatment, which can include prescription-strength antibiotic ointment or a cortisone shot to reduce inflammation in very severe cases.
You should consult a dermatologist about ingrown hairs if you get them persistently or if you get many in one area, says Chang. They may recommend a more permanent hair removal method, like laser hair removal or electrolysis. And if you develop a red bump and are unsure about its diagnosis, see a medical professional before attempting to treat or diagnose it at home.

Experts weigh in,SKIN CARE,"We don’t always have the answers, but we have some people on speed dial who do — which is why we present to you our series FYI where we have experts explain if lip balm is actually bad, how often should you wash your hair and more.
Growing up, I constantly heard my mom reminding me to apply sunscreen before I walked out the door. She still reminds me to apply sunscreen when I’m sitting on the deck or lying on my beach towel outside.
From my conversations with board-certified dermatologists, I know firsthand the importance of protecting my skin from the sun. I constantly make sure to include one into my skin care routine, but have always wondered if it’s necessary when all I’m doing is sitting at my desk or lounging around at home. That’s why I asked four dermatologists whether it’s important to wear sunscreen inside and other ways to protect your skin indoors.

Yes. Even indoors, you should wear sunscreen, especially if you’re sitting by a window or using a digital screen for an extended period, according to Del Campo. And don’t think that a gloomy winter day or summer thunderstorms are reasons not to apply sunscreen indoors, says Gmyrek.
It’s important for three different reasons. UVA rays and UVB rays can still pass through glass and expose your skin to its harmful rays, and the blue light that gets emitted through screens can also impact your skin’s health, he says.
This EltaMD sunscreen is an expert-recommended and NBC Select staff-favorite option. “It provides excellent protection without clogging pores and is enriched with niacinamide for added skin benefits,” says Dr. Danilo Del Campo, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Chicago Skin Clinic.
This mineral sunscreen is great for those with sensitive skin because it doesn’t have common irritants like fragrances or chemical filters and has soothing, moisturizing ingredients like aloe vera, according to the brand. Not only do reviewers love its gentle formula, but they also love how well it holds up for family members of all ages. It’s water-resistant for up to 80 minutes, too.
This oil-free sunscreen is noncomedogenic, meaning it won’t clog pores and combines hydration with sun protection, making it ideal for daily use indoors and outdoors, according to Del Campo. The gel lotion also has a refreshing, water-like feel that doesn’t leave behind any heaviness or greasy residue, according to the brand. Reviewers say it almost doubles as a moisturizer with SPF and sits well under makeup; however, you will want to wait a second before applying any additional products on top of it. It has a 4.5-star average rating from over 5,700 reviews on Amazon.
As a beauty writer, my family and I have tried dozens of sunscreens, and this one is unanimously in the top five for everyone, including my young elementary-aged siblings and my mature-skinned grandparents. This is because it’s moisturizing and gentle on sensitive skin, and it blends in easily thanks to its lightweight, mousse-like consistency. It also doesn’t leave a white cast on my medium complexion (the same goes for my relatives).
Del Campo recommends this reef-safe sunscreen because it’s water-resistant for up to 80 minutes, making it versatile for various activities. Although it’s also suitable for all skin types, this is especially great for dry skin. This is because it has vitamin E, glycerin, dimethicone and the brand’s proprietary thermal spring water, which hydrates and soothes the skin while locking in moisture, according to La Roche-Posay.
This sunscreen, which also protects the skin from infrared rays, helps reduce the appearance of sun-damaged skin and fine lines, according to the brand. “I love that this sunscreen is super lightweight and easy to blend,” says NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio. “It also doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin or exacerbate my rosacea, which is very common with other sunscreens.”
This NBC Select-staff favorite, formulated with ingredients like prebiotics, vitamin C, and vitamin E, has a peach tint that helps reduce white casts on all skin tones, leaving a sheer finish.
“I love how lightweight this sunscreen is and how the tint gives me a little bit of coverage without looking like I have anything on,” says NBC Select editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez. “My skin instantly looks brighter after I apply it and it helps smooth over any redness on my face.”
This sunscreen, which is suitable for all skin types, protects the skin from UVA, UVB, blue light, pollution and infrared damage, according to the brand. Not only is it excellent at acting as a line of defense from potential damage, but it’s also a worthwhile option for those who prefer a tinted sunscreen and want to avoid the risk of a white cast.
NBC Select commerce editor Lindsay Schneider enjoys using it because it dispenses as a traditional white sunscreen but then blends and adapts to her skin tone the more she works it in. “Unlike other options I’ve tried, it’s not overly sticky and importantly doesn’t smell, which in my experience a lot of tinted sunscreen formulas tend to do,” she says.
Sunscreens come in three forms: mineral, chemical and hybrid, which is a combination of both. According to our experts, the choice depends on personal preference and skin type. Whichever option you choose, it should have an SPF rating of 30+ and offer broad-spectrum protection.
“Think of it like choosing between an umbrella and a raincoat — both protect you from rain, but the best choice depends on your needs. An umbrella (mineral sunscreen) might be more cumbersome but gives immediate, broad coverage. In contrast, a raincoat (chemical sunscreen) might be more convenient and comfortable but can take a little while to provide complete protection once put on,” says Del Campo.
The answer is a combination of yes and no. According to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Mary Stevenson, it’s best to apply sunscreen to the areas most exposed, including your face, neck, chest and hands.
Applying a nickel-sized dollop of sunscreen to the face and a generous amount to other exposed areas is essential. As a general guideline, about one shot glass full of sunscreen is recommended to cover the entire body if you’re spending time outdoors. Adjust the amount proportionately if you’re indoors but still exposed to sunlight through windows or near bright screens to ensure all exposed skin is adequately protected, says Del Campo.
If you don’t want to apply sunscreen at home or in the office, you can take simple measures like moving away from windows. But there are other options besides sunscreen, including installing window films or shades to intercept UVA rays, donning UV-protective clothing, and applying screen protectors on your digital devices to lessen blue light exposure, according to Del Campo. Think of it as building a comprehensive defense system against environmental elements, similar to how you would secure your home.
“Just as a seatbelt is crucial for protection in your car, sunscreen is a safeguard for your skin, prepared for unforeseen exposure,” says Del Campo.
While car windows block out UVB rays, they generally do not stop UVA rays, which are responsible for skin aging and damage. Therefore, even inside a car, he says your skin is vulnerable to the harmful effects of sunlight.
Applying sunscreen while driving or taking a road trip is a simple yet effective way to protect against UVA rays. It’s akin to invisible damage—you might not immediately feel the sun’s impact, but exposure can lead to skin issues over time without proper protection.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-hair-oils-rcna101396,"16 best hair oils for healthy, hydrated hair",HAIR CARE,"If you feel like your hair is dry, lackluster and feeling the brunt of damage you’ve put it through, you may want to consider adding hair oil to your self care routine. Unlike hair serums, which form a protective coating on top of strands, hair oils penetrate deeply into the hair to increase moisture levels, reduce breakage and keep your scalp hydrated and healthy, says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Dylan B Alston.
Your hair’s natural oils play a crucial role in moisturizing the hair and protecting it from day to day damage, but sometimes overwashing, hot tool use or chemical processing can strip them.  That’s where hair oils come in. They can restore lost moisture and soften the hair, which is ultimately a sign of healthy hair. “Regularly applying hair-specific oils can soften the hair, as the oils seal the gaps between cuticle cells,” says Alston. This, in turn, can make your hair look and feel healthier.
To help you find the right product for your hair type, I spoke to experts about what to look for when shopping for oils, and curated a list of what to shop based on their recommendations and guidance.

Experts say introducing a hair oil into your regimen can help restore your hair’s moisture and nourish the hair and scalp. When shopping for the best hair oil, experts recommended considering the following factors:
I spoke to hair stylists and dermatologists about their favorite hair oils — for various hair types and textures, including curly, thick and textured hair — and put together their recommendations below. I also included a few products that I and other NBC Select editors love, all of which align with expert guidance.
The Moroccanoil Treatment Hair Oil comes recommended by Dr. Geeta Yadav, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Facet Dermatology, who says that it helps with shine and strength, while fighting frizz.
For years, I’ve been using it on my 2B hair that’s dry, thick and constantly exposed to heat. Its main ingredient is argan oil, which is rich in vitamin E and fatty acids that keep hair hydrated. I typically use it on damp, freshly washed hair and work it in from the middle of my hair to the ends, but you can also use it on dry hair as a frizz tamer and all-around smoother, according to the brand.
Hair type: medium to thick hair | Scent: spicy amber with sweet florals
This NBC Select Wellness Award winner for best hair treatment only contains five ingredients, two of which are tsubaki seed for smoothing and meadowfoam seed oil for hydration. The oil is also formulated to improve shine and strengthen the hair, according to the brand. “I love that it’s super lightweight, so it never weighs down my hair or leaves it feeling greasy,” says NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio. “It’s also a heat protectant, so I don’t have to spray an additional product when I’m using my blow dryer or flat iron.”
Hair type: all hair types | Scent: citrus
To create a salon-like blowout at home, NBC Select editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez uses this hair oil from JVN to help maintain a shiny, smooth, frizz-free blowout. “It’s lightweight, and a couple of drops go a long way. It also smells delicious,” she says.
The oil has hemisqualane to improve hair strength and overall health, as well as hibiscus extract to protect it from damage and color-fading, according to the brand.
Hair type: medium to thick hair | Scent: citrus floral
If you like products that can multitask, then you may want to consider Ouai Rose Hair & Body Oil. Yadav recommends this for those with limited space in their beauty cabinets since it’s an oil that works on both your hair and body. This formula has several different oils in it — like rosehip, shea, camelina, sunflower seed and abyssinian — which are loaded with fatty acids to help condition and soften both hair and skin, according to Yadav. For hair application, Ouai recommends working a few drops into wet or dry hair to smooth down your style. To use as a body oil, apply a few drops as needed to rehydrate the skin.
Hair type: all hair types | Scent: rose and musk
Katelyn Hunziker, hair stylist and owner of Mane Local Salon in New Jersey, says this option is ideal for slightly textured, frizzy hair that lies in the 2A, B or C curl type. In my experience, it’s on the richer side and works great for my long, thick, Middle Eastern hair that’s prone to frizz. I don’t need a lot to reap the benefits — just three drops per application keeps my tips looking sleek, smooth and healthy. Plus, even though it has a thick consistency, I find it absorbs nicely without leaving behind a greasy film. The hero ingredient in the formula is argan oil, which can help regulate excess oil production so it’s a great option if your hair or scalp is prone to grease, says Alston.
Hair type: thick hair | Scent: citrus floral
After noticing some hot tools left her thick, wavy hair frizzy, NBC Select associate reporter Bianca Alvarez began incorporating this hair oil into her routine. The oil combats frizz and humidity while simultaneously protecting hair from heat damage. It also adds shine and hydrates dry hair, according to the brand.
“Other hair oils I’ve tried always either weigh down my hair or make it look like I haven’t washed it for weeks, but this one doesn’t do that,” she says. She adds three to four drops and combs the product through her hair, starting from mid-length and finishing stopping at her ends. Itabsorbs quickly into her hair and adds immediate shine, says Alvarez.
Hair type: all hair types | Scent: citrus floral
This option comes recommended by Hunziker for finer hair because of its light consistency. That being said, it’s suitable for all hair types — especially those who live in humid climates since it’s formulated with amaranth seed extract, which helps get rid of the common side effects of humidity like frizziness and flyaways, according to the brand. While you can use it on wet hair, Living Proof recommends applying it on dry hair for maximum frizz-defying results. If your hair is fine, the brand says to work it into just the ends while thicker, coarser hair types can work it in from root to tip.
Hair type: all hair types | Scent: citrus
If you have a dry scalp, Hunziker recommends this treatment oil that you apply before shampooing on dry hair. To use, rub two to three drops of oil in between your palms to warm it up, part your hair down the middle and massage the oil into the scalp, focusing on the crown. You should leave it on for at least five minutes (or overnight) and then rinse it out. The oil targets hair thinning, breakage and split ends, using ingredients like ashwagandha to stimulate circulation in the scalp, castor oil to improve hair density and dashmool, a mix of holistic plant roots that soothe the scalp, according to Fable & Mane.
Hair type: all hair types | Scent: floral
Peace recommends the Now Solutions Grapeseed Oil that you can also use as a moisturizer for dry skin. It works equally well for hair since it has grapeseed oil, which is an excellent choice for various hair textures, densities and conditions because it is a mid-weight oil that won’t flatten the hair or contribute to grease, says Peace. Grapeseed oil is also rich in fatty acids to help soften the hair and get rid of dryness too, according to the brand. This is a great oil for protective hairstyles because of its thin, lightweight consistency that won’t weigh the hair down, says Leigh Hardges, a hair stylist and natural hair expert based in Chicago.
Hair type: all hair types | Scent: nutty
This K18 formula is designed to mimic the natural structure of a healthy, growing hair strand. It works to smooth frizz and enhance shine, and is suitable on all hair types or textures, according to K18.
I have used this oil several times and love how thick it is, though it can definitely weigh down fine hair, so I recommend starting light with application and avoiding the roots. I notice an immediate difference in my hair’s texture when I use this after flat ironing — usually, my ends are brittle and frayed, but the oil makes them appear healthy, soft and hydrated.
Hair type: all hair types | Scent: floral
This hair oil, which is one of my favorites to use after a blow dry, offers heat protection up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the brand. After using a hot tool, it gives my hair a polished look without weighing it down. It has a floral scent with a musky background, and, as a bonus, the frosted glass bottle looks nice sitting in my bathroom. Unlike most other hair oils I’ve tried, the packaging doesn’t include a spray or dropper, so you’ll have to pour it out of the bottle and into your hand before applying, which can get messy.
Hair type: all hair types | Scent: floral
Hardges says this hair oil is one of her favorites for hair types three to four, especially if it’s color-treated since it “builds strength and seals in hydration well.” It uses sunflower seed oil, olive oil and buriti oil harvested from Brazil to improve texture and manageability, according to  Aveda. Like the hair oil from Authentic Beauty Concept, this doesn’t have a dropper, so be careful to avoid over-application.
Hair type: thick, coarse hair | Scent: clean
Rosemary oil is helpful in preventing dandruff and scalp fungi as well as stimulating blood flow, which can support healthy hair growth, says Hardges, who recommends this Mielle formula. It is especially good for adding moisture to types 3A to 4C hair and those who style their hair in braids or weaves, according to the brand. There are a few different ways to use this: You can apply it on the ends and leave it on for 10 minutes to improve luster, or you can use it as a scalp treatment by dividing your hair into four sections, massaging it into the scalp, combing through your hair and styling as normal without rinsing it out.
Hair type: all hair types | Scent: mint
This hair oil, which has a 4.6-star average rating from over 600 reviews on Amazon, acts as a conditioning treatment or a hydrating gloss on all hair types and textures, including curly hair, according to the brand. Reviewers love the honey scent and say it’s not overwhelming when adding a few drops to their hair; instead, it lingers subtly throughout the day. You can apply this hair oil to damp or dry hair.
Hair type: all hair types | Scent: honey
Hardges is a fan of this formula because it contains castor oil — a well-loved ingredient in the haircare world for its ability to support healthy hair growth. It’s also an antibacterial and high in vitamin E to help improve conditions like dandruff and dryness, according to the brand. Aside from castor oil, the formula includes lavender, another ingredient with antibacterial properties that’s especially good when hair is confined in protective styles like braids or twists, says Hardges. “If your hair is up, I would recommend lightly oiling the scalp, as needed, by dabbing the oil onto the exposed scalp,” says Hardges. You can also add it to your conditioner or use it as a hot oil treatment, according to  the brand.
Hair type: all hair types | Scent: earthy
​This hair oil adds shine and hydration for a glossy, frizz-free finish. Reviewers say this lightweight oil hydrates and smoothes dry hair without making it look greasy or weighed down. Reviewers also note that it’s worth the high price point because a little goes a long way (most say you only need one to two drops). This hair oil has a 4.5-star average rating from over 250 reviews on Amazon.
Hair type: all hair types | Scent: floral
When searching for the right hair oil, our experts recommend considering several factors, including your specific hair type and the consistency of the formula. Below, I highlight their shopping suggestions.
It may be tempting to pick up any hair oil, slather it onto your strands and hope for the best, but it’s crucial to think about your product’s consistency and its ingredients when shopping. “Using the right type of oil for your specific hair texture, density and condition can make all of the difference in achieving the best results,” says Peace.
You’ll first want to consider the weight and consistency of the oil you’re using, which will impact  how it performs on your hair.
“A thick oil applied on fine hair will most often weigh down the strands, leaving them looking limp and greasy,” he says. Likewise, “a lightweight oil on thick, curly hair may not offer the fortitude needed to lock in moisture, which can result in dryer hair.”
The market is full of different types of hair oils. When it comes to ingredients, Yadav recommends considering options with castor oil since it’s full of fatty acids that condition your hair, and helps promote hair growth (with consistent use).
Yadav also recommends products with argan oil because it can help protect hair from damage caused by environmental factors such as UV rays, humidity and cold, dry air — which is especially important if your hair is processed or color treated, she says. She advises against using coconut oil on your scalp, since it’s comedogenic and may congest the hair follicles, which can cause breakouts and inhibit healthy hair growth.
Hair oils come with a long list of benefits for all hair textures. For curly textures, oils can help ensure your entire hair strand is receiving adequate moisture, from scalp to ends. “Although curly hair is like a sponge, it has the tendency to be dry since the natural oils that the body produces may not always trickle down through the strands as easily as it would be the case for straighter and looser hair textures,” says Peace. Hair oils can also benefit those with dry hair, whether the dryness stems from UV exposure, hot tools or chemical treatments. “When hair is dry and brittle, it’s much more prone to breakage,” says Yadav. “A hair oil will deeply penetrate the hair strand, nourishing it and plumping it from within to make it more resilient.”
Hair oils can also support new hair growth if it’s massaged for 11 to 20 minutes when applied, according to one study. This helps “promote blood circulation and brings better blood flow to the hair follicles, promoting healthier hair growth,” says Yadav.
If your scalp is experiencing inflammation, whether it be from eczema or psoriasis, anti-inflammatory oils like olive and argan oil can help, according to Yadav. She also recommends tea tree oil, which has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties and “can be very soothing on the scalp.”
Finally, hair oils are a great way to compensate for daily activities that decrease our hair’s natural oils, like shampooing. “Cleansing our hair and scalp strips them of their natural oils, and if you have curly or processed hair, this can be especially dehydrating,” says Yadav. “Restoring that moisture can go a long way towards maintaining a healthy skin barrier on the scalp and keeping the hair smooth, conditioned and tangle-free.”
Hair oils are useful for all hair types — especially those with natural hair. Natural and textured hair types tend to lose moisture quickly due to high porosity (which refers to how well the hair can hold on to water and therefore, hydration), according to Hardges. “Oils will seal in hydration where it would normally escape through raised cuticles on the hair strand.”
Those with protective hairstyles will also benefit from incorporating a hair oil into their regimen. While protective hairstyles are great for preventing breakage, they can lead to dryness because the natural oils on the scalp don’t get a chance to travel down the hair strand, says Hardges. Hair oils offer lubrication and allow you to reap the benefits of a protective style without drying out your hair in the process, says Hardges.
While hair oils and hair serums are typically applied similarly, they function differently on the hair. “Hair oils penetrate into the hair to nourish it from within whereas hair serums sit on the surface and form a protective layer against heat damage,” says Hunziker. “Oils are better for moisturizing the hair and scalp.”
Hair oils are typically made of botanical-based ingredients, such as olive oil, grapeseed oil and avocado oil, while hair serums are usually synthetic-based, according to Peace. Generally speaking, scalp oils are the same as a hair oil you’d apply to your ends, but some formulas, like the Fable & Mane HoliRoots Pre-wash Hair Treatment Oil , specifically target the scalp.
When using a hair oil, be sure to follow the directions on the bottle and take your unique hair texture and your hair goals into account. In any case, you should apply most formulas on wet hair — though it shouldn’t be sopping wet, says Hunziker. “Applying a hair oil to damp hair can help seal water into the hair cuticle to leave lasting moisture in the hair,” says Yadav. Apply two to three drops from the tops of your ears working your way down toward the tips.
You can also use some formulas on dry hair, which is helpful if it’s extra dry or damaged and needs added nourishment after cleansing and conditioning routine, says Yadav. Applying hair oil to dry hair also has some benefits — it can help tame flyaways and frizz. When doing this, rub a few drops in between your hands to warm up the product, then apply it from the tops of the ears down toward the tips, says Hunziker. “If you feel like you still have flyaways, you can apply oil to the hair around the face sparingly,” she says. To prevent your roots from appearing oily, avoid applying hair oil to the scalp when it’s dry — unless it’s a hair oil formulated particularly for the scalp, in which case you should apply a few drops to your scalp, let it sit for a few minutes, then shampoo your hair, making sure all the oil is out, says Hunziker.
If you have natural or textured hair, Hardges says you can apply hair oil onto wet hair prior to heat styling. While Hardges says that hair oil benefits don’t differ between curl types, its usage does. “Hair types two and three are not often very dry and would be better served by doing a hot oil treatment instead of a daily oil,” says Hardges. “Hair type four is typically drier and needs the daily oil for lubrication, as well as doing an intensive hot oil treatment once a month.” Hot oil treatments involve heating oil in a double boiler, massaging it into the scalp and brushing through the hair with a wide-tooth comb to ensure even distribution. Then cover your hair with a shower cap and let the oil sit for about 15 to 45 minutes (or overnight, depending on how damaged your hair is) before shampooing it out in the shower.
Whether you’re doing a daily application or a hot oil treatment on natural hair, even distribution of product is key, according to Hardges. With either application method, you’ll first want to split your hair into sections and work a drop of product into each part, says Hardges. “Be sure to comb or finger rake your hair through after you have applied the oil to disperse it even more thoroughly.”
Applying more than a few drops of hair oil per application session can clog pores on the scalp and hairline, and can also lead to dehydration if they become blocked with oil and dead skin cells, says Hardges.
Hunziker recommends using a hair oil after every wash one to two times a week on either wet or dry hair, except if your hair tends to be on the oilier side. In that case, she recommends using one after every other wash cycle. “If you use a lot of oil everyday, it can definitely cause buildup on your hair and scalp,” she says. Buildup on the scalp can inhibit healthy hair growth, according to Yadav. It can also make your hair appear dirty faster than it ordinarily would, since oil makes it easier for dirt and daily grime to stick onto the hair, says Yadav.
Those with oily hair can still benefit from using a hair oil — it can balance the scalp and prevent your hair from being too oily — though how you use it may look different from someone with dry hair. “In some cases, people have oily hair because they’re using shampoos that are too drying, which causes the scalp to produce excess oil to counteract the stripping effects of the shampoo,” says Yadav.
Avoid using a hair oil every time you style your hair if you’re prone to oiliness, says Hunziker. Also, choose lightweight oils like jojoba oil, which function like our scalp’s natural oils instead of richer oils like coconut or castor oil that can make the hair very oily, especially if you have fine hair, according to Yadav.

For many, dandruff is a small but persistent common hair and skin care concern. Thankfully, experts say it’s easily treatable with a dandruff shampoo.
I spoke to dermatologists about what causes dandruff and how to shop for a shampoo that can help. I also gathered expert-recommended shampoos and highly rated options that align with our experts’ guidance.
If you’re looking to combat dandruff and its associated effects like itchiness and flakiness, dermatologists recommend considering the following factors:

Keep in mind, if an over-the-counter dandruff shampoo is not showing any improvement, you should consult your dermatologist for a prescription option.
If you’re looking for a shampoo that can relieve the flaking and itching associated with dandruff and is suitable for all hair types and textures, consider this one, which comes recommended by board-certified dermatologists Dr. Isabela Jones and Dr. Julie Jackson. This is the only over-the-counter option that has ketoconazole in it, which dermatologists say is the best anti-yeast medication, says Jones. (Yeast, specifically Malassezia yeast, is linked to dandruff, so controlling this is important to prevent and target this skin and hair care issue, according to our experts.)
Key ingredient: ketoconazole | Size: 7 fl oz | Scent: fresh and clean
If you have a sensitive scalp, consider this mild option from Vanicream. It targets itchiness, redness and flaking, and it hydrates the scalp with ingredients like panthenol and glycerin, according to the brand. This shampoo, which has a 4.5-star average rating from over 2,400 reviews on Amazon, is also free of common irritants, including dyes, parabens and sulfates.
Key ingredients: pyrithione zinc | Size: 8 fl oz | Scent: fragrance-free
This shampoo not only helps tame psoriasis, but it also helps combat dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis (a condition that can create itchy, flaking scales and rashes that develop on the scalp and other areas of the face, according to the American Academy of Dermatology). The neutral-smelling shampoo has a high percentage of salicylic acid (3%), which is great for removing dandruff flakes and oils that cause the yeast to grow, says Jones.
Key ingredients: salicylic acid | Size: 4 fl oz | Scent: fragrance-free
After a recent brush with mild dandruff, this option cleared it away fast after just a few uses. Plus, it didn’t leave my hair feeling like dry hay. Although Cerave has a dandruff shampoo and conditioner, I love the convenience of this 2-in-1 version. It’s the best and most gentle dandruff product I have tried, and I cannot recommend it enough.
Key ingredients: pyrithione zinc, hyaluronic acid, ceramides, niacinamide | Size: 12 fl oz | Scent: fragrance-free
With a 4.6-star average rating from over 1,300 reviews on Amazon, this dandruff shampoo is formulated specifically for wavy, curly and coily 4C hair. Not only does it help combat dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis, but it’s also safe for those with dry and sensitive scalps, according to the brand. Reviewers say their scalp felt a sense of relief without any irritation and suggest using an additional moisturizing agent (like a conditioner or hair mask) if you worry about it drying out your hair.
Key ingredients: tea tree, olive oil, peppermint oil | Size: 12 fl oz | Scent: fragrance-free but has a natural tea tree scent
This color-safe shampoo helps with mild to moderate dandruff, dry scalp and itchiness, according to the brand. It also has ingredients like coconut oil to soften and hydrate hair, squalane to prevent hair breakage and sugar kelp extract for its hydrating and anti-bacterial properties, according to Jupiter. The shampoo has a 4.3-star average rating from over 2,100 reviews on Amazon.
Key ingredients: pyrithione zinc | Size: 9.5 fl oz | Scent: fragrance-free but has a natural mint, vanilla sage and lavender scent
This shampoo is an expert-recommended option because it lathers well, smells good and has zinc, a gentle ingredient that helps control the yeast that can contribute to dandruff, according to Jones. It will clean your hair and combat dryness, relieve irritation and itchiness, reduce visible flakes and redness, and control oil levels, according to the brand.
Key ingredients: pyrithione zinc | Size: 12.5 fl oz | Scent: fresh and clean
Selsun Blue’s shampoo has selenium sulfide and menthol, the latter of which is a cooling ingredient that helps relieve mild itching, says Jones. The shampoo will also help combat and prevent flaking when used regularly (at least twice a week for approximately two minutes, according to the brand).
Key ingredients: selenium sulfide | Size: 11 fl oz | Scent: n/a
This scalp shampoo’s gentle formula helps reduce itchiness and flaking and treats severe scalp conditions, including dandruff, dermatitis and psoriasis. Reviewers say it helps maintain their scalp health and prevent future symptoms and buildup (including dead skin cells), but most importantly, it helps provide relief quickly. The shampoo, which has the National Psoriasis Foundation’s Seal of Recognition, also helps reduce inflammation and thick plaque buildup, according to the brand. It has a 4.5-star average rating from over 11,700 reviews on Amazon.
Key ingredients: salicylic acid | Size: 4.5 fl oz | Scent: fragrance-free
I use this option as a weekly preventative treatment during winter because it soothes my scalp and prevents noticeable white flakes on my dark brown hair. It also boosts overall hair health by adding shine, reducing breakage, improving smoothness and preventing dryness, according to the brand.
Key ingredients: selenium sulfide, niacinamide, glycerin | Size: 6.76 fl oz | Scent: fresh and clean
This sulfate-free dandruff treatment reduces the appearance of flaking and redness while also soothing the scalp and relieving irritation and itchiness, according to the brand. The shampoo, which is suitable for all hair types and textures, uses ingredients like salicylic acid and propanediol caprylate to reduce the amount of bacteria that causes dandruff, according to Ouai. Reviewers say that after using this scalp shampoo twice a week, their hair and scalp feel as though it had a deep clean and that it’s effective at combatting dandruff and its accompanying symptoms. It has a 4.3-star average rating from over 400 reviews at Amazon.
Key ingredients: salicylic acid | Size: 10 fl oz | Scent: earthy with notes of ginger and spearmint
For those looking to combat dandruff and dry hair, consider this option from Dove, which has a 4.5-star average rating from over 5,600 reviews on Amazon. The shampoo gently cleanses the scalp while preventing and controlling dandruff flakes, itchiness and irritation, according to the brand. Reviewers say it calms their symptoms but doesn’t make their hair feel as dry as other alternatives.
Key ingredients: pyrithione zinc, coconut oil, shea butter | Size: 12 fl oz | Scent: n/a but has added fragrance
Dandruff, which falls under the skin condition seborrheic dermatitis, is flaking of the scalp skin. It can fall on a spectrum of mild and severe cases, according to the AAD. Dandruff causes white to yellow flaking or scales on the scalp. You’ll sometimes notice it more prominently along the hairline or behind the ears. Most people have no symptoms, but occasionally, there is mild itching. In the more severe cases of seborrheic dermatitis, you might even notice redness on the scalp, larger scaly plaques and more severe itching, says Jones.
As with many conditions, dandruff may be multifactorial, meaning multiple causes are at play, says Jones. Here are a few factors dermatologists say can cause dandruff:
When shopping for a shampoo to combat dandruff, experts recommend keeping ingredients and hair type in mind.
Look for active ingredients that help to combat yeast and are anti-inflammatory, such as pyrithione zinc, selenium sulfide, salicylic acid, ketoconazole or ciclopirox, says Jackson.
There are also a few ingredients you’ll want to avoid, if possible. For example, many dandruff shampoos contain tea tree oil, which, in general, is great for combating seborrheic dermatitis. However, it is a common allergen, so if your scalp tends to be more sensitive, this ingredient might make your dandruff worse, says Jackson. Also, since the yeast that causes dandruff likes to grow in oil, experts I spoke to advise against shampoos that have oils as the primary ingredient.
If you want to go the extra mile, consider shampoos for your specific hair type and texture, according to our experts. For example, if you have color-treated hair, shop for a color-safe option to remove dandruff while preserving your color. Also, depending on your hair type, make sure you are picking an appropriate conditioner for your strands to make sure you are counteracting any drying effects of your shampoo, according to Jones. “It’s a bit of a battle — we want to degrease the scalp but moisturize your hair,” says Jones. “As most know, we don’t want conditioner on your scalp, which will add oils that can worsen dandruff.”
Dandruff can affect people regardless of their skin type, hair type and hair texture, according to our experts. Those with oily skin also tend to have an oily scalp, making them more likely to develop dandruff and acne around the hairline because the Malassezia yeast can contribute to both issues, says Jones.
Seborrheic dermatitis may be a lifelong condition for some, according to Jackson. However, there are certain periods where the condition may worsen. “I will see flares in a hot, humid environment, and I have even seen flares in susceptible individuals who have taken up activities such as hot yoga,” says Jackson. “However, other individuals will flare in the less sunny months.”
How often you use a dandruff shampoo will depend on the severity of your condition. If you suffer from a mild form of dandruff, consider incorporating this type of shampoo once or twice a week. In more severe cases, you might rotate two to three different anti-dandruff shampoos, but overuse may also lead to your hair strands drying out, says Jones.
There isn’t a specific amount you need to apply — just make sure you use enough to cover the entire scalp, which will vary from person to person, says Jones. But be sure to use the balls of your fingers or a gentle scalp massager to work the shampoo into your scalp and let it sit for two to five minutes before rinsing, says Jones.
“You should see improvement after a week, and if you don’t, then you may need to see a dermatologist for prescription treatment,” says Jones.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-hair-masks-rcna95328,How to find the right hair mask for your hair type,HAIR CARE,"Like a face mask for your skin, a hair mask is a powerful treatment that can help tackle a laundry list of hair concerns. Ideal for those looking to restore moisture, repair damage and add shine, hair masks tend to have a thicker consistency than traditional conditioners and are a great option for those looking to deeply nourish their hair.
“Masks are known for reducing frizz because of their oil properties that seal the hair cuticle, which causes it to repel outside moisture that could compromise definition and create puffiness,” says Darrius Peace, a natural hair expert, beauty instructor, author and international speaker based in Birmingham, Alabama.
To help you choose the right one, we spoke to experts about what to look for when shopping for masks and put together a list of what to shop based on their recommendations and guidance.

We spoke to hair stylists and a dermatologist about their favorite hair masks and compiled their recommendations below. We also included a few products we love based on their guidance.
This deep conditioning mask comes recommended by New York-based hairstylist Tomy Biton. It’s especially ideal for fine hair types, thanks to the aloe barbadensis leaf juice in it, which hydrates the hair without weighing it down or causing it to feel greasy, according to Biton. The rosehip oil in it also works to control frizz, while its algae extract protects against free radicals, according to the brand. (Free radicals are toxins found in the environment that can damage our cells and speed up the hair’s aging process, says Biton).
Hair texture: all hair textures | Hair type: all hair types | Scent: clean — notes of white musk and floral woods
This hair mask uses biomimetic technology (the process of mimicking your hair’s natural structure and connecting broken bonds) to repair damage from chemical processing and heat. Unlike other masks, which are traditionally rinse-out, this is a leave-in mask that you should apply on wet, shampooed hair (without conditioner).
“I tried the K18 mask over the course of one month — I would use it every time I washed my hair (about five times in one month) after a clarifying shampoo,” says NBC Select contributor Michelle Rostamian. “I used three pumps on towel-dried hair and let it sit for four minutes. Then, I styled as usual with my flat iron. Because the brand recommends using this on unconditioned hair, my hair was frizzy the first few times I used it. But, after using the mask for five consecutive weeks, my hair looked and felt shiny, smooth and healthy-looking.”
Hair texture: all hair types | Hair type: all hair textures | Scent: floral — notes of jasmine and peony
NBC Select associate SEO reporter Ashley Morris purchased this mask after hearing about it on TikTok, and has been using it for the past year. “I was looking for a mask that could help with dryness and overall hair health, and this one fits the bill perfectly,” she says. “It has a creamy but light texture that moisturizes my hair without weighing it down, and also has enough slip that I can detangle my hair while wearing it.”
Hair texture: all hair textures | Hair type: curly, coily | Scent: n/a
This certified organic shea butter works for dry, coarse or curly hair, says Biton. “Many hair masks on the market with much higher price tags use mainly shea butter (typically listed as the first ingredient) with some added fragrance and charge double or triple the price.” This one contains only raw shea butter, and you can use it on both your skin and hair to moisturize and soften them, according to the brand. Since shea butter can be thick, Biton recommends breaking it down in your hands by rubbing it together, applying it evenly onto your hair, letting it sit for a few minutes and then rinsing it out thoroughly.
NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin prefers using this mask over a standard conditioner because it leaves her hair more hydrated, shinier and less frizzy afterward. “Instead of reaching for my daily co-wash, I opt for this conditioning mask when my hair looks dull or dry, and I need a quick zap of moisture,” says Malin. “It’s very thick, so it can be challenging to squeeze out of the tube, but it comes with a metal tool to help with this problem, which is a lifesaver.”
Hair texture: all hair textures | Hair type: all hair types | Scent: floral, musky — notes of cardamom, iris and sandalwood
This in-shower treatment for all hair types uses a plant-based complex to strengthen bonds, revive damaged hair and maintain scalp health, according to the brand. On top of that, it also has ingredients to improve your hair’s softness, and hyaluronic acid to strengthen and moisturize your hair, according to Dr. Leah Ansell, a board-certified dermatologist at Treiber Dermatology Associates in New York.
“I tried this mask out for two weeks on chlorine- and heat- (both UV and hot tools) exposed hair and was impressed with how well it managed my frizz and how silky my hair felt afterward,” says Rostamian. Unlike other hair masks, you use this after shampoo and conditioner as the last step of your in-shower routine. “I apply it from scalp to ends and let it sit for up to five minutes before rinsing out with cold water, as the brand recommends,” she says.

“Whenever I take out my box braids, this is the first thing I put in my hair after cleansing it,” says NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who tends to have tangled, brittle hair after removing them. “This mask basically drowns my hair in moisture, making it feel stronger and easier to detangle after about 10 minutes.”
Hair texture: all hair types | Hair type: all hair textures | Scent: n/a
This moisturizing hair mask comes recommended by Peace, who says it’s great for 3a to 4c hair types since it contains botanicals and proteins to fortify curls. You’ll find raw honey and olive oil in the formula, which help with moisture retention and breakage reduction, according to the brand. “The mask also coats the strands, leaving them pliable and springy for easier style manipulation,” says Peace.
He recommends saturating the hair with the mask and then brushing it through so you can evenly distribute the product. “Allow the mask to sit for at least 15 minutes under a processing cap, rinse with tepid water and style as usual,” he says. “The mask should leave the hair feeling super soft and manageable for combing and brushing.”
Hair type:  Curly, dry, damaged hair | Scent: Sweet
This hair mask is a favorite of NBC Select commerce editor Lindsay Schneider, who received it as a courtesy from the brand. She uses the mask in place of conditioner when her severely dry, frizzy hair needs extra hydration. “It’s really easy to work through my hair because it’s not clumpy or too thick,” says Schneider. “I definitely notice a difference in how much calmer and softer my hair is when using this compared to regular conditioner.” For those who have thicker hair, consider Kérastase’s Nutritive Masquintence Riche Hair Mask, which is made to condition very dry, medium to thick hair.

The Restore Repair Hair Mask is made with a blend of emollients, which helps lock in hydration on all hair types, including those with color-treated hair, according to Biton.
“I’ve used this mask several times on my 2b hair that is constantly exposed to heat, and found that it hydrates my ends and reduces breakage,” says Rostamian. “It has a thick, high viscosity consistency that makes it easy to control how much comes out of the tube. I like to rub the formula in between my hands to break it up before applying it to my hair — doing this ensures that the mask evenly coats each strand. In my experience, it has a slightly spicy, slightly acidic scent that ends up smelling very refreshing once it hits my hair.”
Hair texture: all hair textures | Hair type: all hair types | Scent: citrus
After using her clarifying shampoo once a week, Malin follows it up with this rich and creamy hair mask. “I can practically feel my hair drinking in the moisture as I apply it, and after I use it, my curls look more shiny, hydrated and defined once they’re dry,” she says. “I also notice less frizz and an overall smoother feel.”
Hair texture: all hair textures | Hair type: wavy, curly, coily | Scent: citrus — notes of lemon, bergamot and orange
This NBC Select staff-favorite hair mask, which works for all hair types and texture, combats multiple hair care concerns, including damage, dryness and frizz, according to the brand. “The Crown Affair hair mask adds moisture without making my hair look like it’s a greasy mess,” says NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson, who has fine, straight hair.
It’s also a favorite of NBC Select associate reporter Bianca Alvarez. “I’ve been on a hair-repairing journey, and one of the products that has transformed my thick dull, rough and brittle hair is this mask,” she says. “I use it once a week and have been able to see and feel a noticeable difference. I can’t stop running my fingers through my hair since it’s so soft and silky.”
Hair texture: all hair textures | Hair type: all hair types | Scent: citrus — notes of bergamot, yuzu and lemongrass
For curly hair types in need of moisture, Peace recommends the Oribe Moisture & Control Deep Treatment Hair Mask, which he says leaves curly hair shiny and soft. Ideal for medium to thick curly hair types that are 2b to 4c, the hair mask helps detangle, reduce frizz, prevent breakage and enhance curls, according to the brand.
Rostamian likes to use this mask once a week when her hair has been heavily styled and is in need of moisture. “A little goes a long way with this mask — it has a thick, buttery texture that melts into my hair nicely without much effort,” she says. “I also find it works as an excellent detangler, and despite it being so thick, it doesn’t leave behind a greasy film once I rinse it out and style it.”
Hair texture: medium, thick | Hair type: wavy, curly and coily | Scent: citrus, bright — notes of bergamot, jasmine and sandalwood
“This smells divine (it has a strong vanilla flavor) and was one of the first hair masks I used that I actually noticed a difference on my hair with,” says Schneider. “My hair gets insanely soft and shiny when I use it. At first, I truly couldn’t believe how much of an impact it had. I try to use it once a week and make sure to rake it through my long hair with a comb so it coats every strand.”
Hair texture: medium, thick | Hair type: all hair types | Scent: warm, earthy — notes of coconut and yuzu
This is a rich mask made with several kinds of butters, including mango, avocado and shea butter, to hydrate curly, coarse and dry hair types, says Biton. Ideal for 2b to 4c hair types, the cream-to-butter formula works to protect hair from split ends while also adding hydration and bounce to curls, according to the brand. To use, R+Co recommends applying it once a week in place of conditioner. You can use the mask from root to tip, though the brand recommends focusing on the ends. After applying all over, run a comb through your hair to detangle and evenly distribute the product. Then, rinse out after letting it sit for five minutes.
Hair texture: all hair textures | Hair type: wavy, curly, coily | Scent: earthy — notes of lemon, eucalyptus and amber
You can use this fragrance-free hair treatment as a serum (which typically has a more liquidy texture and forms a protective layer on the hair) or a mask (which typically has a thicker consistency and heals the hair). Several of its ingredients help revive damaged hair, including vegan keratin to get rid of frizz and flyaways, and hemisqualane to protect hair from heat, according to Superzero. Unlike other hair masks that may come in a liquid or cream form, this comes in a bar form, which makes it easier and mess-free to transport.
There are several ways to use this treatment. To use as a leave-in serum, work the bar in between dry hands before spreading onto damp, towel-dried hair. You can also use this to tame flyaways — just follow the previous steps, but apply it sparingly when your hair is completely dry. As a hair mask, use it before shampoo on dry hair — massage the bar generously in between dry hands and work into the hair, beginning at the mid shaft and moving toward the ends. Comb the treatment through the hair, let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes (or overnight for a more intense treatment), then shampoo it out.
Hair texture: all hair textures | Hair type: all hair types | Scent: no synthetic fragrances — a hint of lavender and chamomile
If you’re looking for a deep conditioning treatment that will soften your fine hair without weighing it down, consider this option from Ouai. The mask, which has a 4.5-star average rating from over 1,900 reviews on Amazon, has shea butter, panthenol and keratin to repair hair, fight frizz and improve hair health, according to the brand. Reviewers say a little goes a long way, and  it leaves their hair feeling soft, looking shiny and smelling great.
Hair texture: fine to medium | Hair type: all hair types | Scent: floral — notes of rose, lychee and cedarwood
This hair mask uses almond extract, an ingredient rich in proteins and vitamins E and B, to help nourish, soften and control curls, according to the brand. Brown loves this option because it helps detangle her hair. After applying it to her hair and letting it stay on for roughly five minutes, she can easily use her fingers to comb through and detangle her hair, which helps reduce breakage.

When shopping, our experts recommend looking at several factors, including your specific hair type and the consistency of the formula. Below, we highlight their suggestions of things to consider.
Consider the ingredients. Ansell says that hair masks commonly use oils (such as coconut, argan and avocado) as well as butters (like shea and mango). Other ingredients like honey, aloe vera or avocado derivatives are also often used for their hydrating, softening qualities. If you have coarse or curly hair, Biton recommends shea butter to nourish and deeply condition. Those with damaged hair will benefit from ingredients that replenish moisture, such as hydrolyzed proteins and oils rich in fatty acids, such as almond oil or macadamia oil, says Biton. Finally, a lightweight mask with ingredients like aloe vera or egg derivatives can help build up the hair shaft (the visible part of hair on the scalp) in those with fine hair, says Ansell. Additionally, if you have sensitive skin, hair masks with artificial fragrances can irritate your scalp or cause an allergic reaction so you may want to avoid them, according to Ansell.
In the end, a hair mask should never leave behind a residue or make your hair feel oily after rinsing — if this is the case, you’re using the wrong formula for your hair type, according to Biton.
Hair masks are loaded with natural oils, butters and extracts to provide a range of benefits for the hair. Most are made to target one specific hair concern, but many offer multiple benefits in one formula. You can use a mask to hydrate the hair, repair damage, add shine, restore the scalp, improve softness and define curls, according to Biton. One of the most common benefits? Giving your hair a smoother look, he says.
Masks can also make your hair more manageable when it comes to brushing. “A hair mask can prevent breakage from vigorous brushing and combing of knots and tangles,” says Biton. This is especially helpful for those with overprocessed hair, as gentle brushing will ensure you don’t further damage your hair, says Biton. They can also pose a real benefit for your scalp too, as they “help break down excessive sebum, allowing the scalp to naturally exfoliate the dead skin,” says Ansell.
Hair masks aren’t a solve-all, however: they won’t mend split ends (nor are they a substitute for regular trims), says Biton.
Anyone can use a hair mask, and finding one to suit your particular hair is key to getting the most out of your product. If you don’t shampoo your hair frequently, a hair mask may be a good option for you since they can help enhance the overall strength and durability of your hair, according to Peace. Those with curly, textured hair will benefit from a hair mask that provides bounce and offers curl definition, while those with fine hair can use a hair mask to boost volume and give the appearance of thicker hair.
Hair masks come in many different formulas, and you’ll most commonly find them housed in a tub, pump or tube, which can give you insight to the consistency. “Hair masks in a tub are more likely to have a thicker consistency than those in a pump,” says Peace. “Hair masks in a pump are most ideal for finer, less dense hair, as sometimes the thicker solution can be too heavy and result in limp, less voluminous tresses.”
There are so many hair masks on the market, but ultimately, Biton says that the right one should “hydrate your hair and leave it soft, touchable and shiny without any residue.”
You should follow the manufacturer’s instructions, but generally speaking, you should apply a mask after shampooing (to ensure the hair is clarified and ready to absorb the mask) and in place of a conditioner (to allow for better penetration into the hair), according to Biton.
A formula’s consistency will also indicate how you use it. “If you’re using a thick mask, rub it in between your palms first to heat the product up and break it down — this will ensure an easier and even application,” says Biton. Hair masks that have a thinner consistency can lead to over-application, so start with just a dime size amount and apply from the ends upward, adding more as needed. After applying, let the mask sit in the hair for the amount of time as directed on the packaging (usually between five to 15 minutes).
Then, to avoid buildup on the scalp, you’ll want to thoroughly rinse it out, ensuring there are no leftover traces of the mask in your hair. Ansell recommends “running your fingers through the scalp and hair while rinsing out the mask, particularly at the base of the scalp, to ensure the removal of excess product.”
This varies based on your hair’s needs. “You may be using a hair mask once a week during the wintertime to compensate for the dry weather conditions that can lead to dehydrated hair,” says Biton. In warmer, more humid climates when hair is more hydrated, you may be using it less often. “If your hair is chemically damaged, a mask might be a daily essential while you nurse your hair back to health,” says Biton. If you feel your hair is falling limp and is too soft to hold a style, it may be a sign that you’re using your mask too often. If you’re unsure of what might work best for your hair’s texture, ask your hairstylist.

So, I’ve been adding other hair products to my routine, including a leave-in conditioner. Incorporating a leave-in conditioner can help your hair in a couple of different ways, like adding necessary hydration and moisture, and even protecting your hair from aggressors like pollution or heat damage, according to experts.
Typically, leave-in conditioners come in the form of sprays and creams. In addition to minimizing shedding, adding moisture and strengthening your hair, leave-ins can also detangle your hair, add shine, tame frizz and make your hair easier to style, according to hairstylist Tom D’Antuono.
To help you find the best option for you, I spoke to trichologists and hairstylists about how to shop for a leave-in conditioner, the benefits of using one and how to properly use it.

When shopping for a leave-in conditioner, experts recommend keeping the following in mind:
Below, I rounded up expert-recommended leave-in conditioners that are made for a diverse range of hair textures and densities. I also included highly rated options as well as NBC Select-staff favorites that align with the guidance I received from experts.
This leave-in conditioner spray can create frizz-free waves while adding moisture and shine, says certified trichologist Courtney Foster. It has vitamin E, hydrolyzed proteins and tamarind seed extracts to help strengthen your hair, according to Ouai. It also has a combination of lemon, bergamot, rose and violet fragrance notes, according to the brand. NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio uses this leave-in spray on hair wash days and pairs it with the brand’s wave spray. “It leaves my hair silky soft, shiny and it smells great,” she says.

Briogeo’s leave-in conditioner is ideal for thick hair because you can layer it on top of other heavier styling products without making your hair feel greasy, according to hair colorist and trichologist Bridgette Hill. Plus, it has two lightweight fatty acids (rosehip and argan oils) to hydrate your hair, which is great for those with dryness and frizz, according to the brand. Apply this leave-in to damp hair and evenly distribute the product using a comb, according to Briogeo.

This citrus and vanilla-scented option is made with moisturizing shea butter and argan oil, plus fatty acids and proteins that strengthen the hair fiber, says Hill. Spritz the product on wet or dry hair and style as normal, according to the brand. The spray is also available in three additional scents, including sweet cream, lavender and sweet almond.

After using your standard shampoo and conditioner, Foster recommends applying this hydrating Rahua leave-in conditioner. This option has morete oil, which offers UV protection, sacha inchi oil to lock in moisture and rahua oil to strengthen the hair, according to the brand. You can mist the product on wet or dry hair and comb through to distribute the product.

Carol’s Daughter is one of Hill’s favorite brands for leave-in conditioners. This lightweight spray moisturizes, repairs and protects your hair, she says. Reviewers say although it has a strong scent when they first apply it, it leaves their curls soft, smooth and robust and they have noticed a difference in their overall hair health. Reviewers also say they love how it doesn’t create product buildup, and many note it becomes a staple in their routine after taking braids out.

When it comes to helping soften and hydrate her fine, wavy hair, Godio has been using this leave-in conditioner for years now. “I struggle with very dry, frizzy hair, so I use this on my hair wash days to reduce the appearance of damaged, dry strands and flyaways,” says Godio. The leave-in conditioner has ingredients like argan oil and amino acids to strengthen the hair, according to the brand. And because it comes in a spray, it’s easy to apply, says Godio. You can spray it evenly throughout clean, towel-dried hair and then comb through it to distribute the product, according to Moroccanoil.

This leave-in conditioner helps soften your hair and repair damage using keratin, a protein derived from human hair, says D’Antuono. The color-safe mist has a citrus fragrance with notes of orange, lemon, tea and flowers, according to the brand. Spray this on damp hair, focusing on the mid-shaft and ends, and comb through to distribute the product evenly before styling your hair, according to Virtue Labs.

Foster likes this Kevin Murphy leave-in treatment because it smoothes the hair and helps moisturize. It’s infused with a blend of six Australian fruit extracts to help detangle and strengthen hair, antioxidant-rich bamboo extract to help protect the hair from damage and soothing Tasmanian pepper, according to the brand. Be sure to shake the leave-in before spraying it throughout wet hair and combing, according to Kevin Murphy.

This leave-in spray is a great option for curly hair, according to D’Antuono. “It’s a lightweight moisturizer mist that creates beautiful, frizz-free curls,” he says. After using your regular shampoo and conditioner, spray the product on damp hair before air drying or using a diffuser, according to Color Wow. NBC Select associate updates editor Zoe Malin uses this leave-in treatment daily and, for the best results, sections her hair so that each strand gets coated. “‘I lift the upper section of my hair to spray the lower layer first, then put it down and spray the upper layer,” she says. “I’ll spray it from roots to ends and scrunch my curls as I go to shape them.

If you have fine hair, you should use a water-based leave-in conditioner, so it leaves the hair feeling soft and manageable without weighing it down, says Hill. This water-based spray is great for all hair types, including fine hair, because it combines soothing green tea extract and panthenol, which helps detangle and hydrate, according to Hill.
Hair Type: all hair types | Hair texture: all hair textures | Formulation: spray | Heat protectant: yes | Scent: fresh
This hydrating leave-in conditioner protects your hair against heat damage and UV light, says D’Antuono. This mist has aloe vera to hydrate the hair, amla to provide UV protection and red hibiscus to add shine, according to the brand. For the best results, spray the conditioner on clean, towel-dried hair and comb through the ends, working your way up to the roots, according to Fable & Mane.

Olaplex recently released their No. 5L Moisturize & Mend Leave-in Conditioner, which repairs and hydrates hair and doubles as a heat protectant. Once you work the creamy leave-in treatment into your hair, you can either style it as normal or wear it naturally — the product helps reduce frizz for an overall sleek and shiny finish, according to NBC Select contributor Michelle Rostamian, who tested it on her dry, thick, curly hair.

This Oribe cream has avocado and jojoba oils, which together help hydrate and soften the hair, according to both Foster and Hill. This leave-in conditioner is helpful for those looking to recreate a salon quality blowout at home, according to Foster. Work the product from the roots to the ends of your hair and comb through using your fingers or a wide-tooth comb. You can also use it on dry hair to add moisture to your curls, according to Oribe.
Hair Type: Medium and coarse | Hair texture: Wavy and curly hair | Formulation: Cream | Heat protectant: Yes | Scent: n/a
I use this creamy, lightweight leave-in conditioner from Ceremonia — one of our favorite Latino-owned brands — because it leaves my damaged hair feeling hydrated, soft and frizz-free. The conditioner has guava to help protect hair from sun damage, blue agave to retain moisture and avocado oil to reduce breakage and split ends, according to Ceremonia. You can apply it on dry hair, but I prefer to use a small amount on damp hair and apply it from the middle to the ends. After using this leave-in conditioner, I apply a heat protectant and style my hair as normal. It also leaves behind a subtle fragrance with notes of vetiver, jasmine petals and, of course, guava.
Hair Type: All hair types | Hair texture: All hair textures | Formulation: Cream | Heat protectant: No | Scent: Earthy/Floral
Although this product is suitable for all hair types and textures, D’Antuono recommends this for those with fine hair because of its lightweight formula. The leave-in conditioner provides both hydration and heat protection, D’Antuono says. You can apply this on towel-dried hair before air drying or styling, or you can apply it on dry hair to control frizz, according to Roz.
Hair Type: all hair types | Hair texture: all hair textures | Formulation: cream | Heat protectant: yes | Scent: n/a
Another leave-in conditioner I have in my current rotation is this one from Act+Acre because it makes brushing my hair easier, leaves it frizz-free and gets my hair ready for heat styling. It uses squalane to detangle and provide heat protection, snow mushroom to hydrate and reduce frizz and meadowfoam seed oil to moisturize and add shine, according to the brand. I typically apply two pumps for my medium hair, but you can apply one pump for fine hair and four to five pumps for coarse hair, according to Act+Acre.
Hair Type: all hair types | Hair texture: all hair textures | Formulation: cream | Heat protectant: yes | Scent: botanical
This is a universally beneficial leave-in conditioner because it’s suitable for all hair types to help lock in hydration and moisture, according to Hill. The lightweight formula is made with hydrolyzed wheat and soy proteins, which help moisturize and smooth hair, according to the brand. You can use this in the shower as your regular conditioner or as a leave-in treatment afterward, according to Kiehl’s.
Hair Type: all hair types | Hair texture: all hair textures | Formulation: cream | Heat protectant: no | Scent: n/a
Although it’s thicker than other leave-in conditioners in her rotation, this cream from Derma E is a favorite of Malin’s because it softens, hydrates, tames and holds her curls. The leave-in has essential oils to hydrate the hair and amla extract to add shine, according to the brand. Use this cream as the last step in your routine and evenly apply it in sections on slightly damp hair before air drying or using a diffuser, according to Derma E.
Hair Type: All hair types | Hair texture: Wavy, curly and coily | Formulation: Cream | Heat protectant: No | Scent: n/a
The hydrating and lightweight leave-in conditioner is great for the days you don’t want to do a rinse-out hair mask or for those looking for a treatment to incorporate into their hair care routine, according to NBC Select staff. “It makes my hair less frizzy and hydrated,” says Malin. This is because it has Tsubaki seed oil to soften, detangle and reduce frizz and meadowfoam seed oil to protect against heat damage, according to the brand. Apply one to two pumps for finer hair or three to four if you have thicker hair, according to Crown Affair.

The experts I spoke to recommend keeping in mind a few different factors when shopping for a leave-in conditioner, including ingredients, hair type and hair texture.
There are three main hair types: fine, medium and thick. When shopping for a leave-in conditioner, your hair type matters, according to our experts.
A leave-in conditioner may help style your hair based on your specific hair texture, like defining curls on curly hair or maintaining volume for straight and wavy hair.
When shopping for a leave-in conditioner, you want to look for ingredients like shea butter, aloe vera, squalane, honey and avocado oil because they’ll help infuse the hair with moisture, according to experts. In terms of what to avoid, “you’ll want to stay away from silicones because, over time, they can build up and leave the hair feeling dry, damaged and brittle,” says Philips. “You also want the leave-in conditioner to be free of any parabens, which can cause irritation of the scalp, flakes and even hair loss.”
Leave-in conditioners help minimize strain, tension or damage to the hair follicle and hair fiber that happens when you style or brush your hair, according to Hill. Some leave-in conditioners can also provide heat protection when you’re styling your hair with hot tools like hair dryers, curling irons and flat irons , says Foster.
Because hair contracts and expands when exposed to environmental factors like sunshine, wind and humidity, the process can zap moisture from your hair, says Hill. “The hair fibers on the scalp should be treated like a delicate fabric that requires nourishment,” she says. “Incorporating the proper leave-in conditioner will mitigate this loss of moisture as a result of external and environmental factors.”
The aesthetic benefits of leave-in conditioners vary, like helping minimize frizz, and the results depend on your hair texture and the specific product that you’re using. For example, if you have curly hair, you can use a leave-in conditioner to help enhance your curls, while fine hair can use one to help volumize fine hair.
You should apply your leave-in conditioner after you finish shampooing and conditioning your hair in the shower but before you start any styling, according to our experts. “ It’s important to continue [using your] rinse-out conditioner,” says D’Antuono. “I only recommend replacing a rinse-out conditioner with a leave-in if [your] hair is very fine or limp and applying a small amount to ends only.”
There is no set rule on how often to use a leave-in conditioner, our experts told us. You should consider using one when your hair feels dry, unruly or needs some extra love, says D'Antuono .
Although you can incorporate a leave-in conditioner in your daily routine, be cautious since it can cause excess buildup on the scalp and hair, according to D'Antuono . Overuse of any conditioner can cause swelling of the cuticle, which makes hair brittle and causes the hair shaft to become dry and susceptible to hair breakage, he says.
While certain products will have their own directions, D’Antuono recommends the following steps to properly apply a leave-in conditioner.
If you need to apply your leave-in conditioner closer to the scalp because your hair is damaged or extremely tangled, comb through the ends first and work your way up to the roots, says D’Antuono. However, you typically don’t need to apply a leave-in on your scalp or close to your roots because the natural oils will help condition your hair, says Philips.

I’m an associate reporter at NBC Select covering skin care, hair care and gift guides, including recent stories on the best shampoos for dry hair and shampoo bars.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-fine-hair-shampoo-ncna1266834,13 editor-approved shampoos for fine hair,HAIR CARE,"If you have fine hair, you’ve probably come across shampoos labeled as thickening, volumizing and/or clarifying. For the average shopper, these labels and ingredients might as well be written in another language, says hairstylist Timothy Aylward. Some are like a puzzle, and one wrong piece can be the difference between a great hair day or a greasy one.
I spoke to hair care experts about what to look for and avoid when shopping for a shampoo for fine hair. I also rounded up their recommendations for the best options to shop.
SKIP AHEAD How I picked the best fine hair shampoo | The best shampoos for fine hair | What to know about fine hair shampoos | How to shop for fine hair shampoo | What to avoid if you have fine hair | Why trust NBC Select?
When shopping for a shampoo specifically formulated for fine hair, experts recommend keeping the following factors in mind:

I consulted celebrity hairstylists and trichologists (hair health experts) on the best volumizing shampoos and rounded up their picks, plus some NBC Select staff favorites below.
R+Co’s thickening shampoo and conditioner are favorites of hairstylist Bobby Eliot because they are made with the vitamin biotin, a popular hair care ingredient or supplement that helps increase hair strength, says Eliot. Palmetto berry extract also adds body to the strands, which creates a thicker effect, according to R+Co, and smells like a mix of cardamom, pineapple, tangerine and bamboo.
This Maxxam shampoo accomplishes exactly what a fine hair shampoo should: It doesn’t add buildup and instead gently cleanses the hair and scalp to promote healthy hair growth, and make it appear fuller, says Caspara. Its formula is “not only gentle and free of harsh sulfates, but also nourishes the scalp, improves volume and strengthens the hair by using a soothing kelp extract complex,” she says.
Innersense’s Pure Harmony Hairbath is another one of Caspara’s favorites. “It’s an extremely clean yet effective brand that is designed for fine to medium hair to provide volume and gentle cleansing,” she says. The shampoo is sulfate-free and formulated with quinoa, rice extracts, shea butter and coconut and avocado oils, which nourish and hydrate hair without weighing it down, according to the brand.
This Ouai shampoo is free of harsh sulfates and uses cocamidopropyl betaine to gently cleanse hair, according to the brand. It’s a favorite of NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio, who uses this when she needs to add volume to her fine, wavy hair. “Post-shower, my hair feels bouncy and light, and doesn’t feel weighed down,” she says. The shampoo has notes of white musk, Italian lemons and jasmine, which smells amazing, according to Godio.
The Living Proof Full Shampoo comes recommended by NBC Select contributing editor Bethany Heitman, who notices that it doesn’t leave her hair feeling dry like other volumizing or thickening shampoos. “My hair feels moisturized after using it, while also feeling so much fuller,” she says. “It’s also not overly scented — it has a slight, clean scent that isn’t overpowering or cloying.” She pairs this shampoo with the Living Proof Full Conditioner, and then adds the brand’s thickening blow dry cream before she styles her hair.
Aylward pairs the R+Co’s Bleu shampoo with the brand’s Bleu conditioner to add volume to fine hair. The shampoo is made with kelp extract to help boost volume and thickness, and vegetable proteins to strengthen strands, according to R+Co. Aylward also appreciates the product’s chic packaging: “You may be tempted to use [the bottle] as a flower vase when it’s empty,” he says. Aylward also recommends the R+Co thickening spray as his go-to product for fine hair.
This higher-end option from Oribe is great for a volume boost, says freelance makeup and hair artist Francesca Maria Alfonso. The shampoo has a weightless formula that has advanced polymers to visibly plump strands, which creates the volume, says Alfonso. Plus, “it smells so luxurious,” she says.
Ogx’s sulfate-free fine hair shampoo has a blend of biotin and collagen, which are naturally-occurring proteins in the body. Reviewers say it makes their hair look thicker and have more volume overall, plus it makes their hair a lot more manageable with fewer tangles and knots. Reviewers say they also love its subtle fragrance (notes of coconut, jasmine and lemon) that lingers in their hair post-shower. The shampoo has a 4.4-star average rating from 10,600 reviews on Amazon.
Alfonso loves this affordable volumizing shampoo bar for its natural ingredients like clove, cinnamon, peppermint and rosemary. “[These ingredients] not only stimulate your scalp and roots, but they also promote shiny and soft hair,” she says. Plus, its bar formulation means less plastic ending up in the trash.
I have fine, curly hair and have been searching for a shampoo that will hydrate my hair while keeping it from looking oily. I purchased this Odele shampoo after trichologist Taylor Rose recommended it to me in our guide to the best drugstore shampoos. It’s been a real game-changer: The shampoo makes my hair feel cleansed and nourished without stripping it of too much oil. My curls end up bouncy and free, rather than weighed down, too. Godio is also a fan of this shampoo: “My fine hair always falls flat the day after washing it, but this shampoo helps me avoid that entirely,” she says. “It adds a great amount of volume, so it’s much more manageable and easier to style.” It’s only $12, but it feels high-end.
Although NBC Select associate reporter Bianca Alvarez doesn’t have fine hair, she loves using this shampoo because it gently cleanses while adding body, shine and volume. “When I’m giving myself an at-home blowout, I reach for this because of how volumizing it is,” she says. “Plus, I love that it also helps repair any damage without me having to do anything extra.” The shampoo, which is suitable for fine to normal hair textures, can help strengthen hair, too, according to the brand.
This shampoo, which has a 4.9-star average rating from over 170 reviews at Sephora, is great for those with oily scalps and fine hair because it uses coconut-based surfactants and rice protein to remove buildup, add volume and leave your hair looking thicker and hydrated, according to the brand. Reviewers say they love that they don’t have to double cleanse or wash as frequently when using this shampoo, even if they have extremely oily scalps.
One of Verb’s newest releases is this lightweight volumizing shampoo, which reviewers say is excellent for smoother, healthier and fuller hair. It has three main ingredients: biotin (to strengthen hair), amaranth extract (to make the hair appear fuller) and hibiscus extract (to condition and nourish it), according to the brand. It has a 4.8-star average rating from over 80 reviews at Sephora.
When shopping for a quality fine hair shampoo, avoid moisturizing or smoothing products because they tend to have ingredients that can weigh the hair down, says Caspara. Instead, “opt for gentle cleansers and lightweight conditioners that aren’t trying to oversell on the moisturizing capability,” she says. Ingredients are typically listed in proportion, so if heavy oils like avocado or shea butter appear amongst the first few ingredients, fine-haired shoppers beware.
Buyers should also be aware of shampoo labels that may conflate “fine” hair with “thin” hair, when they’re two completely different things, says Aylward. (If you’re experiencing hair loss, consult our guide to the best shampoo for thinning hair). The term “thin” refers to the number of hairs per square inch, while “fine” refers to the diameter of each individual hair, experts say.
“Think of it as the number of trees per acre versus the size of each tree,” says Aylward. That said, “the thinner and finer the hair, the more sensitive the scalp is as it lacks the same protection and coverage thicker hair provides,” says Caspara.
Those with fine hair are caught in a bind: they’re desperate to suds up their scalp to remove any excess oil, but don’t want to leave their ends high and dry. Here’s what to look for in a fine hair shampoo to keep your hair clean, healthy and bouncy:
Below, I list some things you should avoid while shopping for fine hair shampoos, according to our hair experts.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-natural-hair-masks-rcna169563,Editor-tested hair masks for treating damaged natural hair,HAIR CARE,"For some people with natural hair, addressing damage or daily wear and tear may require more than cleansing and styling products — in these cases, hair masks may help. Even if you’re not addressing damage, hair masks can provide a weekly moisture boost for the general health of your hair.
Not sure of which hair mask to choose? Read on for shopping guidance from Dani Priester, a licensed cosmetologist of 22 years and the founder and owner of Haus of Beauty in New Jersey, and Jaxcee Challenger, a hairstylist and founder of The Coily Collective salon in New York City. I also compiled a list of hair masks for natural hair that align with their expert guidance, including options that myself and other NBC Select staffers have tried.
SKIP AHEAD  The best hair masks for natural hair in 2024 | How to shop for a mask for natural hair | Why trust NBC Select?
According to Priester and Challenger, the best hair mask for you depends on the following factor, which I kept in mind while compiling this list:
This list includes expert recommendations, highly rated picks that align with their advice and personal favorites of NBC Select staffers with natural hair.
This mask, which comes recommended by Priestler, is especially good for addressing dryness caused by heat processing, coloring, relaxers and more, according to the brand. It’s formulated with amla oil and shea butter, which moisturize and soften hair, and an amino blend to repair damaged protein bonds, according to the brand.
Best for: Processed hair (heat damage, color-treated, relaxed) | Size: 11 oz
This mask also comes recommended by Priestler for “intensive repair” because of its nutrient-heavy formula — it includes sea buckthorn oil and borage oil, which contain vitamin C and fatty acids to strengthen dry hair, and shea and mango butters to hydrate. The mask also contains an exclusive “bond cure technology” to target and repair the hair’s hydrogen bonds, which are the most abundant type in the hair, and the most susceptible to breakage and split ends from heat processing, according to the brand.
Best for: Heat damage | Size: 8.4 oz
I bought this mask after trying the brand’s Leave-In Conditioner and love what it does for my hair whenever it’s dry. It’s the first product I use outside of shampoo after taking down box braids, or whenever my hair needs a moisture boost since its slippery texture makes detangling easy. I work it through my hair in sections, using first my fingers or a wide tooth comb, and then my Denman brush. After a bad silk press, this mask also helped to revive and soften my heat-damaged hair, bringing it closer to my natural texture.
Best for: Dryness, heat damage  | Size: 15 fl oz
NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who rarely ventures outside her local beauty supply store for hair supplies, was initially skeptical of this pricier mask, which the brand sent her to try. “The texture is incredibly thick, similar to that of mayonnaise. I have shoulder-length hair and only need a small dollop to cover my entire head. I find that if I allow it to sit in my hair for about five minutes, I can easily finger comb my hair because the mask does such a great job of softening my strands. And in the end, I don’t completely rip out my hair while detangling it,” she says. Its star ingredient, almond extract, is rich in protein and vitamin B, which help to treat brittle, dry hair by increasing hair volume and elasticity, according to the brand.
Best for: Brittle hair, dryness | Size: 8.82 oz
Brown loves the entire Rosemary Mint line from Mielle Organics — “it’s been recommended to me more than anything else over the years,” she says. The mask is infused with biotin to strengthen hair, and uses mint and ginger root to stimulate hair growth, according to the brand. “My hair sheds a lot less when I use this consistently and the mint sensation feels amazing on my scalp,” says Brown. This is likely due to the rosemary and mint oils, which increase blood circulation in your scalp, resulting in thicker, stronger hair, according to the brand.
Best for: Weak, thinning hair | Size: 12 oz
If you’re looking for maximum hydration at a minimal cost, this mask from ORS may be for you. It comes recommended by Brown for people with severely dry hair — it uses rice water, olive oil and electrolytes to hydrate and nourish your hair strands, according to the brand. “It feels very lightweight and has an amazing slip for detangling,” Brown adds. Plus, it comes in a large container, so “it lasts a very long time,” in her experience.
Best for: Dryness, brittle hair  | Size: 20 oz
This mask comes recommended by Challenger for people who need an infusion of moisture. Avocado, a key ingredient, has plenty of fatty acids, which conditions hair. The formula also includes kiwi, which contains vitamin C and antioxidants to protect hair from environmental stressors, according to the brand. It also contains phytonutrients like spinach, cocoa seed butter and chia seeds, which help to lock in and retain moisture, increasing your hair’s shine and softening any brittleness or dryness.
Best for: Dryness, dull hair | Size: 8 fl oz
Redken is a salon brand that Challenger loves to use with her clients. She recommends this acidic bonding mask for low-porosity hair, because it has a thinner texture that she says can better penetrate hair. It uses citric acid and a blend of oils to detangle hair and deliver moisture without a heavy, weighed-down feeling, according to the brand. The mask is also quick and easy to use — it only needs five minutes in your hair to deliver results, according to Redken.
Best for: Low-porosity hair, dryness | Size: 8.5 fl oz
According to Priestler, the most important factor when shopping for a hair mask is choosing one best suited for your specific need(s). Below, she explains the three main types of hair masks for natural hair and the concerns they address.
Although hair masks are a great treatment option for natural hair, they aren’t a replacement for daily hair care and maintenance. The best products for your daily hair routine will differ from style to style, but Priestler recommends using a hair mist or lightweight serum for basic maintenance.
According to Priester, “since most natural hair tends to be drier, natural products are designed to have more moisturizing agents and ingredients.” Since these are often formulated to combat frizz and brittleness, she says they can help with your hair’s manageability. However, it really all depends on your hair’s specific needs — Challenger says that it’s important to pay more attention to ingredient content and quality, and which masks can properly address your hair’s issues.
According to experts, hair masks aren’t a necessity, but can be used at home to address “more serious dryness and damage,” says Challenger. Prister agrees, adding that if you’re using a mask, it’s important to choose one that “aligns with the goals of your hair.”
Challenger says that the best way to apply a mask will differ according to your hair’s porosity. If you have higher-porosity hair (meaning water absorbs easily into your hair but doesn’t retain well), you can work your mask into your strands by applying and detangling. However, for lower-porosity hair (hair that doesn’t easily absorb water), she suggests using heat to help product absorb — this could be a hair dryer, or a hot towel.
Pristler says that you should use a hair mask “as often as needed.” How often you use one will depend on the issues you’re trying to address and the condition of your hair, she says. “If your hair is mistreated or damaged, you can use one every time you wash it,” she says. However, for protein masks and treatments, she recommends using two times a month — although overuse doesn’t pose danger, she says they’re not necessary to be used every time you wash your hair.
Priestler says it’s not harmful to use a hair mask overnight if your hair is extremely dry or damaged, but it’s not necessary. She also warns that unless your hair is in severe need, keeping a mask on overnight can leave your strands greasy.
According to Priestler, it’s totally fine to use hair masks in the same routine as a conditioner. Sometimes it’s even necessary — some hair masks may require a shampoo afterwards, and she says that in these cases, it’s best to follow up that wash with a conditioner to maintain your hair’s moisture balance.
Priestler likes to detangle hair while using a hair mask to help work the product into the strands, she says. She preferred using a detangling brush to go through the hair, and then following it up with a steamer to help the mask better absorb into the strands.

I’m an associate SEO reporter for NBC Select, where I’ve consulted with experts for multiple articles about hair, including roundups of the best natural hair stylers and scalp acne shampoos.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-anti-frizz-products-rcna167965,23 anti-frizz products approved by editors and experts,HAIR CARE,"If you struggle with frizz like me, a stroll outside with freshly washed, product-free hair can leave you looking as if you’ve been electrocuted. Thankfully, getting a handle on frizz doesn’t require a Brazilian blowout or keratin treatment at the salon. You can also hack your at-home routine with products formulated to give your hair a smoother and sleeker appearance.
I talked to hairstylists about what to keep in mind when shopping for anti-frizz products and compiled a list of recommendations that align with their guidance, along with products that NBC Select staffers swear by.
SKIP AHEAD How I picked the best anti-frizz products | The best anti-frizz products | How to shop for anti-frizz products | Why trust NBC Select?
To narrow my search, experts advised me to consider the following factors:
The below list includes cleansing, styling and finishing products. There are highly rated options that align with our experts’ guidance and recommendations we have personal experience (and success) with.
Suitable for all hair types and textures, this lightweight sulfate-free shampoo has a six-oil blend (coconut, safflower seed, macadamia nut, argan, sweet almond and grapeseed) that reduces frizz and protects the hair from breakage, according to the brand. Reviewers say the shampoo also smells amazing and that a little goes a long way. It has a 4.6-star average rating from over 1,000 reviews on Amazon.
Perfect for dry and damaged hair, this shampoo reduces frizz, prevents breakage and smoothes out hair cuticles with the help of ingredients like manuka honey, yogurt and mafura oil, according to the brand. “I’ve used this as both a regular conditioner and leave-in treatment,” says NBC Select editor Cory Fernandez. “I love that it’s not overly greasy and really helps define curls.”
This option is a go-to for NBC Select editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez, who started using it after constant coloring and heat left her curly hair frizzy and damaged. “The mask has a jelly-like texture that is thicker than traditional conditioner but not as dense as other masks I have tried,” she says. “I apply it once a week in place of conditioner and leave it on for anywhere between 15-30 minutes.” The hair mask uses vitamin C, castor oil and a  proprietary anti-frizz technology to strengthen the hair, retain moisture and prevent humidity from entering hair cuticles, according to the brand.
Boton recommends this sulfate-free shampoo from Oribe for reducing frizz in coarser, thicker hair. Its polymer complex has antistatic properties, boosts shine and makes detangling easier, according to the brand. To protect hair from damage caused by outdoor elements and ward off deterioration of natural keratin, Oribe also infused this shampoo with a “signature complex” made of watermelon, lychee and edelweiss flower.
Reviewers say they notice a difference in hair manageability and frizz control after just a few washes with this sulfate-free shampoo. Its key frizz-fighting ingredients are jojoba esters, which smooth the hair to combat the effects of humidity, according to the brand. Plus, thanks to a proprietary amino complex, it can remove buildup without leaving the hair devoid of moisture, according to Living Proof.
Whether she’s air drying her hair or using a diffuser, NBC Select associate updates editor Zoe Malin uses this spray daily. “In both scenarios, the spray reduces frizz and makes my curls look smooth,” she says. “It really locks in the definition my other curl styling products create, and I notice a huge difference in my hair’s overall frizz level when I use it versus when I don’t. I tell every curly-haired person I know that they have to buy this.”
If you don’t have curly hair but still want to reduce frizz, consider the original Color Wow Dream Coat, another NBC Select staff favorite.
Whenever I apply this smoothing spray to my naturally wavy hair, I see significantly less frizz. I apply it to my hair while it’s damp, blow dry it and apply the spray again before using my flat iron — this way, it really mimics a salon-like treatment. The best part is that it doesn’t leave behind a residue in my hair, nor does it weigh it down or make it look greasy.
When Rodriguez decides to blow out or straighten her hair, she uses this spray because it prevents her hair from frizzing up during hot and humid months. “I’m used to having blowouts that only last a day in the heat, but this spray keeps my hair smooth for two to three days,” she says.
To decrease frizz, this spray combines vitamin E (to strengthen hair and add shine), argan oil (to improve manageability and protect the hair from environmental aggressors), thermal polymers (to lock in moisture and protect hair) and an anti-static agent (for control, shine and body) according to the brand.
“I mainly use this spray to refresh my curls halfway through the day when I notice they look frizzy, and it helps tame them without making them feel hard or crunchy,” says Malin. “I also use the spray when I’m slicking my hair back into a bun, ponytail or braids. It removes flyaways and helps the style keep its hold for hours.”
This serum from Fekkai uses olive oil, prickly pear extract, plant-derived silicone, and extracts to help reduce frizz while adding more shine for a glossy finish, according to the brand. You can use this humidity-resistant and color-safe serum daily on dry hair as a finishing product or on wet hair to lock in moisture and create a smooth look and feel, according to Fekkai. This serum has a 4.8-star average rating from over 300 reviews at Ulta.
This gel is a must for warding off humidity and frizz, according to NBC Select editor Lindsay Schneider. It’s also a favorite of Malin’s because it defines her curls and maintains their shape rather than allowing them to expand and become poofy. “It almost forms a protective outer shell over my hair, which prevents how much of an impact heat and humidity have on it.”
Reviewers say this serum, which has a 4.5-star average rating from over 19,900 reviews on Amazon, effectively keeps their hair frizz-free throughout the day, thanks to a blend of argan, coconut and moringa oil. They say you only need a small amount to achieve the tame, shiny look without hair appearing greasy or weighed down.
The Frizz Ease serum is also available in its original formulation, which is best for medium to thick hair.
This leave-in conditioner, recommended by Dickson, defines and hydrates curls, and reduces frizz, according to the brand. Its key ingredients include argan oil to nourish the hair, polyquaternium-7, which is an anti-static agent and tocopheryl acetate, which is a form of vitamin E, according to Moroccanoil. For the best results, apply it to damp hair or refresh your hair by lightly spritzing it with water before, says Dickson.
This moisturizing cream is good for medium, frizz-prone and wavy hair because it adds shine, moisture and weight to control the frizz, says Dickson. The high-gloss cream is infused with a soy protein biopolymer to condition the hair without causing buildup, and a brand-exclusive complex created specifically for defending the hair from environmental elements, keratin deterioration and photoaging, according to the brand.
Before I blow dry my hair, I love using Briogeo’s Farewell Frizz because it doubles as a heat protectant and tones down frizz before styling. The formula includes ingredients like rosehip, argan, and coconut oils that work together to seal the hair cuticle, hydrate the hair and lock out humidity, according to the brand.
This styling cream from Moroccanoil combats frizz, improves hair manageability, controls hair and adds shine, according to the brand. “This is my go-to leave-in conditioner because it hydrates my curls and noticeably reduces my frizz,” says Rodriguez. “I sometimes switch between leave-ins while testing new products, but I always come back to this one because the reduction of frizz is so much more evident.”
In my opinion, there’s nothing worse than slicking back your hair with gels and creams only to see little flyaways and frizz start popping up. To prevent this from happening, I apply this dry wax spray all over my hair and immediately watch those little hairs go back down rather than sticking out and up. Although it has numerous ingredients, key ones like tamarind extract and styling polymers target frizz by reducing it, blocking humidity, and keeping styles intact, according to the brand.
This hair oil reduces frizz, restores hydration to the hair and protects it from humidity, according to the brand. “Not only do these drops help maintain a smooth blowout, but they also give my hair a beautiful shine that makes me feel like I just came out of the salon, says Rodriguez.
“It’s lightweight, and a couple of drops goes a long way, plus like every JVN product I tried, it smells divine.”
This wax stick has castor oil in its formula to smooth frizz, control edges and tame baby hairs, according to the brand. Malin enjoys using this product when putting her curly hair in an updo, especially when it’s humid and hot outside. “I slick my hair back into braids and use this stick that basically creates a frizz-proof helmet,” she says.
NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio loves using this silk pillowcase because it’s as helpful for her hair as it is for her skin. “The silk material doesn’t pull or rub at my hair like harder cotton pillowcases do, so I usually wake up with a lot less frizz, making my hair so much more manageable when styling it in the morning,” says Godio.
After trying multiple satin and silk bonnets, Rodriguez couldn’t find one that would stay on as she slept through the night until she tried this stretchy satin option. “The elastic tie helps keep it in place without being uncomfortable or tight around my head,” she says. “When I use it consistently, I can see and feel a difference in how soft my hair is and how much more manageable my frizz is.”
When shopping for anti-frizz products, our experts recommend considering the following:
When you look at frizzy hair through a microscope, it looks like a Christmas tree, according to Boton. The goal is to fill in the hair with a smoothing product so the frizz is contained, she says.
To control frizz, consider your entire hair care routine. Start with the most effective shampoo and conditioner for your hair type and then add styling products like sprays, gels, creams and more. You can also use hot tools to flatten the cuticle down and then finish with an anti-humidity, anti-frizz product, says Boton.
Below, Dickson shares a few things to keep in mind when shopping for stylers.
“I personally like to mix a serum, oil or cream with a mousse or gel to get both the softness and hold for maximum frizz control on super humid days,” says Dickson.
When shopping for an anti-frizz product, proteins and moisturizing ingredients (like argan oil, glycerin and shea butter) are great since hair needs both of these things, according to Dickson. Oils can also seal in the goodness of previously applied products, she says.
Depending on the time of year or where you live, you may need more of one than another. For example, summertime humidity in New York should be counterbalanced with protein products to offset all the moisture in the air, but individuals in Los Angeles should lean toward moisture to offset the dryness.
Regardless of your hair type, you can experience frizz. However, those with wavy and curly hair, may be more prone to it, according to our experts. Other contributors to the worsening of frizz are damage, improper hair care, aging, vitamin deficiencies, and illnesses, says Dickson.
Every day if necessary. Most anti-frizz products are designed to be nourishing, so overuse isn’t usually detrimental, according to Dickson. Build-up can occur, but it’s nothing a clarifying shampoo couldn’t undo, says Dickson.
Besides following the directions specified on the product, there are additional things you can do, depending on your hair texture.

I’m an associate reporter covering skin care and hair care for NBC Select, including stories on the best curling irons and dry shampoos. For this article, I interviewed two experts about how to address frizzy hair. I compiled a list of their product recommendations, as well as options that align with their guidance and personal favorites of NBC Select staff.",Bianca Alvarez,Unknown
https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-purple-shampoo-ncna1295370,The best purple shampoos for blonde hair,HAIR CARE,"If your hair is naturally blonde, color-treated blonde or gray, experts recommend adding a color-depositing shampoo to your hair care rotation to maintain your color. Color-depositing shampoos add specific pigments (either purple, blue or green) onto the hair shaft to maintain your desired color. Based on color theory, blondes should use purple shampoos, which is one type of color-depositing shampoo.
As the name suggests, purple shampoo uses violet pigments to tone and neutralize hair, allowing it to counteract unwanted brassiness and yellow/orange hues that can develop over time, according to Brittany Byrd, hairstylist and owner of Blondify Studio. These shampoos aren’t meant to cleanse or hydrate your hair nearly as much as regular shampoo, so these aren’t a complete replacement.
I spoke to four hairstylists and colorists about what ingredients to look for when shopping for a purple shampoo and how to find the right formula for your hair. I also compiled expert-recommended and NBC Select editor-favorite purple shampoos to consider.

This Amika shampoo, which is suitable for cool blondes, platinum blondes, grays, silvers and textured blondes, has ingredients like plant butters and quinoa protein to strengthen the hair and tone down its brassy appearance, according to the brand. It also works to strengthen hydrogen bonds in your hair. (You have the most of these types of bonds in your hair, but they are also the most prone to damage, according to the brand.) With this formula, you’ll not only preserve your desired color, but also prevent and repair any damage to those hydrogen bonds.
Reviewers say that, unlike other purple shampoos, this one leaves their hair feeling soft after cleansing and smells great post-shower. It has a 4.6-star average rating from over 700 reviews on Amazon.
Recommended frequency: every wash for silvers and grays; every two washes for color-treated, platinum and textured blondes; every four washes for natural blondes | Scent: warm vanilla, spicy sweet clover, and fresh citrus
New York City-based hairstylist Jasmine Burnside recommends this Oribe shampoo to manage brassiness. Brassiness occurs when your hair either oxidizes or hard water and pollutants contaminate it, says Byrd. The formula has lemon, ginger root and chamomile extract that work together to brighten the color, according to the brand.
Recommended frequency: daily or as needed | Scent: notes of Calabrian bergamot, white butterfly jasmine and sandalwood
This sulfate-free shampoo is gentle enough for all hair types and leaves hair shiny, vibrant and soft, according to the brand. It has centaury (a violet flower) that neutralizes unwanted yellow and copper tones in blonde, silver or gray hair, says New York City-based trichologist Shab Caspara.
Recommended frequency: daily or as needed | Scent: n/a
This purple shampoo has a lighter color deposit (meaning it doesn’t add a ton of purple pigment to the top of the hair shaft) and is one of the most affordable options on this list. “It’s for somebody that wants the occasional maintenance without a huge investment,” says Byrd. Keep in mind that this shampoo might be drying, so use a conditioner in conjunction with it, according to Byrd.
Recommended frequency: twice a week or as needed | Scent: n/a
With ingredients like hyaluronic acid and edelweiss flower, this option prevents breakage and protects hair from daily damage. Reviewers say this formula is one of the least drying purple shampoos on the market, and although it is one of the more expensive options, a little goes a long way. The shampoo is highly rated with a 4.6-star average rating from over 9,700 reviews on Amazon.
Recommended frequency: as needed | Scent: n/a
R+Co’s Sunset Blvd has more of a lavender color, making it a great option for daily use without causing your hair to turn purple, says Munoz. It removes the brassiness, adds shine and helps the hair retain moisture using humectants like glycerin and emollients like sunflower sprout extract, according to the brand. If you want a shampoo that’s a bit more powerful, Munoz recommends R+Co’s Bleu Blonded Brightening Shampoo, which is more moisturizing and has a darker violet pigment.
Recommended frequency: daily or as needed | Scent: notes of juniper berries, blood orange, rhubarb, violet, leather accord and dark woods
This deep purple shampoo, which has a 4.6-star average rating from 2,400 reviews on Amazon, helps repair damaged hair while neutralizing unwanted warm or brassy tones, according to the brand. The formula includes plant-based proteins to strengthen the hair and prevent future damage, while other ingredients help repair and soften the hair, according to the brand.
Recommended frequency: as needed | Scent: floral with notes of rose, pear and sandalwood
You can use this shampoo daily to brighten, tone and protect your color from fading when exposed to the sun’s rays. You can pair it with its matching conditioner to help moisturize your hair, according to the brand. Reviewers say the shampoo doesn’t turn their blonde hair purple over time, which can happen if you overuse a purple shampoo, experts say. If you notice any purple residue, the color will rinse out with your standard shampoo after one to two washes, according to Sun Bum.
Recommended frequency: daily, once a week or as needed | Scent: n/a
Nak has multiple blonde shampoos that come in various purple pigment concentrations, which can help you dial in the perfect tone depending on your specific hair washing frequency and level of blonde, says Byrd. With hydrating ingredients like aloe vera, this option is great for natural blondes, bleached blondes and grays. The brand also has other shampoos, including Blonde Plus for very yellow blondes, Platinum Blonde Anti-Yellow Shampoo for platinum blondes and Blonde Cleanse for blondes who want to double cleanse their hair.
Recommended frequency: as needed | Scent: n/a
This Redken shampoo comes recommended by Burnside, who uses it on her clients. It not only manages to maintain their desired blonde, but it also helps repair damage, strengthen hair and increase hair elasticity. Reviewers say they love the shampoo’s effectiveness, but recommend only using a little at a time to avoid overuse. Many reviewers also recommend going in with another shampoo or conditioner after to soften the hair and get a more in-depth cleanse of the hair and scalp.
Recommended frequency: two to three times a week | Scent: citrus
Reviewers, which include platinum blondes, color-treated blondes, silvers and grays, say this shampoo makes the fastest and most noticeable difference in removing unwanted undertones. They say a little goes a long way, and you don’t need to let the product sit on your hair for more than a few minutes for it to work. This shampoo, which has a 4.6-star average rating from over 13,100 reviews on Amazon, also conditions the scalp and strengthens the hair, according to the brand. If you want to target the same concerns but in a less-pigmented formula that’s more suited for daily use, consider the brand’s light formula, which only has 50% of the violet pigment seen in the original.
Recommended frequency: as needed | Scent: notes of blueberry, blackberry and raspberry
Burnside recommends this Davines option, which is especially great for platinum blondes and cool, silver-toned hair. Reviewers say this shampoo lathers well when mixed with water and leaves their gray hair brighter, shinier and less dry than other options. That’s because the shampoo’s formula has vitamin B, glycerin and panthenol, all of which add moisture to the hair, according to the brand.
Recommended frequency: as needed | Scent: n/a
In addition to her standard hair-washing routine, NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson uses this purple shampoo to tone her blonde hair. “This Olaplex one is gentle on my fine hair and still does a solid job of bringing the brassiness down,” she says. “I typically leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing, but on particularly brassy, yellow days, I’ll let it saturate for several minutes.” She also recommends following up with a second cleanse and a moisturizing conditioner to combat any dryness and thoroughly clean her hair.
Recommended frequency: two to three times a week or as needed | Scent: citrus
This purple shampoo neutralizes brassy yellow and orange tones, making it great for all blondes, grays and highlighted brunettes, according to the brand. Reviewers say the shampoo itself is gentle on their hair and scalp, doesn’t strip it of too much moisture, and improves the vibrancy and tone of their hair after a few uses. Some say it’s slightly drying (depending on their hair type), so they recommend using its matching conditioner and a hair mask. The shampoo has a 4.5-star average rating from over 25,500 reviews on Amazon.
Recommended frequency: one to three times a week | Scent: notes of violet and thyme
Although this isn’t necessarily a shampoo, you can use this hair mask during every wash, according to Byrd. “It’s a conditioner, so it bathes your hair in nourishing [and] hydrating ingredients [to help] your blonde get some pampering,” she says. “It’s also great because it’s very sheer, so it’s hard to go overboard.”
Recommended frequency: as needed | Scent: n/a
When shopping, the experts I spoke to recommend taking a product’s consistency and your hair type into account.
Look for hydrating ingredients to prevent your hair from drying out. Consider options with humectants like hyaluronic acid and emollients like shea butter because they can counteract the drying element of purple shampoos, says Byrd.
Generally, purple shampoos at salons tend to have a thick consistency, while drugstore options have a more liquid consistency, according to Byrd. “I actually tend to like those [liquid options] because clients don’t go as overboard with them,” she says. Runnier shampoos tend to distribute a lot easier, and they usually have less concentrated pigment, so there’s less chance for user error, says Byrd.
Unlike other shampoos and hair products, you have a little more flexibility when it comes to choosing a purple shampoo for your specific hair type and texture.
Purple shampoos help maintain blondes or grays by neutralizing unwanted tones and yellow hues that occur over time as hair oxidizes (think of it like a cut apple) and hard water and pollutants contaminate it, according to Byrd. By massaging a purple shampoo through your scalp and hair, you’re depositing the purple pigment on top of the hair cuticle to eliminate those yellow hues. It also reduces how frequently you’ll need touch-ups at the hair salon, experts say.
While you can find different colored shampoos on the market, including purple, green and blue options, purple shampoos are strictly reserved for blondes and grays, according to our experts.
It all comes down to color theory: Yellow is across from purple on the color wheel, so it’ll help counteract unwanted yellow tones. (If you’re a brunette, on the other hand, you’ll want a blue shampoo to counteract orange tones following that same theory, says Munoz.)
The most significant downside of using a purple shampoo is that it’s not formulated specifically to cleanse your hair like most shampoos — their purpose is to deposit color, according to Munoz. So, they can dry out your hair because they tend to not have moisturizing and hydrating ingredients (such as emollients) like normal shampoos do, says Byrd. Munoz recommends using a rich conditioner or conditioning agent (like a hair mask) to help compensate for any dryness.
Overusing it can also leave your hair looking slightly purple or even gray, and might even cause you to need correction during your next salon visit, says Munoz.
There isn’t a specific formula for how often you should use purple shampoo because everyone’s hair is different, however, generally speaking you can use your purple shampoo every four to six washes, says Byrd.
If your hair looks really brassy, try a clarifying shampoo before reaching for a purple shampoo, says Byrd. Clarifying shampoos have surfactants that pull out any contamination that is causing your hair to look discolored.
If that doesn’t work, Munoz recommends asking yourself whether your hair looks yellow when styled (like a light bulb). If so, you know it’s time to reach for a purple shampoo, says Munoz.
Experts recommend having a separate non-purple formula for normal wash days and only use a purple shampoo for when you need that toning element, according to experts.
Overusing a purple shampoo can cause or worsen damage and dryness. It can also turn your blonde hair darker or even purple because of the large amount of pigment in these products, which can build up over time and cause hair to look dull, says Byrd. (Some warm undertones are essential to keep for shine and brightness, she says).
If your hair is drying out, make sure you use other hair care products, like a leave-in conditioner or hair mask, to bring in moisture. If your hair is looking purple, use a clarifying shampoo and visit your hairstylist so they can remove the color.
Shampoo your hair regularly and then apply a small, quarter-sized amount of purple shampoo to your hands and mix it with the running water. By emulsifying it (combining it with the water), you can avoid globs of purple in your hair, says Byrd.
After emulsifying it, move it through with your hands, going underneath the hair, at the roots and down your midshaft to the ends, says Byrd. Depending on the pigment’s concentration, you can either immediately rinse the shampoo out or you can leave it on for up to five minutes. However, if you have very porous hair and are a paler blonde, you want to avoid sitting on it for a long time (no more than five minutes) because it can turn your hair purple.
Another way to apply your purple shampoo is the “snow cone” method. This involves taking a small amount of purple shampoo and mixing it with water into a squeezy bottle to dilute it. Afterward, you can apply it all over your head like a snow cone. “Especially for your very platinum, almost solid blondes, it really creates the most even application, and it makes sure that the hair is being toned evenly across and that you’re not going to get any violet zones,” says Byrd.
Other than using purple shampoo or conditioner, experts recommend investing in:

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-heat-protectants-rcna140023,Why you should always use a heat protectant,HAIR CARE,"When using a hot tool like a blow dryer, flat iron or curling iron, using a heat protectant is an absolute must. Not only can they prevent damage, but they also help maintain color longer, reduce frizz, and retain moisture, says Guy Tang, Los Angeles-based celebrity hairstylist.
Heat protectants come in various forms — oils, sprays and creams — and everyone, regardless of your hair type or texture, should use one, according to our experts. Without that added protection, you’re damaging your hair, which can leave it permanently altered, says Angela Walker, founder of N Natural Hair Salon in Maryland.
To help you find the right heat protectant, I spoke to five hairstylists about what to look for and which formulas work best depending on different hair types and textures.
SKIP AHEAD The best heat protectants | How to shop for a heat protectant | Best creams | Best sprays | Best oils | Why trust NBC Select?
Experts I spoke with recommend incorporating a protectant before any using any hot tool, so when making this list, we looked for products that include the following:
Below, I gathered expert-recommended, highly rated and NBC Select staff-favorite heat protectants that are made for a range of hair textures and types and align with our expert’s guidance. We categorized the heat protectants into three categories: creams, sprays and oils — every product also protects against heat up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
Regardless of your hair type and texture, this heat protectant helps combat dryness and frizz, according to the brand. I work it into my damp, thick and wavy hair section by section and only use a little bit (quarter-sized amount at most.) That’s enough to cover my hair from mid-length to ends, taking any leftover product on my hands and placing it closer to my roots. Luckily, after blow drying, it doesn’t leave it looking greasy, and I see less frizz when I use this.
This lightweight cream, which has a 4.5-star average rating from over 400 reviews on Amazon, leaves your hair sleek, shiny and frizz-free, according to the brand. It also improves hair manageability (making it easier to style) and its key ingredients also help increase your hair’s strength and density, according to Oribe. Reviewers say a little goes a long way and to start off with a dime-size amount before adding more. Work it into wet, slightly damp hair before using any hot tool.
This is what Gutterman calls “your hair bestie” because it both moisturizes and protects your hair at the same time. She suggests using it on wet hair prior to blowing it out and to also apply it section by section. The cream is best for frizz-prone, dry hair, medium to thick hair, according to the brand. “Kerastase products, specifically the heat protectants, always make my hair look insanely shiny and healthy,” says NBC Select editor Lindsay Schneider, who received a sample from the brand. “I always get compliments on how good and healthy my hair looks whenever I use this before blowing out my very frizzy, curly hair.”
If you want your protectant to be extremely conditioning, consider this balm-to-cream option, which comes recommended by hairstylist and salon owner Tiffany Munoz. It will help quench your hair’s thirst and help tame it, says Munoz. Since it’s concentrated you won’t need much of it, all you need to do is apply a quarter-size amount of product, work it with your hands and then brush it through, says Munoz.
Right before curling or straightening my hair, I always spray this mist from my roots to my ends. After using this for over a month now, I can see a difference in how my hair looks — there’s less frizz, my hair doesn’t feel stiff or crunchy, and I love the fruity and floral scent, which lingers for a long time in my hair. Because my hair is pretty thick, I do go through this product faster than cream formulas I’ve tried, but because of the results, I don’t mind repurchasing it more frequently.
“My hairstylist specializes in cutting curly hair and uses this product in my hair right after washing it because it significantly smoothes, de-frizzes, detangles and protects my curly hair from heat damage,” says NBC Select production coordinator Kelsey Fredricks. “After using it in the salon, I now use it right before I diffuse my hair. iIt’s become a favorite addition of mine, plus the scent is like an amber musk dream.”
This oil-based heat protectant is great for day two hair when you want to add a little more moisture. It’s suitable for all hair types, including extensions and chemically treated hair, according to the brand. All you need to do is spray it five to six inches away from dry hair before styling. You can also use it again after you style your hair for added shine and smoothness or if you want to add more of the fragrance to your hair.
This spray, suitable for all hair types, including dry, frizz-prone hair, doubles as a styling treatment. “I love that it keeps my frizz under control while also protecting my fine wavy hair from heat damage, especially because I use hot tools a lot,” says NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio. It’s also available in a formulation specifically for curly hair. “My curls look so much more defined when I use it with my diffuser,” says NBC Select associate updates editor Zoe Malin.
If you have curly or coily hair, consider this lightweight spray from Mizani. You can use it on damp hair and work it in sections before blow drying, diffusing or putting your hair under a hooded dryer to help minimize frizz on curls without weighing them down, according to the brand. With a 4.5-star average rating from over 420 reviews on Amazon, reviewers say their coarse, coily, type 4 hair feels sleek without any tacky or sticky residue.
This heat protectant, which has a 4.6-star average rating from over 5,300 reviews on Amazon, uses argan oil and panthenol (vitamin B5) to hydrate the hair and give it a glossy finish, according to the brand. Reviewers say they love this spray for three key reasons: It doesn’t make their hair wet, so there is no waiting period before using a hot tool; it softens hair and doesn’t make it crunchy like hairspray typically does; it also has a long-lasting, subtle scent (a blend of spicy amber and sweet floral notes) that makes their hair smell great.
If you’re looking for a multitasking heat protectant, consider this option from Ceremonia. Not only does it protect your hair from damage caused by styling tools, but it also protects against UV damage, blue light exposure and pollution, according to Ceremonia. Reviewers say this doesn’t make their hair greasy and it doesn’t weigh down their hair, making it great for those with fine hair and thicker hair textures.
Reviewers have mixed opinions on the scent (which has notes of guava, jasmine petals and vetiver), with some saying the scent can be strong, while others find it pleasant. “I personally love the beachy, fruity smell of it,” says Schneider. “In my experience, it only smells immediately after I spray the bottle. The scent doesn’t last on my hair for very long.”
With a 4.6-star average rating from over 1,200 reviews, this oil protects hair from environmental aggressors like pollution and heat. Reviewers say it helps by combatting tangles and frizz on and between wash days. Some reviewers even say they combined it with their favorite leave-in conditioner for extra moisture.
This Bumble and Bumble formula, which has a 4.7-star average rating from over 1,600 reviews at Ulta, has six oils to hydrate and protect hair from heat and UV damage, according to the brand. Reviewers say it doesn’t leave behind residue at the roots and has helped hold styles for longer periods of time. The color-safe product is suitable for all hair types and textures, and you can apply it on wet or dry hair. Since certain areas might be more or less porous, massage the oil into your hair to help it absorb evenly, according to the brand.
Suitable for all hair types, this anti-frizz leave-in heat protectant uses three proteins (silk, soy and wheat) to strengthen the hair while also leaving it soft and shiny without any buildup, according to the brand. In addition to its protective and repairing abilities, reviewers say this helps combat overall hair dryness, with some reviewers even using it as a hair oil to soften and moisturize their dry ends. This option has a 4.7-star average rating from over 34,800 reviews on Amazon.
When you’re shopping for a heat protectant, the experts we spoke to recommend considering a few different factors and characteristics like your hair type, texture and ingredients.
There are four main hair types: straight, wavy, curly and coily, and four main textures: thin, medium, thick and coarse. Here’s what to look for based on your type and texture below:
Certain ingredients will help protect your hair, including dimethicone, which you can find in a lot of products since this primarily acts as a shield when added into the hair, says Gutterman. Other ingredients, including octylacrylamide, acrylates, and methacrylate, are other key ingredients that provide strong thermal protection, says Tang.
Grape seed oil is another option you’ll commonly see since it can protect the hair up to 420 degrees Fahrenheit while also adding shine and moisture, according to Gutterman.
There are also some key ingredients to avoid including alcohol (dries out the hair), sulfates (can be drying and can cause damage if used with heat), parabens (can create a cast over that hair that will weigh it down and need to be removed with a clarifying shampoo), according to Gutterman.
You can apply your heat protectant on wet or dry hair, though some circumstances make some better than others. For example, a cream tends to work best on slightly damp hair prior to blow drying, while a spray and oil are best on dry hair prior to using a styling tool, according to our experts. No matter which formulation you choose, let your heat protectant sit for a few minutes before applying any heat, says Tang.
For the sake of your hair's health, you should use a heat protectant anytime that you are using heat. But if you forget to use one on occasion, your hair is not going to fall off, says Walker.
Incorporating a leave-in conditioner with heat protection into your hair care routine is a great step toward safeguarding your hair from heat damage, says Tang. While these dual-purpose products provide a good level of protection, you can always enhance your defense against heat by using an additional dedicated heat protectant. This extra layer will give you comprehensive coverage and help minimize the potential damage caused by styling tools, ensuring your hair remains healthy and resilient, according to Tang.

And while a pencil can certainly be used to define brows, having to rely on makeup isn’t for everyone. That’s where an eyebrow growth serum comes in. A number of formulas on the market say they may help condition brows, prevent breakage, combat thinning and even lead to potential hair growth. All you have to do is incorporate the serum into your daily skin care routine for results.
I spoke to board-certified dermatologists about the efficacy of eyebrow growth serums, what to know when using one and how to determine which one is best for you. I also gathered some of their recommendations as well as highly rated options available on the market now.
SKIP AHEAD How I picked the best eyebrow growth serums | Best eyebrow growth serums | How to shop for eyebrow growth serums
An eyebrow growth serum can help improve your brow hair health, growth, density, and more. When shopping for one, our experts recommend keeping the following factors in mind:
While some of the dermatologists I spoke to had reservations about fully endorsing the efficacy of brow growth serums for growth, they did recommend several options with ingredients that have conditioning aspects or that they have seen their patients achieve success with.
When it comes to eyebrow growth serums, this option from Vegamour is one of the most successful ones for her patients, according to Dr. Michele Green, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City. The serum has a vegan formula with ingredients including acetyl tetrapeptide-3 and red clover extract, both of which have been shown to be helpful for hair growth, says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Hadley King.
For the best results, apply the serum to your brows twice daily for the first two months. After using this as part of your skin care routine, you’ll see longer, denser, fuller and bolder brows, according to the brand.
Board-certified dermatologists Dr. Debra Jaliman and King both recommend this option from RevitaLash, which helps combat over-grooming and chemical and environmental stressors. The formula has the brand’s proprietary BioPetin complex, a blend of peptides, biotin and green tea to condition and strengthen brows while also giving it an overall healthier appearance. Reviewers say their brows look more defined and now have a bolder and fuller look after consistently using the serum.
If you want to target all aspects of your brow, consider this serum, which comes recommended by Jaliman and King. It has peptides including octapeptide-2, copper tripeptide-1 and sh-polypeptide-1, all of which have been shown in studies to be potentially helpful for hair growth, says King. In addition to peptides, the serum has ingredients like keratin, biotin and panthenol to maintain the health and appearance of your brows and focuses on nourishing, conditioning, strengthening and softening brow hair, according to the brand.
The Ordinary’s water-based serum helps create and maintain thick and full eyebrows while also supporting overall health and appearance, according to the brand. Reviewers notice a slight growth, length and strength in their brows and lashes, but some say it can be irritating, so be cautious if you have reactive skin.  This serum has a 4.0-star average rating from over 3,000 reviews at The Ordinary.
King recommends this serum from Babe Original, which is formulated with nourishing emollients like castor oil and hyaluronic acid, which can help hydrate and thicken the appearance of brows.
You can use this brow growth serum on a nightly basis to see results, but if you have sensitive skin, use it every other night for the first two weeks so that your skin can acclimate to the product, according to the brand.
This option from Maya Chia, which comes recommended by King, has peptides in the formula to stimulate hair growth and panthenol to nourish the hair. It’s safe for both your eyelashes and eyebrows and has a dual-ended applicator, making it easy to switch between applying to both areas. One side of the applicator has a fine-tip brush so you can draw a thin line at the base of your eyelashes. The other side is a spoolie brush so it can evenly distribute the product throughout your eyebrow hairs. Reviewers say the treatment doesn’t cause any irritation or itchiness.
This hypoallergenic formula will help minimize hair breakage and loss while also giving you full and feathery brows, according to the brand. Reviewers say the doe foot applicator makes it really easy to apply to their brows, and after a month, they can see a noticeable change in brow growth and thickness. They also say that it might leave behind a residue if you apply too much, but it’s easy to remove, and the formula doesn’t irritate their eyes or skin.
This paraben-free serum from Joey Healey contains peptides to stimulate hair growth and hyaluronic acid to nourish and hydrate brow hairs, says King. It also contains hydrolyzed wheat protein to add volume to your hair, according to the brand.
Again, experts I spoke to expressed some skepticism that brow growth serums can seriously boost hair growth. However, they agreed that if they have the right ingredients, they can help improve the condition of the hair that’s already there and even help to create an environment that encourages new growth.
Below are a few ingredients you’ll likely encounter in your search, along with notes on their efficacy and tips on what to avoid.
You may want to be cautious using an eyebrow growth serum if it has prostaglandins because they often have side effects like irritation, according to our experts. Prostaglandins are hormone-like compounds produced by the body in response to various stimuli that affect bodily processes, says King. However, prostaglandins are associated with a risk of orbital fat loss — a side effect that can lead to the appearance of sunken or hollow-looking eyes, she says. While these are effective in causing growth for your lashes and brows, you may want to avoid that potential side effect and instead consider formulations that are peptide-based or contain botanical DHT blockers.
Some examples of prostaglandins include s — Isopropyl cloprostenate, Isopropanol Phenyl-hydroxyl-pentene,  Dihydroxy-cyclopentyl-heptenate, Dechloro Dihydroxy Difluoro Ethylcloprostenolamide and Trifluoromethyl Dechloro Ethylprostenolamide.
Wondering what causes sparse brows? Genetics plays a significant role. If you weren’t born with many hair follicles in the first place, no topical or oral solution will create follicles where they did not previously exist, says Jaliman.
Genetics aside, some people may have lost eyebrow hair because they have either over-plucked their hair, have an autoimmune disease, eat a poor diet, have experienced hormonal changes, or have inflammation of the skin, according to Jaliman. Fortunately, there are solutions like eyebrow growth serums for these environmental or situational changes to your eyebrow hair.
The active ingredient in most shampoos for thinning hair and products like Rogaine is minoxidil, which essentially widens the blood cells, allowing more oxygen, blood and nutrients to reach the follicles, says King.
Given that it’s the most proven treatment for hair loss in men and women, it would seem like a strong candidate for eyebrow growth, but the dermatologists we spoke to advised us to proceed with caution. “Side effects from applying Rogaine to the eyebrow area include burning, dryness, itchiness, redness and scaling,” she says. Plus, you could grow hair where you don’t want it, according to Green.
If you want to see results, consider using your eyebrow growth serum every night to see results, says Jaliman. As you’re getting ready for bed, apply the serum as the last step in your evening skincare routine and let it completely dry so you’re not wiping it away on your pillow when you lie down. “Once you have your desired brows, you can cut usage back to three times a week,” she says.
Just know that you have to be diligent about continuing to use the serum to maintain the results. If you stop using the serum once you are happy with the results, your brows will return to their previous state.
Typically, dermatologists, including Jaliman and Green, treat patients with Latisse, a prescription-only topical solution that’s marketed for eyelash growth but works on eyebrows as well. Latisse has been shown in clinical studies to make eyelashes grow longer, thicker and darker, says King.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/shark-speedstyle-smoothstyle-review-rcna100036,I tried two Shark hair tools for months — here’s what to know,HAIR CARE,"I don’t know life without worrying about my curls. Shampoo and styling routines take up an uncanny amount of brain space. I don’t go more than a few hours without thinking about my wash schedule, how my workouts affect my curls, what the humidity will mean for my hair throughout the day and what sprays I need to keep my blowouts lasting as long as possible. I’m constantly looking for products or tools that can make optimizing my hair — whether it be my natural waves or a sleek blowout — easier.
Enter: the Shark SpeedStyle and SmoothStyle, two tools I’ve been using on and off for months to style my hair. The tools, which Shark sent me last year to test out, are part of the brand’s air technology lineup along with its FlexStyle wand (a popular — less expensive — alternative to the Dyson Airwrap).
The SpeedStyle, has similar functionality to the FlexStyle and comes with different head attachments, while the SmoothStyle is the brand’s version of a brush and styler in one (á la the Revlon One Step Volumizer).
Below, I share more about my experience using Shark’s hair tools and what you should know before shopping.
SKIP AHEAD What is the Shark SpeedStyle? | What is the Shark SmoothStyle? | How I tried Shark’s hair tools | My experience trying the Shark SpeedStyle | My experience trying the Shark SmoothStyle | How do Shark hair tools compare in price to competitors?
The Shark SpeedStyle ($199) is a standalone hair dryer that comes with various attachments like a diffuser, a finisher to reduce frizz and flyaways, a quick-smooth brush, an express touchup brush, a turbo concentrator and a wide-tooth comb. It’s available in two versions — one for straight and wavy hair and one for curly and coily hair; the two models come with different combinations of the aforementioned attachments. However, you can purchase all of them on Shark’s website if you’d like the full set.
With three heat settings and three air settings, you can find your ideal drying experience. For example, if you’re more interested in a quick dry and want to avoid direct heat, you can turn up the air to level three. If you’re interested in a highly styled look, you’ll likely want to use some of the heat settings along with air. It also has a cool shot to help you seal in styles like bouncy curls.
Unlike the FlexStyle base, this styler is curved at a 90-degree angle to mimic the shape of a classic hair dryer. The pièce de résistance? Its temperature regulation. The tool measures its temperature 1,000 times per second and won’t exceed 230 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the brand. (Heat damages hair at around 302 degrees Fahrenheit, according to Shark.) With the included cord, it weighs 1.7 pounds.
This heated comb straightener and smoother (which weighs 1.6 pounds, including the cord) looks like an electric round brush. It has three preset air temperature settings and one heat setting, which you can use on dry or wet hair. For the best results, Shark recommends that your hair be about 70% dry and only 30% wet.
The 2-inch x 2.5-inch oval-barrel tool ($99) combines nylon and boar bristles with ceramic-coated plates that heat up to 420 degrees Fahrenheit. The heated plates are covered by black “teeth” that prevent you from accidentally touching the plates. (Generally, ceramic-coated plates are great for those with damaged, dry hair since they don’t get as hot as other types of plates (like titanium and tourmaline) and provide even heat distribution, according to experts in our guide to the best hair straighteners.)
On the barrel, a little light indicator lets you know when it’s heating up, ready to use and off. (In wet hair mode the ceramic combs are always off.) For the full experience, Shark recommends using the airflow in wet hair mode to dry your hair before following it up with dry hair mode (where the ceramic plates will turn on) to give it a finishing touch and remove frizz.
If you have coily or curly hair, Shark recommends avoiding curl cream or mousse during prep to get a smooth finish.
For the past few months, I’ve been using both tools to dry and style my hair (Shark sent them to me to test before each tool’s launch). I’ve also used the brand’s FlexStyle for the past year and am particularly familiar with its round brush head and diffuser. Familiarity with how the FlexStyle attachments work made using these two products easier, though I think you can still use the SmoothStyle and SpeedStyle easily without doing so.
I have wavy to curly hair that, depending on the day and humidity level, falls between a 2A to 2C curl. Since my hair is especially frizzy, dry and finicky, I often use at least three to five taming or styling products when wet. When using heat tools specifically, I always use a heat protectant; my favorites are the Briogeo Farewell Frizz blow dry perfection heat protectant cream and the Kérastase Genesis heat protecting leave-in treatment. I used the tools differently — I either try to enhance my natural, everyday curls or give myself a salon-style blowout.
The Shark SpeedStyle, just like its name implies, is speedy. The air settings are powerfully strong, and the heat settings are quite hot. This tool, which operates like the FlexStyle (with a base with different attachments), works quickly and mightily. A level three (out of three) air setting made my dripping wet hair somewhat damp in minutes. If you’re someone who doesn’t need to style their hair and is just looking for a quick dry tool, the airflow options are great.
The same goes for the heat settings — I found it almost too hot especially when I used the finisher head (its taming attachment) near my roots. (The finisher head sits parallel to the SpeedStyle base, you run it over the top of your hair to smooth away frizz and baby hairs.)
The SpeedStyle comes with a helpful, easy-to-follow manual that denotes which parts of the attachments you can touch so you don’t burn yourself while removing the heads. The booklet also has detailed instructions about how to use each head and achieve certain hairstyles (it even gives you optimal air and heat settings.)
Besides how strong the air force was, one of my biggest takeaways is how lightweight it is. While the base doesn’t fold down (it permanently sits at a 90-degree angle), it’s relatively compact compared to other blow dryers I’ve used. The head attachments, in my experience, are also smaller than the FlexStyle’s attachments, which made reaching my roots easier.
As someone with curly hair who likes to vacillate between a sleek blowout and natural curls, this is a reliable all-in-one tool since it comes with a diffuser (that has extendable divots to better reach longer hair) and attachments geared toward non-curly hairstyles. Its diffuser functioned as expected — it works like it’s supposed to, which, for someone with curly hair, is essential.
The SpeedStyle’s ultimately extremely similar to the FlexStyle in terms of its offerings — it’s just shaped slightly differently and has some new attachments like the finisher to fight frizz. If you already own the FlexStyle, in my experience, you don’t also need the SpeedSyle; they’re extremely similar.
The Shark SmoothStyle combines the two-step process of needing to hold a blow dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other. As a frequent user of brush-like heat tools on my hair — mostly the Amika Hair Blow Dryer Brush 2.0 and the oval brush attachment on the Flexstyle, I found it inherently easy and intuitive to use. There’s not a huge learning curve like some other curling irons or air stylers.
To give myself that blow-out look, I sectioned my primed hair into layers and ran the brush tool through my hair from root to tip, at an angle, to give my ends a bit of a bounce. If you are used to partitioning your hair into sections, styling it, and continuing the process until you’re done, you’ll likely have an easy time using this.
Since there are no attachments, there is little to get “good” at. You can decide which level of air you want (out of three) and whether you want a heat setting, but besides that, all you need to do is run the brush through your hair for it to work — it’s quite simple and great for beginners looking to explore the hair tool world.
In my experience, the air settings alone were not enough to quickly dry or style my naturally frizzy, wavy hair. To get closer to a picture-perfect, post-salon look, I needed to use the heat setting and repeatedly go over my hair three to five times, followed by a flat iron to really nail smooth out my curly roots. (That said, this is typically the case with my hair for every heated styler I’ve ever used.)
The SmoothStyle is about 13.5 inches long (about the size of a Macbook) and feels comfortable enough to hold. At the top of the styler, there’s a tiny widget that doesn’t heat up so you can hold onto it while gliding the tool through your hair. Shark calls it a cool-touch tip, which was very helpful to have when the heat setting was on.
Overall, it’s lightweight and easy to use. If you’re looking for a vehicle to straighten your hair or give yourself a bouncy blowout, it’s a great option. This is not the tool for anyone wanting to enhance natural coils or curls, however.
Shark is known for making quality tools — whether it be vacuums, air purifiers and fans, carpet cleaners or hair tools — at a pricey, but not too pricey range. All of its tools are less than the Dyson counterparts; for example, its hair dryer with attachments (the SpeedStyle) retails for $199, while Dyson’s hair dryers range from $399 to $499.99; Shark’s FlexStyle wand is very similar to Dyson’s Airwrap, but retails for much less ($299 versus $599, respectively).
Pattern Beauty makes a comparable blow dryer with attachments designed specifically for curly, coily and tight-textured hair. It retails at a similar price point ($189) to Shark’s.
Regarding combination round brush hot tools, there are many options, most of which are similar in price or more expensive than Shark’s ($99). There’s T3’s AireBrush One-Step Smoothing and Volumizing Hair Dryer Brush for $149.99, Drybar’s Double Shot Oval Blow Dryer Brush for $155 and Amika’s Hair Blow Dryer Brush 2.0 for $100. If you’re looking for a more budget-friendly option, Revlon makes a hair dryer and volumizer brush for $59.99.
I’m an editor for NBC Select.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-flat-irons-hair-straighteners-ncna1234372,"15 best flat irons, according to experts",HAIR CARE,"There are various tools that can help you create a salon-worthy blowout at home, including curling wands, hair dryers and, perhaps the most versatile of them all, flat irons. A flat iron can often have similar functions as a round brush or curling iron, which minimizes your need for extra hair tools, especially if you’re traveling.
To help you find the best flat iron for your hair type, I spoke to experts and hairstylists about how to shop for a flat iron and how to protect your hair from heat damage. I also gathered their recommendations for the best flat irons to shop, as well as NBC Select staff favorites.
SKIP AHEAD Best flat irons to shop | How do ceramic, tourmaline and titanium flat irons differ? | How to shop for a flat iron | Do flat irons damage hair? | Why trust NBC Select?
Flat irons provide sleek, long-lasting looks that smooth the cuticle and lock in a specific style with minimal tension and less repetitive passes on the hair fibers, says Bridgette Hill, a certified trichologist and scalp expert. When shopping for one, our experts recommend looking at the following factors:
Below, I rounded up experts’ recommendations for the best flat irons to shop, all with varying plate types, sizes and heat settings. I also included favorites from our NBC Select editors.
Dyson is an NBC Select staff-favorite brand for hair tools, and the brand’s straighteners come recommended by Kyle DeToure, a Washington-based hairstylist and colorist. The Dyson Airstrait, the brand’s newest flat iron, uses hot air to dry and straighten your hair instead of hot plates (which helps cause less heat damage to your hair, according to the brand). In addition to using the tool on wet or damp hair, you can use it to refresh or touch-up dry hair. For efficiency, the tool senses when hair is closeby, and automatically drops to low airflow when it’s not, according to Dyson. It also has an LCD screen that displays airflow and temperature settings, plus an auto-pause feature after three seconds of inactivity.
If you're looking for a more traditional flat iron, consider the Dyson Corrale, which uses magnesium copper alloy plates instead of the traditional ceramic or titanium plates to help cause less heat damage to your hair, according to the brand.
Plate type: n/a | Plate size: n/a | Number of heat settings: 3 | Digital display: yes | Max heat: 285 degrees Fahrenheit | Automatic shut off: no; auto-pause after 3 seconds
This tourmaline-infused ceramic iron comes recommended by Harvey because it gives hair a smooth finish, she says. It takes 30 seconds to heat up to the maximum temperature of 425 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the brand. “Its sleek design also makes it easy to straighten, curl or wave [hair] effortlessly,” says Harvey.

T3 is a quality hair tool brand, according to Tina Malhotra, hairstylist and owner of Hair By Tina M. This highly rated option has nine heat settings that you can adjust using the built-in digital display. The flat iron also includes a smart microchip that monitors heat fluctuations and maintains a consistent temperature while you use it, according to the brand. The flat iron is available in both a 1-inch and 1.5-inch version.

David Jones-Muñoz, a stylist and owner of Salon Dumbo in Brooklyn, says he keeps this flat iron handy and loves that it has a small curve to help create a beachy wave. Although it does not have a digital display, it has smart technology that helps the straightener maintain a preset temperature as you style, according to Ghd.
Plate type: ceramic | Plate size: 1 inch | Heat settings: 1 | Digital display: no | Max heat: 365 degrees Fahrenheit | Automatic shut off: after 30 minutes
NBC Select associate reporter Bianca Alvarez recommends this flat iron from Drybar, which she uses to get pin straight hair as well as waves. The ergonomic hot tool, which reaches 450 degrees Fahrenheit, has four small plates that require fewer passes, creating less heat damage, according to the brand. “I have medium, dry hair and after using this flat iron, my hair looks way less frizzy because I’m able to get close to my roots and take it all the way down to my ends in one go,” says Alvarez.
Plate type: titanium | Plate size: 0.5 inch | Heat settings: 5 | Digital display: no | Max heat: 450 degrees Fahrenheit | Automatic shut off: after 60 minutes
You can use this tool, which has a 4.6-star average rating from over 1,400 reviews on Amazon, to create straight, wavy or curly hair. Reviewers say it’s easy to use because it heats up quickly, glides without any snagging or pulling and has a long cord that doesn’t get in their way. It also comes with a heat-resistant travel cap to protect the surfaces you place your hot tool on.
Plate type: titanium | Plate size: 1.25 inches | Heat settings: 4 | Digital display: yes | Max heat: 440 degrees Fahrenheit | Automatic shut off: after 30 minutes
After owning this flat iron for years, it’s still my all-time favorite — it’s one of the only flat irons I’ve used that doesn’t pull at my hair and heats up fast. You can adjust the temperature on the digital display, which makes using it so much easier than using side buttons, and I love knowing the exact temperature that it’s at so I don’t fry my hair. Aside from its performance, its slim shape doesn’t take up too much space while I’m traveling.

This flat iron is easy to use and heats up and cools quickly, says Harvey. The slim design lets you be precise and get close to your roots as you straighten or curl your hair thanks to its rounded edges, she says. It’s available in two sizes: 1.25 inch plates and 1.5 inch plates, the latter of which is great for those with long, thick or coarse hair, according to the brand.
Plate type: ceramic | Plate size: 1.25 inches | Heat settings: 8 | Digital display: yes | Max heat: 410 degrees Fahrenheit | Automatic shut off: after 60 minutes
This Babyliss flat iron has elongated plates to help you style your hair faster, according to the brand. This flat iron, which has a 4.6-average star rating from 7,700 reviews on Amazon, heats up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and can straighten or create waves, according to Babyliss. Reviewers say it works on all hair types, including fine and very coarse hair, and leaves hair frizz-free. This flat iron is also available in a larger size with 1.75 inch plates.
Plate type: titanium | Plate size: 1.25 inches | Heat settings: 5 | Digital display: yes | Max heat: 450 degrees Fahrenheit | Automatic shut off: n/a
The Cloud Nine flat iron, which comes recommended by London-based hair stylist Stefan Bertin, is available in three sizes: 0.5 inches, 1 inch and 1.5 inches. It has seven temperature settings, which is helpful for determining which one works best for your hair type, according to the brand. The ceramic plates are infused with minerals (including tourmaline), so you get a snag-free glide, says Bertin. The tool takes 20 seconds to reach its maximum temperature, according to the brand, and has a protective guard to keep your surfaces safe from heat damage.
Plate type: ceramic and tourmaline | Plate size: 1 inch | Heat settings: 7 | Digital display: yes | Max heat: 392 degrees Fahrenheit | Automatic shut off: after 30 minutes
I recently fell in love with this T3 flat iron after the brand sent it to me to try out, and it's now one of my favorite hair tools to use. It has more rounded and longer plates than most other options on this list, which makes it easier and quicker to create smooth waves. It's also super lightweight and easy to hold without it slipping out of my hands, in my experience. I also notice the ceramic plates leave my hair smooth and frizz-free with every pass.
Plate type: ceramic | Plate size: 1 inch | Heat settings: 9 | Digital display: no | Max heat: n/a | Automatic shut off: after 1 hour
If you want a flat iron that will last you a long time, consider this option, which comes recommended by NBC Select editor Lindsay Schneider. “I’ve been straightening my hair since I was 10 and have only ever used two straighteners, including this one that I’ve owned for five years now,” she says. Unlike most other flat irons on our list, which allow you to adjust the temperature, this one is pre-set to prevent extreme heat on your hair, according to the brand. It also has universal voltage, so you can take it overseas, according to Ghd.
Plate type: ceramic | Plate size: 1 inch | Heat settings: 1 | Digital display: no | Max heat: 365 degrees Fahrenheit | Automatic shut off: after 30 minutes
Malhotra has used this Paul Mitchell flat iron at her salon for years. It has 1.25-inch plates (it also comes in a 1.5-inch version, which is best for thicker, more coarse hair) and has rounded edges that can make it easier to style your hair into waves, curls or flips, according to the brand. The flat iron heats up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit in 45 seconds, according to Paul Mitchell. It also lets you set a custom timer for when you want it to turn off automatically.
Plate type: titanium | Plate size: 1.25 inches | Heat settings: 4 | Digital display: yes | Max heat: 450 degrees Fahrenheit | Automatic shut off: after 120 minutes or sooner based on customization features
This Amika hot tool uses infrared light beams in its titanium plates to maintain your hair’s moisture while you straighten, curl or create waves, according to the brand. Not only does it keep moisture locked in, but it also helps minimize frizz, which occurs frequently in overly dry hair, according to Amika. Reviewers say it makes their thick, frizz-prone hair look smooth, and it takes a shorter amount of time to style since it only requires one to two passes. The flat iron has a 4.5-star average rating from over 300 reviews on Amazon.
Plate type: titanium | Plate size: 1.25 inches | Heat settings: unlimited between 170 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit  | Digital display: yes | Max heat: 450 degrees Fahrenheit | Automatic shut off: after 60 minutes
Jones-Muñoz calls this flat iron a “workhorse” and says he likes using it at his salon because of  its thick, durable plates. The adjustable temperature works well for his clients, and he prefers the brand’s ceramic plates over titanium because it offers a better “pull” on the hair, making it easier to style.

The three most common flat iron plates are ceramic, tourmaline and titanium. Each one will straighten hair, but different attributes make each more beneficial for certain hair textures, ranging from fine wavy hair to kinky coils.
Ceramic flat irons, which have ceramic-coated plates, are the most affordable option out of the three types of hair straighteners, says Bertin. They don’t get as hot as titanium and tourmaline, which makes them “ideal for those with dry, damaged or fine hair,” he says. However, ceramic-coated plates often need to be routinely checked since the coating can wear and chip away — in fact, when the metal beneath (usually aluminum) is exposed, it can cause damage to your hair, says Bertin.
Ceramic flat irons provide fairly even heat distribution, glide through the hair smoothly and leave behind a glossy sheen, says Courtney Foster, a licensed cosmetologist and owner of Courtney Foster Beauty. However, both Foster and Bertin agree that those with thick, coarse hair should pass on ceramic flat irons since they don’t typically reach high enough temperatures to straighten thicker hair.
Tourmaline-coated plates are generally constructed from a tourmaline (a mineral) and ceramic blend that “offers an extra layer of protection and smoothness,” says Hill. Tourmaline irons are considered the best of the three types because their heat distribution means you’ll need fewer passes to get your desired straightening effect, says Bertin.
“Tourmaline plates are a step above the ceramic plates when hair type and texture are medium with loose waves and nominal frizz,” says Hill. Tourmaline provides a barrier to excessive heat and, as with most modern heating tools, you can adjust the temperature settings to fit the majority of hair types and textures.
Titanium is a strong, durable metal best suited for professional salon use on coarse thick, curly and coily hair. These plates typically heat up the quickest and more evenly distribute heat compared to ceramic plates, which allows for fewer passes over the hair, a smoother finish and better results than a ceramic iron, says Foster. However, titanium can cause the most damage to your hair, so you should avoid these if you have fine or damaged hair, according to Hill.
“The heat transfer from titanium is intense, quick and, if used frequently or improperly, can create irreversible heat damage and breakage,” says Hill. She recommends leaving titanium to the professionals and touching up at home with a tourmaline or ceramic iron when needed.
In addition to the plate materials, our experts recommend looking at features like size of the plates and a digital display to monitor the temperature.
“Smaller plates are better for short hair, whereas larger plates are better for longer hair,” says Bertin. However, the plate size won’t really affect the finished product, but it will affect the speed at which you get there, he says.
Once plates get to 2 inches wide or above, there’s less versatility and less chance that you’ll move the straightener quick enough without burning the hair, says Jones-Muñoz.
If you’re looking to use a flat iron for curls and beach waves, consider using flat irons with rounded edges that allow you to curl your hair onto the back of the straightener without much tug and pull, says Jones-Muñoz.
Flat irons vary in price based on multiple factors, including plate quality and material, size and brand recognition.
“If you’re using it for a quick touch-up or once a month, then you could go with something that’s a little less expensive,” says Jones-Muñoz. More durable straighteners (like those with titanium plates) are on the pricier side, but they will be less likely to wear and chip with frequent use.
Our experts agree that flat irons should have a button or knob that displays the temperature you’re using. Harvey recommends flat irons with a digital display, which indicates the exact temperature the iron reaches and any fluctuations.
Improper use, like using a temperature too high for your hair type, can cause damage, according to our experts. “Hair is a fabric and, like any material, heat can deteriorate and break down the hair structure,” says Hill. The cuticle — the outer layer of a hair strand — can very easily become damaged by heat over 356 degrees Fahrenheit, experts told us. Damaging that cuticle layer will make your hair more porous, which means it will struggle to hold on to moisture, causing dryness and breakage.
Determining the safest heat setting depends on your hair type and texture. “​​Thick hair can use a higher setting, while thin hair should use a lower heat setting,” says Foster.
When using a flat iron, you should do so via quick passes on low or medium temperature and you should always use some kind of heat protectant when using any hot tool, according to our experts. Severe damage is likely irreparable and has to be grown out, says Bertin. Although hair straighteners are safe when used properly, you shouldn’t use them (or any hot tool) every day, our experts say.
“Even with the best heat protectants in the game, heat is not something you should be exposing your hair to every day,” says Bertin. “Those with afro-textured hair, for example, should consider flat ironing their hair at most once a week because our hair is naturally more fragile and dry, so flat ironing any more than that is a huge no-no,” says Bertin.

What can be better? Thankfully, you don’t have to master working a hair dryer and round brush at the same time for a salon-level finish. A 3-in-1 hair tool that dries, detangles and styles hair simultaneously, more popularly known as a blow dryer brush, requires less work while giving you the same results.
To help you learn about this hot tool, including how to properly use it and what to consider before purchasing one, I spoke to hairstylists and rounded up their recommendations along with NBC Select staff favorites and highly rated options.

Amy Abramite, creative director and hairstylist at Maxine Salon in Chicago, loves the Dyson Airwrap for its quality (both performance and material) and versatility, which mimics a full salon kit thanks to six styling attachments, including three brushes — two for smoothing and one for volumizing.
It’s also a personal favorite of mine because it dries my hair fast, and I can use the interchangeable attachments to achieve whatever style I want. For example, I use the firm smoothing brush for straight and smooth styles, but for big and bouncy curls, I use the long barrels.

“If you’re looking for a vehicle to straighten your hair or give yourself a bouncy blowout, it’s a great option,” says NBC Select commerce editor Lindsay Schneider, who received a sample from SmoothStyle to test and review. This tool comes recommended by Abramite because it has wet and dry hair modes. Wet hair mode dries and adds volume to the hair, while dry hair mode heats the comb with no added airflow to smooth out and straighten styles, according to the brand.

“I used to always blow dry my hair and then straighten it with a flat iron, but I haven’t looked back since getting the Revlon One Step,” says NBC Select page Ella Morrissey, who has short and straight hair with a fine texture. “It leaves my hair feeling silky and soft after just 10 minutes. It feels like I’m getting a professional blowout from the comfort of my own home.” The hot tool has a 2.4-inch oval head size and soft bristles that help to prevent snagging or pulling on the hair, according to the brand.

Schneider also loves using this option from Amika to blow out her curly hair. “It gets hot without feeling like I’m burning through my hair, and the big barrel gives me really big bouncy curls on my ends when I use it,” she says. “It can very quickly dry my hair, too, which I appreciate.” She also loves that there’s almost zero learning curve, making it straightforward to use. This version is an upgrade from its previous model, thanks to internal mechanisms that boost its durability, according to the brand.

Whenever I want a subtle, bouncy blowout, I reach for my T3 Airebrush because it works fast and I can easily adjust the airflow and heat settings by rotating the end of the handle. After a few passes through my hair, my final look has little to no frizz, which is surprising since I tend to have frizz-prone hair that can worsen with excessive brushing. Aside from its effectiveness and efficiency, I can move around my bathroom while styling my hair since it has an 8-foot swivel cord that doesn’t get tangled up or restrict movement.

Abramite, who has straight and fine hair, never travels without this lightweight option. “It has ionic and ceramic technology built in for a speedy and healthy blowout that’s frizz-free with plenty of bounce,” she says. She also says it’s easy to maneuver and gets the job done in just a few passes.

The Shark FlexStyle comes recommended by NBC Select social media assistant Caitlin Cusack, who says it cut her styling time from 40 minutes down to 20. “I love using the round brush attachments to give my hair the perfect blowout look,” she says. “I like to use these right after washing to smooth my frizzy hair while also giving it some volume. I’ll first use the paddle brush to make sure my hair is dry, then I’ll use the rounded attachment to give my hair volume and a bouncy blowout finish.” The FlexStyle also comes with two interchangable auto-wrap curlers and a styling concentrator. And although this is pricier than most options on our list, Cusack says it’s durable and worth the splurge.

Reviewers say that this blow dryer brush, which has a 4.4-star average rating from over 3,900 reviews on Amazon, leaves their hair smooth, voluminous and shiny in a timely fashion. They also love how easy it is to use, and despite it being one of the heaviest options on this list, reviewers say it feels lightweight and isn’t bothersome as they dry and style hair. If you prefer a smaller barrel, the brand also has its Single Shot Blow Dryer Brush, roughly 0.2 inches smaller than the barrel on The Double Shot.

L’ange’s Le Volume uses tug-resistant bristles to create tension for overall smooth styles with lots of volume, according to the brand. The brush’s titanium technology heats up quickly and distributes the heat evenly so you can efficiently style your hair with minimal frizz. This blow dryer brush has a 4.4-star average rating from over 12,600 reviews on Amazon and is also available in a smaller barrel size.

This silicone-cushioned paddle, which has a 4.5-star average rating from over 3,000 reviews on Amazon, has 136 evenly-spaced bristles for pain-free brushing and comfort, according to the brand. Reviewers say they notice less breakage, snagging and pulling when blow drying and brushing their hair with this tool. They also say their hair is left feeling and looking silky smooth and enjoy that they can have a slight bounce to their style if they choose not to have completely straight hair.

Although this is suitable for all hair types and textures, reviewers with thick hair especially love this blow dryer brush because it dries and smooths their hair fast. Reviewers say it’s also great for quick touchups and refreshes at the ends (the charcoal-infused bristles help refresh day two hair, according to the brand) and love how its long cord allows for them to easily move around their bathroom.

When shopping for a blow dryer brush, our experts recommend thinking about a few important factors so you can safely and easily style your hair:
Most blow dryer brushes have nylon and boar bristles for grip and tension to manipulate hair into a smooth, frizz-free finish regardless of the style you want to achieve. Most textures respond well to denser bristles, but if you have breakage, use one with sparser bristles to create less tension and more protection for fragile hair, says Abramite.
A larger barrel will create smoothness and minimal movement post-styling, whereas a smaller one will boost volume and waves and/or curl in the style, according to Abramite.
Barrel size might also depend on your hair length, according to Tineo. For example, a small brush is best suited for those with short hair, while a larger brush may be better for those with long hair, Tineo says.
Blow dryer brushes typically have two to four heat settings. Abramite recommends choosing one with a high heat, low heat and cool setting. Fragile textures prone to heat damage should be used on low heat, and healthier hair types can use the high heat setting. The cool button is a nice bonus to lock in and set the style for longer-lasting results, she says. Keep in mind that hair cuticles can become damaged by heat over 365 degrees Fahrenheit, according to experts in our guide to the best flat irons.
The type of blow dryer brush you choose also depends on your hair type and texture. Tineo recommends the following:
A blow dryer brush is more user-friendly for at-home styling, according to Abramite. The hair dryer and brush are combined in one tool, making it easier to dry and style simultaneously because there is less juggling of the tools. A bonus with some of the newer blow dryer brushes is the variety in sizes and shapes of attachments to mimic salon results, she says.
However, a blow dryer (on its own) offers more variety with heat settings and power options, resulting in more styling options. The downside is it requires more skill to dry hair while simultaneously using a hair dryer and a brush.
How you use a blow dryer brush will depend on the tool (some may have specific instructions) and how you want the finished hairstyle to look. Generally, Abramite suggests doing the following:
Because a blow dryer brush has bristles, hair can get stuck and leave your brush dirty. After each use, use your fingers or a tail comb to remove the loose hair that gets caught in the bristles, says Abramite. You can also use a damp cloth to wipe away any leftover product that builds up on the handle, she says.

I’m an associate reporter at NBC Select covering the latest product launches and all things beauty and wellness, including recent stories on the best shampoo bars and hair masks.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-heatless-curlers-rcna156559,The best heatless curlers,HAIR CARE,"There have been a number of beauty trends on TikTok that are not worth the hype or that are even dangerous—like suctioning your lips to make them look fuller. But the social media platform is also filled with some pretty smart trends. Case in point: heatless curlers. Perhaps you’ve even seen videos of people with their strands wrapped around these silky tubes.
Made of a soft material, heatless curlers can give you bouncy waves without exposing your hair to the heat damage you risk with hot tools like traditional curling irons or flat irons. Even better? Experts say they really can. Below, we asked hair stylists and beauty experts to explain what heatless curlers are and how to shop for them — plus, we collected a list of expert- and NBC Select staff-recommended heatless curlers to try.
SKIP AHEAD What are heatless curlers? | How we picked the best heatless curlers | The best heatless curlers of 2025 | How to use heatless curlers
Heatless curlers are exactly what they sound like. “They require no heat, no electricity, no hot irons — they are just tools to set hair without heat and create curls,” says Meleesa Luna, a hairstylist and founder of Intuitive Beauty Studio. Most heatless curlers consist of a long foam tube covered in satin or silk that you wrap your hair around and secure with either clips or scrunchies. But this isn’t the only type of heatless curler. There are also individual heatless curlers. These act as more traditional curlers where you wrap sections of hair around a tool, let them set and then take them out.
Hot tools (like curling and flat irons) use heat to style your hair. Heat can damage your hair, dry it out and cause breakage. One of the biggest benefits of heatless curlers is you can achieve bouncy curls without potentially damaging your hair, says hairstylist Valery Joseph, founder of Valery Joseph Salons. Because of this, heatless curlers can be a particularly good option for those who have damaged or chemically treated hair, which can be more prone to breakage.
When shopping for heatless curlers, the experts we spoke with suggested paying attention to the following factors:
To help you choose the right heatless curlers, we gathered expert-recommended options, NBC Select staff favorites, and highly rated picks that meet the above criteria.
This heatless curling set consists of one long satin-covered tube. You put it on like a headband and then wrap your hair (in 2-inch sections) around either end, securing it with the two included satin scrunchies. “This set is the best,” says NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio. “The satin material is soft and easy to use once you get the hang of it.” For curls that last, the brand suggests wrapping damp hair around the foam tube, letting it set overnight and removing it for bouncy curls.
Similar to the set from Kitsch, this option from Silke London includes a foam rod and two scrunchies. It also includes a clip to help you fasten the tube to the top of your head for easier hair wrapping. Joseph notes this rod is longer than most, making it a good option for those with long hair. The rod and scrunchies are covered in 100% silk and can be worn for just a few hours or overnight for curls that will stay longer, according to the brand.
“Rather than a long rod, this option is more of a headband — which may be easier for some to sleep in,” says Joseph. To use, secure the down-filled rod on top of your head with the included claw clip. Wrap your hair in small sections around the silk-covered foam rod on either side of your head and secure each end with the included no-slip hair ties. Then, snap either end of the rod together at the back of your head so it stays in place all night.
According to the brand, this heatless curling rod is stuffed with cotton and covered in a combination of cotton and velvet, giving hair something to cling to without causing friction. The top of the rod has a flat design, making it sit on your head more easily. The set comes with two small clips to fasten it as a headband and two scrunches to secure your hair in place. This set has a 4.4-star average rating from over 16,250 reviews on Amazon.
Do you prefer individual curlers over one long rod? This set comes with 30 individual satin-covered sponge rollers. To use them, take 2-inch sections of damp hair, wrap them and secure them by typing the two ends of the curlers together. For best results, sleep in them overnight. Unlike the single rod options, this set will give you a fuller, more curly look. It has a 4.2-star average rating from over 10,970 reviews on Amazon.
One thing to know beforehand: “Heatless curlers take some practice to get uniform curls,” says Joseph. So, it’s a good idea to do a few trial runs when you don’t have somewhere important to be — that way, if you don’t like how they turn out, you’re not left scrambling. To make the process smoother for you, we asked our experts for a step-by-step guide on using them.
Step one: Prep your hair with your favorite products. “If you have fine, straight hair, you would want to spray your hair or prep it with something that will give your hair support as it wraps around the curler,” says Luna. “If you have curly or frizzy hair, you might want to use a serum or a cream to soften it.”
Step two: Wrap damp hair around your curling rod (or curling rods). You want it to be about 90 percent dry, says Joseph. Regardless of whether you use one long rod or a bunch of smaller rods, take 2-inch sections and wrap them around the rod. Finish by securing hair to the rod.
Step three: If you plan on sleeping in your heatless curlers, Luna suggests wrapping your hair with a silk scarf or bonnet to avoid flyaways and frizz. Another option is to sleep on a silk pillowcase.
Step four: Mist hair with a light-hold hairspray before taking your hair out. Then, gently unwrap your hair from the curlers and run your fingers through your curls to loosen them.
Yes. Sleeping with heatless curlers is smart for a few reasons. First, it gives your curls extra time to set. Plus, sleeping with them can save you time in the morning; you just have to unwrap your hair and you’re good to go, says Luna.
“Heatless curlers can give you many different looks,” says Luna. “It all depends on your hair length, texture, and the type of curler you use — the smaller the diameter of the curler, the more curl you'll get. The wider the rod, the looser the curl will be.” It also depends on how much hair you wrap around the rods. Bigger sections will lead to looser curls, whereas smaller sections will give you tighter curls.

All of the head shavers below are water-resistant with both wet and dry shaving capabilities, which aligns with our experts’ guidance.
The Skull Shaver Pitbull is a favorite of Davide Marinelli, founder and creative director at Davide Hair Studio, thanks to its durability. Although it doesn’t come with extra attachments, it has an ergonomic handle and a chamber to prevent hair clippings from falling everywhere and making a mess. It also has an LED display that lets you see how much battery you have left.
Number of blades: 4 | Number of attachments: N/A | Run time: 90 minutes | Water-resistant: yes
This head shaver from Wyklaus has seven rounded razors for getting a close shave all over the curves of the scalp. You can charge it via a USB cable, making it great for keeping in your bathroom or in your toiletry bag when traveling. With a 4.3-star average rating from 9,133 reviews on Amazon, it has a runtime of up to 120 minutes, according to the brand, and a travel lock, so it won’t accidentally turn on in transit. The handle on top displays how much battery is left, so you don’t have to worry about it dying in the middle of a shave.
Number of blades: 7 | Number of attachments: 4 | Run time: up to 120 minutes | Water-resistant: yes
The Kibiy Electric Razor comes with a hair clipper, a nose and ear hair trimmer, a massage tool and a cleansing brush to soften stubble. It has a self-locking function that automatically stops the shaver when the blades become clogged, according to the brand. This shaver, which has a 4.2-star average rating from 5,655 reviews on Amazon, also has an LED display showing how much time is left on its current charge.
Number of blades: 6 | Number of attachments: 5 | Run time: 90 minutes | Water-resistant: yes
The Remington Balder Pro Head Shaver comes recommended by Marinelli for its five durable, rotating blades, which he says provide a quick shave. Though it doesn’t come with any attachments, it does collect hair in a chamber underneath the blades that you can empty.
Number of blades: 5 | Number of attachments: N/A | Run time: 50 minutes | Water-resistant: yes
The blades on this head shaver are flexible and contour to your head for an easy glide on the skin, according to Marinelli. It comes with a precision clipper and trimmer with three safety guards, a nose and ear hair trimmer, a pre-shave massager and an exfoliating brush. The head shaver also comes with a cleaning brush to dust off hair from the blades and has a textured ergonomic design that makes it easy to hold, according to the brand.
Number of blades: 5 | Number of attachments: 5 | Run time: 90 minutes | Water-resistant: yes
The Braun Series 9 electric foil razor, which has a 4.4-star average rating from 12,887 reviews on Amazon, is primarily a beard trimmer and face shaver, but you can use it to shave your head in certain areas. Since it’s not a rotary shaver and doesn’t have a curved shape, it’s best for using in more flat areas, such as on sideburns and the temples, which is great for taper fades. It has a charging stand so you can prop it up in your bathroom instead of searching for it in a drawer. Plus, it’s easy to take with you on a trip since it fits in the included travel case.
Number of blades: 1 | Number of attachments: 1 | Run time: 60 minutes | Water-resistant: yes
This head shaver from Philips can help you achieve the closest shave without upsetting your skin, especially since it works perfectly well in contact with water, according to the brand. This means you can shave your head with shaving cream and water without worrying that it’ll break the device. It has a charging stand and a light on the front so you can monitor the battery level and avoid it running out unexpectedly. With a 4.4-star average rating from 44,531 reviews on Amazon, the razor can last for up to 20 shaves on a full charge, according to the brand.
Number of blades: 27 (individual) | Number of attachments: 0 | Run time: 60 minutes | Water-resistant: yes
A head shaver is a tool that uses oscillating rotary blades, which are covered with a thin layer of metal and operate at a high speed, to cut hair. They come with multiple flexible blades to give the curvatures of the head a close and even shave.
While you can use trimmers, clippers and razors to help maintain a smooth shave, which one depends on how you want your hair to look, how close you want your shave to be and how much time you have, since they work at different speeds.
Head shavers are ideal for clean and close shaving. They come with four to seven rotating blades meant to cut hair as close to the scalp as possible. “[Head shavers are] designed to shave hair down to stubble or completely smooth bald while protecting the skin, making them the easiest option for consumers with the least irritation,” says Pezzillo.
Trimmers are better suited to get rid of hair around the neck and around the beard. They’re also good for making precise cuts around the head, according to Pezzillo. “These are electric cutters with a short flat blade that has a thin metal guard attached, typically used for shaving hair bald or doing lineups on the neckline and hairline,” she says.
Clippers are designed to cut long and thick hair quickly or to do different types of fades, according to Pezzillo. “These are larger devices used mainly for haircuts. They’re what you would use to cut fades or a one length buzz cut,” she says. Clippers won’t leave a clean, smooth finish but rather a very short buzz cut. If you want your head completely bald, it’s better to use a true head shaver, according to Marinelli.
Razors can provide a close shave using water and shaving cream , but you should use them with the tools above first if you have longer hair. While you could use a razor to shave your head, it would take much longer than if you used a head shaver. It’s best to only use a razor for getting a full shave on the beard or mustache area. “These are traditional blade razors, like straight razors, safety razors, or disposable razors,” says Pezzillo. “They're used to shave hair completely off the skin, leaving it smooth and bald .”
Before shaving your head, you should shower or soak a washcloth in warm water and apply it according to Butler. You should also use a pre-shave oil to prepare the skin and hair for a close shave. “Prepping the hair first will soften that hair and allow the shaver to glide more smoothly over the head,” Butler says. When using a head shaver, you don’t want a thick shaving cream barrier, making it harder for the blades to glide over the hair, Butler says. He recommends using a brush to apply a thin layer of cream. Once you’re done using your head shaver, rinse your head with cool water and moisturize with a post-shave lotion specifically for the face or scalp.
To avoid skin irritations, such as razor bumps, it’s best to get the skin and hair wet with warm water to relax the follicles, according to Fernandez, who says he only shaves after a shower since the hairs on the face and scalp are much easier to work with and shaving.”As someone who often battles razor bumps, I’ve learned that you should always apply water to any area before shaving it, otherwise it can actually be quite painful.” Plus, consider using a pre-shave oil or, if you do use a shaving cream or gel, only use a small amount since a little goes a long way.

But what are the best curling irons, and what should you look for when shopping for one? To find out, we asked professional hairstylists to share their favorite curling irons, along with tips on how to shop for one and hacks to achieve the look you want.

When deciding which curling iron is best for you, our experts recommend the following factors to keep in mind:
Below, we gathered expert-recommended curling irons, as well as NBC Select staff favorites that we have tried ourselves, as well as highly rated options that align with our experts’ guidance.
The luxe Dyson AirWrap comes with reengineered attachments that self-wrap hair both clockwise and counterclockwise with one barrel, according to Courtney Foster, a hairstylist and trichologist. It comes with six attachments, including three brushes for smoothing and volumizing. After sectioning your hair, choose a barrel, wrap your damp strands around it and hold for about 15 seconds to dry and curl your hair. Follow up with a cool shot of air to help lock your style in place and release for curls or waves, says Foster.
Material: n/a | Barrel size: Depends on attachment |  Number of heat settings: 3 | Digital display: No | Max heat: 302 degrees Fahrenheit
T3 makes some of our favorite curling irons because they have extra long barrels and leave hair very shiny with curls that seem to last all day, says Michael Dueñas, a celebrity hairstylist, groomer and photographer. This long barrel, which is great for long hair and hard to reach places, styles with ease since it’s held in place by the brand’s ProGlide clip design, which is easy to control and glides easily without snagging hair, according to the brand.
Material: Ceramic |  Barrel size: 1.25 inches |  Number of heat settings: 9 | Digital display: No | Max heat: 410 degrees Fahrenheit
This curling iron, with its 24K gold iron barrel, heats up to 430 degrees Fahrenheit evenly, allowing you to create uniform curls, according to the brand. It’s also easy to use and evenly distributes heat, which allows for faster styling, says Foster.
Material: 24K gold |  Barrel size: 1.25 inches |  Number of heat settings: 10 | Digital display: No | Max heat: 430 degrees Fahrenheit
For easy at-home use that’s suitable for all hair types, Foster recommends this option from Babyliss. The nano titanium exterior helps to speed up styling, lock in moisture and reduces frizz for smoother curls. You can achieve this with minimal hassle since the tool is lightweight and equipped with features, like a cool tip, to lower the risk of burning your fingers, according to the brand.
Material: Titanium |  Barrel size: 1.25 inches |  Number of heat settings: Unlimited between 250 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit | Digital display: No | Max heat: 450 degrees Fahrenheit
This curling iron has every barrel size you could ever need, and each one distributes heat evenly. Plus, the curling iron comes with a stay cool tip to make styling easier, says Dueñas. This option from Amika also reduces the amount of heat damage since it causes heat to penetrate the cuticle, resulting in faster styling, according to the brand.
Material: Titanium |  Barrel size: Depends on attachment |  Number of heat settings: Unlimited between 250 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit | Digital display: Yes | Max heat: 450 degrees Fahrenheit
Styling my hair isn’t always easy, and neither is getting the exact curls/waves I have in mind, but I have had the best luck with this interchangeable trio. It comes with three barrels that are easy to swap in and out. Plus, they heat up quickly and always leave me with a shiny and smooth, bouncy curl/wave. If you prefer less of a wave and more of a curl, consider the T3 Switch Kit Curl Trio.
Material: Ceramic |  Barrel size: Depends on attachment |  Number of heat settings: 9 | Digital display: No | Max heat: 410 degrees Fahrenheit
“It looks strange at first and takes some practice, but the Conair Infinito Pro produces the most uniform curl, like magic,” says Foster. This curling iron automatically draws the hair into its chamber, where it’s rolled into a curl and heated. When your curl is ready to be released, an automatic beep indicator will sound off to alert you. However, you can always adjust the timer to release the hair sooner, according to the brand.
Material: Tourmaline ceramic | Barrel size: n/a |  Number of heat settings: Two | Digital display: No | Max heat: 400 degrees Fahrenheit
This L’ange hot tool creates waves that last all day with immense shine, says Dueñas. To help you achieve the perfect look, this waver’s 10-second smart timer will let you know when to move onto the next section of your hair, according to the brand. Overall, this L’ange waver creates cascading and medium waves as opposed to Le Waver (tight, crimpy waves) and Le Tridente (deep beachy waves).
Material: Titanium |  Barrel size: Three 16 millimeter barrels |  Number of heat settings: Unlimited between 250 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit | Digital display: Yes | Max heat: 450 degrees Fahrenheit
This curling iron  is one of the most user-friendly on our list — to create a curl, simply  clamp your hair down and twist the base so that it rolls the hair around the barrel, according to the brand. After curling, your hair is left still feeling soft because the brand’s technology helps seal and lock in moisture throughout the curling process, according to Bio Ionic.
Material: Ceramic |  Barrel size: 1.25 inches |  Number of heat settings: Unlimited between 140 to 440 degrees Fahrenheit  | Digital display: Yes | Max heat: 440 degrees Fahrenheit
This waver is one of my most used hair tools and it goes wherever I go because I truly cannot live without it. The three barrels give my hair perfect waves in just a short amount of time because it heats up so quickly and molds my hair to its shape instantly. Luckily, my thick hair holds styles for a long time so I’m left with sleek beachy waves for days after using this hot tool.
Material: Tourmaline ceramic |  Barrel size: Three 1-inch barrels | Number of heat settings: Unlimited up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit | Digital display: Yes | Max heat: 450 degrees Fahrenheit
Unlike other interchangeable irons on our list, this one combines all types of curling irons into one with attachments including a wand, clamp curling iron and waver. Not only can you customize it to how you want your curls and waves, but it’s also suitable for all hair types and textures since you can adjust the temperature and tailor it to your preferences.

In addition to your hair type, our experts say you should consider the following when shopping for a curling iron:
The type of curling iron you purchase will depend on how you want your hair to look. Our experts discuss the different types below.
Curling irons can be made of various materials and, at times, can combine two or more. Below, our experts explain each and how it differs from its alternatives.
Choose a curling iron that allows you regulate its temperature, as opposed to one with a simple on/off switch, says Foster. This is important because your hair density helps determine the appropriate temperature setting, according to Jagling.
Finer hair types benefit most from low heat, while those with thicker hair should aim higher, according to our experts. For example, people with very thick hair, should set their curling iron between 400-450 degrees Fahrenheit, says Jagling. To keep things in perspective, remember that paper burns at 451 degrees, so if your iron is that hot, it can burn your hair just the same, adds Jagling.
According to our experts, barrel size depends on the type of curl you want to achieve. For tight curls, use a small barrel, and for looser ones, consider a large barrel.
To create long-lasting curls with a curling iron,, consider some of Jagling’s pro tips below.
Constantly applying heat to your hair, especially daily, won’t help to prevent damage. However, Jagling says using a curling iron weekly is generally okay, since there are so many heat protectant products available, which allows you to safely style your hair more frequently.
Also, how often you use a curling iron might depend on how often you wash your hair, he says. Generally, his clients follow a routine. Day one involves washing their hair and blowing it out. Day two is using a hot tool, like a curling iron, and molding their hair. If their hair tends to get greasy quickly, by day three, they throw their hair in an updo and apply dry shampoo before washing and repeating the cycle again.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-meal-prep-containers-ncna1288927,These meal prep containers make storing food easy,HEALTH,"Meal prepping allows you to be on autopilot when you’re ready to eat a meal or snack, says Dr. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University and a nutritionist in private practice. Instead of having to prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner, you can reach into your fridge and pull out pre-made food, eliminating time spent standing over the stove or chopping ingredients.
Since meal prepping involves cooking multiple servings of a dish or larger quantities of food at once, you’ll need containers to store everything in. I talked to nutrition experts about how to decide which meal prep container is right for you and the features you should consider while shopping. I also rounded up some of our favorite options, plus expert-recommended picks.

To recommend the best meal prep containers, I rounded up expert picks and options NBC Select staff love. All of the containers on our list are BPA-free and freezer-safe. We note which ones are oven-safe, microwave-safe and dishwasher-safe.
I meal prep dinner for the work week every Sunday and store food in these containers. They come in a set of five with snap lock silicone lids and have two compartments inside that help me portion out meals. I’ve used the containers for about two years and find them to be super durable. They also haven’t stained, in my experience, even when I’ve poured tomato sauce and curries inside.
Material: glass | Capacity: 4.5 cups | Compartments: three | Care: dishwasher-safe, oven-safe, microwave-safe
Available in multiple sets, these food storage containers from Rubbermaid have secure, snap-on lids, making them leakproof, according to the brand. Each one has two compartments, one large one and another smaller one. With a 4.7-star average rating from 110,562 reviews on Amazon, they have built-in vents on the top to help make them microwave safe and they’re both stain and odor resistant, according to the brand.
Material: plastic | Capacity: 2.85 cups each | Compartments: two | Care: dishwasher-safe, microwave-safe
These meal prep containers are very similar to the glass one above, but they’re made from plastic, so they’re less fragile. They come in a set of four and have tight-fitting lids. The stackable containers — which have a 4.6-star average rating from 16,424 reviews on Amazon — are designed with three compartments, the largest of which holds 2.5 cups of food and the smallest of which holds 1/2 cup of food. Each container in the set has a different color lid, so you can designate one for each meal or day of the week.
Material: plastic | Capacity: 5 cups | Compartments: three | Care: dishwasher-safe, microwave-safe
Recommended by Yaceczko, Bentgo offers stackable, multi-compartment containers that you can use to build snack packs or meals. These come in a pack of 10 with lids and the volume of food that each compartment holds is embossed on the bottom of the tray, helping you measure portions. You can purchase the containers in colors like lilac, blue and silver. They’re reusable up to 10 times, according to the brand.
Material: plastic | Capacity: 4 cups | Compartments: three | Care: dishwasher-safe,  microwave-safe
These meal prep containers are a lower profile option compared to others on our list, making them particularly suitable for stacking in your refrigerator or freezer. The containers have three compartments inside and the clips on their lids create a leak-proof seal around the top, according to the brand. They’re available in a set of five and have a 4.7-star average rating from 23,197 reviews on Amazon.
Material: plastic | Capacity: 3.5 cups | Compartments: three | Care: dishwasher-safe,  microwave-safe
Yaceczko recommends Pyrex containers because of the lid’s superior air-tight seal, which is supported by their built-in locking tabs. This set comes with seven stackable containers in a mix of sizes, plus round, square and rectangular shapes. The containers are designed with labels you can write on with dry erase markers, helping you keep track of what’s inside and when you made it.
Material: glass | Capacity: containers range in capacity from 1 to 6 cups | Care: dishwasher-safe, microwave-safe
OXO also offers glass containers with reliable leak-proof lids, says Yaceczko. The brand’s 12-piece set comes with six stackable containers and lids in multiple sizes, plus rectangular and circular shapes.
Material: glass | Capacity: containers range in capacity from 4 oz. to 3.5 cups | Care: dishwasher-safe, oven-safe, microwave-safe
Caraway sent me these containers about a year ago and I’ve used them ever since for daily meal prep and storing snacks like muffins and cut fruit. The set includes one large container, two medium containers and two small containers, plus inserts that nest inside to hold condiments or toppings like nuts and seeds. The containers’ matching lids create a very tight seal and are made from clear glass, which allows me to see what’s inside. You also get two straps to wrap around the larger containers, adding an extra layer of assurance that they won’t open in transport. Additionally, to help you organize the containers when not in use, they come with a convenient storage system I keep in my pantry.
Material: ceramic-coated glass | Capacity: Containers range in capacity from 4.4 cups to 10 cups | Care: dishwasher-safe, oven-safe, microwave-safe
I bring my W&P Porter Lunch Box to the office almost every day and pack meal prepped food in it the night before. The lunch box has a modular design that allows you to remove the divider, so you can change the size of each compartment or take out the divider completely. There is also a removable tray you can place inside the box, splitting it into two levels, helping you separate a sandwich from chips or a salad from crackers, for example. The container has a built-in silicone strap that helps keep the air-tight lid in place when I’m walking to work, making me confident that it won’t open inside my lunch box.
Material: plastic | Capacity: 4-cup bowl and 2-cup removable tray | Compartments: three | Care: dishwasher-safe, microwave-safe
If you’re looking for a meal prep container that’s as stylish as it is functional, I recommend Bentgo’s two-tone box with metallic accents. There’s two parts to it: a food tray and a food tray holder. The holder houses the food tray inside and has a lid with a locking clip plus a silicone seal. The food tray is designed with three compartments, which you can turn into four compartments by inserting an included removable divider. You’re able to lift the tray out of the holder to microwave or clean it.
Material: plastic | Capacity: 5.5 cups | Compartments: four | Care: dishwasher-safe, microwave-safe
Since it’s made from stainless steel, this container is extra durable, reducing the chance that it will break or get damaged if it’s jostled around in a backpack or work tote. The container comes with a removable divider and its lid has a silicone tab that extends over the side, giving you a place to grip while lifting it off the base. There are also snap-and-lock tabs on the lid that connect to the container’s base, keeping it even more secure. Klean Kanteen sent me a few of its food boxes to try, and I prefer this one due to its large size, which accommodates almost any meal I want to pack inside. I also love the brand’s smaller 2.8-ounce and 10-ounce snack containers, which I use for nut butters, hummus and dressing.
Material: stainless steel | Capacity: 6.9 cups | Care: dishwasher-safe, oven-safe, microwave-safe
You can use glass jars of various sizes to store food like chopped vegetables, salads, overnight oats, cooked grains, snacks and parfaits, says Young. Ball Mason Jars are available in sizes from 4 to 32 ounces, and they come in multipacks so you can buy a few at a time, ensuring you always have one on hand. Each jar has a screw-on metal lid and band to form a tight seal around the mouth, according to the brand.
Material: glass | Capacity: 2 cups | Care: ishwasher-safe, microwave-safe
Reusable silicone bags take up minimal space, so they’re a great container option if you don’t have a lot of kitchen storage, says Yaceczko. Stasher Bags — some of my favorite eco-friendly kitchen tools — come in a variety of styles, sizes and colors, and some models have flat bottoms so they stand upright. I meal prep smoothies in these bags by portioning out frozen fruit, vegetables and milk ice cubes, as well as pack snacks, sandwiches and salads inside. You can label Stasher Bags by writing directly on them with dry erase markers, and they have an air-tight Pinch-Loc seal. Stasher’s Starter Kit 4-Pack comes with one 15-ounce sandwich bag, one 9.9-ounce snack bag, one 56-ounce stand-up mid bag and one 64-ounce half gallon bag.
Material: silicone | Capacity: bags range in size from 0.5 cups to 13 cups | Care: dishwasher-safe, microwave-safe, oven-safe
Young suggests using small stackable containers to store condiments like dressing and snacks such as dried fruit and nuts. These round plastic containers from Rubbermaid come in a pack of three and have a twist and seal lid.
Material: plastic | Capacity: 1.2 cups | Care: dishwasher-safe, microwave-safe
Below, we broke down the pros and cons of different materials meal prep containers are commonly made from.
Beyond the pros and cons of each material, experts recommend thinking about the following factors:
You can meal prep virtually any food you enjoy eating for breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as for snacks, experts told us. For example, you can make yogurt parfaits for breakfast, grain bowls for lunch, pasta and veggies for dinner and crudités with hummus as a snack. As you’re thinking about what to cook, there are a few rules of thumb Young recommends keeping in mind to create wholesome, well-balanced meals.
Generally speaking, meal prepped food that’s refrigerated and stored in a container with an air-tight lid stays fresh for about seven days, says Patrick Guzzle, the vice president of food science for the National Restaurant Association, the organization that writes and publishes ServSafe products. After that, it tends to decline in quality, meaning it might develop an odor, discolor, grow mold or change in texture. Keep in mind that the seven day guideline is dependent on a maximum refrigerator temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit, says Guzzle. Your refrigerator should never be above this temperature to reduce the chance of spoilage and food-borne illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.
To make sure your refrigerator stays at or a little bit below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, Guzzle recommends buying a refrigerator thermometer and checking it frequently. Why? Because if the appliance’s internal temperature rises above 41 degrees Fahrenheit for any reason, that seven day freshness time frame starts to get shorter, says Guzzle.
While meal prepping, remember that the freezer is your friend. You can make a large batch of soup, sauce, chili or broth and freeze it to eat at a later date. If food is frozen solid, it’s good for months, if not longer, so long as it does not develop freezer burn, says Guzzle.
Once you’re ready to eat something you froze, take it out of the freezer and place it in the refrigerator to thaw. There, food is good for about seven days, so long as you freeze it directly after originally cooking it, says Guzzle. If you don’t, you’ll have to do some math to figure out how long the food will stay fresh in the refrigerator. “Seven days are cumulative, so if you wait to freeze something, you have to reduce those seven days by the number of days before you froze it,” says Guzzle. “For example, if you make something on Thursday but wait until Saturday to freeze it, you’ll have four days to eat it once it’s thawed,” he explained.
In addition to the right containers, there’s a handful of kitchen tools that can help you meal prep. Measuring cups and a food scale assist with portioning out food, and freezer trays preserve soups and sauces for future use. Below are a few highly-rated kitchen tools we recommend, which all have over 4-star ratings on Amazon.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-vegetarian-vegan-meal-delivery-ncna1298934,Vegetarian and vegan meal delivery services to try in 2025,HEALTH,"Whether you’re eating at a restaurant or shopping for groceries, there’s usually no shortage of vegetarian and vegan options to choose from. Meal delivery services are no exception: Many popular meal kits and ready-made meals offer flexible plans to fit most dietary restrictions, including vegetarian, gluten-free and dairy-free diets. Meal delivery services that include vegetarian and vegan plans can provide you with easy-to-cook or ready-made meat-free meals and prevent you from having to sprint to the supermarket each week.
“Nowadays, there are meal delivery services specifically catered towards more challenging dietary restrictions —[they] can make it easier to find meals you can safely tolerate when you can’t always rely on unfamiliar restaurants,” says Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group.
If you’re ready to sign up for a meal delivery plan but don’t know where to start, I spoke to nutritionists and recipe developers about services that they think are worth considering and compiled their favorite ones that include vegetarian and vegan plans. I also rounded up meal delivery services I and other NBC Select staffers have tried and love.
SKIP AHEAD How I picked the best vegan and vegetarian meal delivery services | Best vegan and vegetarian meal delivery services | Why trust NBC Select?
When shopping for a vegan- or vegetarian-friendly meal delivery service, our experts recommend keeping in mind the following factors:
Each of the following meal delivery services was recommended by our food experts and/or NBC Select editors. All of them offer either completely plant-based vegetarian or vegan services, or they offer specific plans to fit one of these lifestyles. To make your browsing easier, I note the starting price, serving size and number of meals provided by each service.
Sunbasket has both meal kits and pre-made, non-frozen meals (although you can freeze some of them to cook later, in line with the brand’s cooking instructions). NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin tried Sunbasket for a week and loved how varied the options were for her gluten-free and pescatarian diet. ""I can usually only eat one or two offerings off a meal delivery service’s weekly menu. But with Sunbasket, there were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from,” she says. Malin also loves the service's pre-made meals, which taste like homemade meals without needing to put in the work, she says.
Sunbasket has a variety of options that you can, depending on whether you eat meat or strictly follow a plant-based diet, says Moskovitz. One of the service’s nine meal plans is the vegetarian plan, which comes with a variety of meal kits to choose from that are focused on protein, good fats and fiber, according to the brand. If you don’t feel like committing to just one type of plan, Sunbasket lets you mix and match its Fresh & Ready plan with over a dozen meal kits from its weekly rotating menu.
Cost: starting at $12 for meal kits and $10 for the Fresh & Ready meals with an additional $6 for shipping | Serving size: single-serve, 2 or 4 for meal kits | Number of meals: 4 to 10 per week
Blue Apron has a number of weekly menu items based on your selected meal plan. Its vegetarian plan offers nutritionist-approved recipes made with fruits, vegetables, grains, seeds and more, which can be created with or without dairy products, honey and eggs, according to the brand. The plan serves two people and includes two to five meat-free recipes per week (depending on your plan preferences), most of which you can prepare in 25 to 35 minutes, according to Blue Apron.
Cost: starting at $8 per serving with an additional $10 for shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 | Number of meals: 2 to 5 per week
I recently reviewed HelloFresh and it quickly became one of my favorite services — I love that the recipes are easy to follow (which, as a non-cook, is key for me) and the meal options are both tasty and varied. “HelloFresh offers quick and easy chef-curated recipes, they use fresh, sustainably sourced ingredients and [they] offer vegan and vegetarian options,” says Lisa Young, adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University.
The meal kit service has over 30 recipes to choose from each week, and you can customize your plan with protein-specific preferences: beef-free, pork-free, seafood-free and veggie. Though choosing the veggie preference doesn’t change the weekly rotating menu HelloFresh provides, it does ensure that you automatically receive meat-free meals for that given menu week.
The brand offers 10 veggie meals (including one vegan meal) within its Classic Plan each week — vegetarian recipes can also be made vegan by opting to remove certain ingredients like cheese or yogurt, according to the brand. The veggie and vegan meals are labeled under each recipe, so you can see which recipes fit your dietary needs when crafting your menu each week.
Cost: starting at $9 per serving with an additional $11 for shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 | Number of meals: 2 to 6 per week
Splendid Spoon has a menu of more than 50 healthy, ready-made vegan meals and snacks to choose from, including smoothies, soups and entrees, all of which have no meat, dairy or animal byproduct. You can order subscription boxes of five meals or more. The service also offers a five-day detox program, in which you get five days worth of meals.
“I recommend Splendid Spoon for anyone who wants healthy meals in a flash — they taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,” says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The brand sent me a few options of their smoothies, entrees, detox shots and soups to try out, and I loved the variety of flavors. The soups and entrees are also easy to prepare, and I can freeze them to eat later (which is great if I'm traveling that week). The smoothies, which come in more than a dozen delicious flavors, kept me full throughout the day, so I didn't find myself binging on unhealthy snacks in the afternoon. The soups were my favorite part of the service: Not only did they taste great, but they also come in fairly large portions, so they were filling and served as a healthy alternative for lunch or dinner.
Splendid Spoon lets you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, biweekly, every three weeks or monthly.
Cost: Starting a $10 with $13 shipping (free if you order 10 or more meals) | Serving size: single-serve | Number of meals: 5, 10 or 15 per order
Purple Carrot has both prepared meals and meal kits, both of which are fully plant-based and vegan. The meals are a perfect mix of familiar and innovative, says Resnick, who adds that, “it’s an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism.” You can customize the number of prepared dinners you get per week — which range from six to 10 frozen meals — or choose three or four recipes from its weekly rotating menu for meal kits each week. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.
Cost: starting at $11 per serving for meal kits and $13 for prepared meals with free shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 servings for meal kits and single-serve for pre-made meals | Number of meals: 2 to 4 for meal kits and 6 to 10 for pre-made meals
Get $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor’s website.
Factor has a weekly rotating menu of over 27 pre-prepared meals designed by dieticians — you can choose the service’s Veggie + Vegan plan for plant-based recipes that are free of all animal products, including meat, fish, eggs and dairy, according to the service. I tried Factor for a week and found it quick, convenient and tasty, which is great for busy weekdays when I don't have time to cook. Young also recommends this service specifically because it caters to a number of diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.
Cost: starting at $11 per serving with free shipping | Serving size: single-serve | Number of meals: 6 to 18 per week
All of Sakara’s ready-made meals are vegan, plant-based and gluten-free, as well as organic and dairy-free, according to the service. “Sakara is very popular among my clients because of [its] varied menu, top-quality ingredients and delicious taste,” says Moskovitz. Programs include the Signature Nutrition Program, which comes with up to three meals per day and your choice of two, three or five days, and the Metabolism Reset, a one-, four- or eight-week program that sends you a specifically curated menu for up to five days per week. You can choose to do a one-week trial program if you’re just getting started, or you can pick a recurring subscription program that automatically renews each week with a set menu of meals that rotates weekly and seasonally.
Cost: starting at $28 per meal with free shipping | Serving size: single-serve | Number of meals: 2 to 15 meals per week

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/how-to-clean-strawberries-rcna164083,How to clean fresh strawberries,HEALTH,"We don’t always have the answers, but we have some people on speed dial who do — which is why we present to you our series FYI where we have experts explain if lip balm is actually bad, how often you should wash your hair and more.
Aside from simply being delicious when in-season, strawberries are an incredibly versatile fruit to have on hand — I love using them to make shortcakes, cobblers, ice cream and lemonade in the summer But before I even start to pull out any cooking gadgets or recipe booklets, I always make sure to thoroughly clean my berries, even if I only plan on eating them by hand. That’s because correctly cleaning your strawberries makes a difference in how they taste, how quickly they spoil and, in some cases, whether or not they’re crawling with tiny bugs.
I spoke with a culinary instructor and a professor of microbiology about the best ways to clean fresh fruit and asked them for tips and tricks to keep in mind before doing so.
There are a few different cleaning methods you can adopt, which I outline in detail below based on advice I got from experts.

In short: Yes. This is because, even if they look clean on the surface, they’re susceptible to dirt, bacteria, fungi and other microbes, according to Michael Handal, a chef instructor at the Institute of Culinary Education (ICE). “Commercial produce may also carry trace amounts of chemicals and pesticides,” he says. “Washing fresh produce before consuming or preparing meals is imperative and washing methods will vary depending on the type and characteristics of the produce you are preparing.”
While cool water does a decent job of cleaning surface-level impurities, you can take things a step further by using a combination of water and distilled vinegar, according to Dr. Sharon Nachman, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook University. “Vinegar is an acid,” she says. “And none of the bugs like acid and certainly bacteria don’t like acid.” The vinegar is what releases bugs and bacteria from the surface of the strawberries, she says.
It’s typically better to wash strawberries as you eat or prepare them compared to washing, drying and storing them all at once. That’s because washing them at once makes them more likely to spoil faster due to the buildup of moisture. “Strawberries should be stored, unwashed, in the plastic, clamshell-type containers they were purchased in,” says Handal. “An alternative would be storing them in a loose, plastic bag.”
While you can technically wash them all at once, it’s crucial to make sure you thoroughly dry them afterward and store them in a ventilated food container because excess moisture causes them to go bad faster. It’s also important to sort out visibly spoiled or bruised strawberries before putting them in the fridge, as this also contributes to the rest of the berries spoiling, according to Handal.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-electrolyte-powders-rcna185336,13 expert-recommended electrolyte powders that help you hydrate,HEALTH,"Drinking plenty of water is essential to staying hydrated, but sometimes, H20 alone doesn’t cut it, says Dr. Matthew Sedgley, a physician specializing in sports medicine at MedStar Health. Those who do strenuous exercise, have a labor-intensive job or spend long periods in the heat may also need to replenish their electrolytes. “Electrolyte is a fancy word for minerals like sodium, potassium and magnesium, and they’re substances our bodies need to function,” he says. “Your body uses them as you do physical activity, which makes replacing them important.”
Mixing electrolyte powder into your water is a fast and convenient way to do that, says Amy Goldsmith, a registered dietitian specializing in sports nutrition who owns Kindred Nutrition & Kinetics. These powders often come in pre-measured packets, so you know exactly how much of each mineral you’re getting, and they’re available in various flavors, so they taste good.
I talked to doctors and nutritionists about how to shop for electrolyte powders, as well as who should (and shouldn’t) use them. But remember: Before you take anything, be sure to consult your doctor.

Before buying electrolyte powder, it’s helpful to understand what it is, what benefits it offers and who it’s designed for. Here’s some key information experts want you to know.
Electrolytes are minerals like sodium, potassium and calcium that help fluids enter and exit your cells to keep you hydrated, says Jay Patruno, a registered dietitian and certified personal trainer. (They’re called electrolytes because they have an electrical charge when dissolved in water or bodily fluids.) These minerals also play an important role in muscle and nerve contraction, creating energy and building tissue, says Michael Reavis Jr., a clinical dietitian at the University of Maryland Medical Center.
Your body doesn’t make electrolytes — you consume them through food. All foods have electrolytes but some are richer in specific minerals than others, says Patruno. For example, salt is rich in sodium and chloride, bananas are rich in potassium, yogurt is rich in calcium and nuts are rich in magnesium, says Reavis. You mainly lose electrolytes through sweat, though your kidneys also filter out excess electrolytes in urine, says Lisa Young, a registered nutritionist and an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University.
Everyone loses electrolytes at different volumes depending on overall health status, level of physical activity and sweat rate, meaning how many ounces of fluid you lose per hour while sweating, says Goldsmith. Your doctor can evaluate these things to help determine how you should go about replacing electrolytes.
Electrolyte powder is a mixture of minerals like sodium, potassium and magnesium that you add to water to make a fortified drink. It’s a type of electrolyte product, like chews, drops and gels. Since you dissolve electrolyte powder in water, they help balance your body’s fluid and electrolyte levels simultaneously, which is key to staying hydrated, says Young.
Electrolyte powders are designed to replace electrolytes you lose, mainly through sweat, and support fast rehydration so you avoid symptoms of depletion, like fatigue, blood pressure irregularities and lightheadedness, says Kelly Jones, a sports dietitian who works with professional and student-athletes. “They help you get a significant amount of electrolytes in a very short amount of time, give you all the different types of minerals you need at once, and you know exactly how much of each one you’re consuming,” says Goldsmith. “There’s not really a food or drink that can naturally do that.”
It’s important to note that while electrolyte products like powders can help you stay hydrated, they’re not a replacement for plain water, says Sedgley. Electrolyte products should be used as needed in specific situations like intense exercise, while water is essential to drink throughout the day to stay hydrated and keep up your fluid levels, he says.
The most important electrolytes to replace are sodium, which you lose at the highest rate while sweating, and potassium, which comes in second, says Jones. Electrolytes like calcium, magnesium, chloride and phosphorus are also important for hydration, but if you exercise for less than two hours at a time, the amount you lose is negligible, says Jones. So focus on getting these nutrients through food, she says.
Electrolyte powders mainly benefit the average person who engages in an hour or more of moderate to intense exercise, says Sedgley. Moderate exercise involves activities like brisk walking or light jogging, where talking is a bit more challenging than usual, and intense exercise involves activities like fast running, cycling or high-intensity interval training, where talking is difficult, he says.
Electrolyte powders also support recovery and hydration for people who do physical activity in the heat, says Sedgley. That includes runners, bikers, those playing in sporting events, construction workers and landscapers, for example. But in hot conditions, even low-intensity exercise like walking may leave you feeling depleted, he says. People who spend all day on their feet, like teachers and medical professionals, can also benefit from electrolyte powders, says Jones.
While shopping for electrolyte powders, experts recommend keeping the following in mind, all of which I took into consideration while rounding up the best options.
Below, I rounded up electrolyte powders I’ve tried or experts recommend. I included the amount of sodium and potassium each one has per serving since they’re the most important minerals to look for while shopping, experts say.
It’s important to note that when you add a powder to water, you’ll need to give it a good stir — if you don’t, the powder won’t fully dissolve into your water, and you may end up sipping salty clumps. I recommend using a shaker bottle or investing in a handheld electric mixer to thoroughly incorporate the powder into water.
Liquid IV, which Goldsmith recommends, is one of the most well-known brands in the electrolyte powder space. It comes in over a dozen flavors like lemon lime, strawberry, concord grape and passion fruit, so you’ll likely find one you like. Each pack has 11 grams of sugar, which I find gives it a very sweet taste, so I tend to dilute it with a few more ounces of water than the brand recommends. Liquid IV’s sodium- and potassium-based electrolyte powder is vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free.
Sodium: 560 mg. | Potassium: 370 mg. | Sweetener: cane sugar, stevia leaf extract, dextrose | Form: single-serve packets
DripDrop’s variety of flavors is similar to Liquid IV’s, but the formula has lower sodium and sugar concentrations. That gives it a less pronounced taste, so I find it ideal for those who've never tried an electrolyte powder before and are getting used to drinking it. The powder is made with sodium, potassium and magnesium, and its formula is gluten-free and vegan. You can buy flavors like fruit punch, orange, lemon-lime and berry.
Sodium: 330 mg. | Potassium: 180 mg. | Sweetener: sugar, fructose, sucralose | Form: single-serve packets
Because I find Liquid IV’s standard electrolyte powder very sweet, I prefer the brand’s sugar-free sodium- and potassium-based formula.
Instead of cane sugar or artificial sweeteners, it’s made with allulose, a natural sugar found in fruit like figs and raisins. My favorite flavors are lemon-lime and white peach, which taste especially refreshing in ice water. Liquid IV’s sugar-free, vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free electrolyte powder also comes in raspberry melon, green grape and rainbow sherbet flavors.
Sodium: 510 mg. | Potassium: 380 mg. | Sweetener: allulose, stevia leaf extract | Form: single-serve packets
Gatorade’s electrolyte powder, which many experts recommend, has an ingredient profile that’s similar to its Gatorlyte sports drink.
The powder is a great option if you like the taste of Gatorade but want the convenience of a single-serve packet you can throw in your gym bag. You can buy the powder, made with sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and chloride, in flavors like cherry lime, orange and watermelon.
Sodium: 490 mg. | Potassium: 350 mg. | Sweetener: sugar, maltodextrin, stevia leaf extract | Form: single-serve packets
Goldsmith recommends Body Armor’s electrolyte powders over the brand’s pre-mixed beverages for hydration because they have less sugar and more sodium: One packet of the powder has 510 milligrams of sodium and zero grams of sugar, while one pre-mixed beverage has 30 milligrams of sodium and 29 grams of sugar. I’m also a big fan of this electrolyte powder, which the brand sent me to try. Its flavor isn’t overpowering or too sweet, and beyond sodium and potassium, it’s made with chloride, calcium and magnesium. I love the tropical punch flavor, and it’s available in options like lemon-lime, grape and strawberry.
Sodium: 510 mg. | Potassium: 700 mg. | Sweetener: stevia leaf extract | Form: single-serve packets
This electrolyte powder’s formula has a 2:1 ratio of sodium to potassium, which Goldsmith aims for when choosing a well-balanced product for her clients. It’s also third-party tested and Informed Choice Certified for purity and safety. The powder is made with calcium and magnesium and is free from artificial sweeteners, artificial coloring, dyes and gluten. You can buy flavors like peach mango and tropical punch.
In addition to single-serve packets, Transparent Labs’ Hydrate electrolyte powder comes in a jar with a scooper. Make sure you level off the scoop before mixing with water, says Reavis. If you don’t, the electrolyte concentration may be slightly greater than what’s listed on the product’s nutrition label.
Sodium: 500 mg. | Potassium: 250 mg. | Sweetener: stevia extract | Form: scoopable powder, single-serve packets
“Some brands offer electrolyte tablets rather than powders, which tend to be less messy,” says Jones. “The tabs dissolve in water and usually come in a small tube that’s easy to keep on hand while you’re on the go.” In my experience, electrolyte tablets take a bit longer than powders because you can’t mix them — you have to wait until the tablet completely dissolves on its own before drinking.
I’ve used Nuun’s electrolyte tablets for over five years. They make your water fizzy when they dissolve, which I find is more enjoyable to drink. The tablets have sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and chloride, plus they’re gluten-free and vegan. You can buy Nuun’s electrolyte tablets in flavors like strawberry lemonade (my favorite), watermelon and tri–berry. They’re also eligible to buy with a flexible spending account (FSA).
Sodium: 300 mg. | Potassium: 150 mg. | Sweetener: stevia leaf extract, dextrose | Form: tablets
If you want a slightly sweet taste and fewer added carbohydrates than a sports drink, “Thorne Catalyte is a great option, and it’s also NSF Certified for Sport,” says Jones. “With 485 milligrams of sodium and five grams of carbohydrate, it’s perfect for active individuals.” Young also recommends this lemon-lime electrolyte powder, made with sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and chloride. Thorne Catalyte has no dairy, sugar, gluten or artificial flavors.
Sodium: 485 mg. | Potassium: 96 mg. | Sweetener: tapioca maltodextrin | Form: scoopable powder
Since it has a moderate sodium concentration of 400 milligrams, Jones recommends Skratch Labs’ Hydration powder for those who have active careers, like construction workers, nurses, teachers and landscapers, and those who exercise for under an hour but tend to sweat a lot while doing so. The vegan powder is made with sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, and it’s gluten- and dairy-free. Skratch Labs’ electrolyte powder comes in flavors like pineapple, strawberry lemonade and orange.
Sodium: 400 mg. | Potassium: 50 mg. | Sweetener: cane sugar, dextrose | Form: scoopable powder
“For those with very high sweat rates, I often suggest incorporating LMNT to aid in rehydration and maintaining energy levels during exercise,” says Jones.
LMNT’s vegan, gluten-free electrolyte powder has the highest sodium concentration out of all the options on this list at 1,000 milligrams, making it suitable for those engaged in prolonged intense physical activity, like marathon runners and long-distance bikers. Its formula has magnesium as well as sodium and potassium. You can buy the powder in flavors like citrus salt, watermelon salt, raspberry salt and mango chili salt.
Sodium: 1,000 mg. | Potassium: 200 mg. | Sweetener: stevia leaf extract | Form: single-serve packets
Electrolyte replacement products that help prevent dehydration and don’t contain added supplements are eligible for reimbursement with an FSA, a health savings account (HSA) or a health reimbursement arrangement (HRA). Very few brands currently qualify, but Cure is one of them. Its 240 milligrams of sodium is a low concentration, which makes it a great option for first-timers. Cure sent me flavors like berry pomegranate, watermelon, lemonade and strawberry kiwi to try, all of which tasted great and dissolved quickly when I stirred the powder into water.
Sodium: 240 mg. | Potassium: 300 mg. | Sweetener: stevia extract, monk fruit extract | Form: single-serve packets
I often crave an intensely flavored beverage during workouts, but I can’t always stomach something super sweet or salty before I exercise.
That’s when I use Moon Juice’s electrolyte powder, which the brand sent me to try. It helps me preload electrolytes before a long run or hot yoga class, but I barely taste the powder. Moon Juice’s Mini Dew electrolyte powder is sugar-free and made with sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and chloride. Moon Juice also offers a pomelo-flavored version.
Sodium: 270 mg. | Potassium: 130 mg. | Sweetener: stevia leaf extract | Form: scoopable powder
You lose electrolytes while you’re sick if you’re vomiting or having diarrhea, says Mallipattu. In those cases, he recommends drinking Pedialyte, available in powders or as a pre-mixed liquid solution. It has a very simple formula mainly composed of sodium, potassium and chloride, which is similar to what you’d get through IV fluids at the hospital, he says. You can get Pedialyte powder in flavors like grape, fruit punch and cherry.
Sodium: 270 mg. | Potassium: 130 mg. | Sweetener: dextrose, sucralose | Form: single-serve packets
The FDA sets Daily Value recommendations for amounts of certain nutrients you should not exceed each day, including electrolytes like sodium, potassium and calcium. However, these recommendations don’t account for how much of each mineral you lose and need to replace while doing physical activity, says Goldsmith. Use the FDA’s Daily Value recommendations as a guide while evaluating electrolyte powders’ nutrition labels, but talk to your doctor about what’s right for you, says Patruno.
Sodium is the most important mineral to prioritize when buying an electrolyte powder since you lose it at the highest rate while sweating, says Jones. However, how much sodium you need depends on your activity level, sweat rate and overall health status. Below, experts share their recommendations for sodium concentration in electrolyte powder, but consult your doctor to determine what’s best for you.
After sodium, pay attention to potassium since it’s the mineral you lose at the second highest rate through sweat, says Jones. Many electrolyte powders have a 2:1 ratio of sodium to potassium, like 500 milligrams of sodium to 250 milligrams of potassium, for example. High sodium intake with insufficient potassium can quickly increase blood pressure, but a balanced 2:1 ratio helps prevent that from happening as the electrolytes move through the cells, says Sedgley.
Some electrolyte powders contain additional minerals like calcium, chloride, magnesium and phosphorus. They’re less important from a hydration standpoint, so don’t worry about them unless your doctor advises you to, says Jones.
When you do over an hour of intense exercise like running or biking, your body uses sugar, a carbohydrate, as fuel for your muscles, says Goldsmith. Sugar also helps with fluid balance and masks the salty taste of electrolytes, she says. Because of this, many electrolyte powders have 10 to 20 grams of added sugar per serving. “In terms of athletic performance, we think of sugar in an electrolyte powder differently than added sugar in regular food,” says Goldsmith. “This amount of added sugar per serving could be considered excessive if you’re sedentary and eat a lot of foods with added sugars, but from an exercise perspective, it’s necessary for your muscles.” That said, it’s important to think about your daily sugar intake to properly assess your needs, so consult your doctor.
Electrolyte powders are made with different types of sugar, including natural sugars like honey and agave, cane sugar and artificial sweeteners like stevia and xylitol. Each type of sugar has a different flavor and glycemic index, meaning how quickly it raises blood sugar levels after you eat it. The average healthy person doesn’t have to think much about the type of sugar in an electrolyte powder and can prioritize their taste preferences, says Young. But if you have a medical condition like diabetes and need to be careful about sugar consumption, consult your doctor about what’s best for your body. Young also says that artificial sweeteners tend to give some people an upset stomach, so consider avoiding them if you have a history of gastrointestinal issues.
There’s no perfect time to drink electrolyte powder. Everyone’s body is different, so figuring out what’s right for you involves some trial and error, as well as consulting your doctor.
Overall, “hydration is a lot like pain management,” says Goldsmith, “Once you’re behind, it’s really hard to get ahead of it.” That said, ensure you’re drinking enough water daily, regardless of whether you’re adding electrolyte powder at some point.
Suppose you don’t engage in much physical activity during your day-to-day life and aren’t heavily sweating. In that case, you can likely get plenty of electrolytes from a healthy, balanced diet, says Reavis, so electrolyte powder is unnecessary. However, some people find that adding a small amount of flavored electrolyte powder to their water — like half a packet or less — encourages them to drink. So, as long as you consult your doctor and choose an electrolyte powder with a low amount of sodium (200 mg to 300 mg.), do what works for you, says Reavis.
Additionally, a few groups of people need to be extra cautious when it comes to using electrolyte powder, making it even more important to work closely with a doctor to find the right option:
An electrolyte imbalance occurs when there’s either too many or insufficient electrolytes in your body, says Sedgley. Some symptoms of an electrolyte imbalance overlap with those of dehydration, and you can experience both conditions simultaneously — overall, however, they’re different from one another. Dehydration has to do with water loss, while an electrolyte imbalance has to do with being deficient or abundant in certain minerals, says Mallipattu. (If you’re concerned about experiencing dehydration and/or an electrolyte imbalance, consult your doctor.)
An electrolyte imbalance can present differently depending on the minerals your body has too much or too little of, says Mallipattu. If you’re low or high in sodium, for example, you may experience symptoms like confusion or an unstable gait, he says. If you’re low in potassium, you may experience muscle weakness and cramps or, in more severe cases, heart arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), says Mallipattu.
Hyponatremia, a condition that occurs when there’s not enough sodium in your blood, is one of the main types of electrolyte depletion Sedgley sees during marathons and similar physically demanding events. “If someone stopped at every water station on the course and they’ve drunk too much, plus they’re sweating out salt, they may have diluted the sodium in their blood,” he says, noting that symptoms of hyponatremia include muscle cramps, nausea, headaches, confusion and fatigue.
Beyond electrolyte powder, brands make electrolyte drops, chews, gels and pre-mixed drinks like Gatorade and Powerade. Each product offers its own set of benefits, but for the most part, they’re variations on the same theme, so choosing one is a matter of personal preference. However, keep in mind that electrolyte products can differ in their average mineral concentration, which impacts how much one serving can help boost your hydration levels.
“You can’t get as high of a concentration in one serving of an electrolyte drop or chew as you can get in a powder,” says Goldsmith. “That means you usually have to use more of those other products more often.”
Some people also use different electrolyte products depending on the situation. Chews or gels, for instance, are typically easier for runners to fit in their fanny packs and quickly take during a race. But those who play sports like baseball or soccer can keep a water bottle on the sidelines and mix in powders.
Yes, to some degree, drinking electrolyte powder can help with a hangover, says Mallipattu. “You often end up urinating a lot if you drink a lot of alcohol, so you lose water and some sodium,” he says. “Therefore the electrolytes do make a difference, but eating a salty meal may help as well.”

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-gluten-free-meal-kit-delivery-services-ncna1294644,Looking for gluten-free meal delivery? Start here,HEALTH,"Meal kit delivery services have a variety of benefits: They can be a great way to prepare fun and flavorful meals without having to sprint to the grocery store each week. But when it comes to specific dietary restrictions like a gluten-free diet — which limits the intake of wheat, barley and several other grains — it can be hard to pinpoint the ones that fit your needs. Fortunately, many meal kits and pre-made meal delivery services offer gluten-free menu items and plans for tasty, creative and easy-to-prepare meals when you’re in a rush.
To determine the best meal delivery services with gluten-free options or entirely gluten-free menus, I spoke to nutritionists and dietitians about the best services to try out and highlighted each individual service’s pricing, delivery frequency and meal options.
SKIP AHEAD How I picked the best gluten-free meal delivery services | Best gluten-free meal delivery services | Why trust NBC Select?
I spoke to experts about important features to consider when shopping for gluten-free meal delivery services. Here are the most important ones they suggest keeping in mind:
I spoke to experts about their favorite meal delivery services that either provide gluten-free options or have an entirely gluten-free menu. I highlighted their specific recommendations below — all of which offer pre-made meals or a combination of meal kits and ready-made items — and noted their costs, serving sizes, and the number of meals they deliver per week.
Price is based on four meals per week for two people/servings.


Sunbasket offers both ingredient-based meal kits and pre-made meals, all of which the brand says consist of high-quality ingredients and organic produce. One of Sunbasket’s 10 available meal plans is the Gluten-Free Friendly meal plan, which has five to eight gluten-free options each week. NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin, who follows a pescatarian and gluten-free diet, tried Sunbasket for a week and loved the service's variety of meals and delicious pre-made options. ""The particular recipes I chose forced me to use ingredients that aren’t in my regular rotation, like turmeric and artichoke dip, and make foods that aren’t typically top of mind for me, like potato salad,"" says Malin.
Both Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist, and Lisa Moskovitz, CEO of NY Nutrition Group, say Sunbasket is their top choice for healthy meal kit deliveries. “It has a variety of options that can be modified for carnivores and strictly plant-based eaters alike,” says Moskovitz.
The Fresh & Ready option, which comes with single-serve meals you can heat in the oven or microwave in just a few minutes, also has several gluten-free options to choose from. If you don’t feel like committing to a single plan, the service lets you mix and match with over a dozen meals from its weekly rotating menu.
Cost: Starting at $12 for meal kits and $10 for the Fresh & Ready meals, with an additional $6 for shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 for meal kits, single-serve for Fresh & Ready meals | Number of meals: 2 to 5 per week
Splendid Spoon has over 50 healthy, ready-made meals and snacks that include smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and larger dishes— and everything is gluten-free. You can select a box size of seven, 14 or 21 meals and choose your meals for the week. Your cart will automatically fill with Splendid Spoon’s bestsellers, or you can manually swap in your favorites.
Resnick recommends the service for anyone who wants “healthy meals in a flash.” “They taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others.” she says. The large selection of juices and smoothies and the convenience of thawing one at a time is also a big plus, says Resnick.
Cost: Starting at $10 per meal and $85 for the plan, with an additional $13 for shipping (free if you order 10 or more meals) | Serving size: Single-serve | Number of meals: 5 to 20 meals per order
Price is based on four meals per week for two people/servings.
Purple Carrot offers both prepared meals and meal kits, so you can choose the level of effort that you want to put into your meals. The meals are all fully plant-based, and Purple Carrot provides several gluten-free recipes to choose from, as well as gluten-free pre-prepared meals.
“The meal kits are a wonderful blend of familiar and innovative — think kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats,” says Resnick. And because the meals are fully plant-based, Purple Carrot can be an easy way for people to “add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,” she says.
You can customize the number of dinners you get per week, which range from two to four meal kits and six to 10 pre-made meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.
Cost: Starting at $11 per serving for meal kits and $13 per serving for pre-made meals with free shipping | Serving size: 2 or 4 servings for meal kits and single-serve for pre-made meals | Number of meals: 2 to 4 for meal kits or 6 to 10 prepared meals per week
Epicured allows you to choose from a rotating menu of over 50 pre-made meals spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. All Epicured meals are entirely gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don’t feature certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest. “They’re a great option for those with SIBO, IBS or a generally sensitive tummy,” says Moskovitz.
If you don’t want to choose individual meals, Epicured also offers several pre-selected programs, including an omnivore, pescetarian and vegetarian program, that helps you ease into a low-FODMAP diet, according to the brand.
Once you select your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed — if you don’t manually pick your meals, orders are locked in on Friday afternoons with the same meals you previously selected.
Cost: The average price for each meal is around $15 and shipping is free if your total weekly order is over $100 (if not, the shipping cost depends on the delivery location) | Serving size: Single-serve | Number of meals: As many (or as little) as you want
Price is based on six meals per week.
Having a gluten-free diet doesn’t mean you need to sacrifice the joys of dining out. Cookunity offers chef-prepared meals with a wide range of gluten-free options for you to enjoy at home, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week, Resnick says this service is one of her favorites: “I appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses.” NBC Select social commerce editor Sadhana Daruvuri also enjoys it because she can get a variety of delicious meals while still spending about the same amount she’d spent on groceries, she says.
You can also filter meals by other dietary restrictions, like dairy-free, high protein, vegan, vegetarian and more.
Cost: Starting at $11 per meal with free shipping | Serving size: Single-serve | Number of meals: 4 to 16 meals per week
Price is based on 20 meals per week.
BistroMD offers a specialized gluten-free plan that lets you choose from over 100 gluten-free meals each week, according to the service. The Gluten-Free program provides breakfast, lunch and dinner for your choice of five days or seven days. The service also offers an EATS (Essential and Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for an additional charge. “BistroMD prides itself on being ‘doctor-designed’ and therefore is more medically therapeutic than most other companies,” says Moskovitz.
Cost: Starting at $7 per meal for the full program 7-day plan and $8 per meal for the full program 5-day plan | Serving size: Single-serve | Number of meals: Five to seven meals per week
Price is based on three meals per day for three days in the brand's Signature Nutrition Program.
Although Sakara is on the pricier side for a meal delivery service, it offers a large selection of ready-to-eat meals, all of which are gluten-free, organic, dairy-free and plant-based, according to the service. You can choose to do a one-week trial program if you’re just getting started, or you can select a recurring subscription program that automatically renews each week with a set menu of meals that rotates weekly and seasonally. Sakara Life also lets you choose the number of days you want to receive meals (three or five days) as well as which type of meals you would like to receive (breakfast, lunch and/or dinner).
The full five-day gluten-free meal plan is a great way to jumpstart your wellness journey, according to Moskovitz. “Sakara is very popular among my clients because of [its] varied menu, top-quality ingredients and delicious taste,” she says.
Programs include the Signature Nutrition Program — which comes with up to three meals per day (breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner, depending on your location) and your choice of two, three or five days — and the 30-Day Reset, a four-week program that lets you choose at least two meals (breakfast, lunch and/or dinner) for up to five days per week.
Cost: Starting at $28 per meal with free shipping | Serving size: Single-serve | Number of meals: 2 to 15 meals per week with the brand’s signature plan
Price is based on average cost for 8 meals per week.
Provenance offers ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks that are entirely gluten-free and dairy-free. “These organic prepared meals are great for those with intolerances, and most of the ingredients are also locally sourced and sustainable,” says Moskovitz, adding that the meals taste as good as they look, based on her personal experience.
The service also offers a Provenance Detox program, a six-day nutrition program where you can choose either an omnivore or vegan and plant-based plan. This program provides weekly prepared meals, detox teas, prebiotics and more (however, this program is only available for delivery in Los Angeles and New York City).
Cost: Starting around $15 per meal with $10 for shipping and $320 for the Provenance Detox program | Serving size: Single-serve | Number of meals: Choose between 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 items for weekly meal delivery and get 12 pre-prepared meals, 12 detox tea servings and more with the detox plan
Price is based on four meals per week for two people/servings.
Hungryroot, which is more of a grocery delivery service with a lot of the same benefits and customizations as other meal kits on this list, offers several gluten-free items to choose from. When you take the initial quiz about your preferences and dietary needs, Hungryroot creates a personalized grocery plan to meet those needs. In addition to delivering fresh food for the week, it also sends you specific recipes based on the groceries in your order, and you can edit your delivery every week in case you want a specific ingredient or food item.
With the ability to choose the type of meal you want and customize the groceries you get, Hungryroot “allows you to be a bit more adventurous and cook from the hip, or also follow the recipes exactly,” says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan cookware..

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/prebiotic-soda-health-benefits-rcna172429,Prebiotic soda v.s. standard soft drinks: what’s the difference?,HEALTH,"We don’t always have the answers, but we have some people on speed dial who do — which is why we present to you our series FYI where we have experts explain if lip balm is actually bad, how often you should wash your hair and more.
Drinking soda has long been a debated subject in the nutrition arena. It’s a sugary beverage associated with weight gain, heart disease, tooth decay and cavities, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and while diet options are available, they’re made with artificial sweeteners that some people avoid.
Because soda has a bad rap, many people turn to alternatives — lately, all eyes are on prebiotic soda. The bubbly beverage is fortified with prebiotic fibers and is typically lower in sugar and calories than traditional soft drinks. “These products try to mimic classic sodas’ look and taste, but use better-for-you ingredients,” says Christine Dang, a category manager at Thrive Market. “There’s been a groundswell of innovation, from entirely new soda brands to established beverage brands creating new soda lines.”
Prebiotic soda’s presence is growing in grocery stores and people’s refrigerators. But does it offer any health benefits? I talked to doctors and nutritionists to find out, and spoke to a trend expert about why the prebiotic soda bubble isn’t popping soon.
SKIP AHEAD What are prebiotics? | What is prebiotic soda? | Does prebiotic soda offer any health benefits? | Prebiotic soda v.s. standard soda | Final verdict | Our favorite prebiotic sodas | The inception of prebiotic soda | Why trust NBC Select?
Prebiotics are non-digestible fibers and compounds that act as food for probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria in your gut, says Chloe Williams, a registered nutritionist and the owner of Eunoia Wellness Co. Inc. They pass through the upper part of your gastrointestinal tract undigested, and when they reach your colon, your gut microbiota ferments them to help stimulate the growth and activity of healthy bacteria, she says. “Think of your gut as a thriving garden,” says Williams. “Probiotics are the plants, and prebiotics are the fertilizer that helps those plants grow strong and healthy.”
The main benefit of prebiotics is their ability to boost or support your gut microbiome, says Dr. Eamonn Martin Quigley, head of Houston Methodist Hospital’s gastroenterology and hepatology division. By doing so, they’ve been linked to digestive health, including relieving constipation and bloating, as well as symptoms related to inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, he says.
You can consume prebiotics in two ways: by eating prebiotic-rich foods and taking supplements, like a pill or powder. Examples of prebiotic-rich foods include bananas, onions, garlic, leeks, asparagus and whole grains like oats and barley, says Dr. Michael J. Ormsbee, the director of Florida State University’s Institute of Sports Sciences and Medicine. These foods contain fibers like inulin and fructooligosaccharides, which the good bacteria in your gut like to eat, he says.
Prebiotic sodas are fizzy beverages fortified with prebiotics, often in the form of plant-based fibers like guar gum, inulin, chicory root and sunchokes, says Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietician and CEO of the Virtual Nutrition Experts. They’re meant to help increase your daily intake of prebiotics through a tasty drink, and be part of a broader approach to supporting your gut microbiome, says Williams. Prebiotic sodas also act as an alternative to standard soft drinks, which tend to be high in sugar or made with artificial sweeteners some people try to stay away from, she says.
A post shared by NBC Select (@nbcselect)
The idea behind prebiotic soda is that it contains fibers that feed the good bacteria (probiotics) in your gut, helping stimulate growth and activity that could, in turn, bolster your gut microbiome, says Moskovitz. However, whether or not these sodas successfully do that is unclear.
There’s currently a lack of data available about the effects of prebiotic sodas on the gut microbiome, which prevents anyone from drawing conclusive answers to questions about health benefits, says Quigley. Identifying solid health benefits involves evaluating what prebiotics each soda contains, whether those prebiotics exist in sufficient quantities to impact the gut microbiome, and, if so, what those impacts are, he says.
“The whole issue here is the conflict between claims and evidence,” says Quigley. In other words, brands may advertise that their prebiotic sodas support gut health or offer other benefits, but if they don’t provide evidence in the form of scientific data from legitimate studies, we don’t know whether those claims are true.
Whether prebiotic soda is better for you compared to standard soda depends on how you define better, says Ormsbee. From an overall nutrition perspective, soda and diet soda offer no benefit, while prebiotic soda may offer some benefits due to their fiber content. However, the verdict is still out on whether prebiotic sodas are “healthier” due to a lack of evidence available from studies,  he says.
With that said, there are some overall conclusions you can draw when comparing traditional sodas’ and prebiotic sodas’ nutrition labels. “Compared to regular soda, the amount of added sugar in most prebiotic sodas is considerably less, and there are less artificial chemical sweeteners, unlike calorie-free diet sodas,” says Moskovitz. “Both of these differences could be a plus for many people.” However, prebiotic soda isn’t sugar-free or calorie-free, so if that’s what you’re looking for, it may not be the right beverage for you.
All things considered, prebiotic sodas are generally safe to drink in moderation, says Quigley. But you should not rely on them as the sole source — or a significant source — of prebiotics in your diet, says Williams. Rather, they’re one piece of the puzzle, complementary to natural prebiotic sources, like some fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes. Also remember that nothing is a replacement for water in terms of hydration, so be sure you’re drinking enough H20 every day, says Moskovitz. And always talk to your doctor before adding something new to your diet.
If you’re interested in trying prebiotic soda, here are a few options NBC Select staff recommend based on taste and flavor preferences.
I often have more Poppi than food in my refrigerator. I started buying the bubbly beverage when it launched in March 2020, and ever since, I’ve had one can a day, which has helped me reduce my diet soda consumption. Poppi is made with prebiotic fiber from agave inulin and apple cider vinegar, and sweetened with cane sugar and stevia. You can buy it in flavors like classic cola, doc pop (my favorite) and root beer, which mimic classic soft drinks, as well as fruity options like raspberry rose, lemon lime and orange. (Editor’s note: Poppi is in an ongoing lawsuit challenging some of its “gut healthy” claims. A spokesperson for Poppi told NBC Select that the brand stands behind its products, it believes the lawsuit is baseless, and it will defend against the allegations.)
“Not only does Olipop taste great, but it has some of the best flavors I’ve seen in a soda,” says Mili Godio, NBC Select updates editor. “You just can’t go wrong with whatever flavor you choose — my personal favorites are strawberry vanilla and orange squeeze. I usually order it in bulk on Amazon so my fridge is always stacked.” Olipop’s beverages are made with a blend of plant-based fiber, like cassava root fiber, chicory root inulin and Jerusalem artichoke inulin, and they’re sweetened with stevia. You can purchase Olipop in 18 flavors, including fruit-forward options like watermelon lime, lemon lime and tropical punch, as well as those that mimic classic sodas, like vintage cola and ginger ale.
Dang says some established brands are launching prebiotic soda lines, which Sun Sip is a great example of. It’s owned by Health-Ade, a kombucha company that’s been around since 2012. Sun Sip’s beverages are made with prebiotic fibers from agave inulin and they’re sweetened with fruit juice, monk fruit and cane sugar. You can purchase this prebiotic soda in four flavors: raspberry lemonade (my favorite), cherry cola, strawberry vanilla, lemon lime and root beer.
Wildwonder is one of our favorite women-owned and AAPI-owned brands. Its beverages are made with prebiotic fibers from Jerusalem artichoke and chicory root inulin, and they’re sweetened with monk fruit. They also have probiotics in their formula. You can purchase Wildwonder’s drinks in six flavors: raspberry lychee, strawberry passion, pineapple paradise, guava rose, mango gold and peach ginger. I find the brand’s beverages to be flavorful but not too sweet, and they’re great to make mocktails with. I’ve added non-alcoholic spirits to them for dinner parties.
The average adult should aim for at least five grams of prebiotics a day, according to the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebitoics, an organization that Quigley and Ormsbee say is a great source of information on this topic. Those five grams can come from food and beverages, or supplements like pills and powders. While the ISAPP recommends for adults to consume five grams of prebiotics a day, everyone’s body is different. Be sure to consult your doctor about what’s right for you before taking a supplement or changing your diet.
It’s much easier to track your prebiotic intake if you’re taking supplements — the pill or powder’s label will clearly state how many grams of prebiotics each serving contains, says Williams. That’s often not the case for food and beverages. However, it’s not necessary for most adults to measure the exact amount of prebiotics they’re consuming each day, says Moskovitz. If you eat a variety of fiber-rich foods, you’re likely consuming an optimal amount of prebiotics, she says. As a point of reference, a banana typically gives you about 0.5 grams of prebiotics, says Ormsbee.
If you’re concerned about your prebiotic intake, talk to your doctor or work with a nutritionist to create a plan that’s right for you.
According to Williams, prebiotic-rich foods include:
In addition to naturally occurring prebiotics in foods, some brands enrich granola bars, cookies, chips, cereals and breads, plus yogurt and non-dairy alternatives, with prebiotics, says Williams. Similar to prebiotic sodas, these foods often contain plant-based fibers like inulin and chicory root, she says.
There are currently no studies that point to specific short- or long-term side effects associated with drinking prebiotic soda, says Ormsbee. In general, however, consuming prebiotics or fiber in excess can cause issues like more frequent bowel movements, bloating, gas and cramps, says Quigley. “This happens because prebiotics are fermentable fibers, and as they’re broken down by the bacteria in your gut, they can produce gas as a byproduct,” says Williams. Quigley notes that most prebiotic soda brands recommend only drinking one can a day, which you should follow.
Those who have certain digestive conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be especially careful with introducing any food, drink or supplement that contains prebiotics, says Quigley. Prebiotic fibers can initially worsen symptoms like bloating, gas and abdominal pain, though they may bring benefits in the long term, he says. Overall, it’s best to start slowly and introduce prebiotics gradually.
Additionally, anyone who experiences digestive upset after drinking prebiotic soda should stop using it and consult their doctor.
Prebiotic sodas began popping up about five years ago, but under a different name. Some of the earliest products called themselves “prebiotic drinks” or “health tonics,” which didn’t translate to shoppers, says Dang. “There wasn’t a specific category these products would play in,” she says. “They always sat somewhere between sparkling water or juices.” Shoppers didn’t understand what the beverages were and where to find them, two issues brands solved when they began positioning themselves as soda alternatives about two years ago. “Now that these brands have started to coin the term soda on their packaging, we’ve found that shoppers can quickly identify and understand what the product is,” says Dang.
Dang compares the growing popularity around prebiotic soda to that of probiotic-rich kombucha when brands started heavily marketing it as a “better for you” beverage. But prebiotic sodas have a leg up in terms of appeal due to their flavor. “Probiotic beverages like kombucha are typically fermented and have a sour-like taste that can polarize consumers,” says Dang. “On the other hand, prebiotics are usually fiber-rich and fruit- or root-based, but do not require fermentation until they’re ingested in the gut. Prebiotic soda brands have taken innovation even further by creating beverages that mimic classic soda flavors, like your favorite cola, with a focus on taste.” Prebiotic soda is a relatively new category within the beverage market, so Dang expects it to continue growing. She’s even seen a few prebiotic soda brands listed on restaurant menus next to traditional soft drink brands, which is a sign that they’re continuing to permeate the market and expand their reach.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-prepared-meal-delivery-services-ncna1295380,"The best prepared meal delivery services, according to editor reviews",HEALTH,"After a long, busy day, cooking dinner is the last thing you want to think about. Prepared meal delivery services take the guesswork out of that daily chore with a range of low-effort, ready-to-eat meals that you can pop into your oven or microwave. Unlike meal kits, which come with individual ingredients you prepare and cook yourself, pre-made meal services can save a lot of time. They also come with unique and customizable food options to fit your personal preferences, including serving size and protein amount, while catering to dietary restrictions like gluten-free, vegetarian and low-carb.
I have tried and written about meal delivery services for the past four years. I connected with chefs and nutritionists about their favorite prepared meal delivery services and compiled a list of their recommendations below, along with services NBC Select editors use and love. Pricing, serving size and plan details are also included with each option.
SKIP AHEAD How I picked the best prepared meal delivery services | Best prepared meal delivery services | Why trust NBC Select?
I talked to our experts about what to consider when shopping for prepared meal delivery services. Here are the most important factors they say to keep in mind:
I talked to nutritionists, dietitians and chefs about their favorite prepared meal delivery services and highlighted their recommendations across budgets and diets, including gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan. All the meal delivery services below offer single-serve, ready-to-eat meals. Some also offer additional meal kit options.
Price is based on eight meals per week.
Cookunity has multiple plans depending on how many meals you want to receive, with subscriptions ranging from four to 16 meals per week. You can make your selections from a rotating menu of ready-to-eat options each week or have them picked for you based on your preferences, including your choices of protein and any dietary restrictions like vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and gluten-free.
“The convenience is unbeatable — it also offers a ton of gluten-free and pescatarian options, so I didn’t feel limited by the menu at all,” says NBC Select associate updates editor Zoe Malin. However, Malin did have to take out a few components of meals before microwaving them, like a kale salad or coleslaw, which was tricky and caused her to do more dishes (normally, she would reheat and eat meals out of the same disposable containers they came in). “This didn’t take away from eating the meal, but it did make prep more involved — if I was in a rush or wanted to heat something up at the office, it would be frustrating,” says Malin.
Cookunity is also a favorite of NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who loves browsing and picking her meals each week. “It feels like grocery shopping, except I don’t have to push a cart or carry bags,” she says. There’s something for every type of diet, and the vegan and vegetarian options are hearty and filling, according to Brown. The meals are also easy to prepare: “All I have to do is remove the film and pop it into the oven for 15-30 minutes, depending on what it is,” says Brown.
You can flag any allergies or foods you don’t like, and the service will notify you if they appear in any meals on the menu. “I appreciate that they provide full ingredient lists, down to the individual ingredients in cheeses,” says Ariane Resnick, a special diet chef and certified nutritionist. The meals come in a reusable bag that you can send back to the company instead of having to break down boxes every week. The meals are fresh and have a refrigerated shelf life of about four to seven days, according to Cookunity.
Cost: Starting at $11 per meal with free shipping | Number of meals: 4 to 16 meals per week
Price is based on 20 meals per week.
BistroMD is a single-serve, individualized plan, so this may not be a good option if you’re looking to feed a family or yourself and a partner. It lets you choose from over 150 chef-prepared meals based on your dietary needs. Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian and CEO of NY Nutrition Group, recommends this service because it has various health-conscious plans — you can pick from five different programs: signature, gluten-free, heart healthy, diabetic and menopause. Each week, you’ll be able to customize which meals you receive.
The service also has an EATS (Essential And Tasty Snacks) program that provides healthy snacking options for either five or seven days for an additional charge, as well as a Men’s Snack Program that costs an additional $53 for three snacks a day for seven days, and a Women’s Snack Program that costs an additional $35 for two snacks daily for seven days.
Cost: Starting at $7 per meal for the 7-day plan and $8 per meal for the 5-day plan, with an additional $20 for shipping | Number of meals: 5 or 7 meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner per week
Price is based on 8 meals per week.
Get $130 off, plus free wellness shots for life with code NBCSELECT130 through Factor’s website.
Factor has a weekly rotating menu of over 30 prepared meals designed by dietitians. Lisa Young, an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University, recommends this service because it caters to a number of diets and dietary needs, including keto, paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, plant-based and high-protein. You can choose from five plans, ranging from four meals per week up to 18 meals per week.
I tried Factor after the brand sent me a few boxes, and I found the meals to be both delicious and convenient — after a long day at work, I simply popped them into the oven and they were ready to eat in less than 10 minutes. Though they don’t look the prettiest in their container , the meals are tasty and varied, which made me excited to eat dinner at the end of the day. I’m also someone who struggles with portion control, so these single-serve meals are satisfying and help me avoid that uncomfortably full feeling.
Our experts also like that the service has a great price point for the quality of meals: “Factor is incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of health-oriented food they offer,” says Resnick.
Cost: Starting at $13 per serving with free shipping | Number of meals: 6 to 18 per week
Price is based on eight meals per week for one person/serving.
Purple Carrot has prepared meals (as well as meal kits), which are plant-based and include several gluten-free options. “Because it’s fully plant-based, Purple Carrot is an easy way for people to add more plant foods into their diets without having to fully convert to veganism,” says Resnick. She called the meals a perfect mix of “familiar and innovative,” with options like kimchi grilled cheese and Baklava overnight oats.
Malin tried Purple Carrot after the brand sent her a few pre-made options, and she loved the convenience and taste of the meals. “When it comes to prepared vegetarian and vegan meals, I often find that they’re either bland or overly seasoned to make up for the fact that they’re boring. But Purple Carrot’s were genuinely delicious,” says Malin, who took the microwavable meals to work. “The pre-filled tray fit in my lunch box and I looked forward to eating it halfway through the day.”
You can customize the number of meals you get per week, ranging from six to 10 frozen meals. Deliveries take place on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays depending on your shipping location, and you can choose to skip a delivery on any given week.
Cost: Starting at $13 per serving for pre-made meals with free shipping | Number of meals: 6 to 10 for prepared meals per week
Price is based on four meals per week for two people/servings.
Home Chef’s weekly rotating menu has a Fast & Fresh section with multiple microwave-ready meals, as well as oven-ready meals that lets you throw pre-chopped ingredients in a pan and heat them up with minimal prep and clean up, according to the service. Keep in mind that Home Chef is first and foremost a meal kit delivery service, which means its prepared meal options — which the service calls its fast and fresh plan — are limited each week: Within its weekly menu of more than 30 meals to choose from, Home Chef will offer about 10 prepared options. However, it’s great for families who hope to rotate their meal kits with oven- and microwave-ready meals to cut down on cooking time each week, according to our experts. The service also has a family plan with 4-serving oven-ready meals.
Before ordering, you’ll be prompted to take a quiz that personalizes your menu based on your taste, serving size and delivery preferences. When looking at individual menu options, each meal shows the estimated time it takes to heat up. Home Chef also lets you customize the type and amount of protein you want in each meal (including low-calorie and vegetarian options), which makes it a great option for people who want variety or those with certain dietary restrictions, says Ben Leonard, chef and culinary manager for GreenPan. With that said, it may not be the best option for people who are indecisive or picky eaters, says Leonard.
Cost: Starting at $10 per meal, with a minimum weekly order value of $51 (Home Chef Plan) or $83 (Family Plan) | Number of meals: 2 to 6 meals per week
Price is based on four meals per week for two people/servings.
Sunbasket has seasonal-ingredient focused meals made for those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes-friendly. On its weekly rotating menu, Sunbasket has around 10 single-serve meals, which the service calls its fresh and ready plan, that you can heat in the oven or microwave and add to your order each week. If you don’t feel like committing to prepared meals, you can mix and match with over a dozen meal kits from its menu, giving you options for days you want to cook, as well as those sporadically busy days when you just don’t have time. Each meal indicates whether it accommodates certain dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, soy-free, pescatarian and vegetarian.
Malin tried Sunbasket for a week and became a huge fan of the service. “There were almost too many delicious dishes to choose from, and each one I tried came with an easy to follow recipe — I loved that some of them also prompted me to cook with ingredients I don’t normally buy,” she says. ""And don’t sleep on the fresh and ready meals: They taste like homemade meals, but all you do is warm them up in the microwave.”
These pre-made meals don’t come frozen, but you can freeze most of them to cook later (the ones that can be frozen have specific cooking instructions on them).
Cost: Starting at $10 per meal with $6 shipping | Number of meals: 2 to 5 per week
Price is based on four single-serve prepared meals per week.
Blue Apron joined the prepared meal delivery scene earlier this year with its Prepared & Ready plan and now has over 30 single-serve meals on its rotating weekly menu. These meals heat up in the microwave in under five minutes, and they come in one tray that you can recycle afterward. You can also combine prepared and meal kit plans by adding the pre-made meals to your meal kit orders as add-ons each week.
I tried Blue Apron’s prepared meals for two weeks and was impressed by how tasty they were, in addition to being super quick and easy to heat up when I’m feeling too lazy to cook. The options are also fairly varied each week (though you will find a lot of pastas on the menu, which can be a con for some), and I found the portions to be just right for myself. However, the meals do not come with sides, so it may be lacking in variety. Any foods that can be considered as sides, like veggies, are mixed into the meals rather than portioned off (like you would find in most other prepared meal services).
Cost: Starting at $10 per meal | Number of meals: 4 to 10 per week
Price is based on 12 meals per week.
Splendid Spoon has over 50 healthy ready-made and gluten-free meals and snacks, including smoothies, soups, noodle bowls and dishes. You can choose one of three plans, including a six-, 12- or 18-meal plan per week (and you can add more meals at an additional cost). The service recommends freezing the food upon unpacking, which it says makes the meals last one to three months. “They taste as healthy as they are, which is a downside for some and a bonus for others,” says Resnick, who was sent a few boxes by the brand to try out.
While you can’t customize the number of meals you get per plan, Splendid Spoon does let you choose how often you want to receive your meals: weekly, every other week or once a month.
Cost: Starting at $10 per meal and $85 for the plan, with an additional $13 for shipping (free if you order 10 or more meals) | Number of meals: 6, 12 or 18 per order
Price is based on four meals per week for two people/servings.
Epicured’s meals are all gluten-free and low-FODMAP, which means they don’t have certain carbohydrates and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest, according to the service. This makes Epicured a great option for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a generally sensitive stomach, says Moskovitz. It has a rotating menu of over 50 prepared foods spanning breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and desserts. You can filter the menu by diet, including gluten-free, pescatarian, vegetarian and vegan — each diet has a “menu cycle,” which means it rotates every few weeks. Once you choose your meals and register, each weekly order is automatically renewed (if you don’t manually pick your meals, last week’s meals will be sent again).
Cost: Starting at around $15 per meal with free shipping for orders over $100 (the shipping cost for orders under $100 depends on the delivery location) | Number of meals: As many as you want
Like their name suggests, prepared meal delivery services have a rotating menu of pre-made meals that you can easily heat up in the microwave or oven minus the prep work (like chopping, slicing and dicing).
These services are great if you lead a busy life and want to cut down on the time you spend cooking per week, or if you simply want a good meal without needing the cooking chops to make it. And since these meals are delivered directly to your door, you won't have to worry about picking up groceries.
Prepared meal delivery services typically offer a wide range of menu items, so you can try new foods each week or stick with what you like (most will ask you for information about your dietary preferences when you sign up). Plus, many pre-made meal services cater to several dietary restrictions like gluten-free, dairy-free and vegetarian.
One of the most enticing parts of using a prepared meal delivery service is that actually preparing your foods takes very little time. While all services have their own heating directions, they usually require you to heat them up in the microwave or oven for just a few minutes. The services I've tried, for example, needed no more than 5 minutes in the microwave and 10-11 minutes in the oven to be fully ready to serve.
Though there are plenty of benefits to a prepared meal delivery services, there are a few downsides to keep in mind:

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/sunbasket-meal-delivery-service-review-2024-rcna140564,Is Sunbasket the best gluten-free meal delivery service?,HEALTH,"Because I have a few dietary restrictions, I often get stuck in what I call the “safe zone” when it comes to cooking — I have the tendency to make the same dishes over and over again because I know they align with my gluten-free, pescatarian diet. Even when I’m sick of them, I’ll revert back to the handful of recipes I know best, especially because it makes grocery shopping easy. Meal delivery services always seem like an ideal solution, but I was discouraged after trying a few and feeling limited by their two or three “special diet” options. That is until I tried Sunbasket.
Sunbasket develops its dishes for people with dietary restrictions like me — it has over a dozen gluten-free, paleo, vegan, dairy-free and soy-free meal kit options to choose from each week. I tried the meal delivery service for a week and found myself feeling empowered to cook with flavors I do not typically gravitate toward, plus I was less stressed about cooking dinner overall.
Below I’ll share my experience trying Sunbasket, including what to know about pricing, delivery schedules and menu options.
SKIP AHEAD What is Sunbasket? | How much does Sunbasket cost? | How I tried Sunbasket | My experience with Sunbasket | Who is Sunbasket best for? | How does Sunbasket compare to competitors?
Sunbasket is a meal delivery service that caters seasonal-ingredient focused meals to those who follow specific diets like gluten-free, paleo and diabetes friendly. The company offers meal kits and prepared meals (which it calls fresh and ready meals), both of which you can add to your weekly delivery. You aren’t tied to hitting a quota for either — for example, there’s no rule about choosing at least one meal kit per delivery. The meals ship fresh inside a box with ice packs so they stay fresh in transit.
Sunbasket also somewhat functions as an online grocery store. It sells a la carte products like meat, seafood, pre-packaged snacks, soups and bottled smoothies you can add  to your order, helping you cross a few items off your grocery list that you might usually shop for at your local market.
Sunbasket operates on a subscription-based model. It delivers meals weekly and most customers can schedule delivery on any day from Sunday to Thursday, but there may be restrictions based on your zip code. By Wednesdays at 3 p.m. ET, you have to select the meals — either meal kits, prepared meals and/or a la carte grocery items — you want to receive for the upcoming week.
You also can skip weeks at any time or change your delivery address from one week to the next. For instance, if you want to have meals delivered at your home one week and a family member’s home while you’re there for the holidays, you just have to update your delivery address before the Wednesday deadline. It’s free to cancel your subscription at any point.
Meal kits start at $11.49 a serving, and fresh and ready meals start at $9.99 per serving, but each one is priced differently. That means instead of paying a flat fee each week, you’re charged based on the individual prices of the meals you choose — each order has a $45 minumim. Meals with meat or seafood are typically a few dollars more than vegetarian and vegan meals. Shipping is free for your first box, but costs $9.99 per box for subsequent orders.
To try Sunbasket, the brand sent me three meals: two meal kits, salmon with pistachio-herb dressing and warm potato salad and blackened sole with turmeric cauliflower and artichoke-spinach dip, and one fresh and ready meal, sichuan glass noodle bowl with plant-based Impossible beef. I tried everything over the course of a week. I cooked the meal kits for dinner in my small New York City apartment kitchen. I warmed up the premade meal for dinner in my microwave. Since I don’t have a dishwasher, I hand-washed all my dinnerware, cookware and kitchen utensils by hand.
I follow a gluten-free, pescatarian diet and chose Sunbasket dishes that align with it. I live alone, usually just cooking for myself, and am confident in the kitchen from my many years of cooking experience. I typically meal prep a low-effort dinner for the work week on Sunday or Monday nights, and cook something a bit more elaborate at least once during the weekend.
From start to finish, or, in other words, from selecting my meals all the way through cooking and actually eating them, my experience trying Sunbasket was seamless. Here are some of my main takeaways from each part of trying the meal kit delivery service.
The week prior to receiving my Sunbasket shipment, I chose what meals I wanted to receive via the company’s website. As someone with dietary restrictions, I expected this process to take a while. With other meal delivery services, I usually have to scroll through the menu, click on each meal individually and read through its ingredient list to make sure it didn’t include any meat or gluten. This was a straightforward process thanks to the website’s detailed filters. I selected “gluten-free” from a dropdown menu so I only saw meals that matched the specific diet I follow, and I could easily tell which ones had seafood or were vegetarian based on the pictures and names of each dish. I also used the “under 20 minute” filter to find dishes that don’t take much time to cook, which helped me identify options I could quickly whip up after a work day.
I browsed through the two dozen-or-so options, and I clicked on ones that looked appealing to get a summary of how many people it serves, how many calories it contains and how long it takes to prepare. All of these details helped me select my meals quickly.
My Sunbasket box arrived on a Wednesday afternoon, just as I expected it to. The box was insulated and packed with dry ice, so all the food inside was cold to the touch when I opened it. Meal kits came packed in individual labeled brown paper bags with recipe cards. The bags made Sunbasket’s meal kits easy to store and organize in my refrigerator, and it kept the ingredients for each dish separate so I didn’t mix them up. I appreciated that the seafood for each meal kit was not included inside the bags. Instead, it came packed underneath the bags, closest to the dry ice, keeping it the coldest out of everything in the box. Sunbasked packed my fresh and ready meal separately from the meal kits — it looked like a prepared meal I’d grab from the grocery store.
Cooking usually feels like a production since it can involve so many steps and pans, including  prepwork and cleaning. But Sunbasket’s meal kits made cooking feel hassle-free and doable even after a long day.
The recipe cards each meal comes with have specific directions for every step of the process, and I found them easy to follow. It felt like they were written for home chefs of all levels — Sunbasket recipes didn’t use technical language or ask me to do any complex slicing and dicing. There’s also a section of the recipe cards that told me what ingredients I’d need to grab from my pantry (usually just salt, pepper and olive oil) and what kitchen gadgets I should have handy. This served as a checklist for me and I made sure I put everything on my counter prior to cooking so I didn’t have to go searching for it later on. Recipe cards also provide estimated cook times for each dish, which I found to be accurate for both dishes I made.
The ingredients that came in my meal kits were fresh and in great condition. Everything was pre-portioned, so I didn’t have to measure a single ingredient, which was one of my favorite parts of the Sunbasket experience. Not having to use measuring cups or a kitchen scale saved me time and reduced the number of dishes I had to clean afterward. It also meant I could cook with ingredients I love but don’t always want to buy a full container of at the grocery store. For example, the salmon dish I made came with just enough capers for the dish but didn’t leave me with extra that would go to waste. Some of the ingredients I used came pre-prepped, too. The salmon dish, for instance, came with roasted pistachios so I didn’t need to roast them myself. This eliminated a step of the cooking process, saving me a lot of time and making the recipe much simpler. Fresh and ready meals
Both dishes I cooked were delicious, flavorful and were filling — each one was portioned for two servings. The particular recipes I chose forced me to use ingredients that aren’t in my regular rotation, like turmeric and artichoke dip, and make foods that aren’t typically top of mind for me, like potato salad. I live alone, so I ate one portion the night I cooked and saved the second portion to eat the next day. The meals I made reheated well, plus not having to cook two days in a row was an added bonus.
I didn’t know much about Sunbasket’s prepared meals prior to trying the meal delivery service, and they ended up being what I was most surprised by. Their main perk is convenience — all I needed to do to get dinner on the table was peel off the container’s lid, transfer the prepared food to a bowl and microwave it. My meal was ready in less than five minutes, and knowing that it was waiting for me inside my refrigerator made me less stressed about the evening ahead. I did not dread coming home, standing over a pot for half an hour and then spending double the amount of time cleaning up like I sometimes do.
There’s a smaller selection of fresh and ready meals for customers to choose from compared to the meal kits, but still plenty of options for those with varying dietary restrictions. I opted for a noodle bowl with Impossible Beef, which in the past I’ve felt intimidated to try because I do not know how to cook with it. Since Sunbasket did the cooking for me, it felt more accessible and allowed me to try a food I probably wouldn’t have otherwise.
My noodle bowl came in what looked like a paper takeout container with a sealed lid. It wasn’t greasy, heavy or oily like some prepared meals can be, and felt better than ordering takeout because its container had a detailed nutrition label on the back, ensuring I knew exactly what ingredients it was made with. The label also directed me to eat the dish within three days; knowing this was helpful so I could plan when to eat it. While I ate the noodles for dinner, I could have easily thrown the container in my lunchbox and microwaved it at the office for lunch.
Based on my experience, Hands down, Sunbasket is best for individuals or two-person households with dietary restrictions. You can easily filter meals by your specific dietary preferences, which makes choosing options quick and easy. Since the dishes are largely centered around seasonal produce, anyone looking for a meal delivery service that has healthy options and hassle-free cooking would benefit from a Sunbasket subscription.
If you’re just feeding yourself, you can go with the single-serve prepared dishes or select meal kits that make two servings so you have leftovers for the next day. If you’re feeding yourself and one other person, the meal kits make enough food for two filling portion sizes. You can double up on meal kits if you need to  feed four people instead of two, but that makes your weekly delivery double the price.
When it comes to cost, Sunbasket pricing can be on the more expensive side compared to competitors like Purple Carrot, Blue Apron and HelloFresh. The price per serving for meal kits is about $11.00 for Purple Carrot, $10.99 for Blue Apron and $9.99 for HelloFresh — with Sunbasket, the price per serving for meal kits can be anywhere from $11.49 to $24.49. If you’re shopping on a budget, you can be particular about which dishes you choose by paying attention to the price listed under each meal’s name on the menu.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/fsa-eligible-products-on-amazon-rcna184034,19+ FSA-eligible products you can buy on Amazon,HEALTH,"At the top of each year, many companies offer employees the option of putting tax-free money into a flexible spending account, or FSA, so you can use it on medical expenses over the course of the year. What’s considered a “medical expense” is actually pretty far reaching. It can cover insurance deductibles, prescription copayments, medical treatments and supplies like breast pumps, reading glasses, acne face washes and even certain massage guns.
The only catch: You have to designate how much you want to put in your FSA account at the start of the year and use them within that calendar year. If you have unused funds, most FSA programs offer a grace period that lasts until March 15 of the following year to use up any remaining money. After March 15, unused funds will be returned to your employer.
To help make sure you don’t lose any money you’ve stashed away, we gathered a list of FSA-eligible products that are available on Amazon right now.

FSA, also known as a flexible spending account, is something that some employers offer alongside health insurance. With an FSA, you’re able to deduct pre-taxed money from your paycheck and funnel it into a separate account that you can use for certain health care and medical expenses, including treatments and products. The Internal Revenue Service sets a maximum of how much you can put into an FSA account each year — in 2024 that maximum was $3,200, while the max for 2025 is set at $3,300. It’s also worth noting that your employer can set the limit to even less than that.
There are a few ways that FSA accounts work. Many employers provide a debit card that you can then use on eligible expenses. Other plans require you to submit receipts for eligible expenses so that you can get reimbursed for them.
You can use money from your FSA account to pay for things like insurance deductibles and trips to the emergency room, as well as for copays at the doctor’s office and prescriptions. There are also a number of health and medical related products that you can use your FSA money on. Many of these products are available to everyone, while some — such as a sleep apnea machine — require a letter of medical necessity from a doctor. Here, you’ll find a list of some of the product categories that are covered for most people under their FSA:
You can purchase FSA-eligible products anywhere, but Amazon makes it particularly convenient. Not only do Prime members get fast, free shipping on many products, Amazon has an FSA store that makes it easy to see what is covered. Below, I rounded up a variety of FSA-eligible products from Amazon. Everything on this list has either been recommended by experts in previous stories, comes highly recommended by NBC Select editors or has at least a 4-star average rating from over 1,000 reviews on Amazon.
Yes, you really can use your FSA funds for a massage gun. And, in fact, if you have a sizable amount of money left in your account, it could be a smart purchase before year’s end. Experts have told us this one from Theragun is quiet and that the built-in five speeds allows for a more customized massage. You can also download the Therabody app, which integrates with Apple Health and Google Fit and recommends guided wellness routines based on your behaviors.
This won an NBC Select Wellness Award for best acne treatment. It has 0.1% adapalene, an over-the-counter retinoid that’s commonly used to treat acne because it can reduce inflammation and clean pores, according to the brand. NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson says it’s gentle while still being effective.
Experts recommended this salicylic acid cleanser in our guide to the best products for acne-prone skin. It has LHA (lipohydroxy acid), which dermatologists told us is gentle on the skin. The formula’s also free of oils, fragrances and parabens, making it a good choice for those with sensitive skin, according to the brand.
“I like that these are a little more translucent than other patches I’ve tried because they blend well with my skin tone and don’t scream ‘hey I’ve got a pimple,’” says NBC Select’s editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez. These patches rely on hydrocolloid gel to draw out any oil and bacteria from pimples.
This mineral lip balm, which we included in our guide to the best SPF lip balms, is made with zinc oxide to physically block the sun’s rays. But it doesn’t just protect your lips from the sun, it has sweet almond oil to hydrate skin as you wear it, according to the brand.
Both dermatologists and NBC Select staffers recommend this face sunscreen. NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio says it’s particularly good for those with certain skin issues. “I have really bad rosacea, so many skin care products I try leave my skin looking red and create a burning feeling,” she says. “This is the only sunscreen I’ve ever tried that doesn’t irritate my skin at all.” The oil- and fragrance-free formula is non comedogenic and has niacinamide to soothe skin, according to the brand.
Period underwear, like this FSA-eligible pair from Thinx, is designed to absorb periods and bladder leaks, so you rarely need to use pads, tampons or cups in conjunction with it. The underwear can hold up to 12 regular tampons’ worth of flow, plus it's leak-resistant (for up to 12 hours) and stretchy, according to the brand. This pair is fairly full-coverage and has mesh and lace detail for a more stylish fit.
While not all face and body products are FSA-eligible, those directly associated with helping with certain issues are — like this cream, which made our list of best lotions for eczema. It calms irritated skin and has a cooling sensation, which experts told us can further calm flare-ups. The lotion’s considered safe for children and babies 3 months and older, according to Eucerin.
You can use this antibiotic ointment on scrapes and cuts to prevent bacterial infection. Experts also told us it’s helpful to apply it to blisters for the same reason. It’s made with bacitracin zinc, neomycin sulfate and polymyxin, which all help to prevent skin infections, according to the brand. You should use it after cleaning a wound and before a bandage is put on.
Dealing with bunions? Podiatrists recommended these toe separators to ease the pressure of the bunion by straightening the big toe. They’re washable and reusable and made of flexible gel that’s comfortable and soft against the skin, according to the brand.
In our guide on how to clean your ears, experts warned us about being careful not to try and dig wax out of your canals because it can be damaging. This kit comes with drops that have cerumenolytic agents, which help soften and loosen excess earwax so it comes out more easily. It also comes with a soft, rubber bulb syringe that you can place at the opening of your ear to suck out the solution and softened wax.
Experts have told us that cervical traction — meaning devices that help stretch the neck — can ease neck pain. During our reporting, experts also recommended this cervical neck traction device since it can be good for different levels of pain. It inflates to gently stretch and straighten your neck, is made from vegetable fleece that’s soft on the skin and you can easily adjust the tightness of it when you put it on by using the velcro straps.
One of our favorite treatments for athlete’s foot, you can use this antifungal cream twice daily for a week to eliminate athlete’s foot. The main ingredient is Terbinafine Hydrochloride, which specifically targets and kills fungus, according to the brand. Apply it to clean feet and only use it on infected areas.
You can use heating pads for a variety of things — including soothing sore backs, menstrual cramps and more. Doctors recommend this option from Sunbeam in our roundup of the best heating pads because it’s budget-friendly and large enough to cover bigger areas of the body. It has a nine-foot cord, a two-hour auto shut off, and a slide-button controller with three heat settings, according to the brand.
NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin keeps these nasal strips, which work by opening up nasal passageways for easier breathing, at home because she suffers from allergies, which can cause congestion and lead to snoring. “The nasal strips come in a pack of 26 and their adhesive has never irritated my sensitive skin,” she says. “I find that they usually stay in place overnight, too.”
I’ve been wearing contact lenses for nearly 25 years and this has been my go-to solution for at least a decade. I find it to be gentle on my eyes and I don’t need more than a drop or two to moisturize my eyes after I’ve been wearing my contacts all day. This saline solution is hydrating and can also clean your contacts if they get smudged or dirty. The box comes with two 12-ounce bottles of solution and a plastic lens case.
Ideal for your medicine cabinet or for keeps in your car trunk, this 80-piece first-aid kit comes with everything you might need for minor wounds — like bandages, Neosporin, Tylenol and gauze. Everything is housed in an easy-to-carry, organized case. It has a 4.8-star average rating from 8,731 reviews on Amazon.
Few things are harder than trying to take the temperature of a sick toddler. This thermometer makes it much easier. You can hold the no-touch model away from the forehead and will still give an accurate reading. I’ve used it with my 3-year-old and can attest to how quick and easy it is to use. In fact, rather than fighting me, my daughter likes to get in on the action and help take her own temperature. Not only does the digital screen give you the exact temperature, it glows green if there is no fever, yellow if there is a mild fever and red if there is a moderate or high fever.
As spring approaches, seasonal allergies start kicking up. Use your remaining FSA funds to stock up on allergy relief meds like Zyrtec. This bundle includes a bottle with 30 pills and three travel packets that each contain one pill. The main active ingredient in these antihistamine tablets is cetirizine hydrochloride, which can treat indoor allergies caused by dust, mold, and pet dander, and outdoor seasonal allergies caused by tree pollen, weeds, and grasses, according to the brand.
If you struggle with blood pressure issues, an at-home monitor can help you keep an eye on your numbers. This one comes with a cuff that fits standard to large adult arms and it syncs with an app so you can store all your readings in one place. The backlit display, which is powered by four AAA batteries, shows your systolic and diastolic numbers in large font, making it easy to read from far away or if you have less than perfect eyesight.
Intended to rehydrate you on a hot day, after a workout or anytime you’re feeling a bit dehydrated, this mix has electrolytes and glucose to hydrate you quickly, according to the brand. Each box has 14 single-use packets — you can mix one packet with as much as 16 ounces of water. It has a 4.3.-star average rating from over 4,050 reviews on Amazon and is available in eight flavors, including watermelon, lemonade and tropical punch.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-home-covid-19-tests-ncna1275687,Where to buy at-home Covid tests right now,HEALTH,"Gone are the days of visiting a doctor’s office to determine whether you have Covid. Instead, you can buy over-the-counter test kits, which diagnose infection from the comfort of your home, making them convenient. However, at-home Covid tests are generally less sensitive than tests performed by medical professionals, so it’s important to understand their benefits and limitations, says Omai Garner, PhD, chief of clinical microbiology for the UCLA Health System.
I spoke to experts about how to shop for at-home Covid tests, including how they work, who should use them and how accurate they are. I also rounded up FDA-authorized test kits you can purchase right now.

There are two methods of at-home testing:
Both methods of at-home testing allow you to do diagnostic tests, which tell you if you’re actively infected with Covid. Diagnostic Covid tests fall into two buckets: molecular tests and antigen tests. The tests detect different parts of the Covid virus and vary in sensitivity.
It’s important to note that most rapid tests are antigen tests, and while a few molecular rapid tests are available, they are not PCR tests — they perform a different type of molecular test that’s less sensitive, which means they require a higher amount of the virus in a sample to detect it, says Garner. Be aware that many rapid test kits say they are able to deliver PCR-quality results, but a PCR-quality test is not equivalent to a PCR test, says Garner.
While shopping for at-home Covid tests, experts recommend considering the following:
Below are some of the most widely available Covid home testing kits on the FDA-authorized list. All of the rapid tests require you to collect a nasal or saliva swab and perform the test yourself using provided materials. All of the home collection tests come with prepaid return labels and professionals perform PCR tests on your samples when they arrive at the labs.
One of the most important things to know about rapid tests is that they often come with two or more tests and recommend that you perform multiple tests a few days apart — this is called serial testing, according to the CDC. The FDA recommends repeat (serial) testing following a negative result from an at-home antigen test whether or not you have symptoms. This is because on the first day you perform an at-home test, it might not be able to detect low levels of the virus and you may get a false negative, even if you’re symptomatic, says Dr. Sharon Nachman, chief of the division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Children’s Hospital.
iHealth’s kit includes two tests — it’s best to test twice over three days with 24 to 48 hours between them, according to the brand. You perform the test using a nasal swab you collect, a test card and processing fluid. iHealth also offers an app you can download to log your results.
Type: rapid | Result time: 15 minutes | Age range: 2 years old and above | Sample type: nasal
This kit comes with two tests — you should test yourself twice within three days, making sure tests are done at least 36 hours apart, according to the brand. It provides the materials needed to perform nasal swabs as well as the actual test, which is done using test cards and processing fluid.
Type: rapid | Result time: 15 minutes | Age range: 2 years old and above | Sample type: nasal
FlowFlex’s home testing kit comes with five tests. After the first test, the brand recommends testing two more times at least 48 hours apart. The kit comes with materials needed to perform a nasal swab and the actual test, which is done using a test card and processing fluid.
Type: rapid | Result time: 15 minutes | Age range: 2 years old and above | Sample type: nasal
This kit is intended for you to test twice over two to three days with 24 to 36 hours between each test. You collect a nasal swab sample and dip it into a solution tube with a test strip to perform the test.
Type: rapid | Result time: 10 minutes | Age range: 2 years old and above | Sample type: nasal
On/Go’s kit comes with one test, so you'll have to buy multiple to perform serial testing. You should test twice over two or three days with 24 to 48 hours between them, according to the brand. There is a QR code on the box you can scan to download a companion app, which guides you through the testing process and allows you to log your test results. The test comes with materials needed to perform a nasal swab and the actual test, which is done using test cards and processing fluid.
Type: rapid | Result time: 10 minutes | Age range: 2 years old and above | Sample type: nasal
This home collection test comes with all the materials you need to collect a nasal swab, which you ship to the brand's lab using the included pre-paid return label. The lab runs a PCR test on your sample and posts your results online about one or two days after it arrives.
Type: home collection | Result time: 24 to 48 hours after the sample arrives at the lab | Age range: 2 years old and above | Sample type: nasal
The two at-home Covid testing methods — home collection kits and rapid tests — are similar in that they can diagnose infection and are performed on either nose or throat swabs. From there, the methods differ, and experts say those differences determine how reliable tests are, as well as how you should use them. I broke both testing methods down and highlighted pros and cons to be aware of.
Pros: Home collection tests generally produce more accurate results than rapid tests. “The reason for that is because the gold standard PCR test is run on the sample, and the people running the test are professionals,” says Garner.
Cons: You need to account for human error. Because you are collecting the sample instead of a trained professional, there’s always the possibility of collecting a poor sample, which can impact your result, says Garner.
Pros: Rapid tests deliver results in minutes, so if you are symptomatic, you can learn if what you’re experiencing is Covid or not very quickly.
Cons: Some rapid tests say they can screen asymptomatic individuals for Covid. However, Garner says he “fundamentally disagrees with [this]” because you cannot perform a PCR test — the most accurate Covid test — entirely at home. If you test too early with a rapid test, there may only be low levels of the virus present in the sample, which could lead to an inaccurate result. Thus, Garner does not think rapid tests are appropriate for asymptomatic testing, and all the experts we interviewed agreed. As for symptomatic testing, he says rapid tests perform relatively well — there is typically a higher amount of virus present in the body, reaching a threshold rapid tests can cover, he says.
Each test kit is different and requires its own specific set of procedures, so it’s crucial to read the directions before taking a sample, says Nachman. ""It sounds silly to say, but reading the directions carefully is actually quite critical to do,” she says.
When you get your results from home collection or rapid tests, they’re simply reported to you, not explained, says Nachman. Because of this, it’s important to call your primary care doctor — especially if you test positive — to understand how to proceed. “At-home tests are geared to get the information to you with the idea that you’re going to call for a helping hand to deal with the results, particularly if there’s a positive result,” she says.
Beyond their convenience, the benefit of at-home Covid tests is that they allow people to get tested frequently, which can lead to catching more infections and, in turn, decrease spread, experts told me.
Changes in Covid variants have not made at-home tests any less sensitive, so they continue to be a great diagnostic tool, says Garner. But since you're collecting the sample for a test or performing the test entirely by yourself, testing for Covid at home is generally less reliable compared to getting tested by professionals in a medical office. Because of this, if you have a high-risk exposure and/or are symptomatic despite testing negative at home, it still may be worthwhile to get a formal test done by a medical professional.
So are at-home testing methods reliable? The answer is complicated and often comes down to who is being tested, when the test takes place and what type of test is being used, says Nachman.
Anyone can use at-home Covid tests, and many options are suitable for children as well as adults. However, it’s challenging for parents to test young children, says Nachman — if they’re moving around or you’re trying to collect a sample quickly so as to not upset them, you may not collect a good sample, which can skew results. If you’re concerned about collecting a good sample from kids by yourself or are having trouble doing so, experts say it’s best to get kids tested by medical professionals.
Yes, Covid tests expire, and you should not use expired Covid tests, according to the FDA. “The expiration date is a guaranteed date by which a test will still work,” says Garner. “This means you can only trust the result if the test is not expired.”
You can find a test’s expiration date listed on its box. Be sure to also check the expiration date column on the FDA’s List of Authorized At-Home OTC Covid Diagnostic Tests, which lists the most up-to-date expiration information. The expiration dates for Covid tests may be extended, which means “the manufacturer provided data showing that the shelf-life is longer than was known when the test was first authorized,” according to the FDA.
No, you cannot get free Covid tests right now. The U.S. Health and Human Services agency previously ran a federal program that offered free Covid tests to households across the country, but it's currently inactive.
You can get free or low-cost Covid tests through insurance plans, which are now required to provide reimbursement for eight tests per month for each individual on a plan. Tests will either be free at the time of purchase or you’ll be reimbursed if you're charged (make sure to keep your receipt if you need to submit a claim to your insurance company for reimbursement).  Some health plans have a network of preferred providers — including in-person and online pharmacies and retailers — you can get free tests from. If you purchase tests from retailers outside that network, insurance companies are still required to reimburse you up to $12 per individual test (or the cost of the test if it’s less than $12).
Yes, many at-home Covid test and collection kits are HSA/FSA eligible, so long as the full cost has not been covered by your insurance plan.  At-home Covid tests are also eligible for reimbursement with a health reimbursement arrangement (HRA). They’re not eligible with a dependent care flexible spending account (DCFSA) or a limited-purpose flexible spending account (LPFSA).

I'm a reporter at NBC Select who has covered Covid since 2020. In addition to at-home Covid tests, I've reported about disposable masks, KN95 masks, N95 masks, KN95 masks for kids and vaccine card holders. For this article, I spoke to two experts about how to shop for and use at-home Covid tests.",Zoe Malin,Unknown
https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-disposable-face-mask-ncna1252865,When should you wear a disposable face mask?,HEALTH,"Wearing a face mask when you’re in a public setting is one of the best ways to avoid getting and spreading illnesses like Covid-19, the flu, RSV and the common cold, says Dr. Carl Fichtenbaum, a professor of clinical medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. But choosing which type to use might seem tricky — you could go with a reusable cloth mask, a disposable mask or a respirator, like a N95 or KN95.
Ultimately, “the best mask is the one you’re going to wear,” says Dr. Sharon Nachman, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Children’s Hospital. Ideally that’s a respirator, which offers the highest level of protection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But wearing a disposable mask is better than wearing no mask at all, she says. And since some people find them more comfortable, they’ll likely wear them properly and for longer periods of time, thus reducing viral transmission.
To help you shop for the best disposable face masks, I talked to doctors about what features to look for and rounded up a handful of options that align with their guidance. Experts also explain when you might want to wear a face mask and why doing so is important.
SKIP AHEAD What are disposable face masks? | How I picked the best disposable face masks | The best disposable face masks to shop | Why trust NBC Select?

Disposable face masks are multi-layered, single-use face coverings that create a physical barrier between the wearer’s nose and mouth and their environment. They help block germs from entering the air when the wearer speaks, breathes, coughs or sneezes, says Fichtenbaum. Disposable masks also help prevent the wearer from inhaling large germ particles that may be in the air around them.
Medical-grade (often called surgical masks) and nonmedical-grade are the two types of disposable face masks. I’ll break down the differences in more detail below, but the most important thing to know is that a nonmedical-grade face mask is a fine option for the average person, so long as you wear it properly and dispose of it frequently, says Nachman.
While shopping for disposable face masks, experts recommend considering the following factors.
All of the disposable face masks below are highly rated and align with expert shopping guidance. They also have features the CDC recommends looking for — each mask is at least two-ply, has a nose wire and does not have exhalation valves. The mask from DemeTech is medical-grade, while all others are nonmedical-grade.
You can buy these three-layer masks, the only medical-grade option on this list, in a pack of 50. They have an adjustable nose bridge and come in various colors.
These face masks have three layers of nonwoven fabric and an adjustable nose bridge. You can purchase them in sets of 50 or 100. The brand also sells individually wrapped options.
WeCare’s disposable face masks come individually wrapped. They’re made from three layers of nonwoven fabric and have an adjustable nose bridge. You can purchase packs of 50 masks in various colors and patterns.
CandyCare’s disposable face masks have three layers of fabric and an adjustable nose bridge. They come in a pack of 25.
Evolvetogether’s masks have four layers of fabric and an adjustable nose bridge. The masks come with two mask keepers, which you can use to store the face coverings when you’re not wearing them.
Disposable face masks protect those around the wearer by blocking germ particles they exhale from entering the air. This decreases the chance that someone who is sick will spread an illness, says Fichtenbaum. To some extent, disposable masks also help prevent the wearer from breathing in larger airborne particles. They also may deter wearers from touching a contaminated surface and then touching their mouth or nose, he says.
Medical-grade disposable face masks (often called surgical masks or medical procedure masks) are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They’re specifically designed to wear in healthcare settings, says Nachman, so they have to meet strict design and performance criteria to be considered medical devices. It’s important to remember that medical-grade disposable masks differ from respirators like KN95s and N95s, the latter of which are regulated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).
Nonmedical-grade disposable face masks often look identical to medical-grade disposable face masks, says Fichtenbaum , but they’re not regulated by the FDA. They’re made for the average person to wear, not healthcare workers, so there’s no uniform design or performance standard they follow. Most, however, have at least two layers of protection.
A face mask won’t protect you or the people around you unless you wear it correctly. The CDC recommends making sure it completely covers your mouth and nose and fits tightly against your face to prevent gaps around the sides of the mask, nose and chin. Also, don’t wear masks with exhalation valves or vents.
All masks fit differently, and features like adjustable ear loops and an adjustable nose bridge help you improve the fit of your mask, as do mask fitters or braces , according to the CDC. Using a fitter or brace is an especially good idea for people with facial hair, which can make it difficult to achieve a tight fit.
Disposable face masks are not meant to be worn for more than a few hours, says Nachman. They get less effective over time, so after wearing one for a while, throw it out and put on a fresh one. It’s also important to keep in mind that any mask that gets dirty or wet from mouth breathing, coughing or sneezing is not going to be useful, says Nachman. She recommends carrying an extra mask with you in case you need to swap yours out.
You’re typically at the highest risk for getting sick while spending more than 15 to 20 minutes in crowded indoor spaces, says Fichtenbaum. Examples include concerts, grocery stores, classrooms and offices, as well as transportation hubs like airports and train stations. Wearing a face mask while traveling on a crowded plane, train or bus is also a good idea, he says.
If you have a fever, you’re at the highest risk for transmitting a virus, so you should stay home, says Nachman. Once your fever gets better, or if you’re just coughing and sneezing, wear a mask if you absolutely have to go out in public, she says. Doing so makes it less likely that you’ll spread germs to others.
You may want to consider wearing a face mask if you’re at higher risk for infection. That goes for people 65 and older, and those who have medical conditions or take medications that weaken their immune system, says Fichtenbaum.
The CDC has Covid-19 , flu and RSV trackers online that are open to the public, which Nachman recommends bookmarking. You can enter a zip code and see how present each illness is in your community or those you’re traveling to. If positivity is trending upward, that’s a sign that you should consider wearing a mask, especially in crowded indoor public spaces, says Nachman.
Disposable face masks are less protective than N95 and KN95 respirators for two reasons.
Disposable face masks have a looser fit, so there tends to be gaps between the mask and the wearer’s face, giving germs an open door to slip through, says Fichtenbaum . N95s and KN95s, on the other hand, form an airtight seal around the wearer’s mouth and nose.
Disposable masks are typically made from a loosely woven material that has a large pore size. This allows more germs to get through disposable face masks, including very small airborne particles often transmitted by coughs and sneezes, says Fichtenbaum . In contrast, N95 and KN95s are typically made from a tightly woven that has a small pore size. This means less germs get through N95s and KN95s, which effectively filter out very small airborne particles.
That said, some people find wearing N95 and KN95s uncomfortable, making disposable face masks the next best option, says Nachman.

This case stores up to seven days’ worth of medication and each compartment has a different colored lid and is labeled with the day of the week. Each compartment can hold up to 12 large vitamins and the lids stay firmly shut until you push the button to open them, according to the brand. Because this case has one large compartment for each day, it’s best for people who take all their pills at the same time of day. This option has a 4.8-star average from over 47,800 reviews on Amazon.
This aluminum pill organizer is made up of seven compartments that screw together to form a larger vessel that’s shaped like, well, a big pill. Each compartment is labeled with the day of the week and can hold up to eight fish oil pills or 16 large vitamins, according to the brand. When closed, the compartments are airtight and keep out moisture, according to Zannaki. This pill organizer has a 4.5-star average from over 1,350 reviews on Amazon and comes in six colors — including matte pink, ice blue and midnight black.
If you need to take medication or supplements in the morning and then again at night, this pill organizer may be a good option for you. Inside a larger box that locks shut with a plastic clasp sits seven smaller containers that each have two compartments. Each container comes in a different rainbow hue and is labeled with a day of the week on the side. When pulled out and laid flat, each container is split down the middle and can be opened on either side.You can take the larger container if you will be away for a week or can just select a few of the smaller containers if you are taking a shorter trip. This pill organizer has a 4.8-star average from over 8,600 reviews on Amazon.
My husband recently bought this to keep his daily vitamins and supplements in and I love how chic it looks sitting on our bathroom counter. Made from BPA-free plastic, there are seven individual canisters (each labeled with a day of the week) that slot into a larger container to keep them all together and secure. Each canister is shaped like a skinny tube and can be opened from either end. Inside, there is a divider. So, you can put your morning medication in the top and your evening medications in the bottom. The larger container everything fits in has a rotating handle. When closed, it keeps the canisters locked in place and when opened, it props up the container at an angle so you can easily see your canisters.
Made for people who take medications twice a day, this pill case has two removable trays. Each one has seven compartments labeled with the day of the week and one tray has moons on each compartment to denote the medication you take at night, while the other has suns for the medication you take in the morning. Each compartment has a push button that opens it and can fit up to 60 Aspirin, according to the brand. This pill case has a 4.6-star average from over 89,000 reviews on Amazon.
Benjamin recommends a locking pill case for anyone with children and says choosing one with an alarm can be helpful for those who tend to forget to take their medication. This pill case delivers on both fronts. This pill organizer has 28 compartments, which equates to four weeks worth of once-a-day doses or two weeks worth of twice-a-day doses. You can program up to six alarms and set it so that when the alarm goes off, only the medication you are supposed to take at that time is accessible. In between uses, you can lock the case with a key. This case has a 4.3-star average from over 3,200 reviews on Amazon.
The right travel pill case for you will have to do with your needs. However, the experts we spoke with said there are some universal things everyone should look for. Those characteristics include:
Delineated compartments: Most travel pill cases have different areas to hold at least a week’s worth of medication, and our experts recommend paying close attention to how those compartments are situated. Look for clearly delineated compartments for each day if you take medication once a day or enough compartments for multiple times of day (morning, noon, evening, bedtime) if you take things at different times over 24 hours, says Alice Benjamin, a nurse practitioner and founder of the lifestyle website Ask Nurse Alice.
Closing mechanism: If you plan on traveling with your pill case, it may get jostled around your suitcase. “Ensure your pill case has a secure closure mechanism to prevent accidental spills or openings, which could lead to medication mix-ups,” says Benjamin. “And if you have small children or pets at home, a pill case with a child-resistant or secure locking mechanism is important for safety.”
Clear labeling: “For people with visual impairments, larger markings, clear labeling or high-contrast design can be very helpful,” says Benjamin. “Some pill cases even have braille or raised text for tactile identification.” Even if you don’t have visual impairments, clear labeling can make it quick and easy to grab the medication you need and go.
Shopping for a travel pill case is highly personal, as everyone has different needs when it comes to medications and supplements. To ensure you select a travel pill case best suited for you, experts recommend asking yourself these questions.
If you take only a few pills a day, you may be fine with a smaller case. If you take more medication or need to take things at different times of the day, a larger option with more compartments will serve you better. “That said, if you are traveling, I always recommend packing more than you will technically need,” says Robinson. “That way you are covered if something happens.” With this in mind, selecting something that will fit a bit more than you think you’ll need is wise.
Will you only be using your pill case when you travel? Or do you want something to put on your counter at home so your pills are organized and easy to remember? This may influence your choice. If you are just throwing it in a suitcase, you may not need to worry about aesthetics as much. But if it will be sitting out on your counter, consider something that you won’t mind looking at every day.
The potency of some medications can be impacted if they are exposed to moisture and light, says Benjamin. Since bathrooms can get humid thanks to hot showers, you want a pill case that closes tightly so your medications aren’t exposed to that humid air. If you are taking a medication that shouldn’t be exposed to light, you’ll want to look for an opaque or darkly tinted pill case. In terms of maintaining the integrity of your medications, washing your pill case with soap and water regularly is also important — it ensures you aren’t transferring bacteria or residue to new medication you add in there, says Robinson.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-n95-masks-ncna1288842,Where to find NIOSH-approved N95 masks right now,HEALTH,"Out of all the different face masks you can choose from, one type is the most protective, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: N95 respirators. They’re designed to filter out at least 95% of small and large airborne particles, and they fit tightly against your face to reduce gaps around the sides, chin and nose area. Plus, N95s are regulated in the United States by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), so they’re easier to shop for compared to similar international respirators like KN95s and KF94s. (Note that most people use “mask” and “respirator” interchangeably, but when the CDC and medical professionals say “respirator,” they specifically mean fitted face coverings with certified filtration, like N95s, KN95s and KF94s).
If you need to restock your supply of N95 masks, I spoke to medical experts about what to look for while shopping, how these respirators differ from other disposable face coverings and when to wear them. I also compiled highly rated NIOSH-approved N95s that are available to buy online.

While shopping for N95 masks, keep the following in mind:
Numerous N95s meet NIOSH’s requirements, but the CDC recommends leaving surgical-grade masks for medical professionals. Excluding those options, I compiled highly rated NIOSH-approved N95 masks you can shop online. Note that some N95s come packaged together, while others are individually wrapped. All the masks listed below have an adjustable nose bridge and two headstraps.
3M’s Aura foldable N95 respirator has a three-panel design and is made to be low profile around the nose and eye area to accommodate glasses. They come individually packaged and are sold in packs of three at minimum — you can purchase larger packs if needed.
Honeywell’s N95s fold flat when they’re not in use. Their adjustable nose clip has a foam cushion that helps create a tight seal against the face. Masks come in a pack of 20.
DemeTech’s N95s are designed with five layers of material and fold flat when they’re not in use. They come in a pack of 20.
You can purchase Shawmut N95 respirators in a pack of 10, 20 or 240. The masks are built with a piece of foam that lines the inside of the adjustable nose piece, which helps reduce eyeglass from fogging up. The N95s come in small and medium/large sizes.
BNX N95 masks fold flat when they’re not in use and have latex-free head straps. They come in a pack of 10.
The pouch design of these N95s creates a large breathing chamber, making it easier to talk while wearing the respirators, according to the brand. They come in a pack of 50.
Aidway’s N95 mask has five layers of protection and a flat-fold design. You purchase the masks in packs of 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 or 1,000.
Regardless of the type of mask you wear, it won’t protect you or the people around you unless you wear it correctly. Make sure your mask completely covers your mouth and nose and fits tightly against your face to prevent gaps around the sides of the mask, nose and chin, according to the CDC.
“N95 respirators will provide the regulated, expected level of protection to the wearer only if there’s a good seal to the face,” says Hines. “You want a good seal so that all of the air that’s breathed in is pulled in through the mask body. That’s where all the filtration of particles and microbial contaminants occurs.”
You can do an at-home leak test with an N95 by putting it on and breathing out, says Rempel. If you can feel the air under your chin or around your eyes, it’s not tight enough. And if your glasses fog up while wearing an N95, there’s leakage and it’s not tight enough, says Hines.
All masks and models fit differently, and features like an adjustable nose bridge help you improve the fit of your mask, as do mask fitters or braces, according to the CDC. Using a fitter or brace is especially a good idea for people with facial hair, which can make it difficult to achieve a tight fit.
There’s no nationwide mask wearing mandate in the United States, so it can be tricky to decide when you should wear one. Here’s what experts recommend — and remember, wearing a mask can help reduce the transmission of illnesses like the flu, RSV and the common cold, not just Covid-19.
In settings where workers are required to wear an N95, like some construction zones and healthcare settings, they have to do an official fit test , says Hines. The public, however, does not need to do a formal fit test before buying and wearing an N95. Regardless, you should still check to see if your respirator fits properly before wearing it in public, she says.
Technically, N95s are disposable, single-use face coverings. But if you remove and store an N95 properly, you can reuse it multiple times — simply put, that entails taking the mask off by its head straps and storing it in a paper or mesh fabric bag between uses, according to the CDC.
N95 manufacturers often provide instructions for the suggested length of use for their masks on the box or online. But in general, you should throw out your N95 if it gets damaged — crumpled up in your bag, for example — or if you can no longer achieve a tight seal to the face. You should also replace your N95 if it gets wet, dirty or contaminated.
N95 respirators are not intended for use by children and have not been broadly tested on them, according to the CDC. However, some brands offer N95s in small and large sizes, and smaller N95s may fit some children’s faces. Select brands make kids KN95s , too. When it comes to kids’ face coverings, it’s crucial to choose a well-fitting and comfortable option to reduce the chance of children removing it often or wearing it incorrectly, according to the CDC.
Yes, N95 masks are eligible for reimbursement with a flexible spending account (FSA), health savings account (HSA) or health reimbursement arrangement (HRA). They are not eligible with a dependent care flexible spending account (DCFSA) or a limited-purpose flexible spending account (LPFSA).

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/hand-sanitizers-cdc-requirements-ncna1238633,How to shop for CDC-approved hand sanitizer,HEALTH,"When the pandemic hit in 2020, hand sanitizer quickly became one of the hottest commodities to help prevent the spread of Coronavirus, resulting in empty store shelves and a demand manufacturers could not keep pace with. The germ-fighting product is easier to find nowadays, but demand is on the rise again with U.S. officials having recently declared monkeypox a public health emergency.
While monkeypox spreads primarily through close intimate contact, it can also spread through skin-to-skin contact, including “direct contact with monkeypox rash, scabs or body fluids from a person with monkeypox or touching objects, surfaces or clothing that have been used by someone with monkeypox,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
So how should you protect yourself? Besides getting vaccinated, which the CDC strongly recommends, another safeguard is to wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds with soap and water and, when that option is not available, to use a sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Below, we outlined the CDC’s guidance on how to shop for hand sanitizers and rounded up hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol per their guidelines.
Unfortunately, the ingredients within hand sanitizers vary greatly, and the FDA can’t force recalls on over-the-counter drugs and hand sanitizers; it can only do so by pressuring companies to do so voluntarily.
To help you find some of the safest and most effective hand sanitizers on the market, we rounded up sanitizers that are not only CDC- and FDA-compliant, but also contain ingredients such as aloe vera and glycerin to help soothe and hydrate the skin. We included household-sized sanitizers as well as travel-sized sanitizers for on-the-go protection.
Germ-X comes in four varieties: fragrance-free, waterfall scent, citrus peel scent and aloe vera-infused. It’s free from parabens, phthalates and formaldehyde, according to the brand, and contains 62% alcohol. It’s also formulated with moisturizers and vitamin E to soothe drying hands, Germ-X says.
This organic hand sanitizer, which contains 62% alcohol, is formulated with glycerin and dimethicone, which together help hydrate and moisturize the skin, according to EO. The hand sanitizer is available in three soothing scents: Lavender, Peppermint and Sweet Orange. If you’re sensitive to smells, opt for the Unscented version — experts have previously told us that unscented products are better for sensitive skin.
The 70% ethyl alcohol in ClimbOn’s Hand Spray exceeds the CDC requirement, making it a good option for fighting germs and bacteria. The spray is made with soothing aloe vera gel as well as moisturizing coconut oil, the brand says. Lemon and clove oils help leave behind a light, refreshing scent. Other hand-sanitizing sprays to consider include OLIKA, Noshinku, Hello Bello and OH.SO.
Touchland’s hand sanitizer contains 67% ethyl alcohol, which is above the CDC requirement, and comes in 12 different fragrances, like Watermelon, Beach Coco, Aloe Vera and Mint. Each variety contains aloe vera and lemon essential oil to soothe the skin, as well as radish root ferment to boost antimicrobial protection, according to the brand.
Perhaps one of the most well known hand sanitizers ,Purell contains 70% ethyl alcohol. The gel hand sanitizer is paraben-, aluminum- and dye-free, according to the brand. It’s available in large sizes to keep around the house, as well as in travel-size bottles to take with you on the go.
This gel hand sanitizer comes in three scents — Orange Neroli, White Tea and Grapefruit Cassis — in either 2- or 8-ounce sizes. According to the brand, it contains 70% ethyl alcohol and is made with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, prickly pear seed oil and glycerin, without parabens or phthalates.
These hemp seed extract-infused hand sanitizers contain 70% alcohol and are available in gel and spray formulas. They come in two sizes — 1.7 ounces and 10 ounces – so you can pick what is most convenient for you.
Mega Babe Squeaky Clean Hand Sanitizer is made with 62% ethyl alcohol to help kill bacteria. It’s free of problematic ingredients like synthetic fragrance, parabens, phthalates and sulfates, the brand says — instead, there are hydrating ingredients in it like aloe vera, marula and sweet almond oils, which Mega Babe says can help you avoid dry, cracked hands. The pocket-size hand sanitizer, which has a light citrus scent, is convenient for when you’re on the go. If you prefer a larger size, consider the 16-ounce bottle of Squeaky Clean hand sanitizer with a pump to keep by your work-from-home desk for quick access.
Select editor Morgan Greenwald said she doesn’t leave the house without her travel-size Dove Hand Sanitizer. “It feels almost like a lotion and doesn’t have an overpowering alcohol smell like some of the others,” she said. Dove’s hand sanitizer contains 61% ethyl alcohol as well as the brand’s Moisture Renewal Blend, which it says works with your skin to produce ceramides and provide lasting moisture. The sanitizer, which comes in different scents, is also available in a larger 8-ounce container.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-thermometers-ncna1237174,Which type of thermometer is the most accurate?,HEALTH,"If you or someone in your home is feeling sick, one of the most important things to do before figuring out how to treat symptoms is checking your temperature. “Temperature is an important vital sign that health care providers use to determine severity of illness,” said Dr. Cory Fisher, a family medicine provider with the Cleveland Clinic. “The temperature reading and its duration help to determine potential causes for illness and often will dictate triage and treatment plans.” This is why it’s important to keep a thermometer at home. It can quickly read your temperature, which you can report to your healthcare provider, whether you’re visiting them online or in-person.
SKIP AHEAD Best digital thermometers for adults and kids | Which type of thermometer is the most accurate? | What is a fever?| Are thermometers FSA/HSA eligible?
Thermometers come in a variety of styles, from under-the-tongue options to those designed with infrared technology. To help determine which thermometer is the best option for you, we talked to medical experts about how to shop for them and highlighted a handful of products that meet doctors’ guidance. We also included expert tips for taking your temperature at home.
Above all, thermometers should be easy to use and comfortable for those using them, said Dr. Heather Viola, an assistant professor of medicine at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine and a primary care physician at Mount Sinai Doctors Ansonia. Because of that, the exact thermometer you buy has a lot to do with personal preference, but experts said to keep the following in mind while shopping.
Thermometers come in a variety of styles and can measure body temperature in a number of ways, so you should decide which method you’re most comfortable with before shopping. Read more about thermometer types below.
Thermometers with LCD displays make it easy to see a temperature reading. Viola also recommended looking for options with start buttons that are easy to press so you know the device is on and working when you’re using it.
Some thermometers beep when they’re done taking a temperature reading, which can be helpful. It takes a few seconds for a thermometer to deliver a reading, and hearing the beep is a good indication that it’s ready to be viewed and interpreted.
With doctors’ guidance in mind, we rounded up digital thermometers we think you should know about below. Each thermometer has a digital display, making it easy for you to read results, and we highlighted the method each uses to take a temperature and its power source, as well as other features you may be interested in.
Type: Non-contact infrared forehead thermometer
iHealth’s thermometer is designed with an infrared temperature sensor that the brand says can detect body temperature when it’s held 1.18 inches away from your forehead — this means you can take a temperature without having to physically touch someone. The thermometer takes a temperature reading in one second, iHealth says, and shows the reading on its LED display. When your reading is ready to be viewed, the thermometer vibrates to alert you.
Type: Oral, rectal or underarm
Vicks says its thermometer provides a temperature reading in eight seconds. It’s designed with a digital display that changes color based on its reading to help you understand the meaning of the temperature: A green display means no fever, a yellow display means the temperature is slightly elevated and a red display means a fever is present. The thermometer automatically shuts off after use and its memory settings recalls the last temperature taken if you need to compare them. Vicks’ thermometer comes with batteries and a storage case.
Type: Oral, rectal or armpit
While you can use this thermometer on its own, it also connects to a companion app via Bluetooth, allowing you to keep track of temperatures over time, track medication and set medication reminders and more. The brand says the thermometer delivers a reading in eight seconds or less and displays it on its digital screen. The thermometer also beeps when the temperature reading is complete.
Type: Oral, rectal or underarm
Boncare’s thermometer is the simplest and lowest price option on our list, and it covers all your bases. It delivers a reading in about 10 seconds, the brand says, and displays the temperature on its LCD screen. The thermometer beeps when it’s done taking a reading, has an auto shutoff feature and recalls your last reading to compare temperatures over time.
Type: Rectal
FridaBaby designed this thermometer specifically for babies if you’re taking a rectal temperature. It delivers a reading in 10 seconds, according to the brand, and displays temperatures on the LED backlit display. The thermometer’s probe is shorter than those on thermometers that are also for oral or armpit use to ensure you don’t insert it too far. Its memory feature stores up to 10 previous readings and it comes with a case for storage.
Type: Ear
To help you place Braun’s thermometer in one’s ear, its screen flashes and it emits a beep when it's properly positioned. The thermometer delivers a reading in seconds, the brand says, and you can input the age of the person whose temperature you’re taking. The device’s screen then changes color after a reading based on the age you set to aid your interpretation of the temperature. Braun says the ear probe is pre-warmed for comfort and can be used with disposable lens covers. The thermometer comes with lens covers, a case and batteries.
Type: Forehead or ear
This option can act as a forehead or ear thermometer — it has a built-in infrared sensor you can insert into the ear and comes with a cap you can place on top of the sensor to get a reading from the forehead. The brand says the thermometer delivers a reading in one to three seconds and can recall 20 past temperatures. The thermometer also beeps and displays a red light on its screen when it detects a fever. It comes with a storage pouch and batteries.
Below, we broke down some of the most common types of thermometers and how each takes a temperature to help you understand the accuracy of readings. We also explained the pros and cons of each one.
Digital thermometers use heat sensors to determine body temperature. They can be used to take a temperature in the mouth, rectum or armpit. Each method of taking a temperature with a digital thermometer can impact accuracy.
Oral: Digital thermometers that take an oral temperature reading have a probe that’s placed under the tongue. Viola said taking an oral temperature is the most accurate way to take the temperature of adults and children 4 years old and above. However, keep in mind that in order to capture an accurate reading, you have to leave the probe under your tongue long enough — the thermometer usually beeps when it’s done taking your temperature. If kids can’t keep the thermometer under their tongue for the full duration of the reading, Viola recommends using another option.
Rectal: Digital thermometers that take a rectal temperaturereadinghave a probe that’s placed inside the rectum, and it’s recommended for infants and children under 3 years old, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Axillary or armpit: Some digital thermometers can be placed under the armpit to measure body temperature. However, Viola told us this method is not as accurate as oral or rectal readings, so it’s best to use it as a quick first check, and you can follow up with an oral or rectal reading if the armpit temperature is above 99 degrees Fahrenheit.
Digital ear thermometers — formally called infrared tympanic thermometers — measure the temperature inside the ear canal using infrared technology, Viola explained. They’re particularly convenient for older babies and children since they usually get you a result in one to three seconds, which is often quicker than oral thermometers. But Viola said ear thermometers can be difficult to position, are usually the most costly option and can give you a cooler reading if the probe tip is cold.
Temporal or forehead thermometers use infrared technology to measure your temperature through the temporal artery on the forehead. Some forehead thermometers are placed directly on the forehead, while non-contact infrared thermometers use infrared technology to measure one’s surface temperature. Both types are generally less reliable and more costly compared to other thermometer options, specifically digital thermometers, Viola said. They can be especially challenging to use with restless children since they have to sit still while the thermometer is getting a reading.
You should always clean thermometers before and after use, experts told us. Viola recommended using rubbing alcohol or soap and water to clean thermometers and storing them in a dry place that is not exposed to drastic changes in temperatures. If you’re using one thermometer as a rectal thermometer, she suggested cleaning it thoroughly and labeling it for that use only.
A temperature over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is considered a fever, Fisher said. And an elevated temperature is a normal part of the immune response — if you have a cold, flu, Covid or other infection, a fever “is likely just a reflection of the immune system doing what it’s built to do: fight off infections,” he explained. But if you have a very high fever (over 104 degrees Fahrenheit) or a prolonged fever (over 4-5 days), Fisher recommends calling your healthcare provider. Additionally, a fever in a newborn baby under 28 days old should always prompt you to call your doctor, he said.
Yes. According to the FSA eligibility list, thermometers are eligible for reimbursement with a flexible spending account (FSA) and health reimbursement account (HRA). However, they’re not eligible with a limited-purpose flexible spending account (LPFSA) or a dependent care flexible spending account (DCFSA).
At Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience. We also take steps to ensure that all expert advice and recommendations are made independently and with no undisclosed financial conflicts of interest.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-disinfectants-spray-wipes-ncna1299266,Spring cleaning 101: How to properly use disinfectants,HEALTH,"For the most part, scrubbing with soap and water or using an all-purpose spray is enough to clean your home. But some jobs call for stronger products, like getting rid of germs after someone is sick. In that case, you’ll need a disinfectant, which kills viruses, fungi and bacteria on surfaces so they don’t continue to spread, says Brian Boyle, co-owner of MaidThis Cleaning in Utah.
Using disinfectants isn’t complicated, but they’re more powerful than standard cleaners, so they require more attention to detail. For example, disinfectants are only effective if you use them exactly as specified by their directions, and you may have to wear protective gear like gloves or a face mask while handling them.
To help you learn how to disinfect your home and the best disinfectants to use throughout the process,  I spoke to health and cleaning experts. They also shared when you actually need to use a disinfectant, which may be less often than you think.

Disinfectants kill viruses, fungi and bacteria on surfaces by destroying or inactivating them, says Heather Day, a principal scientist at Clorox. (Ed’s note: The inclusion of products sold by Clorox in this article were made independently of Day.) Some of the most common disinfecting ingredients are bleach, quaternary ammonium and isopropyl alcohol, which brands incorporate into sprays, wipes, mists and liquid solutions.
Disinfectants are pesticides, meaning substances that kill, repel or control pests like viruses, bacteria and fungi. Thus, the Environmental Protection Agency regulates disinfectants to make sure they meet certain safety and efficacy standards before people use them in their homes, businesses and medical facilities. The EPA keeps running lists of registered disinfectants on its website, noting which microorganisms each one has proven to be effective against, what type of surface it’s meant to be used on and contact time, meaning how long the chemicals need to sit on a surface before you wipe them away (more on this below). All disinfectants have an EPA registration number, which helps you look it up on the agency’s website. The EPA registration number is a two or three part number separated by dashes that’s usually on the back of the product.
Here are the factors experts recommend keeping in mind when shopping for disinfectants. You can find all of this information on disinfectants’ labels.
All of the disinfectants I recommend below are EPA-registered and kill 99.9% of viruses and bacteria, according to the brands. I include the surface type you can use each one on, its active ingredients and its required contact time for disinfecting.
Remember that some products are EPA-registered as sanitizers and disinfectants, so you may see both terms on products’ labels (more on that below). In these cases, brands list separate instructions for sanitizing and disinfecting on their packaging, so read carefully. Many sanitizers and disinfectants are also made with cleaning agents, so don’t be surprised if you see a label saying a product can clean, sanitize and disinfect — it can, depending on how you use it.
These disposable wipes are soaked in a bleach-free disinfecting solution, so you can take one out of the dispenser and immediately start using it on surfaces around your home, like finished wood, sealed granite and stainless steel. The wipes come in deodorizing lemon and fresh scents. There’s three canisters of 75 wipes in this set.
Active ingredients: quaternary ammonium | Surface types: hard nonporous | Contact time: 4 mins.
When you push down on the spray bottle’s trigger, Lysol’s disinfectant comes out as a continuous mist, so it’s useful for quickly covering large areas, like kitchen counters, sinks and toilets. It has a crisp linen scent and also acts as a deodorizer.
Active ingredients: quaternary ammonium, ethyl alcohol | Surface types: hard nonporous | Contact time: 3 mins.
You get one spray head and four bottles of disinfectant with this pack, so you don’t have to worry about running out of it. The solution has a lemongrass citrus scent made from essential oils and botanical ingredients, which helps deodorize areas in your home. The product’s packaging is also made from recycled materials.
Active ingredients: thymol | Surface types: hard nonporous | Contact time: 10 mins.
While you can use this disinfecting spray on most hard surfaces around your home, it’s specifically designed to get rid of germs on glass without leaving streaks or residue behind. The spray has a citrus scent. It comes in a pack with three bottles of solution and one reusable trigger cap.
Active ingredients: L-Lactic acid | Surface types: hard nonporous | Contact time: 10 mins.
CleanSmart’s disinfectant spray is fragrance-free, so you don’t have to worry about potential irritation if you or someone you live with tends to be sensitive to scents. It comes in a pack with three bottles.
Active ingredients: hypochlorous acid | Surface types: hard nonporous | Contact time: 10 mins.
Microban’s disinfectant spray comes out as a mist and has a citrus scent, so it also works as a deodorizer. You get four bottles in this set.
Active ingredients: quaternary ammonium | Surface types: hard nonporous | Contact time: 5 mins.
When using a disinfectant, it’s crucial to follow the exact directions specified on a product’s label. If you don’t, the disinfectant isn’t guaranteed to work as it’s designed to. Generally speaking, however, there’s two important steps to keep in mind while using any disinfectant. Experts say most people skip or don’t know about both of them, which can potentially reduce efficacy.
In order to properly disinfect, it’s best practice to remove visible dirt and debris first by using an all-purpose cleaner or soap and water, says B. Boyle. If too much grime covers a surface, it can be hard for the disinfectant to reach and kill germs, so cleaning essentially clears the path for the chemicals to effectively do their job.
After you apply a disinfectant to a surface, it needs to sit before you wipe it away — this is called contact time. “Most people use a disinfectant and then immediately wipe down surfaces. But you need to have some contact time for it to be effective and work properly, which is the biggest unknown out there about disinfectants,” says Bill Wuest, a chemistry professor at Emory University. “The chemicals in disinfectants need time to do what they need to do to disengage the bacteria and viruses.” The directions printed on a product’s label list its exact contact time, and the surface you’re disinfecting should stay wet during the entire contact time to make sure germs are killed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The CDC has a detailed list of safety tips to keep in mind while using disinfectants on its website, but here are the basics.
“A lot of times, people think they need to use everything but the kitchen sink to clean,” says Wuest. “But it’s important to be cognizant that there are different levels to cleaning, so you don’t need to use a full-fledged arsenal of cleaning agents all the time.” That said, knowing the difference between cleaners, sanitizers and disinfectants can help you decide what’s right for the job at hand. Here’s how experts break it down.
The EPA only registers cleaning products if they sanitize or disinfect. Sanitizers and disinfectants have to meet their own respective testing requirements and clear a certain bar for effectiveness set by the EPA. Cleaning products that simply remove dirt from a surface, water or air are not regulated by the agency.
Disinfectants are harsh chemicals, so it’s important to only use them when absolutely necessary. It’s best to disinfect surfaces when someone in your home is sick, or if someone is at a higher risk of getting sick due to a weakened immune system, says Nachman.
If you need to disinfect your home, focus on high-touch and high-traffic areas that you or those you live with use constantly, says Day. For example, prioritize doorknobs, cabinet knobs, handles, light switches, sinks, drains , kitchen and bathroom countertops, toilets and bathroom fixtures.
Long story short, no, you cannot and should not make your own disinfectants. You might see DIY recipes online that use ingredients like white vinegar and hydrogen peroxide, as well as botanicals like thyme, lemon and tea tree oil. But since these “disinfectants” are not registered with the EPA, you have no way of knowing whether they’re actually effective, says Day.
That said, if you want to avoid using hard chemicals, the good news is that you don’t need to disinfect very often, says J. Boyle. And if you’re concerned about the environmental impact of disinfectants, prioritize buying those with the EPA’s Design for the Environment certification.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-hand-soap-rcna120681,What experts want you to know about hand soap,HEALTH,"Finding a soap you love can make washing your hands for the CDC-recommended 20 seconds at a time, a more pleasant experience. After all, we wash our hands constantly throughout the day to stay healthy —especially during cold and flu season. When scrubbing, experts recommend lathering soap from your wrists to your fingertips and rinsing with warm water to send germs down the drain after you use the bathroom, before you prepare food and more.
Below, we spoke to medical experts about how to shop for hand soap; they share their best hand washing practices as well. We also rounded up our favorite hand soaps with various scents and price ranges.
SKIP AHEAD Best hand soaps
While shopping for hand soap, experts recommend keeping the following factors in mind:
To recommend the best hand soaps, we rounded up highly rated options Select staff use and love that align with expert shopping guidance.
Blueland’s hand soap start set, which comes with a refillable glass soap dispenser and four solid soap tablets, originally introduced me to the AAPI-owned business. To make the foaming soap, you add a tablet to the dispenser and fill it up with water — after the tablet dissolves, the soap is ready to use. Once you own the eco-friendly brand’s dispenser, you can purchase soap tablet refills as needed or set up a subscription through the brand’s website. Soap is available in a variety of scents like Evergreen, Lavender Eucalyptus and Perrine Lemon, and Blueland often releases limited-edition scents, too.
Consistency: Foam | Smell: Fragrance-free and scented | Use: Refillable
Dove’s original bar soap has a gentle formula that’s free from many ingredients people are often sensitive to, like fragrance, says Campbell. It’s made with moisturizing cream to hydrate and soften skin, plus you can use it on your hands, face or body, according to the brand.
Consistency: Solid | Smell: Fragrance-free | Use: Single use
This aloe-scented hand soap is one of my favorite budget buys — one container is about $3. You can purchase large bottles of soap to refill the original dispenser, and refill bottles are recyclable once they’re empty. The refill bottles come with a foldable mini funnel, plus, in my experience, the formula itself moisturizes your skin as you wash them, making them feel soft especially in the winter.
Consistency: Gel | Smell: Scented | Use: Refillable
Select managing editor Leah Ginsberg says Method’s Gel Hand Soap in the Sweet Water scent, which smells like a blend of grapefruit and lemon, is her favorite option to put in bathrooms. The bottle is made from recycled plastic and you can purchase tubs of soap to refill the original bottle.
Consistency: Gel | Smell: Scented | Use: Refillable
When guests use Safely’s Hand Soap at my apartment, they often comment on how much they enjoy the scent, which is a blend of orange, violet, jasmine and geranium with notes of lemon and sandalwood. The soap is also available in other scents, like Bloom, Bright, Calm and Fresh. It has a rich, gel consistency that lathers well but isn’t sudsy, and I only need a small drop to cover my hands. You can purchase pouches of soap to refill the original bottle.
Consistency: Gel | Smell: Scented | Use: Refillable
“Since I’m constantly traveling and around kids, I wash my hands a lot,” says Bianca Alvarez, NBC Select associate reporter. “This Malin + Goetz soap never leaves my hands feeling dry, which tends to happen with other soaps when I wash frequently.” It’s made with glycerin to moisturize skin, according to the brand, and like many other options on this list, you can purchase a jug of soap to refill the original dispenser once it’s empty. Alvarez describes the soap’s rum scent as sweet yet spicy.
Consistency: Gel | Smell: Scented | Use: Refillable
Grove Co’s hand soap comes in recyclable aluminum containers, and I use it to fill up glass or ceramic soap dispensers around my home. The soap is formulated with aloe vera, an ingredient that soothes and softens skin, according to the brand. You can purchase soap scented with essential oils and plant extracts, including options like lemon and eucalyptus, lavender blossom and thyme, and orange and rosemary. Grove Co. also offers an unscented hand soap.
Consistency: Gel | Smell: Unscented and scented | Use: Refillable
Thanks to its scent, Shari Uyehara, NBC Select’s manager of editorial operations, says using this hand soap feels like  a relaxing aromatherapy experience. Its blend of mandarin, rosemary and cedar matches the brand’s hand cream, which Uyehara also owns and  applies post-wash. You can purchase bottles of soap to refill the original dispenser.
Consistency: Gel | Smell: Scented | Use: Refillable
I also use Clean Cult’s hand soap to refill my dispensers. It comes in recyclable paper cartons, as compared to your standard plastic or glass bottle, and is made with aloe as well as essential oils. You can purchase the soap in scents like Sea Minerals, Lemon Verbena and Wild Lavender. It’s safe for those with both oily and sensitive skin, according to the brand.
Consistency: Gel | Smell: Scented | Use: Refillable
Many Select staffers recommend Mrs. Meyer’s soap, including Uyehara and Lindsay Schneider, NBC Select editor. The brand’s foaming hand soap starter kit includes a refillable glass dispenser and two bottles of soap concentrate. You pour the concentrate into the dispenser and fill the rest up with water to dilute the formula, which is made with olive oil to moisturize along with aloe and essential oils. You can purchase hand soap concentrate refills in Rain Water and Lavender scents.
Consistency: Foam | Smell: Scented | Use: Refillable

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-eco-friendly-laundry-detergents-ncna1298853,The best eco-friendly laundry detergents,HEALTH,"As with most eco-friendly cleaning supplies, determining which laundry detergents are better for you and the environment is easier said than done. Though some companies promote their cleaning products as eco-friendly, “green” or natural, there are no specific criteria detailing what these designations mean.
SKIP AHEAD Best eco-friendly laundry detergents | How to shop for eco-friendly laundry detergent | Why trust NBC Select?
Learning what to look for and what to avoid when shopping for eco-friendly laundry detergent can help you choose the best product for your needs. With that in mind, I talked to experts about how to shop for the best eco-friendly laundry detergent for your household and rounded up a handful of options that meet their guidance.
To highlight the best eco-friendly laundry detergents, I spoke with cleaning and laundry experts. Here’s what they recommend keeping in mind:
Ecolabels: Ecolabels are icons on product packaging that help shoppers identify which products meet “specific environmental performance criteria and are therefore deemed ‘environmentally preferable,’” according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Ecolabels are usually run by third-party governmental or advocacy groups — the top to prioritize when shopping are EPA’s Safer Choice Standard and the Environmental Working Group’s (EWG) Verified mark, according to our experts.
Type: Laundry detergent is available as a liquid, powder or in pods. Weigh the pros and cons of each before choosing one.
Scent: Some people prefer scented laundry detergent so their clothing and linens have a fragrance once they’re clean. Others, however, opt for unscented options. Note that the EPA distinguishes between fragrance-free and unscented.
With expert guidance in mind, this list includes eco-friendly laundry detergents that meet the EPA’s Safer Choice Standard, earned the EWG Verified mark or both. We also highlight products across scent and laundry detergent types to give you an overview of your options. All the laundry detergents below are either direct recommendations from our experts, NBC Select staff or have at least a 4-star average rating from 500 reviews or more. They’re also all HE-safe, meaning they’re compatible with high-efficiency washing machines.
I’ve used Dropps laundry pods for years. They thoroughly clean my clothing, linens and pet beds, and I was impressed by how well they remove odor from sweaty activewear. Each pod contains 9 grams of laundry detergent and is designed to be added directly into your washing machine. You can purchase the pods as needed, or you can subscribe and have them delivered every one to six months at a discounted price. The pods come in a recyclable box.
Ecolabel: EPA Safer Choice Standard | Size: sold as sets of of 64, 128 or 192 pods | Scent: unscented
This liquid laundry detergent from Tide is made from 75% plant-based materials including coconut oil, soy and corn. The container (which has a measuring cap) is made from recycled plastic and can be recycled after use, according to Tide.
Ecolabel: EPA Safer Choice Standard | Size: 46 or 69 fluid ounces | Scent: fragrance-free
Seventh Generation’s laundry packs are filled with detergent and come in a recyclable plastic pouch. You can drop the packs directly into your laundry machine — the brand recommends using two packs for large loads or heavily soiled items. The laundry packs are made from 94% plant-based ingredients, according to Seventh Generation.
Ecolabel: EPA Safer Choice Standard | Size: sold as sets of 45 or 75 detergent packs | Scent: fragrance-free
9 Elements’ laundry detergent is formulated with vinegar to help get rid of residues and odors on your clothes. The liquid detergent gets its eucalyptus scent from essential oils, and it comes in a recyclable plastic bottle with a cap that doubles as a measuring cup.
Ecolabel: EPA Safer Choice Standard | Size: 46, 65 or 92 fluid ounces | Scent: eucalyptus
Blueland’s laundry detergent comes in what the brand calls “dry-form tablets” — they’re similar to laundry detergent pods but don’t have a lining around them. The Laundry Starter Set comes with 60 laundry tablets and a steel Forever Tin, which you can use to store the tablets. You can order additional detergent tablets separately, or subscribe to get refill tablets at a discounted price. The refill tablets come in a compostable paper pouch.
Ecolabel: EWG Verified | Size: sold as sets of 60, 120 or 240 tablets | Scent: fragrance-free

Dirty Labs’ laundry detergent comes with a cap that’s labeled with lines to help you measure how much liquid you’ll need. The bottle, cap and spout are all recyclable.
Ecolabel: EPA Safer Choice Standard and EWG Verified | Size: 8.6 or 20 fluid ounces | Scent: fragrance-free
Attitude’s liquid laundry detergent gets its scent from plant-based ingredients and comes in recyclable plastic bottles. Instead of tossing a bottle when you use up what’s inside, you can reuse it and purchase detergent refills as needed, or subscribe to get them at a discounted price.
Ecolabel: EWG Verified | Size: 35.5, 67.6 or 135.3 fluid ounces | Scent: wildflower
This powder laundry detergent from Charlie’s Soap can be added directly into your washing machine. It comes with measurement instructions on the back of the package so you know how much to use. The detergent’s pouch is recyclable after use, and you can purchase the detergent as needed or subscribe to get it at a discounted price.
Ecolabel: EPA Safer Choice Standard | Size: 1.3 , 2.64 or 8 pounds | Scent: fragrance-free
AspenClean’s laundry pods are formulated with essential oils that give them their scents. The pods — which you can add directly to your washing machine — come in a recycled paper package that’s compostable. You can purchase pods as needed or subscribe and save to get the detergent at a discounted price.
Ecolabel: EWG Verified | Size: sold as sets of 36 pods | Scent: eucalyptus
Defunkify’s liquid laundry detergent is composed of 87% bio-based ingredients. It’s sold as a pack of two bottles, which are made from recycled plastic packaging. The detergent gets its fragrance from essential oils.
Ecolabel: EPA Safer Choice Standard | Size: 37.7 fluid ounces | Scent: lavender
Laundry detergents that advertise whitening or brightening capabilities often contain harmful chemicals, according to our experts, so they recommended adding an eco-friendly laundry booster to your load instead. Boosters can help make the detergent more effective, especially if you’re cleaning items that are stained or have an odor, like workout clothes. Branch Basics’ Oxygen Boost is free from bleach, ammonia, dyes and fragrances. It comes with a reusable plastic scoop. You can use the Oxygen Boost to clean clothes the traditional way using a front-load or top-load washing machine, or you can use it to “strip” your laundry, which requires soaking them overnight in water mixed with the solution.
Ecolabel: EWG Verified | Size: 4 pounds | Scent: unscented

Grove Collaborative’s detergent is designed to be poured into the brand’s reusable detergent dispenser to help you measure out how much liquid you’ll need. In addition to buying pouches of detergent as needed, you can subscribe to get the detergent at a discounted price. To recycle the detergent’s packaging, you can email the brand and get a prepaid return label (more details on the product page).

Shopping for eco-friendly laundry detergent involves many of the same considerations you’ll want to make when purchasing any type of laundry detergent. Experts say to think about whether you hand-wash or machine-wash laundry, and what type of washing machine you use. They also recommend considering what temperature you typically wash your laundry in and what type of material you’re cleaning. For eco-friendly laundry detergent specifically, there are a few additional considerations.
“You don’t need to be a chemist or scientist to become your own product advocate,” says Marilee Nelson, consumer chemical expert and co-founder of Branch Basics. Let ecolabels do the work for you. Ecolabels are the best way to ensure that a product is actually designed to be safe for the environment to some degree, as well as better for human health. A product earns an ecolabel after a third party — like a government agency, nonprofit or other private group — evaluaes that item and comes to its own conclusions about its eco-friendly claims based on criteria it sets.
Though any ecolabel is a good option, experts primarily recommend looking for the following two when shopping for eco-friendly laundry detergent. Both evaluate products' ingredients against what our experts called strict standards and require products to disclose ingredients to consumers, a practice that’s not required by law nationwide.
The EPA’s Safer Choice Standard, which covers all-purpose cleaners. The EPA says it conducts annual audits once a product meets the Safer Choice Standard to verify that standards are being upheld over time.
The EWG’s Verified mark, which is run by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit activist organization that evaluates products and assigns hazard ratings for a variety of cleaners and ingredients, plus rates cleaning products according to its own standards. Makers of products with the EWG Verified mark agree that the organization can randomly test products to ensure they continuously meet its criteria.
These are not the only two eco-labels you’ll see when shopping, however. You may also come across laundry detergents with ecolabel certifications like Green Seal, Ecologo and Cradle to Cradle. Retailers like Amazon and Target have also developed their own standards and partnered with ecolabels to highlight eco-friendly products they sell. For example, you can browse laundry detergents that meet Amazon’s Climate Pledge or Target’s Clean standard online.
So how do you decide which ecolabel to pay attention to? It’s a matter of personal preference, experts told us. Different ecolabels evaluate products according to different criteria, so experts recommended finding one that aligns with what’s important to you and then using that ecolabel’s database to browse products that meet its marks.
The primary ingredients in most laundry detergents — standard, eco-friendly or otherwise — are enzymes, which break down stains, and surfactants, which lift dirt and grime away from clothing, experts told us.  “Look for formulas that utilize natural or bio-based ingredients such as plant enzymes, essential oils, or natural origin fragrances,” says Carlyanne Brown, a Customer Happiness Team Lead at Grove Collaborative. “I recommend avoiding anything that uses harsh chemicals such as synthetic fragrance, phthalates, sulfates and parabens.”
It’s also important to keep in mind that the EPA distinguishes between fragrance-free and unscented. If a product says it’s fragrance-free, it means that it does not contain any fragrance material or masking scents, while unscented, “generally means that the product may contain chemicals that neutralize or mask the odors of other ingredients.”
If your detergent comes in a paper, plastic or tin container, check to see if it can be recycled or is made from recycled (or compostable) materials — better yet, seek out a recyclable and fillable container. When it comes to laundry pods, pay attention to what the pod itself is made from — they usually contain a polyvinyl material (a type of plastic) that’s not very eco-friendly, though some brands make pods from plant-derived ingredients. “First and foremost, your eco-friendly detergent should be plastic-free,” says Sarah Paiji Yoo, the co-founder and CEO of Blueland. “That immediately rules out pods, which are wrapped in nonbiodegradable PVA that eventually becomes detrimental microplastic pollution.”

An affordable air purifier can help remove dust, smoke and other pollutants — many of our favorites, especially for small spaces, cost under $150.
We’ve been using air purifiers for years, and spoke with filtration experts to better understand what to look for when shopping for one on a budget. Plus our experts explain terms you should know like HEPA, CADR and more.

We spoke with filtration experts to learn more about the technical aspects of air purifiers. We combined their advice with our experience using air purifiers to select products using the following criteria:
Many of our recommendations are NBC Select staff favorites we have used in our homes for years. Others are top-rated options with unique specs or features. Below each recommendation we share specifications we think you should know like recommended room size, CADR, sound rating and more.
NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio uses this air purifier in her bedroom — it keeps the room clean of dust and debris, and is barely audible throughout the day and night. Its compact, circular design is easy to place anywhere in your space, in our experience. The screen on top has lights that can be turned off, a nice feature for bedrooms.
This model does not have smart connectivity — consider the slightly-pricier Levoit Core 300s if that is a must-have for you.
Recommended room size: 219 sq. ft. | Decibels: 24 — 50 dB(A) | CADR (CFM): smoke: 141, dust: 140, pollen: 145 | Filter lifespan: ~6 to 8 months | Smart connectivity: no | Speeds: 3 | Weight: 7.5 lbs | AHAM verified: yes
Multiple NBC Select team members use and love air purifiers from Blueair — I have used the larger 311i Max in my home for years. The Pure 511l is small, light and easy to use, with one button on the top that switches between night mode, normal mode and boost mode.
It pulls unfiltered air in all directions and pushes clean air out the top. It has a machine-washable fabric cover that catches large clumps of dust, lint and hair — I’ve thrown similar covers from the brand in the washing machine with no issues.
Recommended room size (AHAM): 180 sq. ft. | Decibels: 24 — 49 dB(A) | CADR (CFM): smoke: 112, dust: 112, pollen: 112 | Filter lifespan: 6 to 9 months | Smart connectivity: no | Speeds: 3 | Weight: 4.2 lbs | AHAM verified: yes
This air purifier from Winix is the same price as our picks from Blueair and Levoit, but is fit for larger rooms — up to 230 square feet. It also has the highest CADR scores of any purifier on this list.
It has an auto-mode that automatically adjusts the fan speed based on the air quality detected in your space, according to the brand. Like our other top picks, it draws air in all directions and pushes filtered air out of the top, making it easier to place in any room.
Recommended room size (AHAM): 230 sq. ft. | Decibels: undisclosed | CADR (CFM): smoke: 147, dust: 149, pollen: 154 | Filter lifespan: 12 months | Smart connectivity: no | Speeds: 4 | Weight: 6.75 lbs | AHAM verified: yes
This air purifier is a little larger and boxier than our other picks, but has smart features uncommon at this price point. Like our pick from Winix, it has an auto mode that automatically detects the air quality in your room and changes the filter speed accordingly. But the wider, U-shaped design better traps large particles like pet fur, according to the brand.
Unlike all our other picks, you can control this air purifier remotely with your phone using the VeSync app. You can also control it with smart home voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Home.
Recommended room size: 219 sq. ft. | Decibels: 23 — 52 dB(A) | CADR (CFM): smoke: 141, dust: 141, pollen: 141 | Filter lifespan: 6 to 12 months | Smart connectivity: yes | Speeds: 3 | Weight: 7.5 lbs | AHAM verified: yes
It won’t replace a sunrise alarm clock, but this air purifier from Coway may be able to pull double duty as a night light in the right space. It has a built-in light that acts as either an air quality indicator, changing colors depending on the detected air quality, or a warm amber-colored night light. (You can leave the light off too.)
Like many of our other picks, this is a circular air purifier that pulls in air from all directions and pushes clean air out of the top vents. It has a slightly lower CADR than some competitors, though.
Recommended room size: <200 sq. ft. | Decibels: 20 — 48 dB(A) | CADR (CFM): smoke: 108, dust: 124, pollen: 112 | Filter lifespan: 12 months | Smart connectivity: no | Speeds: 3 | Weight: 6.6 lbs | AHAM verified: no
When it comes to air purifiers, there are a few terms that can help you better understand what to look for when shopping.
The Department of Energy defines a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter as one that removes 99.97% of particulates that are 0.3 microns in size.
But there is very little enforcement of HEPA standards, says Michael Corbat, vice president of engineering for Rensa Filtration. Most of the time, you are relying on the manufacturers or third-party laboratories to verify if a filter meets HEPA standards. “For the average consumer, there is simply not enough oversight at this point,” he says.
A small filtration difference — a purifier that filters out 99.94% of particles compared to 99.97% — would likely not make much of a difference in air quality, says Corbat.
CADR (clean air delivery rating) is the best way to determine an air purifier’s performance, says Corbat. CADR is given three numbers: one for tobacco smoke, one for dust and one for pollen. For example, a pollen CADR of 125 means that the air purifier can deliver 125 cubic feet of pollen-free air per minute. (CADR assumes a space with ceilings that are eight feet high). According to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturer (AHAM), your air purifier should have a CADR rating equal to about two-thirds the cubic feet of your room.
Corbat recommends air purifiers with CADRs certified by AHAM, otherwise, you are most likely relying on the manufacturer’s self-reporting. Below each product recommendation, we list whether the product is AHAM certified. You can find the CADR ratings of any AHAM-certified air purifier on the AHAM Verifide website.
It’s important that the air purifier you have is rated for the size of your space, or else it will not effectively clean your air, says Kenneth Mendez, president of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.
An affordable $99 air purifier might not be the best choice for a 1,000 square foot room, for example. Keep the two-thirds CADR rule in mind when choosing an air purifier for your space.

If you wear glasses, you know just how annoying smudges can be. In fact, it can be nearly impossible to focus on whatever you’re looking at. But wearing dirty glasses can be more than just annoying. “First off, dirty lenses can cause eye strain and headaches — not fun,” says Dr. Janice Fan, an optometrist at 414 Eyes in Milwaukee. “Plus, bacteria love to hang out on grimy glasses. Yuck, right? You’re basically inviting germs to party on your face.”
The good news: Keeping your glasses clean is a relatively easy chore. With a little care to not scratch your lenses and the right cleaning tools, you can keep the lenses on your glasses clear and dirt-free. To help you do just that, we asked experts for their top tips on how to clean your glasses.
SKIP AHEAD How to tell if your glasses need cleaning | How to clean your glasses | What to use to clean your glasses | Highly rated glasses cleaners
Not sure when to clean your glasses? This will sound obvious, but clean them when they’re dirty, says Susan Johnson, an optician who owns Lost & Found Vision in Hampshire, Illinois. Glasses can take on varying degrees of dirtiness. Overall, if you notice any smudge or haziness on any part of your lenses, they need a good wipe down. Another tactic: Clean your glasses preventatively. “I recommend giving your glasses a good clean every morning,” says Fan. “It’s a great habit to get into. Then, if they get smudged during the day, a quick clean works wonders.”
Most glasses cases come with a small microfiber cloth. This is a good place to start when wiping down your lenses. Use that cloth to try to gently buff out any smudges. However, more stubborn streaks and dirt may require a more in-depth cleaning. If you find yourself in that situation, Fan suggests following this method:
As mentioned above, soap and water tend to be the best thing you can use to clean your glasses. “Everyone typically has soap and water in their house, making this an easy and affordable way to keep your glasses clean,” says Johnson.
Along with soap and water, several other products are specifically made to clean your lenses. “Personally, I’m a fan of pre-moistened lens wipes for on-the-go cleaning. They’re convenient and safe for most lenses,” says Fan. “Some lens manufacturers — like ZEISS — make their cleaning solutions, which are great too.” Below we’ve listed several highly rated lens cleaners for you to consider.
Other than dish soap and cleansers made specifically for lenses, you should not use other household cleaning products on your lenses — specifically glass cleaner, ammonia, or any non-soft material — which can all damage or scratch the surface of your lenses, says Johnson.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-humidifiers-rcna185328,Allergies acting up? You may need a humidifier.,APPLIANCES,"Those who live in dry or frigid climates know that a little humidity goes a long way for the skin. Humidifiers can help introduce more moisture into your home by emitting water vapor into the air, which helps alleviate dry skin, chapped lips, nosebleeds and other dry-weather conditions.
“Dry skin can have an impaired barrier function, making it more prone to irritation and inflammation — humidifiers help prevent winter dermatitis,” says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Jessie Cheung. More moisture in the air also helps slow down the transmission of microbes in your home — which helps with allergies — and combats irritation of your skin, nasal passages, throat and more due to dry air, according to experts. (But keep in mind, humidifiers require weekly cleaning to avoid build up of mold and bacteria.)
To help you find the best humidifier for your space, I spoke to experts about the benefits of humidifiers, the different types available and what to consider when shopping for one.

All of the humidifiers below are either recommendations from our experts, NBC Select staff favorites, or are top-rated options with at least a 4-star average rating from 500 or more reviews on Amazon.
This cool mist, ultrasonic humidifier is designed to automatically shut off when the device detects it has run out of water. The essential oil tray also lets the machine double as a diffuser to add a pleasant scent throughout your home. Since it humidifies large spaces, you can use it in a bedroom or even the living room. It’s also slim and tall, which means it doesn’t take up too much surface area on a counter or side table. Plus, it has a 4.2-star average rating from 58,468 reviews on Amazon.
Water capacity: 1.6 gallons | Run time: up to 50 hours | Room size: up to 500 sq. ft. | Automatic shutoff: yes
The Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier can temporarily relieve cold symptoms and congestion by pumping out a warm mist into the air, according to the brand.

NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown runs this humidifier year-round in her apartment to combat the dry air that typically affects her skin and hair. “I love that this humidifier has both warm and cool settings so I can use it during summer and winter,” she says. Her favorite feature is the humidifier’s back slot for aromatherapy, which she says releases a subtle yet effective scent after about an hour of use. “I love putting a few drops of lavender essential oil into it before I go to bed,” she says.
Water capacity: 1.2 gallons | Run time: up to 45 hours | Room size: up to 580 sq. ft. | Automatic shutoff: yes
This humidifier’s lightweight design — slightly under 1.5 pounds — makes it ideal for tighter, cozier spaces, according to the brand, such as a small bedroom or home office. The top of the humidifier is also transparent, so you can always see the water level without worrying about it running out abruptly. It includes a nightlight to help create a more soothing sleep environment, according to Pure Enrichment, and a 4.4-star average rating from more than 103,000 reviews on Amazon.
Water capacity: 0.4 gallons | Run time: up to 25 hours | Room size: up to 250 sq. ft. | Automatic shutoff: yes
If you’re looking for a cool-mist humidifier to put in your child’s room, this budget-friendly Vicks model might be a good option.

Water capacity: 1.6 gallons | Run time: up to 50 hours | Room size: up to 753 sq. ft. | Automatic shutoff: yes
If you’re looking for a humidifier to take with you on-the-go, this portable option is about the size and weight of an empty wine bottle. “I’ve had it for years at this point, and it’s a very good budget option,” says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin, who uses it at night during wintertime. Due to its compact water tank, it doesn’t have the capacity to produce vapor all night long, she notes. However, “it’s just enough that the air is not super dry, which is all I need,” she says.
Water capacity: about 0.2 gallons | Run time: under 8 hours | Room size: under 400 sq. ft. | Automatic shutoff: no
This top-fill humidifier from Levoit is a great option for large rooms at a decent price point, according to our experts.

If you’re ready to invest in a more robust option, the Venta LW25 Airwasher can help maintain a 40% to 60% humidity level in your home, according to the brand. The automatic shutoff feature also makes this filter-free model an energy-efficient option. The Venta LW25 has a 4.1-star average rating from over 1,026 reviews at Amazon.
Water capacity: 2 gallons | Run time: up to 10 hours | Room size: up to 430 square feet | Automatic shutoff: yes
A favorite of NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson, the Hey Dewy Facial Humidifier can help hydrate your face throughout the day.

Water capacity: 12.4 oz. | Run time: up to 8 hours | Room size: under 400 sq. ft. | Automatic shutoff: no
This humidifier weighs 2.2 pounds, making it one of the most lightweight options on this list.

This model can heat water up to 131 degrees to produce a warm mist, according to the brand. The Crane humidifier has a 4.2-star average rating from 2,900 reviews on Amazon.
Water capacity: 0.5 gallons | Run time: up to 8 hours | Room size: up to 250 sq. ft. | Automatic shutoff: yes
Cheung says this warm-mist humidifier is especially quiet because it doesn’t have a fan — although users may hear the sound of bubbling water. “There’s also no costly filters to replace, but it’s important to clean the mineral scale from a warm-mist humidifier to keep it running,” she says.
Water capacity: 1 gallon | Run time: up to 24 hours | Room size: up to 270 sq. ft. | Automatic shutoff: yes
Whether you’re looking for your first humidifier or want to upgrade your current model, our experts highlight the different types of humidifiers, along with several features to keep in mind below.
Although there are two main types (warm and cold mist), there are multiple versions of the latter, according to our experts.
Cool-mist humidifiers help reintroduce moisture into your home by pumping a cool mist into the air. These humidifiers can be a bit noisier than warm-mist humidifiers as they typically contain a fan. There are two main types of cool-mist humidifiers: evaporative and ultrasonic.
Evaporative humidifiers create a very fine mist that isn’t always visible to the human eye. Unlike warm-mist humidifiers, these humidifiers have no heating element, so there is no risk of burns, says Cheung. They work by using a fan to blow air through a filter. However, the fans can be noisy, and the filter should be cleaned regularly to prevent bacteria and mold from growing.
Ultrasonic humidifiers use high-frequency sound vibrations outside the human hearing range to expel water droplets into the air as a cool mist. They usually have a small fan to disperse the mist over large areas. “These devices don’t use heat and are quiet, but do require maintenance to keep them free of mold and bacterial overgrowth,” says Cheung, adding that she prefers this type because it doesn’t have a filter that needs to be replaced.
Warm-mist humidifiers — also known as vaporizers — have an internal heater that boils the water before releasing it into the air as steam, creating a warm mist. They’re typically more affordable and quieter than cool-mist humidifiers, and they can slightly warm up the air in the wintertime. Our experts say users should avoid sitting too close to steam vaporizers and avoid putting them in children’s rooms since they can get very hot.
You should clean your humidifier at least once a week if you use it regularly. Otherwise, clean it at least once a month. To clean it, unplug it, pour out any residual water, wipe away any grime with a paper towel and use a sprayable dish soap to coat the inside of the tank. Wipe the tank with a damp paper towel. You can also add equal parts white vinegar and water to the tank, let it sit for about half an hour, pour it out and then rinse with a damp paper towel and let it dry.
Humidifiers help maintain a certain range of humidity or moisture in specific rooms or throughout your entire home. The Environmental Protection Agency recommends maintaining indoor relative humidity between 30% and 60% (below 50%, ideally) to avoid the potential of mold growth. When it comes to comfort, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers says the humidity level in your home should remain below 65%. According to the Mayo Clinic, low humidity can cause dry skin, irritate your nasal passages and throat and make your eyes itchy, while high humidity can make your home feel stuffy and cause condensation on surfaces, prompting the growth of harmful and irritating bacteria and mold.
Other than regulating your home’s humidity and aiding in the above preventative measures, our experts say humidifiers have a variety of other wellness benefits that many find worth the investment.

I’m the updates editor at NBC Select, where I write about a variety of home and kitchen products, including space heaters, washable rugs and laundry stain removers.

What’s almost as important is knowing how to properly clean it. Regularly cleaning your mattress increases its lifespan, ensuring that it (along with good sleep) lasts for years to come. You don’t have to be a professional cleaner to thoroughly sanitize and deodorize your mattress — you just have to use the appropriate products and follow appropriate guidance.
I spoke with professionals from popular home care companies who are well-versed in cleaning different types of mattresses, including memory foam, latex and innerspring varieties. I also rounded up the best products and ingredients for thorough mattress cleaning based on their guidance.
SKIP AHEAD: How I picked the best products for cleaning a mattress | The best products for deep cleaning a mattress | How to clean a non-memory foam mattress | How to clean a memory foam mattress | Why trust NBC Select?
I spoke with two experts including the owner of a cleaning business with 15 years of experience and a home improvement specialist with over six years of experience in home services, about how best to go about cleaning a mattress. They recommended keeping the following in mind when shopping.
A post shared by NBC Select (@nbcselect)
I consulted various cleaning experts to get their advice on how to sanitize and deodorize a stained or dirty mattress. In addition to direct recommendations from these experts, I included products that have at least a four-star average rating or higher from products with at least 500 reviews on Amazon or 100 reviews on a brand’s own website.
Both Dulude and Micetich recommend using a small handheld vacuum, like this one, that has an attachment to pick up debris from mattresses. The vacuum cleaner has a UV sanitizing light technology, which kills bacteria and viruses, according to the brand. The vacuum also comes with a pulsating and rotating brush that helps lift and remove hair, pet dander and fur and dust mites, according to the brand. It also has a HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter, which can trap up to 99.97% of microscopic particles such as dust and pollen, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
This stain and odor remover comes recommended by Dulude for addressing stains on mattresses, particularly ones made from pets or bodily fluids. You can spray the product directly to stains on the surface of the mattress, let it sit for about five minutes and use a damp cloth or sponge to blot and scrub the stain as needed, according to the brand. The spray also neutralizes strong odors, according to the brand.
This multipurpose upholstery cleaner from Bissell is an NBC Select Pet Award winner for best pet stain remover. NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio likes it for its versatility and its ability to clean various types of pet stains from carpets and upholstery. “I’ve used Bissell’s Little Green carpet cleaner for years, and I love that I can physically see my furniture getting cleaner and brighter whenever I use it,” she says. “It picks up dirt from my carpet and couch in one smooth motion.” The product has suction capabilities, a self-cleaning hose and a spray tool for crevices and small spaces, which makes it appropriate for cleaning a mattress as well.
If you’re looking to do an especially thorough clean on your mattress, a quality steam cleaner — which blows hot water vapor onto fabric to remove particles and debris — may also be a good option. In fact, Micetich recommends using one to deep clean innerspring, gel or latex mattresses. (Memory foam and memory foam hybrid mattress take longer to dry due to their absorbent properties, so Micetich recommends against using a steamer to clean them). While steam cleaners work curtains and furniture, they also work mattresses, says Micetich. The steam cleaner, which has a 4.5-star average rating on Amazon from more than 20,000 reviews, comes with  a 54-ounce tank for water, a hose, various brushes, washable microfiber pads and an extender.
Micetich and Dulude both recommend using hydrogen peroxide to treat mattress stains. At its core, hydrogen peroxide is a clear chemical that acts as a sterilant, which has the ability to kill microorganisms, according to the EPA. While this particular hydrogen peroxide is safe to use on food, laundry and kitchen surfaces, it’s also fine to use on mattresses, according to the brand. Our experts recommend either using it on its own as a spray on stains or mixing it with baking soda and dish detergent to make your own homemade cleaner. It has a 4.6-star average rating from more than 9,179 reviews on Amazon and comes in a 16-ounce bottle.
In addition to hydrogen peroxide, Dulude recommends using liquid detergent to treat stains and clean your mattress. This particular detergent, which has a 4.5-star average rating from 3.498 reviews on Amazon, is a clear liquid that’s free of harsh perfumes and dyes and is hypoallergenic, according to the brand. Though technically a laundry detergent, you can use a small amount of it to spot clean stains on mattresses, too.
While a mattress protector isn’t technically a cleaning product, it can go a long way in maintaining the cleanliness of your mattress. Our experts emphasize the importance of not simply having a mattress protector, but also making sure to regularly wash it in the laundry. “Mattress protectors really work and they exist for a reason,” says Micetich. “They’re absolutely going to extend the longevity of [your mattress].” This zippered protector has a 4.6-star average rating from more than 100,000 reviews on Amazon and is  machine washable and waterproof and bed bug–proof, according to the brand.
If your main goal is to address bodily stains on your mattress, you can follow the directions above and use hydrogen peroxide in a spray bottle or an enzyme-based stain remover, according to Micetich. “A microfiber cloth works great for this — if the stain is harder to get out and needs more agitation, you can also use a soft bristled brush,” says Micetich. An enzyme-based stain remover is a cleaner that is made from biodegradable plant enzymes, which help to more rapidly break down different types of stains, according to the ACI.

An enzyme-based stain remover is a cleaner that is made from biodegradable plant enzymes, which help to more rapidly break down different types of stains, according to the ACI.
If your priority is getting rid of odors from your mattress, start with baking soda. It’s known for its odor-absorbing properties — I frequently use it to reduce the odors from my trash by sprinkling it lightly over garbage, and it truly makes a noticeable difference. Similarly, you can sprinkle baking soda over the surface of your mattress and let it sit for at least 30 minutes before vacuuming it, according to Dulude. The baking soda will help neutralize the odors coming from the mattress, according to our experts. Additionally, Dulude recommends sprinkling the mattress with baking soda and then rubbing it into the mattress to help lift any stains. You can do this with microfiber cloth or soft-bristle brush.
If you want to take things a step further, you can also mix hydrogen peroxide, liquid detergent, baking soda and a couple drops of lavender essential oil (optional) and use it as a spray to freshen the mattress and leave a more pleasant scent, according to Dulude.
If you often find debris such as pet fur, dust or food crumbs on your mattress, first check to make sure your mattress protector isn’t ripped open somewhere you can’t easily see. Then, consider getting a handheld vacuum cleaner to use on the surface and sides of your mattress. You may even want to get a vacuum that has multiple attachments that can easily pick off all sorts of particles.
You should do a surface-level clean of your mattress, such as vacuuming and sprinkling with baking soda, anywhere from once a month to once every four to six weeks, according to Micetich. Additionally, you should do a deep clean, such as steam cleaning or spraying with stain remover, on your mattress at least twice a year. You can reduce the need for more deep cleans by regularly doing surface-level cleans throughout the year, says Micetich.
In addition to using store bought cleaning products, you can also consider making your own homemade cleaning solution. To do so, Dulude recommends combining 16 ounces of 3% hydrogen peroxide, four tablespoons baking soda, two to four drops of liquid detergent and a couple drops of lavender or eucalyptus oil (if desired). You can add this mixture to a spray bottle to help remove stains on the surface of the mattress.
Using your vacuum to clean up ingredients made of fine powders, like baking soda, could harm your vacuum. “Baking soda particles are typically about 70-90 microns in size  — this means it may clog some filters and vacuum bags, resulting in a loss of suction and cleaning performance,” says Kent Been Lee, associate principal engineer, product performance at Dyson.
People who do use their vacuums to clean ingredients, such as baking soda, should clean the vacuum more often, as vacuuming “does increase the relative volume of fine debris your vacuum cleaner ingests,” says Lauren Seeley, senior brand manager upright vacuums at Bissell.
Additionally, you should always read the instructions on the user's manual for any vacuum that you use to make sure that it’s fine to use on baking soda, according to Miceitch. “If your vacuum is able to clean up fine particles, it’s important to remember not to overuse baking soda when you plan to vacuum it up,” she says. “Too much of anything can always be potentially harmful.” That said, you should use one cup of baking soda and sprinkle it slowly over your mattress, according to Micetich

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/athletes-foot-treatments-rcna148251,How to treat athlete’s foot,SKIN CARE,"“Athlete’s foot, also known as tinea pedis, is a fungal infection that affects the skin of the feet,” explains Dr. Mohammad Rimawi, a board-certified podiatrist in New York City. Left untreated, athlete’s foot can get uncomfortable (read: itchy and uncomfortable). But to treat it, you must understand exactly what it is and how to figure out if you have it.
Below, podiatrists explain exactly what athlete’s foot, the most common symptoms and how to treat it (with over-the-counter treatments or otherwise).
SKIP AHEAD What is athlete’s foot? | How do you treat athlete’s foot? | How we picked the best over-the-counter athlete’s foot treatments | Treatments for athlete’s foot | Are some people more prone to athlete’s foot?
Simply put, athlete’s foot is an infection. “It is caused by fungus — something that thrives in warm, moist environments,” says Rimawi. Now, think about your shoes: They can get warm and swampy. Fungus thrives in environments that are warm and moist. You can also pick up the type of fungus that causes athlete’s foot through exposure. “Common ways people get athlete’s foot include walking barefoot at public places like the pool or gym, poor hygiene and tight-fitting socks which allow moisture to accumulate on the skin,” says Rimawi. Another thing to know: Though athlete’s foot sounds singular, you can get it on both feet simultaneously
It’s not too difficult to tell if you have athlete’s foot — the symptoms are usually quite obvious. “Signs of athlete’s foot include scaling, dryness, blistering, redness, burning or stinging,” says Dr. Bruce Pinker, a board-certified podiatrist and foot surgeon in New York. It often occurs on the bottom of the foot, especially on heels or between the toes. Some people may only experience a few of these things, while others may experience all the symptoms simultaneously. It’s also not unusual for symptoms to start fairly mild and then get worse as time goes on.
Ready for some good news? “Luckily, treatments for athlete’s foot have a high success rate,” says Rimawi. “The first thing you want to do is eliminate the causative factors.” That means you should stop walking barefoot in public places like the gym shower or at the airport. If your feet sweat a lot, change your socks and shoes often. Beyond this, you’ll likely also need some sort of medication. Over-the-counter, topical creams work very well in most cases, adds Rimawi. If you have a bad case of athlete’s foot, you may need a doctor to prescribe you oral medication.
Over-the-counter creams are a go-to for athlete’s foot, which makes it easy to treat this condition if you get it. Below, experts share what you should pay attention to when shopping for an over-the-counter treatment for athlete’s foot:
Below, we rounded up over-the-counter treatments for athlete’s foot that either were recommended by an expert or that meet the criteria our experts set forth and have a high rating.
Pinker says he has found this cream effective for many people with athlete’s foot. The active ingredient in this treatment is tolnaftate, which reduces itching and burning while eliminating fungus. Tinactin is available in a cream and a spray.
Another recommendation from Pinker, Lotrimin Ultra, contains the active ingredient butenafine hydrochloride, which alleviates the symptoms of athlete’s foot while also getting rid of the fungus. According to the brand, this cream is greaseless and odorless and won’t stain your socks. This option is a cream that comes in a pen applicator, which means you can rub the pen tip over infected areas without touching the area with your fingers. This can help prevent the spread of the fungus.
This antifungal cream uses another form of hydrochloride (terbinafine hydrochloride) to treat athlete’s foot. Pinker says it is another popular option and should be used twice daily weekly to eliminate athlete’s foot. According to the brand, before applying, wash your feet and then apply a small amount to the infected and surrounding areas.
The spray, which has a 4.5-star average rating from over 3,110 reviews on Amazon, feels cooling as it goes on. This can relieve the burning and itchy sensation caused by athlete’s foot. The active ingredient is tolnaftate, and the spray makes it easy to apply. According to the brand, not only does this spray treat athlete’s food, but you can also use it preventatively.
Rimawi recommends clotrimazole as a great over-the-counter option to treat athlete’s foot and this cream has a 4.4-star average rating from over 1,900 reviews on Amazon. The cream can also be used to treat jock itch and ringworm. Apply this cream twice a day to the infected area for a week.
Anyone can get athlete’s foot, but some people are more prone to it. Take, for example, athletes. It got its name because athletes are more likely to get sweaty feet in their sneakers and are more prone to walking barefoot in a locker room — two things that can lead to this condition.
Beyond athletes, anyone exposed to conditions that lead to warm, moist feet is more likely to deal with athlete’s foot. “People with weakened immune systems may also be more prone to it,” says Rimawi. “Fungi are opportunistic organisms that take advantage of you at your weakest.” Pinker says that those who suffer from hyperhidrosis—meaning they sweat excessively—are also more likely to encounter athlete’s foot. If you tend to sweat, changing your shoes and socks regularly can help.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-natural-deodorants-ncna1298279,Does natural deodorant actually work?,HEALTH,"Natural deodorants don’t have the best reputation for reducing odor. In fact, they don’t actually prevent you from sweating, allowing odor-causing bacteria to thrive. Experts told me, however, that natural deodorants have come a long way in their effectiveness and certainly have exploded in popularity with brands like Native, Schmidt’s, Necessaire and Kosas launching their own versions of the product.
SKIP AHEAD What is natural deodorant? | How I picked the best natural deodorants | Best natural deodorants to try in 2025
The term “natural” isn’t regulated by the FDA so any brand can give its deodorant that label for marketing purposes, according to the dermatologists we spoke to. A common marker of natural deodorants, however, is the absence of aluminum-based compounds, which are the active ingredient in antiperspirants that work to temporarily “plug” the sweat ducts in your armpits and stop sweat from flowing onto your skin, according to The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.
But are all-natural, aluminum-free deodorants actually safer than antiperspirants, and are they actually effective at minimizing body odor? I consulted dermatologists about how well natural deodorants work and what you should consider before purchasing them.
Natural or aluminum-free deodorants contain plant-based ingredients and natural fragrances like botanical extract and essential oils to mask the smell of body odor. They’ll usually also include ingredients like baking soda, arrowroot, cornstarch and vegetable-derived glycerin to help absorb some moisture, according to the dermatologists I consulted.
Conventional deodorants, on the other hand, will usually contain synthetic ingredients like parabens, a type of preservative, and propylene glycol, a liquid substance that prevents products from becoming dry and cracked but often causes allergic reactions, according to Dr. Ronda Farah, a board-certified dermatologist at the University of Minnesota Medical School and M Health Fairview. They may also contain a low level of aluminum to prevent excessive sweating (compared to a higher level of aluminum in antiperspirants).
“A lot of [natural deodorants] also have coconut oil, which has some natural antibacterial properties, as well as shea butter, which is going to make the formula thicker and allow the deodorant to create a film over the armpit so it’s not secreting as much sweat,” says Dr. Apple Bodemer, a board-certified dermatologist and associate professor of dermatology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. However, she warns that deodorants containing these ingredients “can be tricky” since they may stain fabric.
Since the term “natural” is not regulated by the FDA, each of the deodorants I compiled is highly rated, aluminum-free and contains mostly natural ingredients in line with our experts’ guidance. The dermatologists I consulted recommend considering the following factors when shopping for a natural, aluminum-free deodorant:
Listed below are top-rated and NBC Select staff-favorite natural deodorants that are in line with our experts’ guidance.
Native’s natural deodorant is made from naturally derived ingredients like coconut oil, probiotics, tapioca starch and shea butter. In addition to an unscented option, the deodorant is offered in 17 classic scents, all of which are made from a proprietary blend of oils. NBC Select associate updates editor Zoe Malin and NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz are both fans of Native’s natural deodorants, and Malin says it’s the best out of all other natural options she’s tried. “I don’t notice a difference between how this natural deodorant and other ‘non-natural’ options work, even when I wear it during the most sweat-heavy cardio workouts,” she says. “It applies smoothly and has a non-sticky feel — I also love that it comes in a variety of scents.”
Native’s Regular Deodorant contains baking soda to help neutralize odor-causing bacteria, according to the brand. Native also offers a natural deodorant for sensitive skin that’s free of baking soda for those prone to irritation.
Formula: Stick | Invisible: Yes
I’ve used Necessaire’s Deodorant Gel, which is free from aluminum and baking soda, for a little over a year and love that it dries quickly and doesn’t leave a white residue like the solid deodorants I’ve used in the past. I do notice that I sweat a lot with this deodorant, so I’ll typically use it in the wintertime when I’m not sweating as much outdoors. It also has a pleasant eucalyptus scent derived from essential oils that’s not overpowering. However, I recommend taking it slow when you first start using the product: I experienced some itchiness under the arms when I first started applying it, and it took a few weeks for my skin to fully get used to the formula.
Formula: Gel | Invisible: Yes
Schmidt’s Deodorant Stick is certified natural by Ecocert, an organic certification organization based in Europe. It includes ingredients like magnesium hydroxide to counteract odor-causing bacteria on the skin, arrowroot powder and baking soda to absorb moisture, and a blend of essential oils to add fragrance. The deodorant has a 4.1-star average rating from 711 reviews on the brand’s website and is available in eight scents, including Lavender Sage, Fresh Cucumber and Clean Coconut. If you’d rather opt for a baking soda-free option, Schmidt’s also offers a sensitive skin version of its natural deodorant.
Formula: Stick | Invisible: No
Former NBC Page Mikhaila Archer says she made the switch to natural deodorants because she dislikes the distinct, artificial smell of aluminum-containing deodorants, which never really reduced odor. “I bought Salt & Stone’s natural deodorant after seeing a creator rave about it on social media and haven’t looked back since,” she says. Archer recommends the deodorant for its subtle scent, which includes notes of bergamot, French lavender, cypress and eucalyptus, which keeps her smelling good throughout the entire day, even after intense workouts. “It’s the first deodorant I’ve used that makes me feel totally protected no matter what the situation,” she says.
Formula: Stick | Invisible: Yes
This cream deodorant from Soapwalla, which has a 4.2-star average rating from 824 reviews on Amazon, comes in a glass pot, which allows you to scoop out the product and apply it liberally under your arms. Since the deodorant doesn’t contain any waxes or hardeners, it can liquify with temperature fluctuations — if this happens, Soapwalla recommends gently stirring the deodorant until it’s well-mixed and popping the container into your freezer for 20 minutes until it resolidifies.
Formula: Cream | Invisible: Yes
Malin says Evolvetogether’s natural deodorant is great for everyday use, and she uses it for low-intensity workouts like yoga and pilates. However, because she notices that the deodorant makes her sweat more, she doesn’t recommend it for heavy sweating days or workouts, like running. The deodorant goes on clear and is scented with lemon, patchouli, sage and cedarwood.
Formula: Stick | Invisible: Yes
The Chemistry Deodorant from Kosas has a 4.2-star average rating from 2,075 reviews on the brand’s website and uses alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) — which are typically used in skin care to control hyperpigmentation and even out skin tone — to tackle body odor instead of moisture-absorbing ingredients like baking soda. AHAs lower the pH under your arms and make it harder for odor-causing bacteria to thrive, according to Kosas. The Chemistry Deodorant is offered in two scents — Serene Clean and Beachy Clean — as well as in an unscented version.
Formula: Rollerball gel | Invisible: Yes
Another natural deodorant with a gel-like consistency, this option from Ursa Major is a non-staining deodorant stick that includes a blend of peppermint, eucalyptus and rosemary essential oils for fragrance. It’s made with other naturally-derived ingredients like soothing aloe vera and moisture-absorbing kaolin clay and baking soda. You also won’t need to worry about replacing it too often: The deodorant can last for up to four months with daily use, according to the brand.
Formula: Stick | Invisible: Yes
This roll-on gel deodorant from Crystal offers a hypoallergenic, non-staining formula that includes natural mineral salts to help prevent body odor, according to the brand. The deodorant is offered in an unscented version, as well as several naturally-scented options like Lavender & White Tea, Chamomile & Green Tea and Vanilla & Jasmine. It’s also highly rated with a 4.3-star average rating from over 5,237 reviews on Amazon.
Formula: Rollerball | Invisible: Yes
PiperWai’s natural deodorant has a paste-like consistency that you can easily rub onto your underarms. The deodorant, which has a 4-star average rating from 8,240 reviews on Amazon, is formulated with activated charcoal that can absorb moisture and reduce body odor, according to the brand, and even though it looks darker in the jar, the product rubs on clear. If you prefer a non-paste consistency, the deodorant is also offered in scented and unscented stick versions.
Formula: Paste | Invisible: Yes
When NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown stopped using deodorant over a year ago, she says that her body acclimated and body odor was no longer an issue. However, since becoming more active and returning to office work, she wears AKT a few days a week (“no one wants to be the smelly colleague”) and has been pleasantly surprised at how well it works. “What I love most is how it quickly dries down to a powder finish -- despite being a deodorant that has to be applied with my fingers, the application isn’t messy at all,” she says. She prefers the unscented version, and also likes that the packaging makes it easy to travel with.
Formula: Balm | Invisible: Yes
The aluminum-free label is a big factor for many people who switch to natural deodorants. However, our dermatologists all agreed that there isn’t a significant concern when it comes to aluminum in your antiperspirant: Some claims suggest that aluminum-based compounds in antiperspirants may contribute to the development of breast cancer, but the National Cancer Institute says that, based on an exhaustive 2014 systematic review, there is no evidence to date that shows aluminum-containing antiperspirants can contribute to an increased risk of breast cancer.
“Studies proving a link between aluminum salts and breast cancer are lacking. Based on medical evidence, I still prescribe and use aluminum-containing antiperspirant,” Farah says.
It’s also unclear how much aluminum is actually being absorbed through the skin: One 2017 study concluded that only about 0.01% of aluminum from antiperspirants was absorbed into the skin, and researchers note that we also absorb aluminum in different ways throughout the day, including from the foods we eat.
There are also plenty of myths surrounding sweating and whether or not it’s healthy for our bodies. A common one is that we sweat out our toxins, which is “just not what happens,” according to Dr. Tracy Evans, a board-certified dermatologist and medical director of Pacific Skin and Cosmetic Dermatology. “Toxins are removed from the body through our kidneys and our liver, but we can't sweat them out. You can't, in the same way, block your pores and keep your toxins in,” she says.
The main difference between natural deodorants and regular deodorants comes down to natural, plant-based components versus synthetic, lab-derived ingredients. But the dermatologists I spoke to say that all-natural products aren’t always safer — in fact, they are likely to cause an allergic reaction, especially under the arms where the skin is more delicate and sensitive compared to most other parts of the body.
“All-natural ingredients are usually allergenic [because] more people are commonly allergic to plants or fragrance — when you're using a more natural substance, a lot of those [allergenic ingredients] are more concentrated,” Evans says.
Essential oils, for example, are fairly common skin allergens, so Bodemer recommends making sure that any essential oils in natural deodorants are fairly low on the ingredients list. Other ingredients like baking soda can also cause a rash or sensitivity under the arms — for those with sensitive skin, Dr. Gabriela Soza, a board-certified dermatologist at Wexler Dermatology, recommends opting for a deodorant that contains arrowroot powder instead.
Overall, there are no major benefits to using “natural” deodorants over conventional ones, according to Dr. Robyn Gmyrek, clinical instructor of dermatology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. “Many conventional deodorants are also aluminum-free, but because not all of their ingredients are naturally derived, they might not be labeled as ‘natural’ — but remember, even naturally-derived compounds are still chemicals,” Gmyrek says. Since there are no regulations on the “natural” stamp, Bodemer recommends reviewing the ingredients and patch testing to ensure your skin doesn’t experience a reaction.
You should probably avoid natural deodorants if you’re looking to prevent or limit how much you sweat because they won’t plug your sweat glands like an antiperspirant normally would. Because sweating and smelling usually go hand in hand, our dermatologists agreed that you should stick with antiperspirants if your main concern is odor management, too.
“If you're not sweating, there's less bacteria acting on your sweat, which is normally what makes people feel like they have an odor,” Farah says. Odor-causing bacteria tend to grow more effectively underneath our armpits since they feed on the bit of extra oil secreted by those sweat glands, according to Bodemer. “If we can decrease the level of bacteria on the skin, we're going to decrease the smell,” she says.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-period-underwear-ncna1273695,Is period underwear worth it? Here’s what to know,HEALTH,"While pads and tampons have reigned supreme since around the 1930s, alternative menstrual products — including period underwear, menstrual cups and discs — have gained significant traction in the past few decades. Interest can be attributed to several factors, including shoppers valuing sustainability, cost effectiveness and more willingness to talk about menstruation in general.
“As folks begin to talk more openly and more often about menstruation and menstrual health, they share options beyond what they assume to be the one and only method of care — typically commercial pads and tampons,” says Chris Bobel, professor of women’s, gender, and sexuality studies at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.
Period underwear is reusable, designed to handle the different flows throughout your period and helps those who menstruate move away from traditional disposable pads. And unlike “period panties” that keep pads in place during that time of the month, period underwear can act as either a worry-free backup to a tampon, cup or disc or take the place of tampons and pads altogether.
To better understand how period underwear works (and whether it’s safe to use), we spoke to gynecologists about its benefits, limitations and best uses. We also gathered some highly rated options to consider based on their guidance.

Period or menstrual underwear is specially designed to absorb menstrual blood, so you rarely need to use pads, tampons or cups in conjunction with it, according to Dr. Andrea Zuckerman, chief of pediatric and adolescent gynecology and vice chair of gynecology at Tufts Medical Center. It’s designed to look like normal underwear: You’ll see period underwear offered in all sorts of styles, including boyshorts, bikinis, briefs and thongs.
While period underwear may resemble any other standard pair, it has a built-in pad with a moisture-wicking top layer that draws away wetness and dries fast, plus a super absorbent core layer, says Dr. Carolyn Moyers, a board-certified OB/GYN and founder of Sky Women’s Health.
A lot of period underwear is made from cotton and absorbent microfiber polyester, with some nylon or elastane thrown in for stretch and durability, according to our experts. Best of all, you usually can’t even tell there’s a pad built in — there’s little bulging and you don’t have to deal with the annoying issues that come with traditional pads, such as adhesive and wings.
Below, we highlight the top factors our experts recommend keeping in mind when shopping for period underwear.
We separated the following pairs of highly rated period underwear into three categories according to absorbency level, per our experts’ guidance: light, moderate and heavy coverage. Each of the following period brands indicates its underwear’s absorbency level (either based on number of regular tampons, volume in milliliters, or both) and all underwear options are machine-washable.
ModiBodi sells underwear for a variety of needs, including everyday, pregnancy and moisture-wicking. The brand’s period underwear is among its most popular pairs, and the Sensual Hi-Waist Bikini has earned an 4.9-star average rating from more than 3,100 reviews on its site. This bikini-style underwear is meant for lighter flows — about the same absorbency as two tampons — and is designed to sit right at the hip with a higher leg. The brand also offers a moderate-heavy pair that’s similar to two to three tampons, a heavy-overnight option that’s similar to three to four tampons, and a maxi version, which absorbs the same amount of blood as 10 tampons, according to ModiBodi.
The underwear has a high-waisted fit and a lace trim, and it comes in seven colors and patterns. The bikini-style underwear is also made with a stain-, odor- and bacteria-fighting lining, according to the brand. It’s available in five colors, including beige, moss green and black, and in 10 sizes ranging from XS to 6XL.
Absorbency: 1-2 tampons (10 mL) | Sizes: XS to 3XL
Like Modibodi, period label Proof designs underwear for different needs, including postpartum, workout and maternity. The Leakproof Thong has the absorbency of about one tampon and is designed to both help with light leaks and erase panty lines, according to the brand. Made from a breathable microfiber fabric and with a low-rise silhouette, the underwear is primarily meant for spotting, sweat and other discharge, so it’s best to use it in conjunction with a tampon, according to Proof. It has a 4.9-star average rating from over 70 reviews at the brand’s site and it’s available in two shades: black and sand.
Absorbency: 1 tampon (10 mL) | Sizes: XS to 3XL
Thinx is one of the more well-known period underwear brands with lines designed for different ages and lifestyles, including one for tweens and teens called Thinx (BTWN) and another for bladder leaks called Speax. (Thinx settled a class-action lawsuit in 2022 claiming the brand’s underwear contains harmful chemicals. Thinx denies these claims and admits no guilt or wrongdoing. We go more in-depth about this below.)
Made from flexible nylon and elastane, this cheeky-style underwear, as well as the brand’s thong, has Thinx’s lightest absorbency level: up to one tampon’s worth of blood, according to the brand. Thinx also offers styles in four additional absorbency levels, including light (two tampons), moderate (three tampons), heavy (four tampons) and super (five tampons). The Thinx Cheeky has a 4.8-star average rating from over 1,000 reviews at Thinx.
Absorbency: 1 tampon | Sizes: XS to 4X
Saalt, one of our favorite women-owned brands, is best known for its popular menstrual cups. But the brand also has a period underwear line called Saalt Wear, which includes bikinis, thongs and briefs aimed at absorbing periods, bladder leaks and more. The Leakproof Mesh Bikini, which has a 4.5-star average rating from over 300 reviews at Saalt, is designed to absorb as much as three regular tampons’ worth of blood, according to the brand. This pair is made from sheer mesh and offers a stretchy, mid-rise waistband.
Absorbency: 3 tampons | Sizes: XS to XXL
The Boost Boxer is designed with a statement waistband and an absorbency that matches up to four tampons, according to Aisle. The underwear comes with a booster that you can tuck into the ends of the gusset worth an additional four tampons of protection (or a total absorbency of about eight tampons), according to the brand. The underwear has over a 4-star average rating from more than 600 reviews at Aisle and comes in four colors: black, beet, ginger spice and kelp forest. In addition to period underwear, Aisle also offers its own line of liners, pads and cups.
Absorbency: 4 tampons (8 tampons with booster) | Sizes: XXS to 5X
Eco-friendly tampon and pad company Cora, which makes some of our favorite menstrual cups, also makes period underwear that absorbs the same as three regular tampons, according to the brand. The underwear — which has a 4.2-star average rating from over 1,000 reviews on Amazon — is designed to be flexible, especially for those with active lifestyles: It has a moisture-wicking core and elastane to make it stretchy and comfortable. It’s available in packs of one or three.
Absorbency: 3 tampons | Sizes: S to XXL
Rael offers three underwear styles, each with different absorbency levels: a bikini style that can absorb as much as three tampons’ worth of blood, and high-waisted and boyshort styles that both offer up to five tampons-worth of protection, according to the brand. Meant to look and feel like everyday underwear, it’s made with four layers, including one from breathable cotton and another that’s meant to protect against moisture and odors, according to Rael. The brand recommends changing it after 5-8 hours of use.
In addition to period underwear, including a disposable pair for heavy flows and postpartum, Rael carries its own collection of menstrual cups, pads, tampons and panty liners. Like the other options on this list, Rael’s period underwear is highly rated, with a 4.5-star average rating from 40 reviews at the brand’s site.
Absorbency: 3 tampons | Sizes: S to XXL
Knix’s period underwear has multiple absorbency levels, ranging from light coverage (which absorbs the same as 1-3 tampons) and ultra, which absorbs the same as 5-8 super tampons. The Super Leakproof High Rise is among its most popular offerings: It has an average 4.6-star rating over more than 4,100 reviews on the brand’s site. The pair comes with an extended gusset that’s 9 inches long and four-way stretch that’s meant to create a more comfortable fit the more you wash and wear it, according to Knix. In terms of fit, this underwear sits at the natural waist. You can choose between 11 colors, including rose water (pink), orchid (light purple) and midnight (blue).
Absorbency: 8 tampons (40 mL) | Sizes: XS to XXXXL
As its name implies, The Period Company is centered around period underwear (the brand also offers reusable pads and panty liners that are more recent additions). Made with organic cotton and spandex, this high-waisted pair can hold up to 10 tampons’ worth of blood and lasts an average of 8 hours for a heavy flow, according to the brand. Along with The High Waisted, which earned a 4.2-star average rating from over 1,800 reviews on the brand’s site, you’ll also find The Bikini with a lower rise, The Boxer and The Adaptive Bikini, which has velcro closures.
Absorbency: 10 tampons (148 mL) | Sizes: XS to 6XL
Period underwear is usually offered in three absorption levels for light, moderate or heavy flows. Menstrual underwear can hold as much as (and sometimes more than) five regular tampons’ worth of blood for heavier or overnight menstruation, which is more than most pads can hold, says Moyers. Light absorbency styles can hold about as much as a typical pantyliner.
Just like with pads or tampons, you should pick period underwear based on your specific flow. Our experts recommend trying out different absorbances to get comfortable wearing them and to see how each feels with your body and flow. If you have a heavier flow, you may want to use it in combination with other period products like a tampon or menstrual cup for extra protection and to avoid leaks, says Dr. Taraneh Shirazien, a board-certified gynecologist at NYU Langone and director of the Center for Fibroid Care.
Period or menstrual underwear is specially designed to absorb menstrual blood, so you rarely need to use pads, tampons or cups in conjunction with it, says Dr. Andrea Zuckerman , chief of pediatric and adolescent gynecology and vice chair of gynecology at Tufts Medical Center. It’s designed to look like normal underwear: You’ll see period underwear offered in all sorts of styles, including boyshorts, bikinis, briefs and thongs.
While period underwear may resemble any other standard pair, it has a built-in pad with a moisture-wicking top layer that draws away wetness and dries fast, plus a super absorbent core layer, says Moyers.
A lot of period underwear is made from cotton and absorbent microfiber polyester, with some nylon or elastane thrown in for stretch and durability, according to our experts. Best of all, you usually can’t even tell there’s a pad built in — there’s little bulging and you don’t have to deal with the annoying issues that come with traditional pads, such as adhesive and wings.
Experts told us that most people shouldn’t have too many issues transitioning to period underwear. “It’s not really going to require much of a change from days when you’re not bleeding and just wearing your normal underwear,” says Dr. Tina O’Shea , assistant professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Florida College of Medicine. “I think a lot of people like them because they feel most normal to what they’re used to,”
Period underwear stands out from tampons, pads and menstrual cups because of just how much it can absorb. Period underwear absorbs anywhere from about 5 to 25 milliliters of menstrual blood, which can be more than several tampons’ worth, says O’Shea. Because of its absorbency, you won’t have to change period underwear as often as other period care products (the FDA recommends changing a tampon every four to 8 hours and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises the same for pads). While there’s no specific recommended timeframe for period underwear, you should change your pair every 10-12 hours, according to our experts. However, those with heavier flows should consider only wearing their period underwear for up to 6 hours to avoid sitting in moisture, which can be a recipe for vaginal infections, says Shirazien.
Another important consideration is the environmental impact of disposable period products : Pads, tampons and panty liners all result in a large amount of plastic waste due to their materials and packaging. Period underwear is machine-washable and reusable, so it’s less likely to contribute to waste as much as other disposable menstrual care products would, according to experts.
One major downside to period underwear is that it’s not waterproof like tampons or menstrual cups, which means you won’t be protected when you’re swimming or playing water sports. It also lacks the portability of disposable period products — you likely can’t carry period underwear around as you would an extra tampon or pad in a pocket.
Period underwear also tends to have a higher upfront cost, usually ranging between $25 and $55 per pair. “That cost does start to even out if you think about buying pads and tampons for many years, but I think the initial cost is going to be a little more than some people would like to spend,” says Dr. Lauren Naliboff , a board-certified OB/GYN and assistant professor at Rutgers Health.
Another consideration is your comfort level when washing and maintaining period underwear. Specifically, you need to make sure you're comfortable with wringing out your underwear before throwing it in the washing machine, says Naliboff. And if you’re going to use period underwear as your primary form of bleeding protection, you’ll need at least four pairs to get through your period without having to do laundry daily, depending on your flow, says O’Shea.
Most period underwear brands recommend not putting their products in the dryer. Thinx, for example, says the high heat can ruin the elasticity of the underwear , which is what prevents leaks.
When we initially reported this piece, experts told us that period underwear is safe to use. That advice remains true, despite a 2020 report in Sierra Club Magazine that says testing found Thinx period underwear (one of which we recommend in this guide), contain potentially harmful chemicals, namely harperfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS . The report spurred a class-action lawsuit alleging that Thinx inaccurately marketed its products as “safe, healthy and sustainable” and “free of harmful chemicals.” While Thinx privately settled the case in November, it denies the allegations and admits no guilt or wrongdoing.
PFAS have been around for decades. They’re used in the manufacturing of consumer products due to their stain-, grease- and water-resistance properties, and they’re commonly found in nonstick cookware, water-repellent gear and apparel, firefighting foam and stain-resistant fabrics and carpets.
“PFAS is integrated into the construction of the fibers so it can protect them and make them more water-resistant,” says Ilias Kavouras , professor and chair of the Department of Environmental, Occupational, and Geospatial Health Sciences at the City University of New York.
In fact, PFAS are almost everywhere in our environments: “We have a lot of evidence showing that dust particles in your home, contaminated water and food packaging are all major routes of PFAS exposure, says Linda Kahn , assistant professor in the Division of Environmental Pediatrics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. Period underwear brands are often capable of using alternatives to PFAS, but the water- and stain-resistance may not be as effective, says Kahn. And some manufacturers may not even be aware they’re incorporating PFAS in their products because it can be the raw materials they use that have them, she says.
Exposure to PFAS from using period underwear, which is through the skin, has limited data. “Nobody has really quantified the percent [of PFAS] that’s absorbed dermally, but there’s some indication that it’s possible,” says Kahn.
But it doesn’t hurt to limit our exposure to PFAS, our experts say. “We are constantly exposed to PFAS in our everyday lives, so how much extra should people be concerned about period underwear versus lipstick, dietary exposure or water-resistant clothing? Is it worse than anything else you’re doing? Probably not,” says Kahn. “But ideally, one should try not to expose themselves through any means to the degree that we have any control over it.”
A complaint filed in May 2022 alleged that Thinx had deceptively marketed its products as a “safe, healthy and sustainable choice for women that “is free of harmful chemicals,” when the presence of chemicals like PFAS and nanoparticles in some samples of the brand’s underwear “are a safety hazard to the female body and the environment.”
Thinx denies all allegations — emphasizing that the settlement was not an admission of guilt.
“Consumer health and product safety are top priorities for Thinx, and we stand by the quality, efficacy and safety of our products,” Thinx said in a statement to NBC Select. “PFAS is not included in our product design and we continue to take measures to help ensure these substances are not added to our products.”
As part of the settlement, Thinx agreed to reimburse up to $5 million to customers who purchased its underwear between Nov. 12, 2016 and Nov. 28, 2022.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/how-to-care-for-aging-nails-rcna183968,How to take care of your nails as you age,HEALTH,"Aging is a natural part of life, and while many people focus on solutions for fine lines and wrinkles on their face and neck, tending to aging nails is just as important.
“With age, our bodies naturally produce less collagen and keratin, the building blocks that keep nails strong and resilient,” says Dr. Hannah Kopelman, a board-certified dermatologist based in New York. Aging nails can come with brittleness, splitting, decreased circulation and a noticeably slower growth rate.
We spoke with board-certified dermatologists about the best nail care products for aging nails and what to look for when shopping. We also put together a list of what to shop based on their recommendations and guidance.

Dr. Serena Mraz, a board-certified dermatologist based in California is a fan of this oil because it has a blend of jojoba, vitamin E, rice bran and almond oil, and is designed for daily use on both the nails and cuticles, she says. In addition to the brush applicator, it also comes in pen form, making it easy to travel with and use on the go.
Size: 0.25 fl. oz. | Key ingredients: jojoba oil, vitamin E, rice bran oil
“A classic, highly effective ingredient for aging nails, Vaseline forms a protective barrier on the nail and surrounding skin, locking in moisture and preventing dryness,” says Rambhia. “It’s especially useful for dry, cracked cuticles and brittle nails, creating an ideal environment for healing and strength.” To use, apply a small amount to the nails and cuticles overnight.
Size: 13 oz. | Key ingredients: petrolatum
This plant-based nail hardener is gentle and free from harsh chemicals like formaldehyde, formalin and toluene. It’s formulated to reduce the appearance of ridges on the nails, and “is a great option for anyone looking to strengthen aging nails while avoiding potentially harmful chemicals,” says Rambhi, who recommends applying the formula as a base coat for nail polish to protect and fortify aging nails.
Size: 0.33 fl. oz. | Key ingredients: calcium, phosphoric acid
To keep nails and hands hydrated, this travel-friendly moisturizer comes recommended by Kopelman since it’s moisturizing without being greasy. It also has ceramides, “an ingredient that plays a crucial role in maintaining hydration and reinforcing the skin barrier around the nails and cuticles,” she says. “By helping to lock in moisture and reduce water loss, ceramides prevent dryness and cracking, which are common issues in this area.”
Size: 2.7 fl. oz. | Key ingredients: ceramides
Developed by board-certified dermatologist and nail specialist Dr. Dana Stern, this all-in-one kit has everything you need to get your nails back on track. Whether you’re experiencing age-related nail changes or your nails have been put through damage, the three-step system repairs brittle, peeling nails and improves shine. The kit features a glycolic pen to exfoliate and remove superficial damage, a priming wand to promote shine and a hydrator to moisturize nails and cuticles.
Size: 1.5 ml. glycolic pen, 5 ml. hydrator | Key ingredients: coconut oil, glycolic acid
Kopelman recommends this nail strengthener, which is “fortified with calcium and protein to help strengthen brittle nails.” It comes in several shades — including white, pink, red and nude — so it can work as a nail polish in addition to strengthener. It’s also 9-free, which means it’s free of nine common chemicals commonly found in nail products including formaldehyde, parabens and phthalates. To use, the brand recommends applying two coats to bare nails followed by an additional coat daily.
Size: 0.5 fl. oz. | Key ingredients: calcium, protein
When shopping online or in your local drugstore or pharmacy, here’s what experts recommend you pay attention to:
Nail care products come in different forms and what you choose should depend on your desired benefits and the application experience. For instance, oils are helpful in keeping the nail and cuticle area hydrated, but can potentially feel greasy upon application and may be best worn overnight. Nail hardeners typically have ingredients that strengthen the nail structure, reduce brittleness and help prevent breakage, but they won’t do much for nail growth if that’s what you’re after. To encourage quicker nail growth, look for products with keratin and biotin.
Nails, like skin, lose moisture over time and as we age. “Nails rely on natural oils to hold the layers together, but with age, these oils decrease, making nails more prone to chipping, splitting and even developing ridges,” says Kopelman. “I often tell my patients that these ridges are like wrinkles on the skin — totally normal but sometimes frustrating.” Moisturizers like vitamin E, jojoba oil and omega-3 fatty acids can aid in moisture loss and overall health and appearance in this area. “Moisturizing the nails provides a degree of flexibility and improved strength to the nail,” says Mraz. “When nails are more flexible, they are less apt to break and split with normal forces applied during everyday activities.”
Just like our skin, our nails are susceptible to age-related changes. Here’s more:
There are several things you can do to care for your aging nails. For one, you’ll want to treat the dryness, as dryness can make nails more brittle and prone to splitting and breaking. “I recommend moisturizing your nails and cuticles regularly with a hydrating cream or oil,” says Rambhia.
Also, get into the habit of wearing gloves when cleaning or washing dishes, as it protects the nail from excessive exposure to chemicals and water, which can strip the nails of moisture and weaken them.
Diet can play a role in the health of your nails, too. Mraz recommends consuming a variety of nuts (which have protein and vitamin E), pumpkin seeds (which are rich in protein, iron, minerals and omega-3 fatty acids) as well as oats (for the biotin, zinc and silicon). “Bone broth is rich in collagen, amino acids and gelatin, which can work to strengthen the nails,” she says. Finally, a variety of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C can also help with nail formation. .

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/neck-stretchers-cervical-traction-rcna144537,6 cervical traction devices to try for neck pain,HEALTH,"There are a lot of things that can contribute to neck pain. Poor posture, sitting for hours and the lack of an ergonomic work set-up can all lead to discomfort in the neck and back. One treatment that can help relieve pain stemming from conditions like “tech neck” is a cervical traction device, otherwise known as a neck stretcher. These devices increase spine flexibility and ease neck inflammation, according to Dr. Ken Hansraj, author of “Watch Your Back” and chief of spine surgery at Northern Medical Group. “Cervical traction devices work by gently pulling the head away from the neck, which increases the space between the vertebrae,” he says. The decompression can help reduce pressure on the intervertebral discs and nerves, which means, when used correctly, these devices can help keep neck and back pain at bay.
To find the best cervical traction devices for alleviating chronic neck pain, I spoke to experts, including Hansraj, an orthopedic and spinal surgeon, and Jenna Crivelli, an SSOL Schroth-certified physical therapist at Stroma Physical Therapy. Below, I rounded up their product recommendations and shopping guidance. I also addressed whom a neck stretcher is best for, how to safely use them at home and when to speak to a doctor for further assistance.

I rounded up product recommendations for the best cervical traction devices from our experts, including Hansraj, an orthopedic and spinal surgeon and Jenna Crivelli, a physical therapist with experience treating scoliosis using the Schroth method. Here is what our experts recommend keeping in mind when looking for a cervical traction device:
I spoke with Hansraj and Crivelli to get their input on the best products for neck traction and addressing neck pain. Below, I rounded up products based on recommendations and guidance from our experts.
This cervical traction pillow, which has a 4.3-star average rating from 3,406 reviews on Amazon, is  travel friendly thanks to its small size (12  x 11 in.). The pillow has a small square shape and a curve in the middle to help support the neck when you lay on your back, though you can also use it if you’re a side or stomach sleeper. It’s made of a breathable memory foam material and has a removable cover that’s machine washable.  Plus, if you want a similar version for your bed, you can buy the pillow in three other sizes compatible with twin-, full-, queen- and king-sized mattresses. Pros: Comes with a bag, Fits in a suitcase, Cooling Cons: Nothing to note at this time
This memory foam pillow from Brooklyn Bedding is recommended by Hansraj, who says that pillows can provide cervical neck support and relieve neck pain. Although they aren’t technically cervical traction devices, they still go a long way in helping people with neck pain, according to Hansraj. “These pillows support proper neck alignment during sleep, which can help prevent and alleviate neck pain,” he says. “They’re a good choice for those looking to maintain cervical health passively and are particularly beneficial for people with posture-related neck issues.” This particular pillow is made from memory foam, which evenly supports weight distribution and conforms to your body’s movements, according to the brand. Plus, you can choose from either a low or high profile for the pillow, depending on the height that works best for you.
Hansraj also recommends this cervical pillow to provide relief to the cervical spine. According to the brand, its ergonomic design makes it a good fit for side, back, and stomach sleepers. The rectangular memory foam pillow has a groove in the middle, which gently holds the back or side of the neck as you sleep. The pillow is also made from breathable memory foam, which promotes air circulation, which is great for those who tend to get very hot when they sleep
This small, foam-filled cushion, which has a 4.2-star average rating from 88,018 reviews on Amazon, is ideal for stretching and relaxing the muscles in the neck. It can also help relieve neck pain by using it for 10 minutes each day, according to the brand. You can use it by placing it on the floor, lying on your back with the device underneath your neck and slightly bending your knees. The ergonomic c-shaped cushion design helps ease the cervical spine and though your neck may take a few days to adjust to the device, it doesn’t cause pain.


This handheld massage cane from Body Back Buddy, commonly referred to as an “S cane,” is recommended by Jenna Crivelli. This isn’t technically a cervical traction device, but like a cervical pillow, it can help relieve pain in the back of the neck, according to Crivelli. You can use the device to reach different spots around the body, including ones that are sometimes difficult to reach by hand, such as the back of the neck, the shoulders and the upper back. Additionally, the device has different-shaped knobs attached to it, which help gently but firmly apply pressure to points on the body to target and diminish pain, according to the brand. When used properly, the device helps address pain affiliated with muscle tension, aches and soreness.


Foam rollers are commonly used in exercises such as yoga and pilates, but they can also help relieve neck pain, according to Crivelli. To address the cervical spine, Crivelli recommends using a 36-inch roller to do exercises like chin tucks while lying down and pec stretches. This foam roller from AmazonBasics is high-density, meaning it’s firm in texture and holds its shape well after use. Additionally, the roller, which is 12 x 6 x 6 inches, is perfect for various types of exercise such as flexibility and strengthening, according to the brand.
There are a lot of factors that contribute to a good cervical traction device, such as adjustability and price point. Our experts also recommend putting a lot of thought into the type of device before buying one.
An inflatable cervical traction device uses both cushioning and air to provide support and traction to the neck. Hansraj likes these because they’re easy to adjust based on personal preference. These devices come with a tube and inflation valve that you pump to inflate the cushion to different levels of firmness.
As Hansraj mentioned above, cervical neck pillows aren’t technically traction devices, but they help provide support to  cervical spine alignment in a more subtle way while you sleep. Look for pillows that are made of memory foam, since they more easily conform to the shape of your head and neck, and provide more support than non-memory foam cushions.
In addition to inflatable cervical traction devices and cervical pillows, Hansraj recommends buying a posture pump-style device to provide relief to the neck. Hansraj says that these types of cervical traction devices help in promoting proper posture and alleviating pain from degenerative disc diseases.
A cervical traction device, sometimes called a cervical neck stretcher or simply a neck stretcher, is a device that helps gently stretch the cervical spine, which is the group of bones that make up the neck. The term “traction” is a synonym for stretching. A cervical traction device can make the spine more flexible and decrease pressure and inflammation on the vertebrae, according to Hansraj . The bones of the vertebrae are separated by cushions called discs. When the vertebrae are compressed from cervical traction, this provides relief to the spine, according to Hansraj.  “[Cervical traction] allows the disc spaces to re-hydrate [and] the spinal cord to rest in a relatively uncompressed state allowing the distracted facet joints to be more mobile and physiologically functional,” he says. Additionally, there are different types of cervical traction devices, such as inflatable and manual ones, that allow you to adjust them. These devices can also help with pain related to migraines and neck tension.
An important note about using cervical traction devices at home, is to always approach them with caution and get a doctor’s perspective or input from a healthcare professional on your situation before trying them, according to Hansraj . “Be very careful with these devices and consult a physician, a doctor of osteopathy, a Doctor of Physical Therapy, or a chiropractic physician to make recommendations about which device to get and to get help with fit and use of your device,” he says. Additionally, you should always look over instructions carefully and start slowly to prevent injury, according to Hansraj . “Apply the lowest level of traction or the shortest duration recommended and gradually increase as tolerated,” he says
Since everyone’s situation is different, it depends on many different factors. Some people may notice improvement using a cervical traction pillow or device, while others may require additional help. It’s important to remember that a cervical traction device isn’t an alternative to professional medical treatment from a doctor or physical therapist. These devices are meant to provide some neck pain relief, particularly pain that stems from poor posture, a stiff neck and certain spinal conditions, according to Hansraj. You should always consult your doctor for additional guidance if you’re experiencing severe neck pain.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-compression-socks-ncna1297811,How compression socks promote better circulation,HEALTH,"You’re not imagining it — your legs start to feel heavy, swollen and tired after sitting or standing for a while. If you don’t move around every 60 to 90 minutes, fluid starts to build up in your lower body, which creates that uncomfortable feeling, says Dr. Khurram Khan,  a professor and chairman at Temple University’s School of Podiatric Medicine. Walking around may help, but to really alleviate aches and pains (or prevent them in the first place), try wearing a pair of compression socks.
“The main action of compression socks is to help your veins work better,” says Dr. Tamara Horwich, a professor at The University of California, Los Angeles and the medical director for the university’s cardiac rehabilitation program. They push blood in your legs back to your heart, improving circulation so more oxygen gets to the tissues.
Compression socks are ideal for those whose job requires them to sit or stand all day, and our experts also recommend using them after a long run or tough workout, during pregnancy and on long flights. Below, I broke down everything you need to know about buying and wearing compression socks after talking to doctors. The NBC Select staff also spent two years testing over 20 pairs to recommend the best options.

In the past two years, we’ve tested about 20 pairs of compression socks. We considered the following factors during our trial period.
The compression socks below are our testers’ top picks. Each pair has a knee-high length, is machine-washable and is available in various colors and patterns. Most compression socks are sold in unisex sizes — use the chart on brands’ websites to find the right fit for you.
Ostrichpillow’s knee-high compression socks, an NBC Select Wellness Award winner, is the most beloved pair among our testers. “They’re so comfortable, and the compression isn’t constricting at all, but it definitely works,” says Rebecca Rodriguez, NBC Select editorial projects manager. “I wore them for over five hours of a 13 hour flight and I was shocked by how great my legs and feet felt after sitting for so long. They weren’t tired at all.”
NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown says these compression socks’ pressure level are “so close to perfect.” Unlike other options she’s tried, they don’t slip down her legs thanks to their elastic cuff. The socks maintain their integrity over time, too. “The material is a really great quality, and it still looks and feels like new after multiple washes,” says Brown.
Ostrichpillow’s compression socks are made in part from breathable natural bamboo fibers, which have antibacterial and odor control properties, according to the brand. They have an extra cushioned sole area, as well as reinforced heel and toe areas.
Pressure level: 8 to 15 mmHg | Material: bamboo, recycled polyester and nylon, spandex | Sizes: small, medium and large (sizes 5.5 to 14)
Because they’re the most compressive option I own, I don’t wear these socks daily — they can be challenging to put on and take off, and since they squeeze my legs more than other options, I can only comfortably wear them for a few hours a time. That said, I rely on them when my legs, feet and ankles feel extra tired, like after I run over 10 miles or spent a day standing on set. I also tend to get shin splints when I run on the treadmill in the winter, and they’re a lifesaver for recovery.
These compression socks are made from a thinner material, so I usually wear them under loose pants like joggers. Their higher compression level helps them stay in place on my body. The socks are also durable — I’ve owned mine for at least three years and they’re still in great condition.
Pressure level: 20 to 30 mmHg | Material: nylon, spandex | Sizes: small/medium, large/extra large and extra extra large (women’s 5.5 to 15, men’s 5 to 17)
I’m a big fan of Feetures’ basic athletic socks, so it’s no surprise that I gravitate toward its compression socks for exercising, too. I typically wear them on shorter recovery runs the day after my long-distance runs, which is when my legs tend to feel the most fatigued and need extra support. These compression socks are the most moisture-wicking pair I tested, so I don’t worry about them getting sweaty during workouts. They’re also very breathable because there’s mesh on the top of the sock to provide ventilation.
Feetures’ compression socks have built-in arch support, as well as seamless toe and heel areas to eliminate friction and reduce the chance of blisters, according to the brand. They’re lightly cushioned, sufficiently padding my feet without making my sneakers feel tighter. I never adjust them while I’m running. Once I pull them up my legs, they stay in place for hours.
Pressure level: 15 to 20 mmHg | Material: nylon, spandex | Sizes: women’s small, medium and large (4 to 13); men’s medium, larger and extra large (6 to 15.5)
I typically walk over 15,000 steps a day in New York City, and around dinnertime, my legs start to feel like they weigh a million pounds. I’ve made it a habit to wear these compression socks almost every night for a few hours to relieve some tension. They have gentle, non-restricting yet noticeable compression, and they’re slightly stretchy, so they’re easy to put on and take off. Their fabric is also soft, cushioned and quite cozy. It’s a bit thicker compared to other compression socks I’ve tried, but it doesn’t make me overheat. Plus, the socks never bunch up, move around or slip down when I wear them.
Additionally, I find the look of these socks to be much more stylish than many other options in my closet. Sometimes compression socks look too much like they came from a doctor’s office for my taste, but you wouldn’t know these are compression socks by looking at them. Bombas’ compression socks have a seamless toe to prevent chafing and arch support in the midfoot area.
Pressure level: 15 to 20 mmHg | Material: cotton, polyester, elastane, nylon | Sizes: small, medium and large (sizes 4 to 13)
“These are the most comfortable compression socks I’ve ever used,” says NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio. “They’re super soft, which makes them easy to wear for hours at a time.” Comrad’s compression socks have extra cushioning in the toe and heel, areas that typically see the most wear and tear. That cushioning makes the sock more durable and helps it absorb shock every time your foot makes contact with the ground while walking, according to the brand. The sock’s dual-layer cuff also prevents it from slipping down your leg.
Comrad’s compression sock is designed to mirror the shape of the foot and leg, so getting them on your body is a breeze. “Unlike so many other compression socks out there, they’re easy to put on and take off, so I reach for them over most others,” says Godio.
Pressure level: 15 to 20 mmHg | Material: nylon, combed cotton, micro modal, lyocel, elastane | Sizes: small, medium, medium wide, large, large wide and extra large (women’s 5 to 11+, men’s 3 to 13+)
While the NBC Select staff didn’t test Wellow’s compression socks, they come highly recommended by Dr. Priya Parthasarathy, a podiatrist at the Foot & Ankle Specialists of the Mid-Atlantic, so they’re worth considering. “I really love these for daily wear because they’re comfortable, breathable and easy to put on,” she says. “I wear them on my surgery days as I’m mostly standing throughout the day. Especially now that I’m pregnant again, I also wear them to prevent varicose veins, spider veins and fatigue. They definitely make my feet and legs feel much less tired.”
Wellow’s compression socks have a seamless heel and toe, as well as a blister tab by the ankle to prevent chafing and a double-lined cuff, according to the brand. They’re made with a breathable, sweat-wicking, antimicrobial, odor-resistant fabric. Wellow says you can stretch the socks’ calf area to be 19 inches wide, giving you lots of room to put your leg through.
Pressure level: 18 to 25 mmHg | Material: viscose (bamboo), polyester, spandex | Sizes: small, medium, large and extra large
Type, pressure level and material are three of the most important aspects of a compression sock to consider while shopping. Here’s what experts suggest thinking about to help you narrow down your choices.
There are two types of compression socks:
The amount of pressure that compression socks apply is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), says Horwich. Here’s what to know about different pressure levels, according to Khan.
It’s important to keep in mind that the more compressive a sock is, the harder it is to get on and off your body, says Parthasarathy. People often don’t wear compression socks as much as they should if putting them on and taking them off is challenging, so a mild to moderate amount of pressure is the sweet spot for most people — you get the benefits of compression socks and won’t dread getting your legs in them, says Parthasarathy.
Most compression socks are closed-toe knee-highs, says Horwich. They also come as ankle-length socks, which support the feet and ankles, but neglect the calf, which is often where there’s swelling and fluid-buildup, says Khan. Brands also make open-toed compression socks, as well as those that don’t cover your foot at all, so they resemble leg warmers.
Choosing a style ultimately depends on where you want to feel pressure, but Parthasarathy says the higher, the better. “Higher styles distribute the compression more evenly and help the blood circulate more efficiently than just ankle socks,” she says. However, if you notice the most discomfort in your ankles and calves and your feet are generally fine, open-toed compression socks may be a good option. There’s also thigh-high and waist-high compression socks, but Khan says you shouldn’t wear them unless you have certain medical conditions and are under a doctor’s supervision.
When you sit or stand for a prolonged period of time, fluid gradually builds up in your lower body, leading to tired, achy and swollen legs, feet and ankles. Compression socks gently squeeze these areas of your body to help push blood back toward your heart, thus improving circulation, reducing swelling and preventing blood from pooling in the lower legs, says Khan. These specialized socks can also help your body absorb excess fluid that might otherwise collect in the tissues, which is especially beneficial for those who have conditions like chronic swelling or vein issues.
Anyone who spends an extended period of time standing or sitting can benefit from wearing compression socks. But there are a few specific situations where they’re especially helpful, says Horwich.
Compression socks can also prevent or reduce the severity of varicose veins, which are enlarged, twisted veins you can see bulging under the skin. They usually appear on the legs and are common during pregnancy due to physical and hormonal changes, as well as later in life, says Khan. Compression socks may prevent spider vein formation as well. Spider veins are small damaged blood vessels under the skin that usually look red, blue or purple. Plus, these socks are beneficial for those who experience dizziness due to low blood pressure, experts say.
Young adults with no health concerns can wear most compression socks without consulting a doctor, says Khan. However, older adults and anyone who experiences chronic leg swelling should consult a doctor before wearing them. “It’s important that they know the cause of the swelling and are on the right treatment before starting to wear compression socks,” says Horwich.
Additionally, those with poor circulation due to blocked arteries, serious heart conditions and certain skin infections should avoid compression socks unless prescribed by a doctor, says Khan. Compression socks can worsen these conditions by limiting blood flow too much.
Yes, you can wear compression socks every day, says Khan. In fact, many people do, especially those who sit and/or stand for long periods, like nurses, teachers and office workers. “As long as they’re at the right pressure level and fit well, daily use is generally safe,” says Khan. “It’s a simple and non-invasive way to protect long-term leg health and reduce the risk of future circulation problems.”
Wearing compression socks for 6 to 8 hours a day is sufficient for most people, says Khan. Some people wear them for longer if they’re using the socks to manage a medical condition under a doctor’s supervision, like edema (swelling caused by trapped fluid in the body’s tissues) or varicose veins.
Generally, you should aim to buy compression socks that are comfortable enough to wear all day if you want to, says Parthasarathy. She recommends putting them on first thing in the morning when your legs are the least swollen.
No, you shouldn’t wear compression socks to sleep, says Khan. When you lay down, the swelling in your legs, ankles and feet naturally decreases, so compression socks are unnecessary.
Yes, you can wear compression socks while running and during exercise, says Khan. They can reduce muscle vibration, fatigue and swelling, as well as protect the lower leg muscles from overuse and strain. It’s crucial to only wear mild compression socks while running or exercising, and immediately see your doctor if you experience pain, which could be a sign of compartment syndrome, a serious condition where pressure builds up inside a specific muscle.
Compression socks are FSA/HSA-eligible so long as they have a pressure level of 30 to 40 mmHg or above, and you’re using them to treat a medical condition. Because of these restrictions, most compression socks that the average person wears day-to-day are not FSA/HSA-eligible.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-heating-pads-rcna177149,The best heating pads for treating sore muscles and cramps,HEALTH,"As a gym-goer and former high school athlete, I’m no stranger to aches and pains. Thankfully, heating pads are a safe and easy way to soothe soreness at home. Specifically, according to the experts, heating pads reduce your body’s perception of pain and stiffness by generating heat to increase blood flow to a certain area, which helps to increase mobility and circulation, reduce inflammation, and help you feel more relaxed.
That being said, I gathered a list of expert-recommended and editor-tested heating pads to consider for treating muscle aches, menstrual cramps and more.  You can find that list below along with guidance and shopping tips from Dr. Michele Christian, a physical therapist at Stroma Physical Therapy in New York City, Dr. Rolland Miro, a sports therapist, chiropractor and the owner/director of Manhattan Sports Therapy in New York, and Dr. Karena Wu, a board-certified clinical specialist in orthopedic physical therapy and owner and clinical director of ActiveCare Physical Therapy in NYC.
SKIP AHEAD  How I picked the best heating pads | The best heating pads in 2025 | How to shop for heating pads | Why trust NBC Select?
While choosing the best heating pads, experts told me to focus mainly on the different types.
The list below includes every type of heating pad mentioned above.
When it comes to electric heating pads, Miro recommends this option from Chattanooga, which also doesn’t need water to provide moist heat. The pad, which uses a flannel covering to draw moisture from the air, also includes a digital controller that lets you program and monitor the temperature and duration of your heating treatment up to 30 minutes, according to the brand. The temperature can be controlled between 88 and 166 degrees Fahrenheit, and also includes a lockout mode that protects against accidental or inconsistent setting changes during the treatment.
Type: electric
This microwaveable option comes recommended by Christian because of its cordless design and washable, cotton covering. Christian also says it can be dampened with water before microwaving to provide moist heat, and that it gradually loses heat while in use, which reduces your risk of burns. The pad’s star-shaped design provides more targeted and even heating, and themillet, flaxseed and claybead filling makes it flexible enough to be used on any part of the body, according to UNCN. You can also use it as a cold compress — just stick it in the fridge or freezer to cool it down.
Type: microwaveable
This electric heating pad from Homedics is designed to draw moisture from the air to deliver moist heat without water, according to the brand. Sanders calls it a “top recommendation” because of its large size and moist heat options, which she says “tend to provide deeper pain relief.” It has a weighted design and a 12-foot long cord to help with portability, along with an automatic 2-hour shutoff, according to Homedics. The pad is made from a plush, machine-washable polyester and comes with a one-click remote that has four heat settings: warm, low, medium and high.
Type: electric
This moist heating pad “gets very hot and maintains heat well,” says Miro. To use it, the brand recommends heating the compress to your desired temperature using a hydroculator or, for those of you using it at home, a heated pot of water, or a microwave as a last resort. Since it gets so hot, Miro recommends layering a towel or other comfortable buffer between your skin and the pad, which he does in his own practice: “We wrap these up in a towel and place a few folded towels on the person before placing this pack on them,” he says. This pad is also pliable and more flexible when it’s heated, making it easier to mold to the shape of your targeted area, according to the brand.
Type: microwaveable
NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown has had this heating pad for years and still uses it monthly when she has menstrual cramps. It’s made from a machine-washable, velveteen fabric pad and has four heat settings available on the included single-button controller. “It heats up fast and has an auto shutoff feature that comes in handy when using overnight,” says Brown. The pad also has moist heating features; to use, the brand says you should lightly mist the surface of your pad with water, or pat it gently with a wet sponge to add moisture.
Type: electric
This heating pad from Bearaby (who also makes the NBC Select Wellness Award-winning Terraclay Dreamer Sleep Mask), is both warmable and freezable, making it a versatile option for anyone in need of a dual heating pad/cold compress. NBC Select editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez calls it a “lifesaver” when she’s suffering from cramps, and says the weighted design gives her “the feeling of a big hug when [she] really needs one.” She also says that it stays warm the longest out of any heating pads she’s tried — after microwaving, it can stay hot for up to a full hour, according to the brand. This pad is also machine-washable.
Type: microwaveable
Wu recommends Sunbeam’s heating pads because they’re easy to use and budget-friendly. This model comes with a nine-foot cord, a two-hour auto shut off, and a slide-button controller with three heat settings, according to the brand. It’s also great for targeting larger areas — it has a 24-inch length that Wu says is big enough to work “pretty much everywhere you need it on the body.” It also has a machine-washable cover, and can be used with moist heat by lightly spraying the surface with water.
Type: electric
If you want to target your back or waist areas, Wu suggests this microwaveable heating pad from Suzzipad. It has an ergonomic design that fits around your lower waist to better localize your heat therapy session, according to the brand. It’s filled with flaxseed, millet, clay beads and sorghum, which can trap both heat and cold, making it a great dual treatment option. The pad is also double-sided, with one side made of a soft, fuzzy material and the other side made of a smooth, Dutch velvet for extra heat retention, according to the brand.
Type: microwaveable
When shopping for a heating pad of your own, experts recommend keeping the following factors in mind.
The biggest danger with using a heating pad is the risk of burning yourself, says Christian. She says this can happen as a result of a number of things, including prolonged exposure to the heat, issues or malfunctions with the heating pad itself, using the heating pad in an area with decreased sensation, or a lack of layering between the pad and your skin.
To lower your risk of burns, the experts suggest trying the following:

In a word: no. All three experts advise against sleeping with a heating pad, as they say it can pose a potential burn risk if you’re not able to tell if/when the pad gets too hot. If it’s electric, there’s also an added fire risk of the pad overheating or short-circuiting while you’re asleep and unaware.
Though experts differ on the precise range, none of them advise heating a pad past 160 degrees Fahrenheit. For a minimum heat, Christian suggests nothing lower than 104 degrees Fahrenheit in order to provide the necessary amount of heat needed to soothe your pains.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-lumbar-support-pillows-rcna142358,The 6 best lumbar support pillows,HEALTH,"Suffering from chronic low back pain, regardless of your age or health status, imposes a great deal of stress and inconvenience on everyday life. Unfortunately, the condition is extremely prevalent in a range of demographics. As of 2020, over 600 million people globally suffer from some form of low back pain, which is also the single leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization. However, there are ways to combat low back pain, including an ergonomic lumbar support pillow.
To learn more about what causes lower back pain, what lumbar support cushions are and how they function, we spoke with experts, including chiropractors. Additionally, we rounded up product recommendations from experts and incorporated their guidance on shopping for lumbar support pillows.
SKIP AHEAD: How we picked the best lumbar support pillows | The best lumbar support pillows in 2025 | How to shop for lumbar support pillows
To pick the best lumbar support pillows, we rounded up recommendations from experts, including chiropractors Dr. Matthew Cavanaugh and Dr. Allen Conrad. When it comes to shopping for lumbar support pillows, our experts recommended keeping the following characteristics in mind:
We considered guidance from experts in chiropractic care and high ratings to round up a list of the best lumbar support pillows to help alleviate low back pain.
The Cushion Lab sells a wide variety of pillows and cushions for various purposes, including this popular lumbar pain relief pillow. The cushion’s unique shape is intentionally designed to target and support particular points in the lower back. This pillow comes recommended by Cavanaugh, who says it’s a versatile option that works in different seats. The pillow comes with a breathable cover and has a firm memory foam material that provides support whether you’re using it on a couch or traditional office chair, according to the brand. Plus, the cushion is available in 23 colors, which is more than any other pillow on this list.
Washable cover: Yes | Adjustable strap: Yes | Material: Memory foam | Shape: Oblong | Dimensions: 16 x 16 in.
The lumbar support pillow from Qutool was designed to fit many different types of seats, according to the brand. Cavanaugh recommends this pillow, which he says is a good choice for those who spend a lot of time seated. The cushion has a rounded shape at the bottom for lumbar support, but it also has cushioning for the middle and upper parts of the back for those who need a little extra support. The cushion has two large straps on the back, which you use to fasten the cushion to whatever you’re sitting on.
Washable cover: Yes | Adjustable strap: Yes | Material: Memory foam | Shape: Rectangular | Dimensions: 17 x 15.5  x 4.7 in.
Conrad recommends this lumbar support pillow from Samsonite, which he says many patients find comfortable and they like that it provides a good amount of back support. The product is designed to maintain its curved shape without flattening or becoming flimsy over time, according to the brand. The shape of the pillow is not only meant to help provide some relief, but it helps promote better posture over time by complimenting the curve of your back.
Washable cover: Yes | Adjustable strap: Yes | Material: Memory foam | Shape: Square | Dimensions: 13.5 x 14  x 4.5 in.
This travel-friendly lumbar cushion from well-known mattress brand Tempur-Pedic comes recommended by Cavanaugh, who likes its dimension and portability. “This lumbar support travel cushion is perfectly sized to be taken anywhere you go and is ergonomically shaped to provide the support your lower back needs,” he says. The cushion itself is square-shaped so it lies flat, which makes it easy to store and travel with. Additionally, the pillow is made from the brand’s proprietary Tempur material, which offers more support and pressure relief to the body compared to traditional memory foam, according to the brand.

Conrad also recommends this square-shaped lumbar pillow from Sleep Number, which he likes for its affordability and you can easily move it between different types of seats and chairs. “The Sleep number beds were quite popular over the years and so is the back support pillow,” he says. “This one is a bit softer, but is cost effective and easy to travel from a chair to your car seat if needed.” The pillow also comes with a removable, machine-washable microfiber cover.

Everlasting Comfort comfort makes a variety of wellness-related and ergonomic products, including this lumbar support pillow. The cushion has a 4.4 star average with over 40,000 reviews on Amazon and is fine to use on office chairs, car seats, couches and gaming chairs, according to the brand. The straps on the back of the pillow make it easy to fasten to each seat, this way you don’t have to worry about it shifting as you move throughout the day. In addition to providing posture support, the contour of the cushion and the extended sides conform to the shape of your lower back.

A good lumbar support pillow depends a lot on the person using it. This means that a certain pillow might be a perfect match for one person and completely incompatible for another. Some people may need a pillow that provides a lot of pressure, while others simply want a bit of cushion. Cavanaugh recommends testing out lumbar support pillows in person if possible, since it’s difficult to gauge how a pillow feels virtually. In addition to doing research online, consider going to a local bedding or orthopedic store.
In addition to shape, size and firmness, Conrad recommends considering your height. That’s because certain lumbar support pillows will fit differently on people of different sizes, according to Conrad. “If your mid back is sore or arthritic, then a taller back support that can reach the mid and low back may be better suited for you,” he says. “If you are five feet tall, a back support designed for a person [who is] 6 feet 5 inches tall obviously won’t be good for you.”
It’s important to always consult your doctor if you’re experiencing severe back pain. A lumbar support pillow helps alleviate some pain in the lower back while sitting throughout the day, but it isn’t considered a replacement for or an alternative to professional medical care. If your doctor recommends getting a pillow to support your lower back, consider looking into one of the options mentioned above.
Lumbar support is any form of support used to protect the area of the spine that is below the lowest rib and above the hip bone, referred to as the lumbar spine. This part of the spine is formed in a way to prevent injury, according to Cavanaugh. “This inward curve, or lordosis, serves as a shock absorber and helps to evenly distribute our weight without causing too much stress or strain to the discs, ligaments and muscles,” he says. It’s crucial to protect this part of the spine to prevent pain in the future. “The reason lumbar support is so important is because without adequate support, ligaments get overstretched, chronic pressure is exerted on our disc and muscles become fatigued,” says Cavanaugh. This is ultimately what leads to low back pain that doesn’t have to do with any particular underlying condition or injury, according to Cavanaugh.
A lumbar support pillow is a cushion that provides support and comfort to the lumbar spine, commonly referred to as the lower back. These types of pillows are a good option for those who sit for long periods of time and suffer from low back pain and poor posture as a result. They also help those who are suffering from low back pain stemming from an injury or degenerative arthritis, according to Conrad. “A lumbar support pillow offers additional pressure to the low back and lumbar region for prolonged sitting,” he says.
Low back pain is common for many people of different ages, and it has several different causes, according to our experts. That said, when it comes to low back pain that isn’t tied to a particular injury or condition, there are a few common lifestyle factors that lead to the condition. People aged 20 to 40 years old are more prone to experience low back pain if they maintain a mostly sedentary lifestyle or don’t regularly participate in physical activity, according to Cavanaugh. “This is also the age group that begins to suffer from disc injuries,” he says. Disc injury refers to complications of the cushions between the bones in the vertebrae, particularly in the lower back. People between the ages of 40 to 60 are also more likely to experience low back pain that stems from the effects of different forms of arthritis, including spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease, according to Cavanaugh. People over the age of  60 also commonly experience these symptoms in addition to age-related conditions like osteoporosis and spondylolisthesis, says Cavanaugh.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-massage-chairs-ncna1302913,"The best massage chairs, according to experts",HEALTH,"Buying a massage chair is akin to buying clothing — to work for you, it must fit your body and your needs. When you find the right one, the result can make sitting down feel like a trip to the spa—both relaxing and rejuvenating. These at-home devices can make regular massages more accessible than the daily or weekly trip to the masseuse.
A regular massage can be beneficial to your well-being, according to experts. “Massage is important for overall health because it's a unique way to rid your body of a certain type of stress,” said Patrick Porter, PhD, the founder of BrainTap. “It is called kinetic stress and it means that your muscles are holding onto the stress.”

""Some studies have found massage chairs help reduce pain and overall feelings of stress and anxiety,” said Nikki Gnozzio, CSCS, LMT, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and a licensed massage therapist. “Massage chairs can also be particularly useful for folks who shy away from physical touch.”
Massage chairs can be an investment, so finding the right one for your home and body can feel overwhelming. Below, we spoke with experts about the best massage chairs on the market, as well as how to shop for them.
Below, we rounded up the massage chairs recommended by our experts or highly rated from retailers we’ve previously covered. You’ll find options across various prices and devices offering different massage strengths and feels.
The Human Touch Whole Body 7.1 massage chair is one that Porter not only recommends, but uses himself. “It's easy to move around, and I can demo it for my customers,” he said, adding that he uses it every day to give himself a massage. While Human Touch also makes significantly more expensive options, Porter told us that this model has many of the same features as the higher-end versions (including zero-gravity positioning, which helps to remove stress and tension from the spine). “Vibration in a zero gravity or an inversion position will help move blood easily from the lower extremities, which will give you a deeper relaxation,” said Porter.
Gnozzio recommends this massager for its accessible price point and its portability. Simply place it on your existing office chair (or any other chair in your home) to turn it into a massage chair. Gnozzio liked that it has flexible massage nodes, which are adjustable to fit the natural curves of your body, and the fact that it gets warm, which helps to relax stiff muscles. This device has a 4.3-average star rating out of 16,134 reviews on Amazon.
Gnozzio said that the ergonomic design of this Osaki chair helps to accommodate a wide range of body types and needs, making for a particularly customized-feeling massage. Thanks to its zero gravity position, this chair can help align your back with your thighs, helping to reduce vertical stress on the spine, according to the brand. Gnozzio noted that the heating pads in the lower back region of the chair may reduce pain and relieve stress.
As the name suggests, the HoMedics Shiatsu Elite II is specifically designed to mimic a shiatsu massage. Porter said it does indeed closely mimic this type of massage, which is defined as a massage that applies direct pressure on various points and channels. The cushion features three massage programs – kneading shiatsu for a deep-tissue experience; rolling massage for a more gentle experience; and spot massage, which targets your most tense areas. According to the brand, this device can be placed on a chair, a couch or even on your bed.
Porter recommends this Svago ZGR Plus chair because it includes a full-body Shiatsu massage option, as well as the ability to fully recline. Other features that Porter liked include a heated foot roller massager, Thai massage option, and bluetooth speaker, so that you can listen to your favorite music (or meditation series) while you’re in the chair.
Gnozzio told us that the Insignia brand produces great massage chairs, particularly citing the unique upper body scan that helps to customize your treatment to your body. According to the brand, you can just sit in the chair and it will automatically adjust to your measurements to give you a more customized massage. This chair contains a combination of rollers, air pressure and heat therapy and has 21 preset massage programs for you to choose from.
This back massager fits on any chair in your home and comes equipped with a massaging neck pillow. It offers a full-back massage courtesy of 8 deep kneading nodes that travel up and down. It also heats up and offers three levels of warmth. Finally, the seat vibrates to provide a relaxing sensation. This device has a 4.3-average star rating from 8,217 reviews on Amazon.
Looking for an actual massage chair that won’t take up a ton of room? This option folds up and can be stored in between uses. When you’re ready to use it, it comes with a neck massager that is adjustable, allowing you to pull it up or down depending on your height. The back features 8 massaging nodes that span from shoulder to low lumbar so they can knead every part of your back, according to the brand. The chair also has an adjustable back, allowing you to sit straight up or lean back for a more relaxed position.
A massage chair is exactly what it sounds like—a device designed to give you a massage. There are some that take the form of literal chairs that you sit in, while others are more portable. In the chair variation, you'll find knobs that act as massaging arms along with airbags and rollers to mimic the movement of hands. Oftentimes, these chairs also come with a remote that gives you full control over the speed and pressure of the massage.
Aside from the larger investment chair, you can opt for a more budget-friendly version that sits atop any chair. These usually look like mats that you lay over the back and seat. Similar to an actual massage chair, they contain rollers, airbags and massage arms to knead muscles. These devices tend to be less expensive and more portable.
Whether you go for a full on massage chair or a device that affixes to a chair you already own, purchasing one of these is an investment. To make sure you get the most out of your purchase, we spoke with experts to determine what you should keep in mind when shopping for a massage chair.
The most important element of a massage chair is safety, both Gnozzio and Porter said. “Massage chairs can hurt you if the rollers or the padding isn't sufficient for what you need,” Porter said. “The main thing is to find one that you feel comfortable in and that you can adjust to your particular needs.” That means that having a strong, intense massage isn't always the best option. Listen to your body, and respond accordingly. Gnozzio points out that within 24 hours, most folks will have a sense of whether their bodies feel better or worse after a massage.
“Just like your wardrobe, massage chairs come in different shapes and sizes,” said Porter. “If you’re buying a chair for your whole family, you need to make sure that it can be adjusted to hit the right areas on the body for everyone using it.” Be sure to try before you buy, Gnozzio said. “Different levels of pressure and pre-set massage patterns differ from model to model and not everyone likes the same thing.”
While heat settings and kneading may seem like extraneous bells and whistles for a massage chair, Porter said that heat helps to loosen up your muscles, while kneading helps encourage blood flow. “If the massage chair has kneading, reflexology, and shiatsu, it's going to imitate a massage therapist more closely than if it just has rollers,” he added.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-foam-roller-ncna1283458,What exactly is a foam roller?,FITNESS,"Foam rolling is a treatment that helps speed up recovery from muscle soreness and tightness. It’s also a popular method for self-myofascial release, which is a deep-tissue massage that can help with breaking up myofascial adhesions, or trigger points, says John Gallucci Jr., a physical therapist and CEO of JAG Physical Therapy. “This technique is a cost-effective way to give yourself a deep tissue massage before or after a workout,” he says. You can also use a foam roller to relieve muscle tension and soreness after hours of sitting during work or stress on the job.
To help you determine the best foam roller for your needs, I spoke with personal trainers, physical therapists and chiropractors about how to safely use and shop for one, and highlighted their personal recommendations.
SKIP AHEAD How I picked the best foam rollers | The best foam rollers to shop | Why trust NBC Select?
Foam rollers come in various sizes and densities, so choosing one that’s right for you is crucial to safe and effective sessions.

Below, I compiled expert-recommended foam rollers to consider based on various use cases and experience levels. I also listed foam rollers our NBC Select editors have tried and loved.
This won an NBC Select Wellness Award for best overall foam roller due to its unique design — the grooves are tough and sturdy, which helps relieve muscle tension and soreness after a workout or sitting for long hours, according to our reviewers. “My boyfriend has sciatica, or nerve pain, and this foam roller did a really good job of helping them stretch out and align their lower back,” says NBC Select editorial assistant Ariadne Night. The roller has a center groove for an even deeper massage that helps properly align your spine and neck and promote better posture while you use it, according to the brand.
The Lululemon Double Roller is another NBC Select Wellness Award winner due to its versatility. There is a smaller roller inside with a deeper ridge design, which our editors love. The exterior roller is best for use on arms and legs, while the interior roller is ideal for back tension, according to the brand. I love using this foam roller when I’m sore from my workouts because the ridges help to ease tension in my legs, back and shoulders. It’s also very lightweight, so I can take it on-the-go when I need it.
This foam roller comes recommended by Allen Conrad, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and the owner of Montgomery County Chiropractic Center. “Many foam rollers seem to wear down after using them a few times, but the Luxfit one is more durable for repeated use,” he says, adding that it’s good for large muscle groups like the hamstrings and quadriceps. Its smooth surface also repels liquid for peace of mind while working out, according to the brand.
The TriggerPoint GRID roller is a good option for athletes, according to Conrad. It has a hollow center that makes it flexible enough to move with your body and a firm, contoured design that can withstand up to 500 pounds of pressure, according to the brand. (Due to the firmness and ridges on the roller, Conrad doesn’t recommend it for beginners.)
If you’re looking for a more intense foam rolling experience, consider this vibrating foam roller from Hyperice. It has a similar rounded, contoured design as other foam rollers on this list, but comes with three speeds of high-intensity vibrations to massage away tension and loosen up muscles. I use this roller after I do more high-intensity workouts like HIIT to get a better, deeper massage on my legs and arms. (However, keep in mind the vibrations can be very intense, and it’s tough to use the highest speed, in my experience.) You can also pair the roller to the Hyperice app, which provides guided sessions, helps you monitor your progress and more.
This Tiger Tail foam roller has non-slip grip handles on either side that can help you guide the roller exactly where you’re targeting and allow it to glide back and forth on the muscle with good stability and pressure, says Conrad. Because of its firmer feel, this roller can soothe tight thighs, hamstrings and quadriceps, as well as pinpoint stubborn sore muscle areas and get rid of chronic muscle tightness, he says. It comes in three sizes: 11 inches, 18 inches and 22 inches.
“If you’re looking to add more pressure to the muscles, using a roller with edges and grooves can provide more intensity,” says certified strength and conditioning specialist Kristina Jennings. She recommends this one from Rollga, which has multiple grooves to provide a contoured fit to the body and make it easier to target trigger points, according to the brand. It’s also made from professional-grade EPP foam, which can hold more than 2,000 pounds, according to the brand.
The Rumble Roller, another recommendation from Jennings, is a firm textured roller with flexible bumps that continuously knead the affected areas of your body, according to the brand. The bumps are less than two inches apart, so you get a good amount of massaging pressure. The foam roller is also water-resistant and repels dirt, according to the brand.
If you’re looking for a more affordable foam roller, this one has a flat surface to provide gentle pressure, making it a good place to start for someone new to foam rolling, says Jennings. It comes in sizes ranging from 18 inches up to 36 inches. With the longer length, you can work on larger body areas like the hamstrings and back of both of your legs, says Conrad.
Foam rollers have multiple benefits depending on when in your workout you decide to use them, says Gallucci. Prior to a workout, they can break up adhesions, increase circulation and lengthen your muscles, warming them up for activity. After a workout, you can use them as a deep tissue massager.
Whether you should use a foam roller before or after your workout depends on your goal, according to Conrad. “If done before an exercise, it will help improve range of motion, elasticity and flexibility. If done after your workout, the main goals are to decrease spasm and delayed onset muscle soreness, which will help you get back to working out faster,” says Conrad.
Anyone can benefit from using a foam roller, especially those with soreness, muscle stiffness or fatigue. To properly foam roll, place the sore body part on top of the roller and use your body weight to slowly roll back and forth over the muscle or muscle group, says Gallucci.
When using a foam roller, breath through the rolling motion as it hits the affected body parts, says Jennings. You can also use a roller up against the wall to make the motion easier.
If you’re new to foam rolling, choose a roller that’s lighter and less intense, says Jennings. Gallucci suggests taking breaks between sessions and gradually increasing the intensity and duration to avoid post-session pain or bruising. “Remember, foam rolling can be uncomfortable, but [it] should never be extremely painful,” he says.
If you have a more serious injury, such as a muscle tear or fracture, avoid foam rolling since it can make pain worse, experts say. You should also avoid foam rolling over bony areas; bones are often mistaken for muscle adhesions, and continuously rolling over them can cause pain and inflammation, says Gallucci. You should also avoid rolling the lower back, neck and joints since hyperextension of these areas can cause further injury and inflammation to the tendons and ligaments, he says.
If you’re unsure about whether a foam roller is right for you, you should consult your physical therapist, certified athletic trainer or physician.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-walking-shoes-men-rcna159074,8 best men’s walking shoes of 2025,,"I walk about five miles on an average workday. While I love a stylish pair of loafers, I want my feet to feel comfortable and supported, so I almost always put on a pair of walking shoes. I’m not alone in my thinking, when I take a look around New York City many people are sporting some type of walking shoe.
But what makes walking shoes more comfortable than other kinds of shoes? And can my running shoes pull double duty? I spoke with podiatrists to find out, and I got their top-picks for the best walking shoes for men.
SKIP AHEAD The best walking shoes for men | How to shop for men’s walking shoes | Why trust NBC Select?
I spoke with podiatrists to learn more about what to consider when shopping for the perfect pair of men’s walking shoes. To select our top picks, I kept the following advice in mind:
Our recommendations come from a mix of expert and NBC Select staff picks, mostly from shoe brands like Brooks, New Balance, Hoka and On Running. Most of our picks are technically running shoes, but running shoes are generally a great choice for most types of walking, according to our experts.
All of our recommendations come in different colors and patterns — browse each retailer to find your favorite style.
“I had what you could best describe as a Cinderella moment when lacing these up for the first time,” says NBC commerce editor Jordan Bowman. The Cloud X3 are so comfortable, well-cushioned and stable that Bowman’s previous walking shoes just couldn’t compete.
The shoe has a molded, firmer heel and a wide platform for your toes, as well as a star-shaped lace pattern at the top of the foot. The upper is made with mesh fabric, which Bowman finds breathable and cooling. The outsole has a mostly smooth but grippy tread, appropriate for paved surfaces. The comfort, support and style helped make this shoe a winner in our most recent NBC Select Wellness Awards.
Sizes: 7-14 | Widths: medium | Heel drop: 8 mm | Weight: 8.57 oz (243 g)
The Brooks Ghost Max are my go-to walking shoes. The brand sent me a pair of the second version in late 2024 to test, and I’ve been wearing them to work and around town ever since. They are one of the brand’s most cushioned shoes, and it feels incredibly comfortable even after all-day strolls.
The toebox is very spacious, with enough room for all my toes to rest comfortably, but not float around unsupported. The shoe has a slight rocker shape that helps propel you forward. The outsole is also made of textured, grippy rubber that feels stable on all sorts of flat terrain, in my experience.
Sizes: 7-15 | Widths: medium, wide, extra wide | Heel drop: 6 mm | Weight: 10.8 oz (306.2 g)
This walking shoe comes recommended by Dr. Miguel Cunha, a podiatrist and founder of Gotham Footcare. They are lightweight, comfortable and machine washable. Plus, they can easily be worn with or without socks, and feel cozy on hot and cold days, says Cunha. While I did not have the best time running in them (despite the name), they were perfectly comfortable for a few miles around town.
The outsole is mostly smooth, with no deep tread to speak of, so these are best for paved surfaces or the treadmill.
Sizes: 8-14 | Widths: medium | Heel drop: 9.6 mm | Weight: 8.6 oz (244 g)
These shoes are lightweight, breathable and durable, making them well-suited to all-day wear, says Cunha. The textured, grippy outsoles add traction and durability, and the shoe is offered in a good range of size and width options. Plus, they are the lowest-priced shoe on our list at around $75.
Sizes offered: 7-15 | Widths offered: medium, wide, extra wide | Heel drop: 10mm | Weight: 9.5 oz (269 g)
If you’re looking for a wide toe-box shoe, Cunha recommends the Hoka Clifton 9. The shoe has a spacious toe-box that accommodates most wide feet and bunions, says Cunha. I’ve walked and run many miles in these shoes — they have a wide, spacious and  supportive footbed. The mesh upper is breathable, and the outsole has deeper lugs for added durability and traction in varied terrain.
The shoe is also available in medium and wide width sizing, as well as a waterproof GTX version.
Sizes: 7-16 | Widths: medium, wide | Heel drop: 5 mm | Weight: 8.7 oz (247 g)
If you’ve got miles and miles ahead of you, Cunha recommends the latest Brooks Ghost shoes for extra durability, arch cushioning and shock absorption. I’ve worn various Ghost shoes over the past five years, including the 16s — they are comfortable, balanced and easy to walk in. The outsole is thick and grippy — I’ve never felt any uneven traction while wearing them. They also have four different width options.
Sizes: 7-15 | Widths: narrow, medium, wide, extra wide | Heel drop: 12 mm | Weight: 9.5 oz (269.3 g)
NBC Select video producer Josh Rios, says he usually wears stylish shoes with little comfort, but that all changed when he tried the New Balance Fresh Foam. The New Balance Fresh Foam series are recommended in our guides to men’s running shoes and women’s sneakers for wide feet, and this latest version comes in more sizes and width options than the v13s that Rios wears. The shoes have a breathable mesh upper and a lug pattern on the outsole for tackling uneven terrain. “If I’m doing a ton of walking, I know these shoes will hold me down,” says Rios.
Sizes: 7-16 | Widths: narrow, medium, wide, extra wide | Heel drop: 6 mm | Weight: 10.5 oz (298 g)
“These sandals are engineered with a meta-rocker sole similar to the bottom of a boat that allows your foot to smoothly roll from heel to toe minimizing shock on your foot, ankle, knees and back,” says Cunha.
The slides are, naturally, very breathable, especially if you forgo socks. They have a wide base and moderate stability and support, according to the brand. Unlike our other recommendations, they are best for recovery and casual use, not miles of walking around town.
Sizes: 7-14 | Widths: medium | Heel drop: 6 mm | Weight: 7.8 oz (221g)
Walking shoes have more flexible soles that allow for the natural motion of walking, says Cunha. While many of our recommendations are running shoes, they are also a good choice for walking, according to our experts. Running shoes have slightly stiffer soles, and prioritize stability and shock absorption to better support high-impact activities, says Cunha.
Regardless of the type of walking shoes you consider, our experts say to keep the following in mind:
If you will mostly be walking outside, look for shoes with a more durable outside and tread patterns, says Cunha.
If you plan to walk mostly on a treadmill, look for lightweight shoes with adequate cushioning — treadmills are softer and more uniform than outdoor terrain, says Cunha.
Our experts recommend trying on shoes in-person, or even better, get fitted at a store that specializes in running or athletic shoes. Shoe stores usually have specialty tools and an informed staff that can help you identify and consider things like your foot shape, arch type and gait. Some stores can even perform a treadmill analysis of your walk.
Cunha recommends shopping in-person later in the day when your feet are a little swollen. “If your walking shoes are comfortable at the end of the day when your feet are tired and swollen, they most likely will feel good throughout the day,” he says.
Experts recommend replacing most types of sneakers every 300 to 500 miles, including walking shoes. Make a note of when you buy a new pair, and put a reminder for yourself every six months or so to consider your mileage.
There are three types of arches: flat, neutral and high, says Dr. Olga Shvets, a podiatrist at Central Park Podiatry. You can learn more in our full story about how to identify your arch type.
Shvets finds that people with flat feet do well in neutral (or pronator) shoes. She also recommends an insert to help the shoe fit in a more neutral manner. Anyone with a high arch may benefit from a high lacing shoe to keep the ankle stable, as well as inserts like orthotics.
The best way to get a precise determination of your foot type is to consult a podiatrist, especially if you are experiencing foot pains and discomfort, says Cunha.

While Spanx is known for its shapewear, they also make some clothing basics — like these leggings. They are seamless, so they won’t rub or chafe and hit your natural waist. They have high compression to hold you in and provide a streamlined look. The brand does note they run small, so you may want to size up.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-workout-socks-rcna184130,8 editor-approved workout socks for all fitness activities,,"I used to think all socks were the same, a pack of cotton socks were all-purpose in my eyes. I would pick up a pack from the drugstore and use them for everything. That was until I finally tried dedicated workout socks. These socks help me get through my exercise in ways I couldn’t imagine, including giving me more compression in my arches and increasing overall comfort.
However, not all workout socks are the same. Many are designed for specific exercises like running, cycling and more. To help you find the best workout socks for your fitness journey, I spoke to experts about what to consider, including fabric compositions and gathered NBC Select-staff favorites that align with their expert guidance.

Choosing the best workout socks is often based on personal preferences, including design features and materials. However, our experts helped weigh in on key features to be mindful of when shopping. When curating this list, I kept the following in mind:

Feetures make some of our favorite socks, including the Elite Max Cushion pair. I wear them for every activity — running, HIIT classes, strength training — because they make my arches feel more comfortable, thanks to its medium compression. They also offer so much cushioning that it feels like pillows are on my feet. Although they initially feel thick and plush, they are lightweight and breathable, so my feet never feel sweaty after 30+ minutes of constant movement. Plus, I noticed they hold up well even after frequent wear and washes.
Material: 74% Polyester; 21% Nylon; 5% Spandex | Compression: medium | Size range: women’s 4-13, men’s 6-15.5 | Color options: 13
To run the New York City Marathon, NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson chose her Saucony sneakers with these accompanying socks. “I prefer the ankle-height option because they help make me feel more stable when running,” she says. The Saucony is also good at wicking away sweat thanks to the polyester construction and it has decent stretch thanks to the spandex.
Material: 97% polyester, 3% spandex | Compression: light | Size range: L (8-12), XL (13-15) | Color options: 3
NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin loves these Wellness Award winners, which she can wear with all shoes for any fitness activity because they have enough cushion to support her as she runs, trains and more. Our testers also love that they are breathable and moisture-wicking, and they never have issues with the socks falling or slipping off their heel as they move around.
Material: 63% polyester, 18% nylon, 16% cotton, 3% elastane | Compression: n/a | Size range: S (4-7.5), M (8-10.5), L (11-13) | Color options: 7
When running outside or cycling in sub-40-degree temperatures, NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz chooses this Swiftwick Pursuit pair. “My hands and feet get cold easily, so I pay special attention to socks and gloves during winter,” he says. “These socks are made with 60% Merino wool, which keeps my feet much warmer than any other material I’ve tried.”
Material: 60% Merino wool, 36% nylon, 4% spandex | Compression: moderate | Size range: women’s 8-13, men’s 7-11.5 | Color options: 6
Experts in our guide to the best Pilates socks suggest these grip socks because they’re durable, snug and support your arches. The ankle socks have slight cushioning, and to prevent any discomfort, they also have a heel tab to protect the Achilles tendon, according to the brand.
Material: 73% cotton, 14% nylon, 7% elastane, 6% polyester | Compression: light | Size range: XS (4-6), S (6-8), M (8.5-10.5), L (11-13), XL (13-14) | Color options: 28 colors, including bold and neutral options
“These running socks hug my arches just the right amount, which helps reduce swelling when I’m on my long runs,” says Swanson. “Inevitably, my feet will always be sore after 17 miles, but these make a huge difference in the level of comfort I experience.”
Material: 65% polypropylene, 33% polyamide, 2% elastane | Compression: moderate | Size range: women’s 5-13, men’s 3.5-12.5 | Color options: 8
“I love that these socks are toeless and breathable because I overheat easily, so I can wear them without wanting to immediately rip them off,” says NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who practices yoga most mornings in her living room. “The grips on the bottom work on a range of yoga mats, in my experience, and they help to keep the sock from sliding around on my foot. I’ve had these socks for years and the grippies are all still in place after being washed over and over.”
Material: 98% polyester, 2% spandex | Compression: n/a | Size range: one size fits most | Color options: 2
“These are by far my favorite workout and lounge socks,” says NBC Select page Ella Morrissey, who loves the Bombas Marl Ankle Socks so much she purchased them in a pack. “They are incredibly comfortable, have the right level of thickness, and don’t get worn down by my shoes when I’m running.” Although this quartet is in women’s sizing, it also comes in men’s sizing.
Material: 74% supima cotton, 23% polyester, 3% elastane | Compression: n/a | Size range: S (4-7.5), M (8-10.5), L (11-13) | Color options: 3
To help you determine which workout sock is best, our experts suggest looking at material composition, compression, cushion and more.
You might notice a few different fabric blends in workout socks because certain materials have specific benefits, including sweat-wicking. Below, Preeti Gopinath, an associate professor of textiles at The New School’s Parsons School of Design, breaks down five you may commonly see on a label:
While the material of your sock may depend on personal preference, it’s also essential to pay attention to how it impacts the overall health of your foot when working out. Socks made 100% out of synthetic materials may increase the risk of infections like athlete’s foot because they may not find the balance of moisture-wicking and breathability, says Dr. Alicia Canzanese, a board-certified podiatrist. Therefore, socks should combine natural and synthetic fabrics to increase the benefits and lower risk, Canzanese says.
On the sock label, you may see arch support and arch compression; however, they do not mean the same thing or are used interchangeably. Arch compression is an excellent quality in workout socks because it helps with comfortability by increasing blood flow and helps reduce swelling and fluid build-up, according to Canzanese. It can also provide relief from plantar fasciitis, says Dr. Priya Parthasarathy, a board-certified podiatrist. Calf compression socks can help support conditions like shin splints and ankle instability and prevent generalized swelling, according to Parthasarathy.
With socks, you don’t want too much of a good thing; instead, you’ll want more balance when it comes to cushioning. Cushioning plays a significant role in comfortability; however, too much cushioning can take up more room in your shoe and can increase the risk of blisters because there’s a risk of more friction with a lack of space, says Canzanese. If you need lots of cushioning for comfort, you’re better off looking for that in your workout sneakers instead of a pair of socks or wearing multiple layers of socks, she says.
The socks should fit like a glove especially around the arch, says Parthasarathy. You also want the heel area of the sock to align with your foot without the sock itself stretching out. Your feet should not slide around in the socks, nor should your feet feel restricted in them. This helps you avoid blisters, discomfort and injury, according to our experts.
Workout socks will come in multiple lengths including no show, ankle, crew and quarter. The decision of the cut will likely fall on personal preference and the activity you choose, according to our experts. However, more fabric can provide more protection, says Parthasarathy.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-womens-running-shoes-rcna186683,"The 13 best women’s running shoes of 2025, tested & reviewed",,"There are many things you can’t control when you go for a run: the treadmills are occupied at the gym, it starts raining halfway through your workout or a street is closed on your favorite route, for example. One thing you have complete control over? Your running shoes.
As a runner for about a decade, I can confidently say that sneakers can make or break your run. And while picking a pair can feel daunting, it all comes down to comfort. “A really good pair of running shoes should almost disappear on your feet,” says Heini Tallent, a certified running coach and the owner of Elements Running Education. “You shouldn’t think about them and they shouldn’t get in the way of you doing your thing.”
I spoke to experts about how to shop for the best women’s running shoes, whether you’re a beginner or marathoner. They also shared tips for finding the perfect fit and explained whether women’s running sneakers are actually different from men’s.

First thing first: You need to run in running shoes. Sneakers labeled as walking, training or workout shoes won’t cut it. “Running shoes are specifically designed for running miles and miles,” says Dr. Alicia Canzanese, a podiatrist, certified athletic trainer and owner of Gordon Podiatry in Glenside, Pennsylvania. “Their whole purpose is to help you strike the ground and propel you forward to the next step, and make sure you do so efficiently, effectively and safely to prevent injury.”
With that in mind, here are the most important factors experts recommend considering while shopping for running shoes.
The women’s running shoes I recommend below are expert or NBC Select staff picks. I tested many of them while running indoors on the treadmill and outdoors on the road. I included the following information about each pair: weight, material, heel drop, sizes and widths. All the sneakers come in various color options and half and full sizes.
I’ve run in these sneakers for years and think they’re a reliable road running shoe and comfortable to wear on the treadmill. Canzanese recommends them, too, saying they’re a great option for casual runners or advanced runners looking for a solid daily trainer. The sneakers have a moderate amount of cushioning, effectively absorbing shock while padding my feet without lifting me off the ground much. Their soft midsole — the section between a shoe’s upper and outsole that forms the main support system — and segmented heel pad promotes smooth heel-to-toe transitions, according to the brand. The Ghosts are designed with a wider toe box, so they’re typically comfortable for those with bunions or frequent joint pain in their big toes, says Canzanese.
Weight: 8.5 oz. | Material: mesh | Heel drop: 12 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 13 | Widths: standard, wide, narrow and extra wide
“I really like the Saucony Ride for casual runners who want a nice cushioned shoe, and have a relatively neutral arch and normal foot type,” says Canzanese. This sneaker is made with soft, lightweight, responsive foam and its breathable mesh upper is slightly stretchy to adapt to your foot shape. The shoe’s rubber outsole has groves that add traction, plus its heel collar is cushioned for added comfort.
Weight: 8 oz. | Material: mesh | Heel drop: 8 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: standard and wide
Whether I reach for these sneakers for a four-mile warmup on the treadmill or a challenging 10-mile loop in Central Park, I know I’ll have a good run. I wear them weekly between my long-distance runs and speedwork, so they’re a staple in my rotation. Their cushioning keeps my feet incredibly comfortable, and while it’s on the softer side, I never feel like I’m sinking into it. The shoes have a bouncier feel and a gentle rocker-shaped outsole for smooth heel-toe transitions. They’re also made with a solid rubber outsole, which adds a touch of stiffness, helps with rebound and grips whatever surface I run on.
Weight: 8.3 oz. | Material: mesh | Heel drop: 6 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 13 | Widths: narrow, standard, wide and extra wide
“My absolute favorite running shoe of the last few years is the Saucony Endorphin Speed 4,” says Tallent, who ran a few marathons in them and appreciates that they support her on long runs and while doing speedwork. NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson swears by them, too. “Even when I get tempted to switch, I always return to my Saucony Endorphins,” she says. “They have such a good spring, are roomy for long distances and are super lightweight. I’ve run three out of four of my marathons in them and plan to run many more in them, too.”
Tallent says the Saucony Endorphins are cushioned, but their foam isn’t super soft. They have a winged nylon plate in their midsole, which adds some rigidity while still giving you flexibility — the nylon plate is a friendlier version of a carbon plate, she says. The sneaker’s tongue is connected to its upper, so it doesn’t move as you run.
Weight: 7.2 oz. | Material: engineered mesh | Heel drop: 8 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: standard
The Pegasus is one of Nike’s most basic sneakers for everyday road running. It has a moderate amount of cushioning in the midsole, a grippy waffle-patterned rubber outsole and a plush tongue and sock liner. The shoes also have reflective details to increase runners’ visibility in low-light conditions. I usually find Nike’s sneakers to be narrower, but these fit true to size, in my experience. They give my feet enough room to expand when I run longer distances and are comfortable to wear for hours.
Weight: 8.8 oz. | Material: mesh | Heel drop: 10 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: regular and wide
Brooks Go-To-Support, or GTS, sneakers are designed with the brand’s GuideRails system and are made from two pieces of firm foam on either side of the heel. It helps prevent overpronation, common in those with flat feet, and provides stability, according to the brand.
“I wear these running shoes because I have a flatter foot that needs a bit more support and stability, but I still want that lightweight, cushioned feel,” says Canzanese. “Some arch support shoes can feel a bit heavy, and some stability shoes can feel pretty firm, but the Brooks Glycerin GTS gives me the best combination of lightweight cushioning and arch support.” The shoes also have a flexible knit upper and a pillowy soft, responsive feel.
Weight: 9.2 oz. | Material: synthetic fabric | Heel drop: 10 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: standard and wide
Feet with high arches are rigid and prone to rolling outward (over supination), so they have difficulty absorbing shock, says Canzanese. They need extra help from shoes with lots of cushioning, like the Asics Gel-Nimbus. The sneakers are made with a thick layer of soft foam and a gel material in the midsole that helps absorb shock, soften landings and contribute to smooth transitions, according to the brand. They have a plush, stretchy knitted tongue and collar, a grippy rubber outsole and reflective details.
NBC Select editor Lindsay Schneider has been wearing Asics for years and says the brand’s sneakers will always be her tried and true. “I’ve tried at least five or six models at this point, and each of them has always been consistently more comfortable than any other shoe brand I’ve ever worn,” she says. “They’re super cushiony and can withstand lots of use.”
Weight: 9.2 mm. | Material: knit | Heel drop: 8 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 13 | Widths: standard and wide
“If somebody comes to see me and they have bunions or joint pain in their big toes, or if they need more space at the front of their shoes in general, I recommend the Hoka Gaviotas,” says Canzanese. “They have a little bit of arch support built in, and they’re really roomy and round by the toe.” These sneakers are designed with Hoka’s H-Frame stabilizing system, which helps prevent overpronation, according to the brand. It’s composed of a strong piece of foam that runs along the perimeter of the midsole and connects in the middle. The Gaviotas also have a plush tongue and collar, a rocker-shaped outsole and a thick layer of soft cushioning.
Weight: 9.10 oz. | Material: creel jacquard | Heel drop: 6 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: standard and wide
The Cloudeclipse is On’s most cushioned shoe, with a thick midsole that lifts you off the ground by about two inches. It’s one of my favorite running sneakers of the past year because it protects my joints and helps me continuously roll through strides. The soft yet firm foam creates a supportive barrier between the ground and my body, absorbing impact mile after mile. Meanwhile, the pods in the shoe’s midsole compress as my feet hit the ground and expand as I take off, softening my landings and propelling me forward. The Cloudeclipse’s tongue is connected to its upper to prevent it from moving while I’m running, and the rubber pads on its outsole add extra traction, especially in wet conditions.
Weight: about 10 oz. | Material: recycled polyester | Heel drop: 6 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 11 | Widths: standard
“The best part about these sneakers is how lightweight they are, which is something I didn’t expect when I first saw them since they look chunkier than my other running shoes,” says former NBC Select associate reporter Bianca Alvarez. “I feel like there’s nothing on my feet when I run in them. They help me move freely and quickly without my feet dragging or being weighed down.” The sneakers have a low-profile layer of semi-firm cushioning to keep your feet closer to the ground, and their grippy rubber outsole makes them extra durable, says Alvarez. The shoe’s tongue is connected to the upper, so it doesn’t move as you run.
Weight: 6.7 oz. | Material: creel jacquard | Heel drop: 5 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 11 | Widths: standard and wide
I recommend wearing the Adidas UltraBoost sneakers if you do intervals that involve short bursts of running with longer periods of walking. They’re simple, cushioned shoes made with lightweight, responsive foam that pads my feet regardless of pace. The sneakers also have a molded external heel support that adds stability and a grippy rubber outsole. One of my favorite parts of this sneaker is its knit upper, designed similarly to a pull-on shoe, so it doesn’t have a tongue. It hugs my feet and makes them feel very secure. Plus, I never worry about uncomfortable tongue migration during the workout.
Weight: 8.36 oz. | Material: mesh knit | Heel drop: 10 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: standard
Zero-drop shoes have a heel drop of zero, which means their cushioning is equally distributed across their midsole, putting your heel at the same level as your toes, says Tallent. She says they promote a natural foot position and stride, making them best for experienced runners with proper running technique. If you’ve never worn zero-drop running sneakers, it’s important to gradually ease into them or work with a coach to make sure you’re carrying yourself correctly to avoid injury, says Canzanese.
Altra is known for its zero drop shoes, like the Via Olympus 2, one of the brand’s most cushioned models. It has a thick, soft foam midsole, a grippy rubber rocker-shaped outsole and a molded heel collar that keeps your feet secure. The sneaker is also designed with a roomy toe box, allowing space to spread out your toes and making it suitable for those with bunions.
Weight: 9.6 oz. | Material: mesh | Heel drop: 0 mm. | Sizes: 5.5 to 12 | Widths: standard
I test over two dozen running sneakers a year, so it takes a lot to impress me with something that truly feels brand new — Brooks managed to do so recently with the Glycerin Max. It has a high stack height, billowy midsole and prominent rocker-shaped outsole; all features that feel like a big departure from the brand’s typical low-profile, streamlined silhouette. And I love it. The sneakers are bouncy and responsive, and once I start running in them, I don’t want to stop. They successfully absorb impact whether I’m running on the road or treadmill, protecting my joints and eliminating pain in my knees and ankles. I’m a big fan of the Glycerin Max, so much so that I have to force myself to rotate them with a different pair every few days.
Weight: 9.5 oz. | Material: mesh | Heel drop: 6 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: standard
Men’s and women’s running shoes should be different because men’s and women’s feet are anatomically different, says Canzanese. However, some brands sell the same shoe in different sizes, so the men’s and women’s versions may be identical depending on which model you buy. That said, shoes designed for women tend to have a narrower shape, and those designed for men tend to have a wider shape. “Women’s feet are typically narrower toward the heel and wider toward the forefoot, while men’s feet tend to be wider overall,” says Canzanese.
“The general rule of thumb is between 300 and 500 miles,” says Canzanese. “It’s a big range because everybody beats up their shoes at a different rate.”
Calculate how many miles you run a week to figure out when to swap out your sneakers. That gives you an idea of how long it typically takes you to hit about 300 miles. Then, once you’re approaching that point, examine your shoes. Think about their condition, including how they feel on your feet. Some of the signs you need a new pair include worn-down treads on the outsole, a stretched-out upper, a less bouncy or less supportive feel and decreased cushioning in the midsole.
Beginner and casual runners don’t need to rotate their running shoes, meaning cycling through a few different pairs a week, says Tallent. But experienced runners may want to consider it. “If you’re doing long slow runs some days and fast speedwork other days, you might want to have different shoes for different purposes,” she says. Also, if you’re someone who runs high mileages most days of the week, alternating between two or three pairs of shoes is a good idea. “Cushioning takes some time to fully rebound after a run,” says Tallent. “If you run in the same pair of shoes every single day, the cushioning might never fully bounce back, which means they likely won’t last very long.”

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-sports-bras-ncna1306036,13 best sports bras for workouts,,"On average, I spend two hours a day in a sports bra. I run about 30 miles a week and cross train with yoga, barre, Pilates and weight lifting, so every activity calls for something a little different. And as someone with a larger cup size, finding a sports bra that’s actually supportive is easier said than done, which is why I’m passionate about testing year round to find the absolute best options. That said, everyone’s body, preferences and activity level are different, so several NBC Select staff members try sports bras with me, allowing us to compare notes.
To date, our team has tested dozens of sports bras. We sweat in them, clean them and wear them again and again to decide which ones actually deserve a place in our closet. To compile the final list of favorites below, I also spoke to bra experts to learn what features make or break a reliable sports bra.

While shopping for sports bras, experts suggest considering the following factors, all of which I kept in mind while choosing models to include in our final list of favorites.
To compile this list, NBC Select staff and I tested dozens of sports bras ranging in style, construction, support level and price point. We exercised in each one multiple times, doing low, medium and high impact activities like running, HIIT workouts, barre, Pilates, yoga and walking. We cleaned each sports bra according to the brand’s directions to evaluate how well they maintained their shape and feel pre- and post- workout — often, that meant machine-washing the bras with cold water and gentle laundry detergent, and air-drying them. Brands sent us sports bras as courtesy samples.
All of the sports bras I recommend below align with expert guidance and are options testers found to be the most supportive during a variety of workouts. Many come in various colors and patterns, so if you’re looking for something specific, browse the full selections online. And remember, no sport bra is perfect for all wearers, so it might take some trial-and-error to find the right one for you.
This bra’s molded, padded cups help separate my breasts to evenly distribute their weight across my chest, and they’re lined with a moisture-wicking material to keep me cool and dry while working out. Its compressive fabric also reduces bounce during high impact activities like running, boxing, dancing and HIIT. The bra’s sturdy, wide, adjustable underband unclasps at the back, making it easy to take off. Plus, the adjustable X-shaped straps lay flat against my skin.
Sizes: XS to L+ | Adjustability: band and straps | Construction: combination | Support level: high | Material: nylon, spandex, mesh
Spanx’s medium impact sports bra has more structure than a low impact bra thanks to its padded, molded cups, but less motion control than a high impact bra since it’s not super compressive. I mostly wear it on the elliptical machine and during strength-focused HIIT classes, but it would also work well for cycling and rowing. The bra’s soft band and wide, crisscross straps lay flat against my skin, so they stay in place while I’m moving. Its fabric is lightweight and breathable, plus it dries pretty quickly, so I often wear it during hot yoga and Pilates.
As someone with a larger bust size, I find that this bra almost fully covers my chest — its lower neckline creates some cleavage, but I feel secure overall. The sides of the sports bra are high, so they extend upward toward my armpit and help prevent spillage.
Sizes: XS to 3X | Adjustability: band and straps | Construction: combination | Support level: medium | Material: nylon, elastane
“When I say I’ve worn this sports bra to every workout class imaginable, I mean it,” says Bianca Alvarez, NBC Select associate reporter. “I normally put a top over it, but sometimes I just wear the sports bra, and I’ve never worried about spilling out of it. The best part is that it’s genuinely comfortable because the crisscross straps and the band don’t dig into my skin.” Alvarez also throws on the sports bra while lounging around at home and for long flights. It has a scoop neck and a keyhole cutout on the back.
Sizes: XXS to XL | Adjustability: straps | Construction: compression | Support level: low | Material: polyester, elastane
I experience no bounce or movement whatsoever while running in this sports bra, which is exactly what I look for whether I’m sprinting, jogging or doing a race. It has a full-coverage high neckline and compressive, molded, padded cups that secure my chest in place, as well as give it a round shape.
Since I can adjust the racerback straps, I can make sure they don’t slip down while I’m moving, so I never get distracted by them. The back of On’s sports bra has a mesh panel that lets air circulate through it, keeping me cool and drying sweat as I’m working out. The only downside I found is that when I’m sweaty after a run, it can be challenging to pull off this sports bra since the band doesn’t unclasp. However, that’s a small inconvenience considering how supported I feel while wearing it.
Sizes: XS to XL D-DD  | Adjustability: straps | Construction: combination | Support level: medium to high | Material: recycled polyester and polyamide, elastane
When experts told me to look for simple, straightforward sports bras that allow me to focus on my workout rather than what I’m wearing, Girlfriend Collective’s Paloma racerback bra is the first one that came to mind. It gently compresses my chest to hold it in place during low to medium intensity workouts like yoga and strength training — I experienced some bounce while wearing it during high intensity workouts like running. The bra has a longline silhouette, so it can double as a crop top, and it’s soft and flexible, allowing me to move freely. It’s comfortable enough to wear while I’m lounging at home or doing errands. Its fabric also has UPF 45+ protection, so it blocks sunlight to protect your skin from UVA and UVB rays. My favorite part of this full-coverage bra is the thick, wide support band that lifts me up and holds everything in.
Sizes: XXS to 6XL | Adjustability: none | Construction: compression | Support level: medium | Material: recycled plastic bottles, spandex
You can buy Nike’s Non-Padded Adjustable Sports Bra in light, medium and high support levels, but my favorite style by far is the high support option because it has an adjustable band. I make it tighter or looser using the Velcro strap, which I can reach behind my back and pull into position while wearing the bra. Being able to adjust the band’s tightness when it’s on my body helps me perfect its fit, and I can completely loosen the band before taking the bra off. Nike’s racerback sports bra has compressive, sweat-wicking fabric that holds my chest in place and dries very quickly.
Sizes: XS to 3X | Adjustability: band | Construction: compression | Support level: high | Material: polyester, spandex, mesh
The straps on Brooks’ sports bra have adjustable hook-and-ladder mechanisms built in, which solve the biggest problem I’ve experienced with traditional sliders — they tend to slip down while I’m exercising, causing the bra’s fit to become loose. The hook-and-ladder adjusters let me lock in a tightness level, and I can count how many loops up from the bottom I place the hook in to ensure that the straps are even on both sides. The strap adjusters also face outward, so the metal pieces don’t touch my skin. Beyond the innovative adjustable straps, this bra has molded cups and the back panel has mesh elements so air can flow through.

Out of all the sports bras in my closet, I wear this one most frequently because it’s suitable for every type of exercise I do. It holds me in and reduces bounce while I’m running, yet is flexible, semi-stretchy, soft and non-restrictive, which is ideal for activities like yoga. You can wear the wide straps crisscross or straight — I find that the straps give me the most lift and don’t move around in the crisscross position. The bra’s thick elastic band adds extra support, and it anchors the compressive fabric in place.
Sizes: XS to 4XL | Adjustability: straps | Construction: compression | Support level: medium | Material: nylon, lycra
I wouldn’t normally workout in a strappy back sports bra — when the straps get twisted or tangled, I find it distracting and uncomfortable.
But this bra’s four crisscross straps are wide and flat, which helps prevent them from shifting while I’m moving. They’re also adjustable so I can customize the bra’s fit. Lululemon’s Energy Bra is made with molded foam cups, a sturdy underband, full coverage and compressive fabric. Overall, its high level of support and adjustability outweighs a potential twisted strap or two.
Sizes: 32B to 40D | Adjustability: band and straps | Construction: combination | Support level: high | Material: nylon, elastane
Third Love’s sports bra comes in one of the most extensive size ranges I’ve found — it’s available in eight cup sizes and seven underband sizes. The bra is convertible, so I can move the wide, adjustable straps into straight or crisscross positions, and it has semi-full to full coverage on the top and sides. The underband and highly padded cups shape breasts while evenly distributing their weight across my chest. I also appreciate that the band doesn’t have a tag by its closure, which often makes me itchy even when I cut it off before my first wear.
Sizes: 32 to 44 band, A to H cups | Adjustability: band and straps | Construction: combination | Support level: medium to high | Material: polyester, spandex
“This sports bra is supportive, stylish and provides a good amount of coverage,” says NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio. “As someone with atrocious posture, I appreciate that it pulls my shoulders back and immediately makes me straighten my spine, preventing my back from feeling painful or sore after a workout. Plus, I always get compliments when I wear it.”
Forme’s Power Bra is a posture corrector that uses tension fabrics and various panels to encourage proper upper body alignment while you’re wearing it, according to the brand. Its wide straps support your chest while evenly distributing weight across your shoulders, and the mesh fabric on the back of the bra increases airflow. The posture correcting bra doesn’t restrict my movement at all when I wear it.
Sizes: XS to 3XL | Adjustability: none | Construction: compression | Support level: medium | Material: not specified
“As someone with a larger chest, I have a lot of opinions about sports bras and their support — or lack thereof,” says Rosalie Sparaco, NBC commerce senior social media editor. “This is one of the most supportive bras I’ve ever worn, period. Every single aspect of it, from the straps to the band, is adjustable, making it easy to be sure everything stays where it should and isn’t bouncing around too much. Plus, it doesn’t chafe or feel extra sweaty at the end of a workout, which is a big deal for me.” SheFit’s sports bra has a front-zip closure and removable cups, as well as 15 inches of lift in the wide shoulder straps and 8 inches of cinch in the rib band. The straps are also convertible, so you can wear them crisscross or straight.
Sizes: XS to 6Luxe | Adjustability: band and straps | Construction: compression | Support level: high | Material: nylon, spandex, polyester
Anyone who runs long-distance knows how many supplies you need to bring on your route: energy gels, electrolytes, a sunscreen stick, your phone, sunglasses and an extra hair tie. Bandit’s Stamina bra can fit all of that (and more) in its three pockets — there’s one under each arm and one on the back, each of which I can easily access while I’m running. The bra is made from highly compressive, stretchy fabric that keeps my chest in place, as well as prevents everything I stuff inside its pockets from bouncing around as I move. It has racerback straps and a crop top style, so I pair it with high-waisted leggings or shorts and layer shirts over it in the chilly weather.
Sizes: XS to XL | Adjustability: none | Construction: compression | Support level: high | Material: polyester, spandex
To make sure you buy a comfortable sports bra that fits well, experts recommend keeping the following in mind.
Many sports bras are sold in alpha sizes, meaning small, medium, large and so on. While shopping, some people assume that since they wear a medium shirt, for example, they’ll fit into a medium bra. But your bra size doesn’t always match your clothing size, and if you assume incorrectly, you’ll end up bringing home an ill-fitting sports bra. That’s why it’s so important to read the sizing information on a brand’s website or, better yet, buy a sports bra that’s sold in bra sizing, which means you can choose your size based on band size and cup size, like a 32B or 40D, for example.
Beyond sizing, the key to finding a sports bra that fits well is buying one with adjustable elements. “Look for styles with adjustable shoulder straps and an underband adjustment like a hook-and-eye closure,” says Tempesta. “That’s how the bra is going to feel like it’s custom made for you.”
Sports bras also stretch out over time, so you want to be able to tighten the straps and band as needed. There should be no more than a half inch to one inch of space between your skin and the shoulder strap when you pull up on it, and no more than two to three inches of space between the skin and the underband if you pull it out, says Tempesta. Anything tighter may cause your skin to chafe, while anything looser can cause the bra to move around a lot while you’re exercising and leave you feeling unsupported.
One of the ways to ensure you’re wearing a well-fitting sports bra is to do a bounce test. Before taking the tags off your sports bra, try it on, stand in front of a mirror and jump up and down. How much bounce do you feel and see? A lot of bounce can be distracting and painful while working out, so this is a good sign you should get a more supportive sports bra, says Sena.
There are three types of sports bras you should know about while shopping:
Typically, compression sports bras are best for those with smaller chests — compression alone can keep smaller busts in place while you’re moving, says Tempesta. Those with larger chests tend to favor encapsulation sports bras because they tend to be more adjustable and structured, and don’t squeeze dense breast tissue against your chest. That said, combination sports bras are the absolute best option for those with larger chests — compression holds breasts close to your chest to minimize bounce, while molded cups keep each breast fixed in space.
Shoulder strap design is the number one most ignored part of sports bra fit, says Tempesta. Because most people have narrow or sloped shoulders, straight straps that are not adjustable — like those on a tank top — often fall down while you’re working out. Racerback or crossback straps are better options for most people.
Some bras are designed with a lot of straps that stretch across your back, which can make them seem more fashionable and stylish. But strappy-back sports bras have a few downsides you should be aware of: Straps can tangle or twist in the washing machine, they can make bras hard to put on and take off, and they may leave unattractive tan lines (or a sunburn) if you’re exercising outside.
Overall, simpler is better when it comes to sports bra straps, and wide, stiff, adjustable straps lift you up the best. Narrow, stretchy straps won’t do much for you as far as movement control or lift goes, says Tempesta.
If you’re looking for a sports bra with cups, Sena recommends opting for molded or sewn-in cups instead of removable pads. Removable pads can move around while you’re working out and cause you to become uncomfortable or distracted. And if removable pads fall out in the wash, you can easily lose them.
Some people, however, prefer removable pads despite their flaws, because they help create a rounded shape on your chest. One benefit is that you can remove them if you want a little extra room in the bra for your breasts — for example, if you find your breast size increases while menstruating, experts say.
It’s important to think about what activities you’ll be doing while wearing the sports bra when deciding how much support is right for you. There are three levels of support:
Keep in mind that there’s no industry standard for what each level of support means, and every brand defines it differently, says Tempesta. If you’re unsure about a bra and how much support it offers, experts recommend reading reviews to learn what types of activities shoppers do while wearing the bra and compare it to how you plan to wear it.
As you wear, sweat in and wash sports bras, the material they’re made from starts to break down, and the bra itself stretches out. This degradation process is inevitable, but you can extend a sports bra’s lifespan by taking care of it properly.
Be sure to read the specific care directions listed on a bra’s tag or the brand’s website, but generally, it’s best to hand-wash sports bras in cool water with a gentle laundry detergent. If you’d rather machine-wash them, use the washing machine’s delicate setting, opt for cold water and use a gentle detergent.
Most importantly, never put your sports bra — or any bra for that matter — in the dryer. “The dryer is literally like kryptonite for bras,” says Sena, adding that this is also the case for activewear like spandex leggings and exercise dresses. Subjecting bras to high heat for an extended period of time lessens their elasticity and stretches them out, thus causing them to lose their fit.
There’s no hard and fast rule about how often to replace a sports bra, says Sena. You can usually tell when a sports bra is past its prime based on how it feels on your body. When the bra’s material stretches out, you’ll begin to feel less supported by it, which is a good sign it’s starting to deteriorate. You shouldn’t think about or be distracted by your sports bra while wearing it, says Tempesta. If you are, it’s time to find a new one.
Yes, you can wear a sports bra every day. It might not give you as much shape as a typical everyday bra, but some people, especially those with larger busts, find that sports bras provide enough support and are more comfortable to wear all day. Wearing a sports bra all day, every day is entirely a personal preference, as is wearing a bra at all, says Sena.
Sports bras are specifically designed to limit breast movement during exercise, says Tempesta. They’re athletic equipment, just like dumbbells and yoga mats — sports bras support your chest to aid your performance, allowing you to have the best workout possible.
Sports bras’ function is different from regular bras, like T-shirt bras and push-up bras, which work to lift and shape breasts, as well as prevent sagging. But the difference between an “everyday bra” and a sports bra has recently become less distinguishable as wireless bras and bralettes grow in popularity, says Sena. Very often, wireless bras and bralettes look like sports bras due to their style and design, but they’re not sports bras whatsoever. Experts recommend against wearing wireless bras and bralettes for exercise since they don’t reduce movement.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/sneakers-for-wide-feet-rcna149878,The best sneakers for wide feet,,"If you have wide feet, you are likely no stranger to the feeling of tightness and pinching that comes from a new pair of shoes.. But having wide feet shouldn’t stop you from having your Cinderella moment. You may just need to focus on sneakers that have a wide width to find the perfect running or walking shoe.
“The right shoe will feel comfortable, provide adequate space for your toes to move freely, and support your foot’s natural shape and alignment,” says Dr. Isaac Tabari, a board-certified foot and ankle doctor and owner of the NYC Podiatry Center of Excellence. Thankfully, there are plenty of sneaker brands — like New Balance, Hoka and Brooks — that make shoes specifically for people with wide feet. I interviewed podiatrists about what to look for when shopping for the best women’s wide sneakers for running and walking. I included their picks along with highly-rated options and NBC Select staff recommendations that come in wide widths.
SKIP AHEAD How I picked the best sneakers for women with wide feet | The best women’s sneakers for wide feet | What happens when shoes aren’t wide enough for your feet? | How to tell if your shoes are too narrow | Why trust NBC Select?
“A wide width shoe offers more room throughout the entire shoe — including the toe box, midsole and heel,” says Tabari. But with so many wide width sneakers on the market, it can be tough to know what to focus on when shopping. Here are the things podiatrists suggest paying close attention to:
To recommend the best women’s wide sneakers for running and/or walking, I asked podiatrists to share their favorites and included NBC Select staff favorites that come in wide width, along with a few highly rated options.
I have wide feet and these are my go-to sneakers — I’ve run multiple half marathons and they have never felt tight or constrictive. Hoka is known for its shock-absorbing soles and supportive uppers. The toe box is nearly as wide as the rest of the shoe, so your toes have plenty of room to splay out. The shoe’s bottom has a rocker shape for smoother heel-to-toe transitions and the upper is made from breathable mesh, according to the brand. This shoe is also available in a version for men.
Material: Knit | Sizes: 5 to 12, medium and wide widths
Featured in our roundup of the best walking shoes, this style from Ryka comes in a wide width and is an NBC Select staff favorite. “I’ve never had dedicated walking shoes before, and this pair from Ryka showed me just how much of a difference they can make,” says Sadhana Daruvuri, NBC Select social editor. She wears them while walking her dog, in the park or around New York City to run errands. “Even when I’m in them for hours, my feet still feel cushioned and comfortable.” The lace-up sneakers are specifically designed around the shape of women’s feet, so the brand gave them a narrower heel, a roomy toe box and soft cushioning in the midsole. They also have a grippy rubber outsole, arch support built into the insole and extra cushioning in the forefoot and heel.
Material: Mesh | Sizes: 6 to 12, medium and wide widths
At under $60, these sneakers are an affordable wide width option. They have a breathable mesh upper and gel technology in the heel to provide extra cushioning and comfort, according to the brand. The shoe, which has a 4.4-star average rating from over 1,230 reviews on Amazon, also has deep treads, making it a good running shoe for various environments — like parks, streets and trails.
Material: Mesh | Sizes: 5 to 12, medium and wide widths
Skechers’ slip-on walking sneakers are one of the more affordable options on my list and have a 4.5-star average rating from over 87,220 reviews on Amazon. They have a mesh upper so your feet don’t get sweaty, lightweight cushioning and come in narrow, medium and wide widths. The sneakers also have flexible, grippy outsoles and memory foam insoles.
Material: Mesh | Sizes: 5 to 13, narrow, medium and wide widths
Though these sneakers don’t technically come in a wide width, NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown vouches for the fact that they work on wider feet. “My feet are very flat and wide and these shoes leave lots of room for my toes,” she says. “I love how sturdy they feel for workouts and casual walks and the fact that they’re also stylish is a major plus.” The molded heel offers support and the breathable upper is lightweight, according to Nike.
Material: Not specified | Sizes: 5 to 12
Like the running shoes from New Balance on my list, these walking sneakers come in wide and extra wide widths. They have a stylish vintage look, in my opinion, but deliver on comfort, too. They have a padded footbed and rubber sole for traction. They are also reinforced around the ankle for extra support as you walk, according to the brand.
Material: Mesh and suede | Sizes: 5 to 12, narrow, medium, wide and extra wide widths
Another pick from our best walking shoes roundup, these shoes are a supportive stability shoe that help people who overpronate. The sneaker has a light, springy feel, according to the brand, a cushioned insole and a rubber outsole. Not only does this shoe come in wide widths, it is available in an extra wide width, too. The shoe also has a leather upper that looks crisp and is highly durable, according to Saucony.
Material: Leather | Sizes: 5 to 13, medium, wide and extra wide widths
Tabari likes New Balance sneakers for those with wide feet because they offer both a wide width and an extra wide width. These sneakers have the brand’s Fresh Foam X midsole to provide extra cushioning without increasing the weight of the shoe, according to the brand. They have a rocker profile to propel you forward and a rubber sole for traction. The shoe also goes up to a size 13 for those with larger feet.
Material: Mesh | Sizes: 5 to 13, narrow, medium, wide and extra wide widths
These shoes don’t technically come in a wide width, but they are designed with a wide toe box, says Kuizinas. Similar to the sneakers from Hoka, these have a rocker-shaped sole that helps to propel you forward as you run and the soles are made with compression foam for comfort. The upper is made with a flexible and breathable mesh material.
Material: Mesh | Sizes: 5 to 12
This sneaker made our list of best running shoes thanks to the durability of its carbon rubber outer and cushioned sole. The shoe comes in both regular and wide widths and goes up to a size 12. The heel of this shoe contains Mizuno’s energy foam, which provides cushioning and energy return, according to the brand. The upper is seamless to prevent rubbing and friction as you move.
Material: Mesh | Sizes: 6 to 12, medium and wide widths
When your shoes aren’t wide enough to accommodate your feet, a number of problems can arise. First, you’ll likely get blisters where the shoe rubs against your feet. Shoes that are too narrow can also put unnecessary pressure on your feet. “Wide shoes provide more room for the toes to spread out naturally, reducing pressure and friction on the toes and forefoot,” says Tabari. “Tight shoes can restrict blood flow to the toes, leading to discomfort and even potential circulation issues.” Other issues caused by shoes that aren’t wide though include ingrown toenails, bunions and cramping.
When walking or running in shoes that are too narrow for your feet, you may also start overcompensating to avoid discomfort, says Kuizinas. This can lead to back pain, rolling your ankle or a number of other injuries.
Not sure if your sneakers are wide enough for your feet? “If you experience any rubbing on the big toe or pinky, your shoes are too narrow,” says Kuizinas. “You should be able to wiggle your toes properly in your shoe.” Another area where people commonly notice discomfort in narrow shoes is across the middle of the foot. If your foot feels cramped or the upper feels too tight there, you need a wider width.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-pilates-socks-rcna180148,"The best socks for Pilates, according to experts",,"When I walk into my mat or reformer Pilates class, I always bring a pair of socks to change into. I don’t like to wear my everyday cotton socks for workouts since they tend to slide around in them. Instead, I wear Pilates-specific socks, which typically have grips on the bottom that are designed to keep you from slipping.
And while you can technically do Pilates barefoot (depending on the practice and studio), most teachers require you to wear socks since it’s more sanitary and safer since the grips reduce the risk of injury. Regular cotton socks can get sweaty and move around, which is very dangerous when using any type of machine, according to Bekah Kilinski, vice president of operations and lead coach at Form50, a workout studio in New York City and Miami.
To help you find the best Pilates socks for you and your practice, I spoke to two experts about what to consider when shopping as well as how to make them last.

When curating this list, here’s what experts recommended I focus on:
The below list is a compilation of expert recommendations, NBC Select-staff favorites and highly rated options that align with experts’ guidance.
Tavi socks keep snug to your foot and last a long time, says Alavi-Parham. These low-rise socks have a compression arch support band, which helps them support your feet and maintain that secure feel on your foot, according to the brand. You can also wear these grip socks for yoga and barre workouts.
Material: 73% cotton, 14% nylon, 7% nylon, 6% polyester | Size range: XS (4-6), S (6-8), M (8.5-10.5), L (11-13), XL (13-14) | Color options: 28 colors
Kilinski recommends these machine-washable socks because they have a good amount of grip to them and easily conform to the shape of your foot well. Lucky Honey has many styles of quarter-length grip socks, and the Harlow Sock specifically comes in nine additional designs, including heart and smiley options.
Material: n/a | Size range: one size fits all | Color options: 9
These NBC Select Wellness Award winners are great for reformer Pilates because they stay in place and prevent any slipping when on the machine. “My favorite thing about Doublesoul’s grip socks is that they hit above my ankles, which helps them stay in place, especially when I’m doing quick footwork on the reformer,” says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. “The higher length also keeps my feet and ankles warm during the colder months.” Malin also loves how durable these are because the grips remained in-tact and in good condition after multiple washes.
Material: 81% cotton, 19% nylon | Size range: S (M:4.5-6.5 / W:5-8), M (M: 7-9 / W:8.5-10.5), L (M:9.5-11.5 / W:11-13), XL (M:12-14 / W: 13.5-15.5) | Color options: 4
After trying out multiple Pilates socks, NBC Select editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez likes these Bombas grippers because they’re soft and comfortable. “The material seemed thick, so I was worried my feet would get hot working out, but the material was so breathable, and they gave me a great grip on the machine,” says Rodriguez, who’s been doing reformer Pilates for four years.
Material: 72% cotton, 18% polyester, 8% nylon, 2% elastane | Size range: S (4-7.5), M (8-10.5), L (11-13) | Color options: 1
These crew-length socks are my new favorite pair because they stay tight and secure without restricting my feet or making them feel uncomfortable. They’re made of a breathable yet thick material and have an elasticized cuff to prevent them from digging into my skin.
Aside from working out in them, I love wearing these with boots since they keep my foot secure and in place, reducing any potential chance of blistering around my toes.
Material: 75% cotton, 17% polyester, 8% elastane | Size range: S (5-7.5), M (8-10), L (11-12) | Color options: 12
Although these are barre socks, many reviewers say they’re great for Pilates because of its silicone, no-slip grips that cover the entire bottom. Reviewers say that they don’t experience issues with these sliding off during their workout and like that they have some cushioning that isn’t too thick or bothersome. These socks have a 4.3-star average rating from over 355 reviews at Alo.
Material: nylon, polyester, spandex | Size range: S/M (5-7.5), M/L (8-11) | Color options: 3
“These are my absolute favorite pilates socks, and they’re definitely the pair I reach for the most out of the nine grip socks I have,” says Rodriguez. “The funky design on the bottom is so unique but also allows for better grip coverage, which makes me feel very stable when doing movements that involve standing on the reformer.”
Material: 80% cotton, 17% nylon, 8% nylon, 3% spandex | Size range: S/M (up to 9), M/L (over 9) | Color options: 2

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-hiking-socks-rcna184609,"The best hiking socks, according to experts",,"Nothing can ruin a good hike like a painful blister or a soggy sock. Preventing such disasters starts with choosing the right hiking sock. “For me, I can easily ruin a beautiful hike by wearing the wrong pair of socks,” says NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who likes to hike in the fall and spring. “Wearing thin work or dress socks, even with the right pair of hiking boots or trail running shoes, is wildly uncomfortable — there isn’t enough cushion or support to feel confident on tricky terrain. I always make sure I have a pair of cushiony, athletic socks on any hike.”
To help you find the best hiking socks for your next adventure, we asked three podiatrists about what factors to consider and for the socks they personally use and recommend to patients.

Finding the right hiking sock involves a certain amount of personal preference — you may prefer a streamlined lightweight version to a more cushioned feel, for example — and variation based on the climate and nature of your typical hike. But the best hiking socks have a few features in common, according to the experts we spoke with. Here’s what to consider:
REI’s affordably priced merino wool hiking socks are Sonaike’s number one recommendation and personal favorite. They’re lightweight, suitable for cooler and warmer temperatures, and 79% merino wool. “I use them in the fall, winter and spring but I have family members who manage to hike in them all summer.” Distance hikers love the seamless toes to prevent blisters and the compression band around the arch for additional support.
Fabric: 79% merino wool/20% nylon/1% lycra spandex | Compression: light | Sock height: crew | Sock cushioning: light | Moisture-wicking: yes
If you’re preparing for icy winter trails, REI also makes a heavy-weight version of its expert-recommended hiking sock mentioned above. Reviewers note the warmth of the sock even in temperatures below zero.
Fabric: 79% merino wool/20% nylon/1% lycra spandex | Compression: light | Sock height: crew | Sock cushioning: heavy | Moisture-wicking: yes
Parthasarathy finds Darn Tough’s hiking socks to be comfortable and well cushioned. “They have a good fit and they’re breathable,” she says, adding that these are the socks one of her patients used for a multiday trek across Europe. Every pair also has a lifetime guarantee.
Fabric: 59% merino wool/39% nylon/2% Lycra spandex | Compression: light | Sock height: crew | Sock cushioning: medium | Moisture-wicking: yes
For a more minimalist hiking sock, Bombas’ merino wool blend quarter socks are suitable for day hikes or trail runs. While they don’t come up as high on the ankle as crew socks suited for full hiking boots, these socks have zoned arch support and ankle compression.
Fabric: 63% merino wool/34% nylon/3% elastane| Compression: medium | Sock height: quarter | Sock cushioning: light | Moisture-wicking: yes
Sonaike often recommends Smartwool socks to her patients since they have a variety of cushioning options to suit individual preferences. Their ultra-cushioned classic edition is a sockstalwart for a reason — you won’t want to take them off post-hike. Full cushioning runs through the foot and ankle to add extra warmth and help prevent chafing on the trail. They also make excellent home socks for drafty winter days.
Fabric: 56% merino wool, 11% nylon, 31% recycled nylon, 2% elastane | Compression: medium | Sock height: crew | Sock cushioning: plush | Moisture-wicking: yes
Whether you’re gearing up for a multiday trek or day hike near your home, the best hiking socks share commonalities in fabric and sock height. Here’s what the experts recommend as well as their advice for factoring in your personal preferences for warmth, comfort, and cushioning.
For hiking socks, merino wool was the hands down winner. “It’s so much better than cotton,” says Sonaike. Unlike moisture-wicking merino, cotton absorbs moisture, increasing the chances you’ll get soggy, cold feet mid-hike therefore promoting the growth of bacteria and fungus, she says.
Wool also provides superior temperature regulation, says Grant, which is particularly useful for hikes that may take you through different temperature zones. “I always say if you’re going to be in a snowy, icy area, wear wool and if you’re going to be in a hotter, humid, wet marshy area, wear wool,” she says.
“When you’re looking for a hiking sock, it should be the first or second fabric listed, which shows you it is the highest percentage of the fabric blend,” says Sonaike.
Cushioning is often a matter of personal preference, but Parthasarathy advises gravitating toward medium to full cushioning for longer distance hikes. “You have to tailor it to your needs, but for longer hikes, more cushioning is helpful,” she says.
Aside from providing comfort, thicker, more cushioned socks can also help provide stability, particularly for those with narrow calves. “If there’s too much space between your calf and your hiking boot where you can fit your finger inside, you definitely want a thicker sock,” says Sonaike. “It’s going to give you stability so that your ankle’s not moving around and you can’t roll your ankle within your hiking shoe.”
Compression isn’t as important in a hiking sock as it is in a running sock, says Sonaike but light compression can help give you more stability on rocky terrain. “Light compression around the ankle can support and stabilize your tendons and ligaments,” she says, “but you don’t want the compression level to be too high.” Medical-grade compression that stops at the ankle (as opposed to extending just below the knee like many medical-grade support stockings) can cause uncomfortable swelling above the sock band. “Those levels of compression are better over your calf or right below your knee where your veins are going to be able to pump the fluid back that you’re accumulating,” says Sonaike. She recommends looking for hiking socks with light compression that come above the ankle to “decrease your risk of ankle sprains and strains when you are out there.”
Durability for hiking socks can vary greatly. Unlike running shoes, there’s no widely agreed upon number of miles or months after which you should replace them, says Grant. “It really is looking at the actual wear of the sock more than anything.”

If your clothes aren’t inspiring you to move or are distracting you from your fitness session, you probably aren’t getting the most of that run in the park or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) class. That’s why it’s essential to have a pair — or multiple pairs — of secure workout leggings that feel good.
I spoke to experts about what separates a decent pair of leggings from a great pair, how your movements impact your legging choice and what to look for when shopping. I also rounded up a list of their workout legging recommendations and NBC Select staff favorites that align with expert guidance.

Below, I rounded up expert-recommended leggings, NBC Select-staff favorites and highly rated options I think you should know about. Every item on our list is moisture-wicking; we also included options across various price points and fabric makeups.
These leggings, which won the NBC Select Wellness Award for best overall leggings, come recommended by Coyle. “They are the perfect combination of maintaining a soft material while still having that high compression that I prefer when doing high-intensity workouts,” she says. I also like these leggings, which I wear on days when I focus on high-impact and intensity workouts; my colleague NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin prefers to wear them for barre, Pilates and cardio. Plus, they come in three lengths and have an adjustable waistband drawcord that helps prevent the leggings from slipping or folding.
Fabric: 77% nylon, 23% lycra elastane | Best for: all workouts | Size range: 0-20 | Inseam: n/a
Quince makes some of our favorite leggings, including this quick drying and moisture-wicking option, another NBC Select Wellness Award winner. They’re great for low-impact exercise like yoga because they move freely with you through each movement and are soft and stretchy, making them perfect for lounging around the house, according to our testers. NBC Select social commerce editor Sadhana Daruvuri also loves how flattering the fit is, however, she says they don’t offer as much tummy control as other options.
Fabric: 78% nylon, 22% spandex | Best for: yoga, Pilates and barre | Size range: XS-XL | Inseam: 25 inches
These are great for low-impact workouts, including yoga, Pilates and barre, according to Coyle. The buttery soft leggings offer a slight compression, but are stretchy at the same time, so they let you move comfortably without feeling constricted, according to Willet, who also says that they are great for heated classes since they are moisture-wicking and dry quickly. They come in 16 colors and have four lengths: 23 inches, 25 inches, 28 inches and 31 inches.
Fabric: 81% nylon, 19% lycra elastane | Best for: yoga, Pilates and barre | Size range: 0-20, 4 lengths | Inseam: n/a
If you prefer strength training, Willett recommends these leggings, which she says offer more compression than other leggings she’s tried. She also likes that they stay in place as you move and have a thick fabric that is great for sweatier workouts because it keeps you dry during and after, according to Willett. The lightweight and breathable fabric is also thick enough that they’re not see-through as you squat and lift weights, she says. They come in 19 colors, including black, plum and teal.
Fabric: 82% polyester, 18% elastane | Best for: strength training | Size range: XXS-XL | Inseam: 24.25 inches, 24.75 inches
These NBC Select Wellness Award winners for best running leggings are made with a smooth compression fabric that doesn’t feel restrictive. “I have sensitive skin and most athletic clothing winds up leaving marks on my body, but I have never had this issue with the Spanx leggings,” says NBC Select editorial project manager Rebecca Rodriguez. “With each wash, they get softer and I can easily pick them out of my sea of black leggings just from their buttery feel.” They also have a high-rise waistband that holds you in and hugs your hips and waist to prevent it from slipping as you run, says Malin.
Fabric: 69% polyester, 31% lycra elastane | Best for: cardio | Size range: XS-3X | Inseam: 25 inches
The nylon-spandex blend gives these leggings the perfect level of compression, according to NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson. I also own them and like to wear them during barre and yoga classes, where I move my body around in many positions. I love that I never need to readjust my pants in the middle of class because the waistband doesn’t roll down. The brand also has an option with a stirrup design that covers the heel for those who want a longer legging or for those who want additional support as they participate in low-impact exercises.
Fabric: 69% nylon, 31% spandex | Best for: yoga, Pilates and barre | Size range: XS-L | Inseam: 30 inches
If you want a pair with minimal compression and more stretch, Coyle recommends these high-rise leggings that have a seamless waistband. “Crz leggings are great because they have the high-end feel and quality of other leggings at a much more affordable cost,” says Coyle.
Fabric: 81% polyamide, 19% lycra elastane | Best for: yoga, Pilates and barre | Size range: XXS-XL | Inseam: n/a
These are incredibly reliable for runs of any distance since they never get itchy or slip, says Malin, who runs five miles a day. They have minimal seams, pockets for convenient storage and a wide-mesh waistband to secure them on your body, according to the brand. They’re also sweat-resistant and dry quickly, so you don’t have to worry about sweat showing in awkward places, says Malin.
Fabric: n/a | Best for: cardio | Size range: XS-XXL | Inseam: n/a
These are also great for long runs, according to Swanson, who wore them during New York City marathon training because of its breathable fabric and secure waistband. “These hug you so well without causing chafing or the leggings to fall down,” says Swanson. They run true to size, according to the brand, and are available in bright and neutral color options.
Fabric: 70% polyester, 30% elastane | Best for: all workouts | Size range: 2XS-3XL | Inseam: n/a
If you need one pair of leggings that can do it all, these are it. I wear them to HIIT classes and Pilates and like that they pass the squat test, meaning they are not see-through. They have just the right amount of compression to keep things in place, and I like that they come with exterior pockets to hold essentials like my phone and headphones.
Fabric: 75% nylon, 25% lycra elastane | Best for: All workouts | Size range: XXS-3X, including petite, regular and tall | Inseam: 25 inches, 27 inches, 30 inches
“These are genuinely some of the yummiest, butteriest leggings I’ve ever worn,” says NBC Select editor Lindsay Schneider. “They have a warm coziness that makes them really nice to wear during colder months.” They’re available in more than 15 colors and do not have any outside seams, according to the brand. Reviewers say they are great for hot yoga classes because they don’t roll down or slip, and the fabric stays dry and absorbs sweat without leaving wet spots.
Fabric: 87% polyester, 13% elastane | Best for: yoga | Size range: XXS-4X | Inseam: 24 inches
Working out while on your period can be daunting, but with these workout leggings, which have a built-in leak-proof liner that acts like a pad, you don’t have to worry, according to Malin. “Knix says you can go commando with these leggings, which I don’t do, but it’s reassuring knowing the pad is there since there’s always a chance of leakage, especially on hour-long runs,” says Malin. The leggings can absorb the same amount of liquid as three super tampons or 1.5 regular pads, according to the brand.
Fabric: 70% nylon, 30% lycra | Best for: training | Size range: XS-XXXXL | Inseam: 25 inches
These are one of my most used pairs of leggings and a staple in my closet for low-impact classes like yoga and barre. I love that they’re moisture-wicking, so I don’t see sweat coming through, and they stay soft no matter how many times I’ve worn and washed them. As someone who is 5 feet 4 inches tall, I prefer leggings that don’t hit my ankle right at my sock line, so I love that these come in a ⅞ length. Like other options on our list, they also come with a pocket to hold your phone.
Fabric: 74% nylon, 26% spandex | Best for: yoga, Pilates and barre | Size range: XS-XXL | Inseam: 24 inches
For walking and other low-impact movements, NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio reaches for these Vuori leggings, a brand that makes many of our favorites. “They’re super soft and have a smooth, stretchy waistband, so I never feel like it’s squeezing my stomach or hips,” says Godio. “I’ve used and washed them what feels like a hundred times by now, and they still feel just as soft and durable as they did coming out of the package.”
Fabric: 75% recycled polyamide, 25% elastane | Best for: yoga, Pilates and barre | Size range: XXS-XXL, including short, regular and tall  | Inseam: 22 inches, 24 inches, 27 inches
These are a great option for those who like HIIT workouts or running since they feel lightweight and have a drawcord to secure them, according to Willett. In my experience, these feel like you’re not wearing anything at all, which is why they’re my most used pair of leggings. What adds to this feel is that, unlike other leggings on this list, these have an unhemmed bottom, making them feel less suffocating, comfortable and lightweight to move in, in my experience.
Fabric: 84% nylon, 16% lycra elastane | Best for: HIIT and cardio | Size range: 0-20 | Inseam: n/a
These Old Navy leggings have an elasticized waistband that sits right at your belly button and on-seam pockets for storage of your workout essentials, according to the brand. “These are hands down my favorite leggings,” says Schneider. “I now compare every other pair I try to these. I love how much they suck me in, the 23% spandex really makes a difference and the pockets are just so helpful to have. Plus, the price tag doesn’t hurt either; they’re super affordable compared to other leggings I’ve tried.”
Fabric: 77% nylon, 23% spandex | Best for: yoga, Pilates and barre | Size range: XS-4X, including petite and tall | Inseam: 26 inches, 28 inches, 32 inches
“These are the leggings I reach for the most in my wardrobe because they have it all, says Rodriguez. “The leggings are supportive and stay in place when I am doing high intensity workouts and I love that there are multiple pockets, including one with a zipper closure.” The leggings, which have six pockets, are made with the brand’s compressive, midweight, sleek fabric that helps wick away moisture as you participate in all types of fitness activities.
Fabric: 68% nylon, 32% spandex | Best for: all workouts | Size range: XXS-XXL | Inseam: n/a
These NBC Select Wellness Award-winning leggings for best training leggings have medium compression and a structured, secure fit that doesn’t leave you feeling restricted during weight lifting sessions and cycling classes, according to former NBC Select editor Christina Colizza. Former NBC Select manager of editorial operations Shari Uyehara also wears these leggings and says the fabric is thick enough so that it isn’t see-through and is sculpting so everything stays in place as you move. The leggings are available in 11 colors, including neutral and brightly colored options.
Fabric: 79% recycled plastic bottles, 21% spandex | Best for: training | Size range: XXS-6XL | Inseam: 19 ½ inch, 23 ¾ inch, 28 ½ inch
These leggings are great for all workouts, however, they won an NBC Select Wellness award because of how well they perform during cardio and high-intensity exercises. “I love how sturdy these leggings feel — I don’t have to worry about them rolling down or sagging when I’m doing any workouts, even high intensity ones like HIIT, says Godio. “Plus, they have a handy side pocket, so I can take my phone on my walks to and from the gym.” These compression leggings are made of the brand’s moisture-wicking fabric, which also has an environmentally friendly finish that helps eliminate odors, according to Reebok.
Fabric: 80% nylon, 20% elastane | Best for: all workouts | Size range: XS-XL | Inseam: n/a
The experts we spoke to say that workouts result in different movement and sweat levels, therefore requiring options with different materials and fit.
Look for moisture-wicking fabrics like polyester and nylon, which wick sweat away, according to Lynn Montoya, a personal trainer and HIIT and spin instructor. Similarly, moisture-wicking fabrics and overall breathability are helpful for specific activities like HIIT classes, says Montoya.
If you want leggings that will move with you, consider options spandex, lycra elastane and elastane, which will stretch themselves to their max and still get back to their original shape after stretching, according to Deborah Young, an assistant professor at Arizona State University’s School of Art. Although they are quite stretchy they’re not the most durable since the elastomeric fibers in them aren’t the strongest or longest-lasting, says Young.
Leggings need to be durable against sweat and multiple washes over time. Look for options made from strong fabrics, like nylon, with reinforced seams to withstand the wear and tear of frequent use, as well as hold up to frequent washing and drying, says Montoya.
Both polyester and nylon tend to be the gold standard for workout leggings because of their moisture-wicking abilities and durability, according to Young. This is because of their elastic recovery, which means they revert back to their original shape after stretching without losing their formfitting qualities — they don’t sag or stay baggy like cotton would if stretched, says Young. The difference between the two is that nylon tends to be a little lighter, stronger and more expensive, whereas polyester is a bit cheaper but still holds up in comparison, according to Young.
Aside from the material, consider options with pockets, straps and reflectors. To help secure your leggings and ensure a comfortable fit, Willett recommends options with waist cords. If you are a frequent runner, look for leggings with a space to hold keys, phones, credit cards and more, says Coyle. You can also look for options with reflectors or logos because these will help passersby see you in low-light conditions and are a subtle safety feature.
Remember your height and double-check the leggings’ inseam when shopping. Similarly, if leggings are too loose in the waist and you’re constantly pulling them up while trying them on, you’ll likely have issues during your workout sessions.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-walking-shoes-women-ncna982351,18 best women’s walking shoes for all foot types,,"Physical activity can be helpful in improving brain health, managing weight and reducing disease risk, according to the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention. If you’re not a fan of running, find strength training intimidating or don’t want to invest in a gym membership, you may want to consider going on regular walks. It’s often overlooked as a workout, but walking is one of the best types of exercise you can do. And all you need is a reliable pair of walking shoes.
I consulted podiatrists about what to look for when shopping for the best women’s walking shoes. I also rounded up a handful of expert picks and NBC Select staff recommendations.

To recommend the best women’s walking shoes, I asked podiatrists to share their favorite options and rounded up NBC Select staff picks. Below, I note which sneakers have the American Podiatric Medical Association’s Seal of Acceptance — shoes earn this stamp of approval after they’re reviewed by a group of APMA podiatrists who find them to promote good foot health. All of the sneakers on this list are available in half and whole sizes.
Many of the shoes I recommend are available in a variety styles, so if you’re looking for something specific, like a certain color or pattern, browse the full selections online. Also, remember that you’ll need to break in any shoes you buy before wearing them across long distances or for long periods of time, says Wynes. He recommends breaking in your shoes by wearing them for a couple hours a day for about a week.
Ryka’s lace-up sneakers are one of the lower priced options on this list, and they don’t compromise on quality. “I’ve never had dedicated walking shoes before, and this pair showed me just how much of a difference they can make,” says former NBC Select social media editor Sadhana Daruvuri, who wears them while walking her dog, in the park or around New York City to run errands. “Even when I’m in them for hours, my feet still feel cushioned and comfortable.” The shoes are specifically designed around the shape of women’s feet, so Ryka gave them a narrower heel, a roomy toe box and soft cushioning in the midsole. They also have a grippy rubber outsole, arch support built into the insole and extra cushioning in the forefoot and heel. Ashley Morris, NBC Select associate SEO reporter, says they soften her landings, too. “These sneakers absorb the shock from my steps really well, which is important to me since I deal with shin splints that can be irritated from too much pressure,” she says.
Material: mesh | Weight: 8.70 oz. | Heel drop: 10 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: standard, wide
Dr. Miguel Cunha, a podiatrist and founder of Gotham Footcare in New York City, recommends these walking shoes for women who tend to overpronate, meaning their ankles or arches roll inward. A supportive stability shoe like this one helps counteract some of that pronation, and it’s extra padded, which adds shock control, he says. The shoe has a light, springy feel, according to the brand, a cushioned insole and a rubber outsole.
Material: synthetic leather | Weight: 10.30 oz. | Heel drop: 8 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: standard, narrow, wide, extra wide
“These are the most comfortable walking shoes I’ve tried and they make me feel like I’m walking on clouds,” says Rebecca Rodriguez, NBC Select editorial projects manager.
The plush support allows Bianca Alvarez, former NBC Select associate reporter, to walk for an extended period of time without experiencing foot pain, and even after hours of wear, she says the sneakers don’t feel tight. The shoes are made with thick foam cushioning, and they’re bouncy — Nikki Brown, NBC Select SEO editor, compared the feel to mini trampolines or bed springs. Nike’s Motiva shoes also have a wavy-patterned outsole that helps them absorb the impact of your steps and grip the ground, according to the brand. Plus, their rocker shape propels you forward while walking.
Material: not specified | Weight: 8.95 oz. | Heel drop: 12 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: standard
Cunha recommends Hoka’s Bondi sneaker for its maximum cushioning and breathability. The midsole is made from an even layer of soft, lightweight foam, which helps diffuse impact across the feet while walking and gives the shoe its minimal heel drop. The sneaker also has an internal heel counter, a piece of supportive material in the back that stabilizes the heel and reduces your risk of getting blisters, experts say. Beyond walking, Dr. Olga Shvets, a podiatrist at Central Park Podiatry in Yonkers, New York and Bay Ridge Family Podiatry in Brooklyn, New York,  recommends highly cushioned Hoka sneakers like these for anyone whose job requires them to stand for long periods of time, like nurses and teachers.
Material: mesh and polyester | Weight: 9.30 oz. | Heel drop: 5 mm. | Sizes: 4 to 12 | Widths: standard, wide, extra wide
It’s rare that I find a sneaker I like walking in just as much as I like running in. But this pair from New Balance is cushioned and comfortable enough to support me across both types of exercise. They feel soft under my feet, are slightly springy and have plush foam that protects my joints, as well as absorbs impact. The shoes’ curved outsole also lets me easily roll through strides, especially when I’m speed walking or jogging. Anyone can wear these sneakers, but Shvets specifically recommends them to her elderly clients because they have a rounded toe and grippy rubber bottom that helps prevent falls. She also likes that the insole is removable, so you can add custom orthotics if needed.
Material: synthetic | Weight: 8.4 oz. | Heel drop: 6 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: standard, narrow, wide, extra wide
I’ve been a fan of Brooks’ Glycerin sneakers for years and can rely on them whether I’m walking three or 10 miles. Their bouncy, nitrogen-infused foam keeps my feet comfortable for hours, and while the cushioning is on the softer side, I never feel like I’m sinking into it. There’s noticeably more cushioning in the shoe’s heel rather than its forefoot and toe, which is why it has a higher heel drop of 10 mm — I don’t mind the feeling this creates, and I appreciate that there’s more shock absorption in the heel since that’s where your foot hits the ground first while walking. Even when my feet swell in the heat or across long distances, the shoe’s upper never makes them feel squeezed or restricted due to the breathable material it’s made with. I also like the stabilizing broad base of the Glycerin 22s.
Material: mesh | Weight: 9.1 oz. | Heel drop: 10 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: standard, wide, extra wide
“I always recommend these shoes because they deliver a soft heel strike and take some stress off the feet,” says Cunha. They have high sidewalls and a broad platform, which stabilizes your feet and encourages them to roll through each stride, thus reducing fatigue and preventing injury, according to the brand. The sneakers are made with soft, lightweight cushioning throughout, giving you rebound with each step. They also have a padded heel collar to help secure your feet in place while walking.
Material: leather and mesh | Weight: 8.6 oz. | Heel drop: 6 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Widths: standard, wide, extra wide


On’s Cloudeasy walking shoes have become a staple in my closet ever since the brand sent me them. They’re so lightweight that I practically forget I’m wearing them, and while they don’t have a thick layer of cushioning, their foam midsole keeps my feet comfortable while I’m walking four or five miles at a time. The shoes have laces but they’re easy to slip on and off my feet thanks to the sock-like upper and built-in tabs on the back of the shoe.
Material: recycled polyester knit | Weight: 7.58 oz. | Heel drop: 8 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 11 | Widths: standard




On’s Cloud 5 walking shoes are a favorite of Cunha’s for their ability to absorb impact and cushion landings. This makes them a great shoe for high-performance walkers and those who alternate with a run once in a while. The sneakers come in two styles: one with a waterproof exterior and one without. The waterproof model is ideal for walkers who live in wet climates or tend to walk on trails that may have puddles or streams. The On Cloud 5s also have a molded heel cup that stabilizes feet, and they come with elastic laces so there’s no need to tie them.
Material: polyester with waterproof covering | Weight: 8.01 oz. | Heel drop: 8 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 11 | Widths: standard




NBC Select editor Lindsay Schneider has worn Asics for over five years and out of all the styles she’s tried, the brand’s Gel-Saiun model is her favorite. “As someone with a wide foot, space is really important to me. These have enough room in the toe box and lace area where my feet never feel constricted or like they don’t have enough room to swell or expand in the heat or while I’m working out,” she says “I’ve probably walked 200,000 steps in these shoes and they still feel great.” The sneakers are best for those with neutral and high arches, according to the brand.
Material: mesh | Weight: not specified | Heel drop: not specified | Sizes: 5 to 13 | Widths: standard


Not all walking shoes are particularly stylish, but the UA Apparition Shoes check the fashion and function boxes. “These get the job done in terms of cushioning and support. I recently wore them on a day where I ended up walking upward of 15,000 steps and felt comfortable,” says Schneider. “I specifically love the on-trend silhouette and color scheme — you can wear them with leggings or a baggy jean and still feel good about your outfit.” The sneakers have a soft sock liner, responsive cushioning and grippy, durable rubber outsole.
Material: mesh and leather | Weight: 13 oz. | Heel drop: 7 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 14.5 | Widths: standard






“When I worked at Orangetheory, I noticed that all my coworkers, trainers and members were wearing these shoes.
Finally, after getting my own pair, I understood the hype,” says Alvarez. “I love using them to walk on the treadmill or outside, and I also use them for HIIT classes, running and lifting. They’re cushioned enough to get me through cardio, but keep me stable while training.” The sneakers have a rubber outsole and a form-fitting, sock-like upper, making them easy to slip on your feet thanks to the built-in heel loop. There’s lightweight, soft, dense cushioning in the shoe’s midsole, and you can remove its insole.
Material: knit | Weight: 10.6 oz. | Heel drop: 10 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 11 | Widths: standard
Alvarez bought Adidas’ Ultraboost sneakers during her freshman year of college when she had to walk from one side of Pennsylvania State University to the other almost daily, which took her over 20 minutes. “These sneakers saved my life during college, and five years later they continue to do just that,” she says. “They’re still a constant in my shoe rotation, have remained intact and are just as comfortable as they were when I first got them. They’re definitely worth the high price point.” The sneakers have a molded heel counter, a rubber outsole and a plush feel.
Material: knit | Weight: not specified | Heel drop: not specified | Sizes: 4.5 to 12 | Widths: standard
The Transport is one of our favorite Hoka walking shoes, and rather than wearing a pair to exercise, Rodriguez says they’re best for commuting, running errands or walking around her neighborhood. “These sneakers are so convenient to pull on and go since they have a toggle lace closure rather than traditional laces that you tie,” she says. “They offer so much comfort and support, so I can walk in them all day without my feet feeling tired or sore.” The shoes have a firmer feel and a thick, durable rubber outsole with pronounced treads, giving you extra traction in slippery weather conditions or on uneven terrain like trails. There’s reflective details on the Transport’s upper, which is coated in a water-repellent coating.
Material: nylon and polyester | Weight: 9.10 oz. | Heel drop: 5 mm. | Sizes: 5 to 11 | Widths: standard, wide
While shopping for women’s walking shoes, experts recommend keeping the following in mind:
Your arch determines the direction and severity of the way your foot rolls or pronates. “You can identify your [foot type] by paying attention to which part of your foot hits the ground first,” says Shvets. She recommends looking at the soles of a well-worn pair of sneakers to see where they’re worn out, as this will indicate where you’re making most of your impact and tell you whether your foot type is a pronator, supinator or neutral. Below is a more detailed description of the three types of feet.
Pronating is a natural, normal movement of the feet, and it occurs when your ankles or arches roll or tip slightly inward. But if your feet roll too far inward, you’re overpronating. This gait can cause flat feet, which is when there’s little to no arch in the feet. Some people are born with flat feet, but other times it’s a result of an injury to the ligaments or tendons, causing the arch to collapse. Those who are pronators and have flat feet will see worn tread in the middle of the heel and toward the inner edge of the heel, experts told us. A shoe with a supportive sole and a firm but cushioned insole is best for overpronators, says Cunha.
When your weight rolls to the outer edges of your feet, you are supinating. Supinators will see a worn tread on the outer edge of the heel and should look for added cushioning at the heels, experts say.
If your foot lands on your heel and rolls forward during your stride, evenly distributing impact across the forefoot, you have a neutral gait. Those with a neutral gait will see the most wear at the heel, as well as below the first and second toe.
Experts recommend replacing your walking shoes every 300 to 500 miles. If you walk briskly for 30 minutes a day, five days a week, that means you’ll need a new pair every six to 12 months.
There is a difference between shoes specifically designed for walking and shoes specifically designed for running, says Wynes. Walking is a lower impact activity and puts less stress on the bones, joints and muscles, while running is a high impact activity that puts more stress on the body. Because of this, running shoes usually have more shock absorbance, cushioning and rotation resistance compared to walking shoes. Running shoes are also often more lightweight compared to walking shoes so runners can quickly put one foot in front of the other, says Wynes.
The wear pattern on walking and running shoes also differ. While running, you spend more time on your tiptoes and the balls of your feet, and less time on your heels. But when you’re walking, your feet tend to smoothly move through a heel-to-toe movement, says Wynes. Sneaker manufacturers use these wear patterns to decide what supportive elements and stability features their sneakers should have.
So overall, you can walk in any running shoe, but you shouldn't run in shoes specifically designed for walking, experts say. Most walking shoes don’t have enough cushioning to protect the body while running, and they can feel too heavy.
Arch support refers to padding built into shoes’ insoles that’s strategically positioned under your feets’ arches to keep them in an ideal neutral position instead of rolling inward or outward. There are three types of arches — neutral, flat and high — and it’s important to know what type of arch you have before shopping. Buying shoes with arch support that’s incompatible with your feet can cause pain, especially if you’re standing, walking or running for extended periods of time, experts say.
Below is information about the three arch types and how that impacts what features you should look for in shoes.
Yes, if possible, you should get fitted in-person before buying sneakers online, says Cunha. The staff at specialty footwear stores are knowledgeable about shoe choices, and they’ll spend time with you individually to recommend sneakers that align with your needs. The length and width of women’s feet can also change over time due to falling arches or hormonal changes. Because of this, getting professionally fitted before buying sneakers ensures you know what your current size is and what feels comfortable to you right now.
The best way to tell that your shoes fit is to make sure there’s one thumb’s width of space ahead of your longest toe, says Wynes. Cunha also recommends getting fit for walking shoes in the evening since that’s when your feet are the most swollen. “If the shoe feels comfortable at the end of the day, it will most likely feel comfortable throughout the day,” he says.

Each of the following dumbbells is made from durable metal, rubber or neoprene material, which is in line with my experts’ guidance. I separated the below options into two categories: fixed and adjustable.
The Amazon Basics dumbbells earned an NBC Select Wellness Award due to their durable build and non-slip textured surface for a more secure grip. They’re also a favorite of Jordan Rowe, a certified personal trainer and founder of NOEX Fitness in Richmond, Virginia: “These dumbbells are a budget-friendly, rubber-coated option, and can be a great investment for a beginner,” she says. Keep in mind Amazon Basics does not offer these dumbbells in pairs, which means you’ll have to buy two if you’re hoping for a set.
Weight range: 10 lbs to 50 lbs | Material: rubber-encased ends; solid cast iron core | Shape: hexagonal
REP Fitness also comes recommended by Rowe, who says she loves these fixed rubber hex dumbbells. “They have been continuously putting out quality home gym equipment at an affordable price in comparison to other companies,” she says. The dumbbells have rubber-encased ends that can limit wear and tear to both the dumbbells and the floor, according to the brand. The handles are also fully knurled, meaning they contain ridges that provide a more comfortable and sturdier grip when working out, according to the brand.
Weight range: 2.5 lbs to 125 lbs | Material: rubber-encased ends; chrome plated handle | Shape: hexagonal
“Any chrome-plated handle with a hex rubber grip is a perfect choice — lots of companies offer this style when it comes to a fixed dumbbell,” says Rowe. CAP Barbell, which makes both fixed and adjustable dumbbells, has a standard, quality dumbbell that is a great fit for anyone, says Rowe. The rubber-coated hex dumbbells from the brand come in singles. If you’re willing to splurge on a set, CAP Barbell’s Dumbbell Set comes with five pairs of weights ranging from five pounds to 25 pounds, as well as a rack to store them in your home.
Weight range: 3 lbs to 115 lbs | Material: rubber-coated ends; steel chromed handle | Shape: hexagonal
These dumbbells are a favorite of NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin, who uses them for low-impact workouts. “They’re easy to grip and soft, and I can hold them tightly even during sweaty hot yoga or weight lifting workouts,” she says. Weights range from one pound to 15 pounds, so they’re a great option if you prefer less weight. Made from neoprene, these dumbbells are also anti-slip and won’t roll away on the floor, according to the band.
Weight range: 1 lb to 15 lbs | Material: neoprene | Shape: hexagonal
Another NBC Select Wellness Awards winner from Amazon Basics, these hand weights are a smaller, budget-friendly option that’s great for low-impact workouts or those who don’t necessarily want heavy weights. They have a cushioned material that makes them easy to hold and maintain a good grip, plus the rubber material doesn’t hold any noticeable odor, according to our NBC Select editors. The weights come in pairs, or you can purchase a rack with three pairs.
Weight range: 1 lb to 20 lbs | Material: neoprene | Shape: hexagonal
These rubber-coated dumbbells from Titan Fitness are a reasonable price for home gym users, says Rowe. They have a hexagon-shaped head that deadens the sound when they’re dropped to the ground, and ergonomic chrome handles for comfort. You can purchase them in pairs, which range from 10 pounds to 100 pounds, or as sets of 10 dumbbells with multiple weight options that go up in increments of five pounds, including a 5-pound to 55-pound set and a 55-pound to 100-pound set.
Weight range: 10 lbs to 100 lbs | Material: rubber-coated ends; steel chromed handle | Shape: hexagonal
This option won an NBC Select Wellness Award for best overall adjustable weights. Though they’re on the pricey side, you’ll get several weights in one compact tool — because they’re adjustable, you don’t need multiple sets of free weights, which many of our NBC Select editors love for their small apartments. Our editors also love how durable these weights are and how comfortable the handles are to hold, even during sweaty workouts.
“I used to not be a big fan of adjustable dumbbells, but these Nordictrack ones won me over — they have replaced essentially all of the dumbbells I used to have (plus a barbell),” says NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz. “The big differentiator is size: these are a lot smaller than other adjustable dumbbells. That’s because the dumbbells have a unique locking system that means you don’t end up with a super long dumbbell with mostly empty slots as you lift — if I’m lifting 20 pounds, I just get two 10 pound plates, without any extra empty slots or length.”
Weight range: 10 lbs to 55 lbs | Material: steel | Shape: round
These PowerBlock adjustable dumbbells are recommended by Mike Boyle, co-founder of Mike Boyle Strength and Conditioning, and Craig Levergood, a personal trainer and certified strength and conditioning specialist, both of whom use these in their respective gyms. “PowerBlocks are some of the best adjustable dumbbells you can get in the fitness industry,” says Levergood. These dumbbells have durable urethane-coated steel plates and the attachments allow them to go up to 90 pounds per dumbbell. You can adjust the weight by inserting a pin into the plate of your choice. These dumbbells also include an auto-lock lever on the handle that can help make micro-adjustments in 2.5-pound increments, according to PowerBlock.
Weight range: 5 lbs to 100 lbs | Material: urethane-coated steel plates | Shape: square
These Nuobell adjustable dumbbells are great for those looking for a wider weight range, says Rowe. They have an easy-to-use adjustment mechanism, which involves twisting the handle instead of using a dial, she says. These dumbbells come as a pair and include a portable cradle to store both dumbbells and avoid damaging your floors, according to the brand.
Weight range: 5 lbs to 80 lbs | Material: steel | Shape: round
Bowflex’s adjustable dumbbells, which come recommended by Rowe, are a great basic option. These SelectTech 552 dumbbells have circular weights that you can adjust by simply placing the dumbbells on the included resting tray and twisting the dial, plus they have a molding around the metal plates for a smooth lift-off and quieter workouts, according to the brand. The dumbbells also work with the Bowflex SelectTech app, which lets you manually keep track of your reps. If you’re looking for more heavy lifting during your workout, the Bowflex SelectTech 1090 goes up to 90 pounds.
Weight range: 5 lbs to 52.5 lbs | Material: steel, nylon, rubber | Shape: round
These NBC Select editor-favorite adjustable dumbbells go up to 50 pounds and let you manually adjust at increments of five pounds using the built-in knob. Each dumbbell sits in its own aluminum stand, so the set saves plenty of space in smaller homes and apartments, according to our editors.

Not all dumbbells are created equally, and certain factors can affect the quality of your workout. As you’re shopping for dumbbells, experts recommend considering dumbbell type, material and shape.​
Dumbbells usually have either a fixed or adjustable weight, both of which can be beneficial for specific types of workouts and preferences.
Fixed weights are sold either individually or in pairs and offer one set weight — in other words, “a 15-pound dumbbell can only be and will always be a 15-pound dumbbell,” says Rowe. These are best for people who are just starting to lift weights or want to focus on one area of the body, experts say. If you’re buying multiple fixed weights, you’ll need to consider storage space and you’ll likely need to invest in a storage rack to keep your dumbbells together.
Adjustable weights offer multiple increments of weights that can be adjusted using a rotating dial or a removable pin. They can provide variety without taking up as much space as a rack of fixed dumbbells, plus they’re a good option for people who like to lift heavier and weight train since weight increments tend to go higher, says Levergood.
Adjustable dumbbells can ultimately be a more affordable option than investing in a whole set of weights, according to Rowe. “Not only do [sets of weights] take up space, but it’s going to cost you a lot of money in comparison to some of these [adjustable dumbbells],” she says. “In an ideal situation, fixed dumbbells will always be better when it comes to durability, convenience, functionality and simplicity, but the price difference between the two options can be substantial for many.”
Dumbbells are usually made of rubber, neoprene or metal. You’ll typically see dumbbells with cast iron or steel heads that are rubberized or coated in neoprene, but some are made entirely of cast iron or other types of metal, experts say. Keep in mind that the material doesn’t make much of a difference in terms of exercise — it simply comes down to personal preference, says Traci Thompson, an associate professor of Health and Kinesiology and director of PEAK Health and Fitness at the University of Utah. Metal is typically more durable, while rubber and neoprene are softer and less prone to damaging floors, she says.
Fixed dumbbells come in two shapes: hexagon and round. Dumbbells with hexagonal ends (which experts say they typically prefer) are much less likely to roll away when they’re on the floor compared to round dumbbells and typically run a little cheaper, says Rowe. Either shape can come in any material.
The shape of your dumbbell doesn’t typically affect the type of workout you’re doing, either, experts say. “The shape is really going to be dependent on what you find and how you use it, but in my experience, the dumbbell shape doesn’t really matter whatsoever,” says Levergood. In some instances, you can benefit from using one shape over the other — for example, if you’re using your dumbbells as platforms (for something like a renegade row), you’ll likely want a hexagon shape.
Dumbbells are considered free weights, which means they’re not attached to another piece of gym equipment and can be picked up and moved around. They can be a great workout tool for just about anyone (whether you’re a beginner or an experienced weightlifter) because you can easily determine the weight that’s most comfortable for you, experts say.
“If you are just starting to exercise, dumbbells can help you add intensity slowly so you don’t get injured as you are getting stronger,” says Thompson.
Dumbbells can also be more shoulder-friendly for upper body exercises: “The shoulder joint seems to self-select a path that’s most comfortable when using dumbbells [and] this isn’t as achievable with a straight bar,” says Boyle.
Both fixed and adjustable dumbbells provide some variety to your weight training since you can utilize them for practically any weighted exercise, ranging from bicep curls and overhead presses to lunges and squats. They can also encourage more range of motion and help challenge your joint stabilizer muscles (like the gluteus medius and triceps that help stabilize your body while performing different exercises) by requiring more balance to control two weights versus one, says Rowe.
Dumbbells (especially adjustable dumbbells) can also be useful for those building a home gym in a small or tight space. “Dumbbells tend to take up less space versus a barbell and plates — you can easily stack a couple of dumbbell sets even in an apartment,” says Rowe.
However, keep in mind that you will need to lift the dumbbells into position when you work out, which can be an issue if you suffer from back pain. “I often caution those with lower back issues to be careful with heavy dumbbells as the back stress of lifting them into position can be significant,” says Boyle.
For anyone just starting out with weights, it’s important to develop a proper lifting technique. “If you have not lifted weights or are unsure how to lift weights safely, you should meet with a certified personal trainer to help you dial in the technique so you don’t get injured,” says Thompson.
Once you nail down the technique, it’s important to increase weight gradually — a good rule of thumb is to lift a weight that’s challenging by the time you reach the recommended number of repetitions, but you can still complete with proper form, says Thompson. For example, if you’re doing 12 repetitions of a biceps curl, you should choose a weight that’s heavy enough to make the last repetition hard, but not to the point where you’re compromising your form just to finish.
If you can do your weight lifting exercises very easily, you probably need to increase the weight. “Muscles need to be challenged; If it doesn’t feel challenging, you may not be using enough weight to receive benefits,” says Thompson. However, “if you’re unable to do 12 [repetitions] without ‘cheating’ by letting your form deteriorate — arching your back or swinging your arms, for example — you need to reduce the weight,” she says.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-affordable-indoor-exercise-bikes-ncna1245309,The best budget exercise bikes for less than $500,,"If you want a good cardio session but don’t want to brave the elements — whether heat, cold, rain or snow — an indoor exercise bike is a solid way to burn some calories from the comfort of your own home. To help you navigate which ones offer the best ride, we’ve rounded up a list of several highly rated stationary bikes under $500 that align with expert guidance.
Today’s home bikes span a range of styles and price points. While the pros we spoke to recommend a more expensive bike for serious tracking and online connectivity, they were quick to point out that there are plenty of more affordable exercise bikes that provide everything you need.
“As with any piece of exercise equipment, the best one is the one you are going to use consistently,” says Chicago-based certified personal trainer Eric Ridings.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-wrist-ankle-weights-ncna1267241,The best ankle and wrist weights to level up your workout,,"At-home workouts are an affordable alternative to gym memberships — they also fit easier into a busy schedule and offer an opportunity to upgrade your home workout equipment.
Treadmills, stationary bikes and dumbbells are all great options, but if you’re in a smaller space or just starting your fitness journey, you may want smaller workout essentials to elevate your at-home experience. One easy (and affordable) way to do this is with ankle weights, which can be incorporated into virtually any workout for added resistance.
To help you select the best ankle weights for your home workouts, we interviewed fitness experts in personal training, cardio, strength training and conditioning, Pilates and more to find out everything you should know before shopping.
SKIP AHEAD The best ankle weights in 2025 | How to shop for ankle weights | Why trust NBC Select?
There are a lot of ankle weights on the market, so to help narrow down your options, our roundup includes top rated options from popular retailers like Amazon and P.volve, and expert favorites.
Kristina Jennings, a certified strength and conditioning specialist (CSCS) and performance coach with virtual personal training platform Future says that Bala Bangles (one of several similar offerings from Bala) are good “for Pilates-based workouts” since “they are on the lighter side” and fit tightly but comfortably. Garret Seacat, CSCS, head coach of Absolute Endurance also notes that these are “one of the better quality ankle weights available.” These ankle weights — which come in fun colors like Blush Pink and Lavender and weights ranging from a half pound to two pounds — are also a staff favorite, and won our Wellness Award for best ankle weights. NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin has been using Bala Bangles for years now, and says that they’re still her most-used fitness accessory — check out her full review here.
Romney recommends Sportneer Ankle Weights —  “They are adjustable from one to five pounds [and] feature an added hook closure that helps keep the weights in place so they don’t fall out,” he says. “They are also made of neoprene, which ensures they will last a long time.” Obi also recommends these as a “great option for adjustable ankle weights” that “helps increase weight and save money.”
Romney also likes the Synergee Adjustable Ankle Weights for people who want a heavier option, as they can go up to 20 pounds. “I like these because even though they can be heavy, they still allow you to adjust the weight in small increments so you can gradually build your strength without having to make a big jump and sacrifice form,” he says. “They are also made of a durable neoprene, but they are still soft enough to avoid skin irritation. The D-ring design also ensures a snug fit.”
P.volve’s ankle weights are made of durable and comfortable neoprene and stay situated on your ankle with a Velcro strap. In addition to the three-pound set, the brand also makes a one-and-a-half-pound set that it says can be used “for toning every part of the legs.” If you buy directly from P.volve’s site, you can also receive a seven day trial of a monthly subscription to P.volve’s streaming service and incorporate your ankle weights into sculpting classes.
At under $20, these five-pound ankle weights are a relatively affordable option. According to the brand, the Velcro close keeps the cuffs in place, and the inside of each weight is padded for a comfortable fit. Obi says that they’re very soft and feel comfortable against bare skin. The Gaiam ankle weights are also top-rated, with a 4.4-star average rating from 7,127 reviews on Amazon.
“If you’re looking for adjustable ankle weights, Perform Better has ankle weights that you can adjust with removable mini weights in the pockets,” says Jennings. They come in two sizes: five pounds, or two-and-a-half pounds per cuff, and 10 pounds, or five pounds per cuff.
“[Ankle weights] are an ideal tool to use when looking to add smaller increments of resistance and strengthen muscle groups,” says Jennings. Seacat adds that “the goal of the extra weight is to increase strength and tone the legs.”
“Ankle weights are a simple way to help add resistance to bodyweight movements,” says Ife Obi, a wellness culturalist, certified personal trainer and founder of The Fit In fitness studios in Brooklyn, New York. “Resistance training is important for building muscular strength and increasing bone density,” she says. “With ankle weights, you can also turn everyday activities into exercise, especially when your time for movement is limited,” she adds.
When shopping for ankle weights, experts recommend considering factors like fit/size, the material, and your desired weight.
Ankle weights and dumbbells serve a similar purpose, but they aren’t the same thing. Unlike dumbbells, ankle weights are designed to wrap around your wrist or ankle, like the name suggests. “[They] are form fitting to stay in place while exercising,” says Jennings. McKay Romney, Utah-based certified personal trainer at Life Time, which offers classes and personal training programs virtually, adds that this “makes it easy to increase the load of an exercise while also keeping the hands free.”
According to Romney, ankle weights are very similar to resistance bands in the sense that “they can be used from a standing position or from the ground on all fours to work the legs, hips and glutes.” Though ankle weights don’t usually weigh more than 10 or 20 pounds, he says that they “allow you to put the weight as far away from your center of mass as possible,” which “translates into a little weight feeling like a lot.”
Since ankle weights are typically on the lighter side, Jennings says they are a “beneficial tool to use when it comes to ramping up a workout.” “Ankle weights can also be a great addition to strength training routines if you are looking to increase weight but want to do it minimally, or if jumping to the next size dumbbell that you have is too much weight,” she says.
According to Jennings, ankle weights can also be used for everything from plyometric-based exercises like box jumps and upper body exercises to hip, glute and quad strengthening exercises for “smaller increments of resistance.” “They strengthen muscle groups and are easy to travel with as they are light and more compact in size,” she says.
As Romney previously mentioned, ankle weights are also great for workouts on all fours like reverse leg extensions, donkey kicks and fire hydrants. “While laying down on the back they can be worn to make exercises like dead bugs, leg raises and reverse crunches more difficult while working your abs and hip flexors,” he adds.

We leveraged our expert guidance to find top-rated products from reliable brands within the fitness space, focusing mostly on ellipticals under $2,000. For each machine, we note key specifications, like weight capacity, flywheel weight, resistance levels and more.
Sole makes some of the highest-rated ellipticals under $2,000. The E35 is one of their mid-tier models and offers a great experience for beginners and enthusiasts alike, according to the brand.

The NordicTrack FS10i bills itself as a “hybrid” trainer, able to mimic elliptical, stair-stepper and treadmill movements thanks to a long stride length, 24 resistance levels and an adjustable incline, according to the brand. The machine’s numerous settings make it a good pick for shoppers seeking versatility and variety in their workouts, which can help to keep you engaged in your routine.

Bowflex’s Max Trainer series is part elliptical, part stair-stepper, hence its very vertical shape. It comes with a ton of different hand-hold positions, which helps it perform both elliptical and stair-stepper duties. Unlike our other recommendations, the Max Trainer M6 comes with a year-long membership to Bowflex’s JRNY training app. You can also use the M6’s magnetic media rack to stack your smartphone or tablet and watch classes, according to the brand.

Zachary Moxham, a certified personal trainer at Physical Equilibrium in New York City,  recommends this Octane model for a professional, gym-quality feel that “has the best experience for resembling running.” He highlights the brand’s “real running motion” as the key differentiator that “does a great job in providing a running experience with very little impact to the joint.” The Q37Xi is also one of Octane’s best-selling models, and includes a detailed built-in screen, multiple hand holds, and options for cross-training, interval programs and more.
Dimensions: 65” (L) x 30” (W) | Weight capacity: 300 lbs | Stride Length: 20.5” | Resistance: Magnetic | Built-in monitor: Yes | Membership: N/A | Warranty: Lifetime frame, five years parts, one year labor
This elliptical comes with 25 resistance levels and a motorized adjustable ramp that lets you customize the intensity and incline of your workout, according to Schwinn. It’s made of a black alloy steel and has a 20-inch stride, and can also measure heart rate and distance. This model also includes a Bluetooth connectivity feature that lets users pair and monitor their progress on app-based trackers, along with a user-friendly LCD display, which comes pre-loaded with 29 different workout programs.
Dimensions: 28.2” (D) x 63.2” (W) x 70.1” (H) | Weight capacity: 300 lbs | Stride Length: 20” | Resistance: Flywheel | Built-in monitor: Yes | Membership: N/A | Warranty: 10 years frame, two years parts, one year electronics, 90 days labor
As recommended in our guide to under-desk ellipticals, the Cubii JR1 is a top-rated mini elliptical for use when sitting at a desk. Its small size and light weight are its biggest strength: it can fit almost anywhere, and be easily moved. It offers eight levels of resistance, and tracks basic stats on the built-in LCD monitor.
Dimensions: 22.52” (L) x 13.39” (W) x 11.1” (H) | Weight capacity: 250 lbs | Stride Length: 6"" | Resistance: Magnetic | Built-in monitor: Yes | Membership: N/A | Warranty: One year or two years (if registered online)
This elliptical’s vertical design makes it a great option for those living in apartments or smaller homes. It works similarly to a stairclimber — along with the usual forward and back movements, the stride also moves up and down which allows you to better work your glutes and hamstrings, according to the brand. It tracks heart rate, calories, time and speed, and also comes with the option of an iFit membership, which provides guided workouts for you to follow and track your progress
Dimensions: 52” (L) x 29.25” (W) x 66” (H) | Weight capacity: 325 lbs | Stride Length: 10” vertical, 5” horizontal | Resistance: Magnetic | Built-in monitor: Yes | Membership: iFit | Warranty: 10 years frame, two years parts, one year labor
When shopping for an elliptical, Moxham suggests trying out as many as you can before making a purchase. “Take a tour of your local gym and try out as many as they have,” he says. “Unlike stationary bikes and treadmills, each elliptical has its own unique swing to it. Some feel like your natural running pattern and others feel like you’re gliding.” Ensuring your elliptical feels right for you should be your first and top priority.
Outside of feel, here are a few other, more technical features to be aware of.
When using an elliptical, resistance is provided by either a flywheel or an internal magnetic system.
Flywheels are more traditional and rely on friction to increase and decrease resistance. A heavier flywheel generally creates a more stable machine, which is why our experts advise aiming for a flywheel around 20 pounds. Flywheel ellipticals typically require a faster pedaling pace to maintain resistance when compared to a magnetic system.
Magnetic systems use electromagnets near a flywheel to adjust resistance levels. They are quieter and less costly to maintain, but are typically more expensive than flywheel ellipticals, according to Moxham.
Most ellipticals will have some form of progress tracking. Many have built-in programs or classes you can select to give yourself more workout guidance. Some require a subscription to use these programs. You can, of course, forgo the built-in routines in favor of your favorite fitness app.
Ellipticals vary in cost depending on brand and included features, with higher-end models going up to as high as around $5,000 or more. However, Moxam says that depending on what you’re looking for, you can find a good elliptical machine for your home in the $1,500 range.
According to Moxam, the average elliptical weighs around 250 pounds.
The average elliptical stride length is around 20 inches, and most allow you to adjust the length of your stride as well. Because of that, Moxam says stride length isn’t something to get too hung up on. “Measuring gait and stride length should not be a concern unless instructed by a medical professional,” says Moxam. To make your ride more comfortable, he suggests adjusting your foot position as you use the machine instead.
When it comes to fitness equipment, our experts say ellipticals are uniquely low-impact, full-body workout machines. “They offer a full-body [exercise] experience with very little load,” says Moxham. While ellipticals are commonly associated with cardio, they are also excellent for total body warm-ups, to increase stamina or even HIIT (high-intensity interval training), according to our experts.
Clair Mason, the owner of Elliptica Studio in Westport, Connecticut, says that ellipticals are especially useful for “people with hip, knee or lower-back issues or injuries.” “[They] are able to push to a higher level of cardio on an elliptical due to it being low (zero) impact,” she says.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-foam-rollers-rcna185034,The best foam rollers for muscle pain relief,,"Foam rolling is a treatment that helps speed up recovery from muscle soreness and tightness. It’s also a popular method for self-myofascial release, which is a deep-tissue massage that can help with breaking up myofascial adhesions, or trigger points, says John Gallucci Jr., a physical therapist and CEO of JAG Physical Therapy. “This technique is a cost-effective way to give yourself a deep tissue massage before or after a workout,” he says. You can also use a foam roller to relieve muscle tension and soreness after hours of sitting during work or stress on the job.
To help you determine the best foam roller for your needs, I spoke with personal trainers, physical therapists and chiropractors about how to safely use and shop for one, and highlighted their personal recommendations.
SKIP AHEAD How I picked the best foam rollers | The best foam rollers to shop | Why trust NBC Select?
Foam rollers come in various sizes and densities, so choosing one that’s right for you is crucial to safe and effective sessions.

Below, I compiled expert-recommended foam rollers to consider based on various use cases and experience levels. I also listed foam rollers our NBC Select editors have tried and loved.
This won an NBC Select Wellness Award for best overall foam roller due to its unique design — the grooves are tough and sturdy, which helps relieve muscle tension and soreness after a workout or sitting for long hours, according to our reviewers. “My boyfriend has sciatica, or nerve pain, and this foam roller did a really good job of helping them stretch out and align their lower back,” says NBC Select editorial assistant Ariadne Night. The roller has a center groove for an even deeper massage that helps properly align your spine and neck and promote better posture while you use it, according to the brand.
The Lululemon Double Roller is another NBC Select Wellness Award winner due to its versatility. There is a smaller roller inside with a deeper ridge design, which our editors love. The exterior roller is best for use on arms and legs, while the interior roller is ideal for back tension, according to the brand. I love using this foam roller when I’m sore from my workouts because the ridges help to ease tension in my legs, back and shoulders. It’s also very lightweight, so I can take it on-the-go when I need it.
This foam roller comes recommended by Allen Conrad, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and the owner of Montgomery County Chiropractic Center. “Many foam rollers seem to wear down after using them a few times, but the Luxfit one is more durable for repeated use,” he says, adding that it’s good for large muscle groups like the hamstrings and quadriceps. Its smooth surface also repels liquid for peace of mind while working out, according to the brand.
The TriggerPoint GRID roller is a good option for athletes, according to Conrad. It has a hollow center that makes it flexible enough to move with your body and a firm, contoured design that can withstand up to 500 pounds of pressure, according to the brand. (Due to the firmness and ridges on the roller, Conrad doesn’t recommend it for beginners.)
If you’re looking for a more intense foam rolling experience, consider this vibrating foam roller from Hyperice. It has a similar rounded, contoured design as other foam rollers on this list, but comes with three speeds of high-intensity vibrations to massage away tension and loosen up muscles. I use this roller after I do more high-intensity workouts like HIIT to get a better, deeper massage on my legs and arms. (However, keep in mind the vibrations can be very intense, and it’s tough to use the highest speed, in my experience.) You can also pair the roller to the Hyperice app, which provides guided sessions, helps you monitor your progress and more.
This Tiger Tail foam roller has non-slip grip handles on either side that can help you guide the roller exactly where you’re targeting and allow it to glide back and forth on the muscle with good stability and pressure, says Conrad. Because of its firmer feel, this roller can soothe tight thighs, hamstrings and quadriceps, as well as pinpoint stubborn sore muscle areas and get rid of chronic muscle tightness, he says. It comes in three sizes: 11 inches, 18 inches and 22 inches.
“If you’re looking to add more pressure to the muscles, using a roller with edges and grooves can provide more intensity,” says certified strength and conditioning specialist Kristina Jennings. She recommends this one from Rollga, which has multiple grooves to provide a contoured fit to the body and make it easier to target trigger points, according to the brand. It’s also made from professional-grade EPP foam, which can hold more than 2,000 pounds, according to the brand.
The Rumble Roller, another recommendation from Jennings, is a firm textured roller with flexible bumps that continuously knead the affected areas of your body, according to the brand. The bumps are less than two inches apart, so you get a good amount of massaging pressure. The foam roller is also water-resistant and repels dirt, according to the brand.
If you’re looking for a more affordable foam roller, this one has a flat surface to provide gentle pressure, making it a good place to start for someone new to foam rolling, says Jennings. It comes in sizes ranging from 18 inches up to 36 inches. With the longer length, you can work on larger body areas like the hamstrings and back of both of your legs, says Conrad.
Foam rollers have multiple benefits depending on when in your workout you decide to use them, says Gallucci. Prior to a workout, they can break up adhesions, increase circulation and lengthen your muscles, warming them up for activity. After a workout, you can use them as a deep tissue massager.
Whether you should use a foam roller before or after your workout depends on your goal, according to Conrad. “If done before an exercise, it will help improve range of motion, elasticity and flexibility. If done after your workout, the main goals are to decrease spasm and delayed onset muscle soreness, which will help you get back to working out faster,” says Conrad.
Anyone can benefit from using a foam roller, especially those with soreness, muscle stiffness or fatigue. To properly foam roll, place the sore body part on top of the roller and use your body weight to slowly roll back and forth over the muscle or muscle group, says Gallucci.
When using a foam roller, breath through the rolling motion as it hits the affected body parts, says Jennings. You can also use a roller up against the wall to make the motion easier.
If you’re new to foam rolling, choose a roller that’s lighter and less intense, says Jennings. Gallucci suggests taking breaks between sessions and gradually increasing the intensity and duration to avoid post-session pain or bruising. “Remember, foam rolling can be uncomfortable, but [it] should never be extremely painful,” he says.
If you have a more serious injury, such as a muscle tear or fracture, avoid foam rolling since it can make pain worse, experts say. You should also avoid foam rolling over bony areas; bones are often mistaken for muscle adhesions, and continuously rolling over them can cause pain and inflammation, says Gallucci. You should also avoid rolling the lower back, neck and joints since hyperextension of these areas can cause further injury and inflammation to the tendons and ligaments, he says.
If you’re unsure about whether a foam roller is right for you, you should consult your physical therapist, certified athletic trainer or physician.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-stationary-bikes-peloton-alternatives-rcna183631,How to choose an indoor cycling bike (that isn't a Peloton),,"Like treadmills and ellipticals, stationary bikes are a home gym staple that can inspire you to get up and move, especially in the age of exercise giants like Peloton and Soul Cycle. But Peloton — which has past issues with equipment safety recalls — isn’t your only option.
To help narrow down your search, we vetted exercise bikes under $2,000 and talked to experts about important considerations to invest in the best bike for your needs.

Listed below are highly rated and expert-recommended exercise bikes at various price points that align with our experts’ guidance.
The Yosuda Indoor Cycling Bike has an LCD monitor to help you track your progress, as well as an iPad holder. It comes with a three-month warranty for the overall bike and offers free replacement parts within a year of buying it. The bike has a 4.4-star average rating from 22,100 customer reviews on Amazon, many of which say that they love how easy the bike is to assemble and adjust, and that it provides great value for money. Reviewers also like how quiet the bike is while in use.
Maximum weight: 270 pounds | Digital monitor: yes | Warranty: 3 months
Although it doesn’t come with a digital monitor or an iPad holder, this option from Sunny Health & Fitness is good for anyone looking for a basic, adjustable exercise bike. The bike is mounted on wheels to make it easier to transport. It has a 4.4-star average rating across 6,458 customer reviews on Amazon, and it comes with a three-month warranty for its parts and a one-year warranty for the bike’s frame, according to the brand.
Maximum weight: 275 pounds | Digital monitor: no | Warranty: 3 months (parts); 1 year (frame)
This indoor cycling bike has an LCD digital monitor that tracks your time, speed and distance, among other metrics. If you want to give the Pooboo a boost, it offers a tablet stand where you can place your iPad or water bottle. Though the bike doesn’t come with a warranty, shoppers can get free replacement parts within a year of buying the bike, according to the brand. It comes with a 4.7-star average rating from 512 customer reviews on Walmart.
Maximum weight: 330 pounds | Digital monitor: yes | Warranty: None
“There is a touch of nostalgia to a Schwinn, and they are consistent and reliable machines,” says Chicago-based certified personal trainer Eric Ridings. “The IC3 serves the purpose of being a quality bike with great features at a lower price.” Schwinn’s IC3 Indoor Cycling Exercise Bike has dual pedals that allow for different types of footwear, meaning you can wear regular sneakers or higher-end clip-in shoes. It also comes with a digital LCD monitor as well as a water bottle or tablet holder. It can hold around 300 pounds — more than most of the bikes here — and its warranty will cover the frame for five years, among other things, according to the brand.
Maximum weight: 300 pounds | Digital monitor: yes | Warranty: 5 years (frame); 2 years (mechanical); 2 years (electrical); 1 year (labor)
This recumbent bike from Schwinn is the best option for those with limited mobility or those who need a back rest while riding, says Zach Moxham, a certified personal trainer at Physical Equilibrium in New York City.
This bike works with cycling apps like Explore the World and Zwift (both of which require separate subscriptions) that let you keep track of your fitness goals and compete with other users. Though its handlebars are static due to its recumbent design (which makes it easier for entry and exit), it does have an adjustable, contoured seat that can move both backwards and forwards. It also offers 16 magnetic resistance levels, 13 workout programs, a Bluetooth-enabled heart rate monitor and a 5.5-inch LCD display that can show programs, goal tracking and more.
Maximum weight: 300 pounds | Digital monitor: yes | Warranty: 10 years (frame); 2 years (parts); 1 year (electrical); 90 days (labor)
The Echelon is about as close to the Peloton as you can get, with the major differences being that the Echelon has only 32 resistance levels compared to Peloton’s 100. Both offer an interactive experience with a wide range of on-demand classes (subscription sold separately), but the Echelon doesn’t require special cycling cleats. According to the brand, its racing-style seat is fully adjustable, and its bullhorn handlebars have a built-in device mount as well. The toe cages are also fully adjustable.
“Echelon also makes rowers and treadmills, so it’s great if you want to expand your home gym,” Ridings says. “They also have their own brand of trainers. If you have good instructors and the riders connect with them, it’s a valuable service.”
Maximum weight: 300 pounds | Digital monitor: no | Warranty: 1 year limited parts and labor

If you’re looking for a smart, higher-end stationary bike that costs less than Peleton’s options, below are highly rated and quality stationary bikes under $2,000.
The Bowflex C6 Bike has a backlit LCD metric console as well as a media holder for your phone or tablet. An upgrade compared to the more affordable exercise bikes, it has two water bottle holders (for those of us who get extra thirsty during a ride) and a knob that allows you to choose between 100 resistance levels.
The bike comes with several additional features, including a two month free trial fitness membership to JRNY, Bowflex’s workout app that comes with trainer-led videos. (Once its trial is up, JRNY costs $20 a month or $149 annually.) It also has dual-sided pedals to slip your toes or clip your cycling shoes into, and comes with a pair of three-pound dumbbells that slide into cradles at the front of the bike and a Bluetooth-enabled heart rate monitor. “The Bowflex has the weights, and people really enjoy the JRNY trail rides,” Ridings says. “It also has a sleek, modern look. People care what it looks like in the room.”
Maximum weight: 330 pounds | Resistance levels: 100 | Membership: 1-year JRNY Membership | Warranty: 10 years (frame); 3 years (mechanical); 3 years (electrical); 1 year (labor)
If you love Bowflex but you’re looking for a bike that has a built-in tablet, the Bowflex VeloCore Bike is your best bet. It comes with a 16-inch console, and you can swap it out for a 22-inch console if you’re looking for something bigger and don’t mind spending $400 more. Like the Bowflex C6, it has two water bottle holders and a knob that allows you to access 100 resistance levels. It also offers the same one-year JRNY fitness membership, dual-sided pedals, three-pound dumbbells and Bluetooth-enabled heart rate monitor. The VeloCore has Bluetooth speakers and a media rack, though it does come with a shorter warranty than its brethren: two years for its frame. It has a 4.8-star average rating from 1,027 reviews on Bowflex.
Maximum weight: 325 pounds | Resistance levels: 100 | Membership: 1-year JRNY Membership | Warranty: 2 years (frame); 2 years (mechanical); 1 years (electrical); 1 year (labor)
NordicTrack stationary bikes are recommended by our experts because they offer similar features to the Peloton, including scenic rides and Bluetooth connectivity. Like the Peloton Bike+, the NordicTrack Commercial Studio S22i Cycle has a large, 22-inch touchscreen display that rotates 360 degrees, so you can use the display off your bike, too (it’s also the most affordable bike here with that capability). It comes with dual water bottle holders, dual-sided pedals and a variety of resistance levels (though it only offers 24 compared to Bowflex’s 100 levels).
The NordicTrack S22i bike comes with a 30-day iFit Family Membership — it costs $15 a month once the trial is up, or $180 for the year — and a pair of three-pound dumbbells. Like the Bowflex, it has a 10-year frame warranty.
Maximum weight: 350 pounds | Resistance levels: 24 | Membership: 30-day iFIT Family Membership | Warranty: 10 years (frame); 2 years (parts); 1 year (labor)
The IC4 has more features and costs a bit more than the IC3. The exercise bike — which has a 4.7-star average rating from 807 reviews at Best Buy — can be synced with other workout apps like Peloton and Zwift, so you can stream thousands of workout classes. It comes with a 40-pound flywheel, 100 levels of resistance and a set of included three-pound dumbbells that sit in an easy-to-reach cradle, according to the brand. It also has dual water bottle holders and an integrated media rack so it can hold your tablet, and a Bluetooth heart-rate armband is also included.
Maximum weight: 330 pounds | Resistance levels: 100 | Membership: 1-year JRNY membership | Warranty: 3 years (parts); 90 days (labor)
This highly rated bike is a good option if you want a good quality bike without the bells and whistles of traditional high-end options: While it doesn’t include a built-in tablet, it does offer a mounted LCD console to monitor distance, calories burned, heart rate and more. And instead of using magnetic resistance settings like many other higher-end bikes, the bike uses a fan to adjust resistance, which means the faster you pedal, the more resistance builds, according to the brand. The padded seat can also adjust to eight different height settings and five front-to-back settings for a more comfortable fit. Keep in mind, however, that the rubber-grip handles are welded directly to the bike’s arms and can’t be adjusted.
Maximum Weight: 350 pounds | Resistance levels: n/a | Warranty: 2 years
The best stationary bike is the one you’re most likely to use, according to Ridings: “Whether that means a realistic price point or the prestige of getting the same gadgets your friends have, it always comes down to the system that fits you best and leads you to more exercise.”
Serious riders should prepare for a hefty price tag (starting at $1,000) if they’re looking for quality equipment, according to Angelina Palermo, a former professional cyclist and spokesperson for USA Cycling — a non-profit group focused on cycling as a sport. That said, you don’t need to spend almost $2,000 on Peloton’s Bike Ultimate Package. “If you know you are going to ride consistently, it makes all the sense in the world to invest in a more expensive bike — and the no-interest financing many of them offer makes some of these expensive bikes more accessible,” Ridings says.
Many of these needs may be met by relatively affordable options. Maybe you want to easily adjust the bike’s resistance, move its handlebars or just need something quiet for nighttime sweats. It’s often when you introduce screens, monitors and trackers — as well as features allowing for social connectedness — that prices climb significantly.
And don’t overlook sprucing up your current stationary bike with spinning accessories like a padded, adjustable seat and easy-to-grip support handles, if those are the issue. An uncomfortable bike has the potential to affect your performance and form while you bike. “In the long run, this could lead to unnecessary muscle strain and sustained injury,” Ridings says.
On May 11, 2023, Peloton announced a recall of about 2.2 million of its popular exercise bikes due to safety concerns over the seat post on its PL-01 models, which were sold from January 2018 through May 2023, according to the brand. Users can contact Peloton for a free replacement seat post that can be self-installed, according to Peloton. In the meantime, Peloton is requesting customers to immediately stop using the recalled bike.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-vertical-climbers-ncna1259661,The 5 best vertical climbers in 2024,,"Though you may not see vertical climbers scattered across home gyms as much as other popular fitness equipment like ellipticals, exercise bikes and treadmills, fitness experts say using a vertical climber is an excellent way to achieve an effective full-body workout and burn hundreds of calories in the process.
Vertical climbers are typically 7- to 8-foot-tall exercise machines that are equipped with foot pedals and height-adjustable handlebars. These machines help you pull up and down against measured resistance with the purpose of engaging your core, ""as if you were climbing or scaling something,"" says Kyle Gonzalez, integrative health and wellness professional and head of content at nutrition and supplement company, Momentous. This exercise tool is also best used for cardio, endurance and high intensity workouts, adds Andrew Schillaci, a personal trainer at Casa Cipriani in New York City.
To help you determine whether a vertical climber is a good fit for your home gym, I spoke to fitness experts and trainers about how to best use these machines and what to look for when shopping for one. They also shared their personal recommendations with me, too.
SKIP AHEAD Best vertical climbers to shop | What are the benefits of vertical climbers? | Why trust NBC Select
If you’re in the market for a vertical climber, our experts recommend keeping a few features in mind when shopping, including durability, size adjustability and size.
Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.
Each of the vertical climbers we list below are recommended by our fitness experts, many of which include key features like adjustable height, a built-in display, preset programs and more.
If you’re willing to invest in a vertical climber, Gonzalez recommends the VersaClimber because it “allows you to create or prescribe specialized workouts.” The residential VersaClimber comes with 16 preset programs and a screen that displays your metrics like distance and time. You can also adjust the height and it accommodates users who are up to 6-foot-5-inches tall and weigh up to 350 pounds. You can connect the machine to the VersaClimber app via Bluetooth, which gives you access to on-demand classes and lets you track progress, heart rate, calories burned and more.
While the VersaClimber is on the pricier side of the fitness equipment market, the machine itself is durable, easy to use and worth the investment, says Schillaci. If you have a higher budget and are looking for more features, VersaClimber also offers the SM-Magnetic machine, which offers 11 adjustable resistance levels and Bluetooth connectivity.
Resistance levels: fixed | Machine weight: 86 pounds | Maximum user weight: 350 pounds | Built-in display: yes | Storage features: no
The MaxiClimber is a quality, affordable option that’s easy to assemble and comfortable to use, according to Gonzalez. “It’s the best option for a beginner or someone looking to switch things up but not break the bank,” he says. This ergonomically-designed model comes with handle grips, an adjustable height and can accommodate users up to 240 pounds. The vertical climber also includes a step counter to track your metrics and works with a companion app to get access on-demand classes and progress tracking.
Resistance levels: fixed | Machine weight: 33 pounds | Maximum user weight: 240 pounds | Built-in display: yes | Storage features: yes, folding design
This RELIFE vertical climber comes recommended by Rhys Athayde, co-founder and head trainer at PHANTOM Fitness, because it’s “affordable, adjustable and lightweight, so you can move it around to different areas if you change your home gym layout.” Although she says buying it made her feel “so incredibly old school”, NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown says that since she’s not a gym-goer, she likes to use this climber while watching TV or talking on the phone. “I feel the burn every time and combined with swimming and my daily commute, I’m getting stronger little by little,” she says. She also likes that it has a foldable, space-efficient design that fits into the corner when she’s not using it.
Resistance levels: 5 | Machine weight: 43 pounds | Maximum user weight: 260 pounds | Built-in display: no | Storage features: yes, folding design
The CLMBR is a more “high-tech option” since it’s equipped with a built-in touchscreen display and has a smartphone app you can access for on-demand classes, Gonzalez says. Though the brand’s home model is more expensive than other options, Gonzalez notes that the unique design and access to instructor-led fitness classes gives it “a Peloton-like appeal.” The CLMBR can accommodate people up to 7 feet tall and has a max user weight of 350 pounds.
Resistance levels: 11 | Machine weight: 180 pounds | Maximum user weight: 350 pounds | Built-in display: yes | Storage features: no
This option from Sunny Health & Fitness, which makes some of our favorite affordable ellipticals and exercise bikes, can be a great option for those in a tight space since it combines a vertical climber and elliptical machine. It offers a 9-inch vertical climb, a 10-inch stride length and eight adjustable resistance levels. It comes with a mounted digital display that lets you track your time, speed, distance, estimated calories burned and more, as well as pulse sensors on the handles to measure your heart rate. It can support up to 260 pounds and has wheels for easy maneuverability.
Resistance levels: 8 | Machine weight: 95 pounds | Maximum user weight: 260 pounds | Built-in display: yes | Storage features: no
Vertical climbers combine both strength and cardio exercise, and can offer some variety to a strength and conditioning routine or work as a standalone piece, according to the experts we spoke to. The machines work by having users mimic the movement of climbing: “Using your upper and lower body muscles the entire time, it’s a low impact movement for many people with a high return on calories burned,” Rowe says. Vertical climbers are safe for everyday use, but our experts recommend mixing up any fitness routine with other forms of exercise, too.
One of the main benefits of adding a vertical climber to your training routine is that it works the sides of the body individually, according to Hopkins. “When used properly, the vertical climber addresses single-side vertical reaching and pulling, which works well with the natural movement of the body and strengthens critical areas of the shoulder girdle,” he says.
Use a vertical climber two or three times per week for the best results, Hopkins says. “You can have a high-intensity and a low-intensity day for endurance protocols, and you could even add a high-resistance day to push the individual leg strength, upper body strength and core function — it’s pretty well rounded,” he says.
However, there are a few limitations to keep in mind: “Besides the immediate risks of falling or injury if you’re not in touch with how your body moves, it requires a decent amount of space, which could be an issue for some people,” Athayde says. Gonzalez doesn’t recommend this type of machine for people with balance or coordination issues due to falling hazards, and those with metabolic or heart issues should use vertical climbers with extreme caution and seek guidance from a coach before using one.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/top-massage-guns-ncna1278605,"The best massage guns for muscle relief, according to experts",,"Whether you exercise regularly and are looking for ways to help with your post-workout recovery, or have back pain due to a less-than-ideal desk setup, it might be time to invest in a targeted deep-tissue massager, otherwise known as a massage gun.
“What the massage gun does is combine impact and movement, known as vibration therapy, to help loosen up tight and sore muscles, similar to that of a massage, as well as stimulate blood flow to help increase recovery,” says physical therapist John Gallucci Jr., CEO of JAG Physical Therapy.
To help you choose the right massage gun for your needs, I spoke to experts about what to consider when shopping for one and collected some of their favorite massagers on the market, including ones we have tested.

Below, I highlighted expert recommendations for the best massage guns, along with a few NBC Select staff picks that are tested and approved. All of the options below have multiple speeds and attachments.
This massage gun won an NBC Select Wellness Award after five weeks of vigorous testing. Our editorial director, Lauren Swanson, tested massage guns while marathon training and this one came out on top for her. The heads and speeds were gentle on her tender muscles after long runs, and she also credits the breathwork feature with helping her to prioritize that underrated part of training. NBC Select editor Jordan Bowman also tested this massage gun and liked how he could select different workout types for stress relief, lower back pain and sleep.
Beldini personally uses the Hyperice Hypervolt 2 model and says it provides a great all-around value. It has three speeds up to 3,200 percussions per minute (PPM), five head attachments and a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that holds up to three hours of juice, according to the brand. “It is easy to handle, and it is relatively quiet,” she says.
Hypervolt massage guns are known for their quick-charging batteries, minimal noise levels, power and ease of use, says Gallucci. “Weighing in at 1.5 pounds, this product packs a lot of power into a travel-friendly option,” he says, noting that it’s “nearly as powerful as many full-size guns.” In addition to being lightweight, it has three different speeds and three hours of battery life, according to the brand.
This massage gun stands in a class of its own due to its ergonomic grip and adjustable arm, says Gallucci. You can angle the arm for a customized massage for any body part. “A few other special features include the six speeds, seven attachments, two batteries lasting five hours total and Bluetooth capabilities. This massage gun is an investment, but fitness enthusiasts and athletes feel it is well worth the splurge,” he says The Pro model is also over 50% quieter than previous Theragun models, making it unobtrusive to use in public, says Allen Conrad, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and owner of Montgomery County Chiropractic Center.
The Theragun Mini, another NBC Select Wellness Award winner, is the smallest, most portable massage gun from the brand. It has three massaging speeds and comes with three head attachments, a soft case and a charging cable. “Its small style means I can bring it everywhere, which I love,” says commerce leadership coordinator Alexa Arent, who used it to target very specific body aches, using different attachments depending on which muscle was involved. “I mostly used it on my legs and shoulders — the rounded-top attachment was my go-to.”
Conrad recommends this option for beginners looking for a budget-friendly option before making a more sizable investment. It comes with four attachment heads, and although it isn’t battery-operated, it has a 9-foot-long power cable so you can move relatively freely. It also has two speeds and two vibration settings with up to 3,350 PPM, according to the brand. One thing to note: This option may not be powerful enough for larger areas, like the hamstrings, but can be useful for smaller regions, like the calves and forearms, says Conrad.
This option is quiet, has an ergonomic handle and packs plenty of power, according to Conrad. Gallucci agrees: “Theragun is the pioneer in this market, and this fourth-generation [massage gun] lives up to the top-quality products that Theragun is known for.” The Theragun Prime is 70% quieter than previous models and has five built-in speed settings, two hours of battery life and four attachments, according to the brand. Users can also download the Therabody app, which integrates with Apple Health and Google Fit and recommends guided wellness routines based on your behaviors. With the app, you can also select any speed between 1,750 and 2,400 PPM.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-workout-headphones-earbuds-ncna1304128,The best workout headphones,,"Working out can feel like a chore. Pounding the pavement or pumping iron can get repetitive after a long day of work, especially if you aren’t used to it. What makes my 45 minute dumbbell workout fly by? Workout headphones, paired with an audiobook, of course.
Workout headphones can vary in shape and size. Some look like typically wireless earbuds, others are band-shaped open headphones that rest on your temples. Regardless, good workout headphones stay secure on your head during jumping jacks, burpees, yoga and anything else.
SKIP AHEAD  The best workout headphones in 2025 | How to shop for workout headphones | Why trust NBC Select?
The NBC Select team has tried dozens of workout headphones over the years, for this guide as well as our annual NBC Select Wellness Awards. To pick our favorites, we selected products while keeping the following qualities in mind:
Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.
Our top picks came from a mix of large and small brands including Beats, Shokz and. and smaller brands like Apple, Jabra, Shokz and more. We list specs like battery life, water resistance and more below each recommendation.
The Beats Fit Pro has been my go-to workout earbud for years, even after trying out dozens of competitors. The fit is a big reason why — the small, built-in wing-tips lead to a secure fit without making the earbuds too hefty.
Both earbuds have physical button controls that are easy to use, even when I am wearing thick gloves for a winter run. You can press either button to stop, start and skip songs, and holding the button down changes between noise cancellation and transparency mode. The Beats Fit Pro pair easily with my iPhone and have a similar experience on Android using the Beats mobile app, in my experience.
Unlike many competitors around this price point, the case does not charge wirelessly.
Noise cancellation: yes | Transparency: yes | Battery life: rated up to 7 hours | Wireless Charging: no | Water resistance: IPX4 | Bluetooth Multipoint: no | Works best with: Android, iPhone | Ear tips: silicone (S, M, L)
These headphones rest on the outside of your ear instead of inside your ear canal. They use a mix of vibrations and highly-directional speakers to get sound to your inner ear.
NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson has used Shokz open-ear headphones to run the New York City Marathon. She feels safer running with them because they leave her ears open, allowing her to hear things more clearly like nearby cars, bikes and pedestrians. I use them for similar reasons while I’m cycling.
The Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 is the brand’s most premium headphone, with the best sound quality, comfortable fit and feel and ubiquitous USB-C charging. But, like with all open-ear headphones, don’t expect them to block any noisy neighbors while working out at the gym.
If the OpenRun Pro 2 is a bit pricey, you could also consider the similar Shokz Open Run, though you lose out on sound quality and USB-C charging.
Noise cancellation: no | Transparency: no | Battery life: rated up to 12 hours | Wireless Charging: no | Water resistance: IP55 | Bluetooth Multipoint: yes | Works best with: Android, iPhone | Ear tips: n/a
If you are looking to try out an open-ear headphone, or want a second pair of workout headphones just for outdoor runs, consider these budget-friendly Anker Soundcore V20i. The earbud rests on, not inside, your ear, and each bud has a rubber earhook for a more secure fit. They are also IP55 dust and water resistant, so you don’t have to worry about sweat or rain.
Noise cancellation: no | Transparency: no | Battery life: rated up to 8 hours | Wireless Charging: no | Water resistance: IP55 | Bluetooth Multipoint: yes | Works best with: Android, iPhone | Ear tips: n/a
The Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 are some of the most secure workout headphones I’ve ever tested. They are also some of the most feature rich — they have active noise-cancellation and transparency modes, on ear media and volume controls, a wireless charging case and heart rate sensors built-in to the earbuds themselves. While the sensors are a little finicky to sync with your workout app, they are a nice-to-have for anyone who doesn’t use a fitness tracker. You can read more in my Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 review.
Our previous earhook pick, the JBL Endurance Peak 3, is still a great option if you are looking for something simple, secure and less pricey.
Noise cancellation: yes | Transparency: yes | Battery life: rated up to 10 hours | Wireless Charging: yes | Water resistance: IPX4 | Bluetooth Multipoint: no | Works best with: Android, iPhone | Ear tips: silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)
For $30, I was surprised by the quality of these earbuds, especially for quick outdoor runs. They have a large ear hook design that wraps securely around the back of your ears — I found them to be tight and comfortable, but not so snug that I couldn’t hear traffic noise or other runners around me.
Like most earbuds at this low price point, they do not have noise cancellation and transparency modes or wireless charging. But they do connect to the JLab app, where you can customize settings like sound balance.
Noise cancellation: no | Transparency: yes | Battery life: rated up to 8 hours | Wireless Charging: no | Water resistance: IP55 | Bluetooth Multipoint: no | Works best with: Android, iPhone | Ear tips: silicone (S, M, L)
The NBC Select team mainly consists of iPhone owners, and they love AirPods Pro for working out and everyday life — they are comfortable and secure in our ears during workouts, including outdoor runs and indoor gym routines.
The earbuds have excellent sound quality and noise canceling. With noise cancellation turned on, chatter and music at the gym fade instantly, in my experience. When I switch on transparency mode, I can hear my surroundings very clearly, perfect for running outdoors. They also include four ear tip sizes in the box, which can help you get a more comfortable fit for your ears.
Noise cancellation: yes | Transparency: yes | Battery life: rated up to 6 hours | Wireless Charging: yes | Water resistance: IPX4 | Bluetooth Multipoint: no | Works best with: iPhone | Ear tips: silicone (XS, S, M, L)
Anyone with an Android phone looking for one pair of headphones to pull double duty as workout and everyday earbuds should consider these latest Google Pixel buds. The new design adds mini wing-tip stabilizers that fit snugly in your ears and make the earbuds much bette for exercise than the originals.
Like Airpods Pro 2, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 have strong noise cancellation and transparency modes. But they also have the longest battery life on our list — up to 12 hours in the earbuds alone and 48 with the case.
Noise cancellation: yes | Transparency: yes | Battery life: rated up to 12 hours | Wireless Charging: yes | Water resistance: IP54 | Bluetooth Multipoint: yes | Works best with: Android | Ear tips: silicone (XS, S, M, L)
We’ve tried dozens of excellent headphones fit for everyday use, but not all of them make for ideal workout headphones. Keep the following in mind as you shop for your next fitness headphones:
In-ear headphones are typical earbuds like Apple Airpods Pro 2 or Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 with rubber eartips that rest inside your ear canal. Open earbuds rest on the outside of your ear instead of the inside, usually on your ear or around your temple. Open-ear headphones are great if you want to listen to music but still hear your surroundings clearly — I prefer open-ear headphones when I am running or cycling outdoors.
Your earbuds need to fit your ears well, or else they will fall out during intense exercise, in our experience. All of our in-ear headphone recommendations come with multiple sized ear tips. Try a few different ear tip sizes and feel out which one fits best. If you want to avoid worrying about eartip all together, look into open-ear headphones instead.
Water and dust resistance is denoted by an earbuds IP (ingress protection) rating. IP ratings contain two numbers. The first represents intrusion protection against dust and debris. The second denotes water resistance. Many of our recommended headphones have an IP rating of IP55, which indicates protection against dust and jets of water. Earbuds meant for swimming or water sports should be fully waterproof, with a rating of at least IPX8.
Noise cancelation and transparency (sometimes called hear through) are both useful features to have in any kind of headphone. Noise canceling can block outside noise like chatter or music at the gym. Transparency lets in sound and is useful for outdoor activities like running, when you may want to hear nearby traffic or pedestrian noise more clearly.
Noise canceling headphones with transparency are typically more expensive than headphones without those features.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-wireless-earbuds-ncna1303634,The best wireless earbuds of 2025,,"Whether you’re tuning out commuter noise with a podcast or taking calls at work, wireless earbuds are a daily staple in most people’s lives. In the US, Apple headphones have become the most popular choice. However, they’re not the only option out there.
SKIP AHEAD The best wireless earbuds in 2025 | How to shop for wireless earbuds | Why trust NBC Select?
To help guide your search in finding the best wireless earbuds, I tested dozens of options, including some of the biggest brands on the market. I focused on key factors like comfort and quality to best fit your specific day-to-day needs.
We tried out dozens of new and top-rated wireless earbuds and considered each product based on the following characteristics:
I try dozens of wireless earbuds annually, incorporating them into my daily routine. That means office work, video calls, subway commutes, outdoor runs, indoor gym time and watching videos on my phone, tablet or laptop. When using the earbuds, I paid close attention to the following factors:

After trying out dozens of earbuds, our top picks largely came from best-selling brands like Apple, Sony and Bose.
The NBC Select team loves Apple’s latest AirPods Pro, a winner in our Select Giftable Tech Awards. They are many staffers’ favorite earbuds, and they use them for everything from commuting, work, gym time, outdoor exercise and sleeping. In our experience, they are some of the best-sounding and best noise canceling earbuds on the market. Office chatter and plane noise vanish with noise canceling turned on. New features like a swipe for volume control, a lanyard loop on the case and multiple ear tips in the box are just a bonus.This version uses a USB-C charging port instead of Apple’s original Lightning connector.
If all of this sounds good to you, but you can’t stand rubber eartips, consider Apple’s AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation. They have similarly great sound and call quality, minus the rubber eartips. However, this does mean the noise cancellation is less effective than with AirPods Pro, in my experience.
Noise cancellation: Yes | Transparency: Yes | Battery life: Rated up to 6 hours (ANC on) | Wireless Charging: Yes | Water resistance: IPX4 | Bluetooth Multipoint: No | Works best with: Apple | Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L included)
The Sony Linkbuds S are another staff favorite and Wellness Award winner. While they weren’t the best at any one task, they were above average at everything we threw at them: voice calls, noise canceling, fitness, you name it. One area the Linkbuds S had the competition beat is size: these are small, lightweight earbuds you can easily forget you’re wearing.
While they launched at $200 MSRP, we have seen them priced at $150 often, a great price for the features. They are available in black, white, sand, violet (in collaboration with Olivia Rodrigo) and blue.
Noise cancellation: Yes | Transparency: Yes | Battery life: Rated up to 6 hours (ANC on) | Wireless Charging: No | Water resistance: IPX4 | Bluetooth Multipoint: Yes | Works best with: Android or Apple | Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L included)
You don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars to get fully featured earbuds — these have active noise canceling, transparency mode, Bluetooth multipoint and wireless charging, all for under $100. I test new earbuds monthly, and found that these headphones can compete with much more expensive competitors in comfort, convenience, sound quality and app support. The only weakness I can point to is its noise cancellation, which can sometimes be overpowered by plane, train and car noise.
The Liberty 4 NC earbuds work equally well on iPhone and Android phones, and come in five colors.
Noise cancellation: Yes | Transparency: Yes | Battery life: Rated up to 8 hours (ANC on) | Wireless Charging: Yes | Water resistance: IPX4 | Bluetooth Multipoint: Yes | Works best with: Android or Apple | Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L included)
These are some of the most affordable wireless earbuds that still deliver a steady Bluetooth connection, surprisingly good sound and a convenient charging case. The earbuds and case have a combined battery life of around 32 hours, according to the brand, and the case has a cable built-in for recharging. If you purchase the earbuds from the brand’s website, you can choose from 13 bright and earth-tone colorways.
They don’t have active noise-canceling or transparency modes. I’ve also found the Jlab app lackluster, but these are fair trade-offs at such a low price point.
Editor’s note: JLab recently launched an updated version of these earbuds called the JLab Go Pop+. We may update this recommendation after we’ve finished testing out the new earbuds.
Noise cancellation: No | Transparency: No | Battery life: Rated up to 8 hours | Wireless Charging: No | Water resistance: IPX4 | Bluetooth Multipoint: No | Works best with: Android or Apple | Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)
The Sony WF-1000XM5 may have a terrible name, but they are some of the best earbuds I’ve tried. Music and media sounded rich and more detailed when compared to the competition. The touch controls work without issue, a rarity, in my experience. They are significantly smaller and lighter than the previous WF-1000XM4s, leading to a much more comfortable fit, even after hours of use. They have a longer 8-hour battery life, and come with four different foam ear tips in the box for a personalized fit — I found the small-sized ones most comfortable.
Noise cancellation: Yes | Transparency: Yes | Battery life: Rated up to 8 hours (ANC on) | Wireless Charging: Yes | Water resistance: IPX4 | Bluetooth Multipoint: Yes | Works best with: Android or Apple | Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L included)
If your top priority is blocking out background noise like the distinctive hum of plane engines, the rattling of subway trains cars or the latest office water cooler chatter, these earbuds have the best noise cancellation of any that I have tried. They replaced Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds II and maintain a similar design, with a swappable rubber ear tip and rubber stability band — the brand includes three sizes of each in the box. Like Apple’s AirPods Pro, you can adjust the volume by sliding your finger up and down on the side of the earbud.
They are larger and heavier than other options — I found small earbuds like the Sony Linkbuds S and Beats Fit Pro more comfortable for fitness activity. They are also pricey — if you are looking for great noise cancellation at a lower price, consider the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds as an alternative.
Noise cancellation: Yes | Transparency: Yes | Battery life: Rated up to 6 hours (ANC on) | Wireless Charging: No | Water resistance: IPX4 | Bluetooth Multipoint: No | Works best with: Android or Apple | Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L included)
The Beats Fit Pro have been my go-to fitness earbuds for years and remained favorites even after comparing them to other fitness-oriented options. The wing-tip design creates a secure fit that never faltered during runs, bike rides or gym activity. Unlike full ear-hook earbuds, the Beats Fit Pro case is small enough to fit comfortably in most pockets. They are available in seven colors, more than most options on the market.
Noise cancellation: Yes | Transparency: Yes | Battery life: Rated up to 6 hours (ANC on) | Wireless Charging: No | Water resistance: IPX4 | Bluetooth Multipoint: No | Works best with: Android or Apple | Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)
These Jabra earbuds are a 2023 NBC Select Giftable Tech winner and one of our favorite workout headphones. They are some of the most durable we’ve tested — I dropped them into a jug of water for over a minute and used them later with no issue. They also sit snug and comfortable in my ears on my commute, at the gym or while running outdoors.
The earbuds are IP68 dust and waterproof (up to a depth of about 5 feet), according to the brand. Between the case and the buds, they have a combined battery life of up to 32 hours. They can handle anything I throw at them, and I don’t have to baby them as much as other tech I own.
Noise cancellation: Yes | Transparency: Yes | Battery life: Rated up to 8 hours (ANC on) | Wireless Charging: Yes | Water resistance: IP68 | Bluetooth Multipoint: Yes | Works best with: Android, iPhone | Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)
There are hundreds of wireless earbuds on the market. Despite many looking the same, they can vary wildly in features and price (which is why you might want to use a credit card to purchase them). Below are a few factors to keep in mind when shopping for a new pair.
Not all wireless earbuds play nice with both Apple and Android devices. If you use Apple AirPods on an Android device, for example, most of their features will be difficult or impossible to use. Earbuds that work well on both platforms tend to have useful standalone apps that can help control noise cancellation, audio equalization and more.
Noise canceling and transparency modes are both useful features that add versatility to any pair of earbuds. Noise-canceling blocks outside sound, while transparency mode lets sound in so you can better hear the noise around you, a useful safety feature for activities like outdoor running. Both features tend to drive up the price tag, however. If you do not need either feature, consider a more affordable pair of earbuds that forgo one or both.
Water and dust resistance is indicated by an earbud’s IP (ingress protection) rating. IP ratings are denoted with two numbers, for example, IP55. The first digit represents intrusion protection against dust and debris. The second digit denotes moisture protection.
If you want to wear your earbuds in wet and rainy conditions, get a pair with a higher IP rating, they are less likely to malfunction in such conditions. All of our recommendations have a moisture protection rating of at least four.

Most have heart rate, GPS and activity tracking built-in, and many can provide insights into your sleep and recovery. I’ve tested over a dozen fitness trackers and spoke with health and training experts to pick the best ones on the market.
SKIP AHEAD The best fitness trackers for 2025 | How to shop for a fitness tracker | Why trust NBC Select?
I spoke with health and fitness experts to better understand how fitness watches, bands and rings can support your exercise and wellness journey. Based on their advice, I kept the following criteria in mind while selecting and testing different models:
I’ve tested over a dozen fitness trackers and smartwatches for NBC Select. I am a runner and cyclist, and use fitness trackers to monitor my pace, heart rate and distance. I test each one for at least two weeks, using all of the features available, including sleep tracking. I often wear multiple fitness trackers at the same time to compare data like heart rate, average pace, mileage, elevation and sleep score.
To pick the best fitness trackers, I paid close attention to the following factors:
Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.
Our top picks come from well-known brands like Fitbit, Apple and Garmin. I have tested each one, and some also come recommended by experts in the health and fitness space.
In an effort to try as many options as possible, we contacted and received products from many brands, including (but not limited to) the ones on this list.
Many NBC Select staffers use Fitbit fitness trackers and love them because they are lightweight and easy to use. The Charge 6 is just that: a small, beginner-friendly fitness tracker that’s light on weight and light on price.
Despite having rarely used Fitbit products in the past, the Charge 6 felt comfortable after only a few minutes of swiping through the watch and app. The screen and stats are bright, colorful and easy to understand.
The Charge 6 tracks and showcases your heart rate, daily steps, distance traveled, fitness activities, calories burned and nightly sleep. It does not track more advanced running stats like cadence, stride length, ground contact time and vertical oscillation (our picks from Apple and Garmin do). Some data like detailed sleep stages and a daily readiness score are only available with a Fitbit Premium subscription, which costs $10 per month.
New to the Charge 6 is Google Wallet, Google Maps navigation and YouTube Music controls. It also now has a button on the left side that returns you to the home screen or pause workout screen. You can read more in our Fitbit Charge 6 review.
Display: 26mm touchscreen | Weight: 15g | Battery life: up to 7 days | Built-in GPS: yes | Sleep tracking: yes (not including naps) | Heart-rate monitor: yes, with EKG | Water resistance: yes, up to 50 meters | Works best with: Fitbit app (iPhone or Android)
The Apple Watch is one fitness tracker that almost always stays on my wrist, and this is the brand’s lowest-priced model. It costs much less than the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, but has almost all the same fitness tracking features and metrics.
The Apple Watch SE is easy to use, especially if you have used an iPhone before. The apps are similar or identical, and the square shape of the watch makes it easy to scroll through notifications and texts. It shows detailed workout, health and sleep metrics via the Apple Health and Apple Fitness, no subscription required. You can also use the Siri voice assistant to make requests and send voice texts, which is much easier than typing a text mid-run, in my experience.
The watch has up to 18 hours of battery life, according to the brand — that’s less than most competitors. To avoid battery life woes, I typically charge it every morning after waking up. It comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with many watch band options.
Display: 40mm or 44mm touchscreen | Weight: 26.4g (40mm), 32.9g (44mm) | Battery life: up to 18 hours | Built-in GPS: yes | Sleep tracking: yes (not including naps) | Heart-rate monitor: yes, no EKG | Water resistance: yes, up to 50 meters | Works best with: iPhone
The Pixel Watch 3 is the best Pixel watch yet, and is a recent NBC Select Wellness Awards winner. It has major software and fitness improvements over the previous model that make it a solid option, especially for someone with an Android or Google Pixel phone.
It does everything you would expect of a premium smartwatch: notifications, texting, calls, tap-to-pay, media controls, offline maps and more.
The watch has built-in Fitbit fitness tracking with more than 40 workout types, and it has more in-depth fitness tracking data compared to other Fitbit products like the Fitbit Charge 6. It can also automatically detect walks, runs, bike rides, treadmill, elliptical, rowing and spin exercise after five minutes (15 for walking). As someone who often forgets to log walks, I love how hands-off this feature can be.
But the new fitness and wellness features are what makes the Google Pixel Watch 3 one of our top picks. There are too many features to list here, but one of my favorites is building custom workouts, including custom runs with warm ups, cool downs, intervals and heart rate targets. As I ran, the watch buzzed and cued me into my next section and indicated if I was on, ahead or behind my target goals. Other favorite features include cardio load and daily readiness scores.
It comes in two sizes, 41 millimeters and 45 millimeters, with screens that are up to twice as bright as the previous version. Battery life is also improved — it lasts up to 24 hours, according to the brand.
Display: 41mm or 45mm touchscreen | Battery life: up to 24 hours with always-on display | Built-in GPS: yes | Sleep tracking: yes | Heart-rate monitor: yes, with EKG | Water resistance: yes, up to 50 meters | Compatible with: Android phones
Garmin makes some of the best fitness trackers for runners and athletes. The Garmin Forerunner 165 is one of their latest models, and it pairs some of the brand’s best features with a competitive price point.
The Forerunner 165 has more fitness and training features than most of the competition, including the options on our list. One feature I like is the morning report: every morning, the watch shows me a series of stats, including a daily exercise recommendation, my sleep score, the weather and more. Another is called body battery, an energy score that changes throughout the day based on exercise, stress, rest and sleep. The morning report and body battery helped me create a better workout routine.
Exercise stats are very specific, especially for running — you have multiple metrics and charts for things like pace, speed, heart rate, cadence, stride, intensity and more. All that data does mean Garmin has a slight learning curve, at least for the first few days. However, I felt comfortable navigating the app after a week of use.
Like most Garmin watches, the Forerunner 165 has excellent battery life — I averaged about 10 days before needing to charge. It also connects to GPS quickly, usually within five seconds. You can read more in my Garmin Forerunner 165 review.
Display: 43mm touchscreen | Weight: 39g | Battery life: up to 11 days | Built-in GPS: yes | Sleep tracking: yes (including naps) | Heart-rate monitor: yes, no EKG | Water resistance: yes, up to 50 meters | Works best with: Garmin app (iPhone or Android)
For in-depth data analysis, consider Whoop 4.0, says celebrity personal trainer Rhys Athayde. Whoop is not a typical fitness watch. It is a small, screenless tracker built into a stretchy polyester and nylon band. It doesn’t track daily steps, stairs climbed or active minutes, nor does it ping you with notifications.
Whoop analyzes your daily health and recovery metrics to give you scores on things like body strain, recovery and sleep in the Whoop app. It showed me how hard my workout sessions are for my body rather than how fast or far I run. Looking at these recovery-focused scores, I found myself thinking more about the quality of my workouts rather than the quantity.
NBC Select editor Jordan Bowman and I found the Whoop very comfortable to wear — Bowman wore it more often than other trackers because it never felt out of place on his wrist.
Whoop requires a subscription to use, which costs $30 per month or $239 per year. You have to pay the first year up front as part of buying the device.
Display: N/A | Weight: 18g | Battery life: up to 5 days | Built-in GPS: N/A | Sleep tracking: yes (including naps over 1 hour) | Heart-rate monitor: yes, no EKG | Water resistance: yes, up to 10 meters (for 2 hours) | Works best with: Whoop app (iPhone or Android)
If you want to track health, wellness, sleep and basic fitness stats, but hate wearing watches, consider a smart ring like the Oura Ring 4. I tested it for over two months — it’s one of the best smart rings on the market right now, especially for sleep and wellness tracking.
The Oura Ring 4 tracks stats like heart rate, body temperature, blood oxygen, sleep stages, stress levels and exercise metrics and stores them on the Oura app. It automatically tracks walks as well, but it’s best to manually start and stop other exercises like runs, yoga and strength training. It categorizes and gives you broad scores for three main categories: readiness, sleep, and activity.
Because it doesn’t have a screen, it cannot show live stats like pace, distance or heart rate zones, meaning it’s not a great fit for avid runners or cyclists
The Oura Ring comes in six colors and a range of sizes. While you can use the Oura Ring without a subscription, you’ll be limited to the current day’s sleep, readiness and activity scores. An Oura Ring membership costs $6 a month. You can learn more in my Oura Ring 4 review.

When shopping for any fitness tracker, price and compatibility should be top of mind. But beyond that, our experts recommend prioritizing the following:
Both Lewis-Trammell and Athayde say that comfort and wearability are the most important factors of any fitness tracker.
If you don’t ever wear rings, you probably won’t find the Oura Ring comfortable. Similarly, if you don’t like to wear a watch, a smartwatch like the Apple Watch or Google Pixel Watch might be uncomfortable. “Ultimately, you’re looking for a device you’re going to wear long term so that it can provide you with the most accurate data,” says Athayde.
Because trackers come in so many shapes and sizes, I recommend going to a store in-person to try a few different options and see what form-factor makes sense for you. Having tested over a dozen options, I am surprised how different each model feels, even ones with similar wristbands.
It’s not just athletes that benefit from fitness trackers, says Athayde. Everyone can benefit from the data fitness trackers provide, if you understand your wants and needs, in my experience.
Before shopping around, think about what data you care about. If you love outdoor exercise stats like pace and power, a Garmin watch may match your habits best. If you want broad exercise and health data, plus all the latest apps, a smartwatch from Apple or Google is a good fit.
What’s best for you depends on your daily habits and larger goals, according to our experts. Take stock of them before you checkout.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-sleep-masks-ncna1279954,"How using a sleep mask may lead to a longer, deeper sleep",,"Whether or not you realize it, being exposed to light while sleeping impacts the quality and quantity of your slumber. Light — or lack thereof — serves as a cue, telling the body when it’s time to rest and when it’s time to wake. Studies show that even small amounts of light in your environment can prevent you from falling into a deep, restorative sleep, which may impact your physical and mental health long term.
If it’s difficult to control the light wherever you’re snoozing, a sleep mask can help. It covers your eyes to create a pitch black environment regardless of where you are and the time of day. We talked to experts about the benefits of using a sleep mask (also sometimes called an eye mask) and how to shop for a model that fits your needs. We also rounded up a handful of our favorite sleep masks, all of which we’ve tried.
SKIP AHEAD The best sleep masks to shop | How often should you clean a sleep mask?
Most sleep masks are similar in the sense that they’re small and lightweight. But deciding which specific model is best for you depends on a few factors. While you’re shopping, experts recommend thinking about the following:
With experts’ guidance in mind, we rounded up sleep masks we’ve tried and highly rated options. We also included what we like and what to note about each sleep mask to help guide your shopping.
Kara Birnbaum, NBC Commerce photo editor, has insomnia and relies on sleep masks overnight as well as for naps. Out of all the options she’s tried, Drowsy’s silk eye  mask is her favorite due to its wide shape, padded design and blackout interior liner. “It’s the most blackout mask I’ve been able to find,” says Birnbaum. “It’s like a pillow on your eyes, it’s so soft and it’s an all around game changer.” You can purchase the mask in over a dozen colors like Green Sapphire, Lavender Haze and Dusty Gold.
Material: Silk | Style: Flat, padded | Adjustable: Yes, velcro straps | Machine-washable: Yes
“I don’t wear a sleep mask every night because I’m a hot sleeper, but I do like to travel with this one because I almost always fall asleep on planes,” says Nikki Brown, NBC Select SEO editor. She finds silk to be more cooling compared to other materials, and says it looks chic, too. You can purchase this sleep mask in over a dozen colors and patterns like black, pink, navy, polka dots and stripes. Slip also makes a 3D version of this sleep mask with contoured, domed eye cups if you prefer that style.
Material: Silk | Style: Flat | Adjustable: No | Machine-washable: No
In addition to sleeping on Blissy’s silk pillowcase, Mili Godio, NBC Select updates editor, uses the brand’s silk sleep mask. “I’m not a big fan of wearing something on my face while I sleep, so any sleep mask I use needs to be super soft, lightweight and comfortable,” she says. “This one fits the bill perfectly, and it’s by far the most comfortable sleep mask I’ve come across because I forget it’s even there.” The sleep mask, which the brand sent her to try, feels soft against Godio’s skin and doesn’t scratch or pull at it. She also says the mask’s elastic band never feels tight around her head or temples.
Material: Mulberry silk | Style: Flat | Adjustable: No | Machine-washable: Yes
“This sleep mask is downright masterful at light blocking,” says Ari Night, NBC Select editorial assistant. It resembles swim goggles due to its padded 3D eye cups, which create a seal around the eyes to prevent light from leaking in while you’re sleeping. Night also says the sleep mask helps relieve migraines, and that its band is comfortable and secure.
Material: Proprietary fabric derived from beechwood fiber | Style: 3D with domed cups | Adjustable: Yes, Velcro strap | Machine-washable: No
Light commonly peaks through sleep masks around the nose bridge area since your nose tends to lift the mask up a bit. To solve this problem, Mavogel designed its sleep mask with a bendable nose wire that you can adjust to reduce how much space there is between the mask and your face. This sleep mask, which has a 4.4-star average rating from 82,862 reviews on Amazon, also has a black sponge inside of it to help block light. The triangular wings on both sides reduce how much direct pressure the mask’s band puts on your temples.
Material: Cotton | Style: Flat | Adjustable: Yes, buckle strap and nose piece | Machine-washable: No
Thanks to its domed eye cups, this contoured mask, which has a 4.6-star average rating from 90,143 reviews on Amazon, avoids putting pressure on your eyes. It hugs your face to prevent light from leaking in and reduce the chance that the mask will move while you’re sleeping. Mzoo’s sleep mask is also designed with an air hole so it feels breathable rather than stuffy, according to the brand.
Material: Brand does not specify | Style: 3D with domed cups | Adjustable: Yes, buckle strap | Machine-washable: Yes
Beyond the adjustable band, you can move this sleep mask’s eye cups wider apart or closer together depending on your face shape. The eye cups also detach from the body of the sleep mask, allowing you to swap them out for the brand’s cooling eye cups, which can help with headaches and migraines, according to Manta. The mask has a 4.6-star average rating from 12,582 reviews on Amazon.
Material: Cotton and modal (rayon) | Style: 3D with domed cups | Adjustable: Yes, Velcro strap and eye cups | Machine-washable: Yes
Luna’s weighted sleep mask, which the brand sent me, is a lifesaver for dealing with my seasonal allergies that cause sinus pressure. When I put this mask on my face, it dulls the discomfort and helps me relax so I can get a good night’s sleep. The mask’s removable weighted insert is filled with ceramic beads. You can put it in the microwave for up to 90 seconds so it’s warm, or put it in the freezer for about two hours before use so it has a cooling effect. I prefer the cooling effect for my sinus pressure, but I look forward to the warmth during the winter months when my bedroom is freezing. The mask blocks a sufficient amount of light and I find it comfortable to wear while sleeping on my side or back.
Material: Polyester, cotton and rayon | Style: Flat, weighted | Adjustable: Yes | Machine-washable: Yes, without the weighted insert
Nodpod, one of our favorite women-owned businesses, makes a weighted sleep mask that has a 4.5-star average rating from 4,947 reviews on Amazon. Its strap-free design is best for side sleepers, according to the brand, although anyone can use it. The mask has four pods filled with weighted beads, two of which you put over your eyes to block out light. There’s fabric on both ends of the sleep mask — you pull one piece of fabric through the slit on the other piece to secure the mask to your head. You can also put the mask in the freezer if you want it to feel cool when you put it on.
Material: Cotton and microfleece | Style: Flat, weighted | Adjustable: Yes | Machine-washable: Yes, but the brand recommends air drying
You should wash your sleep mask once or twice a week, says Makhzoumi. Once a week is the baseline, but consider adding an extra wash if you have oily or acne-prone skin.
Be sure to wash your sleep mask with a gentle, unscented, fragrance-free laundry detergent and avoid fabric softeners and scent boosters, says Makhzoumi. Many people are sensitive to artificial scents and fragrances, which can cause allergic contact dermatitis, an immune response that may show up as itchiness, a rash or blisters, she says. With that being said, avoiding scents and fragrances entirely is your best bet when it comes to choosing a detergent.

Sleep masks tend to be most beneficial in situations where it’s difficult to control the artificial and/or natural light in your sleeping environment. For example, maybe your bed partner likes to stay up and read, you’re a shift worker who sleeps during the day or you’re trying to get some shuteye while traveling. Some people wear a sleep mask situationally, but others are more sensitive to light and use the accessory every night so they don’t see sunlight peeking through their shades or the flashing light on their Wi-Fi router. Sleep masks are also a low-cost alternative to getting a better sleep with blackout curtains if you don’t want to or can’t install them in your home.
Sleep masks may also be useful for those who have a hard time falling asleep, regardless of why. If you wear the mask every night, putting it on may become a signal that tells your body and mind it’s time to power down and get some rest, says Schneeberg.
If you tend to have a hard time waking up in the morning, wearing a sleep mask may not be a great idea, says Schneeberg. Just how darkness cues our body to sleep, light cues our body to wake up. And if you struggle to wake up with some light peaking through your curtains, creating a pitch black environment with a sleep mask will only make it worse, says Schneeberg. She specifically does not recommend sleep masks for tweens and teens who have trouble waking up for school on time.
Because sleep masks totally cover the eyes, some people wonder if they’re safe to wear for extended periods of time. All of our experts agree that sleep masks are safe to wear, so long as you can easily take it off by yourself. So, for example, people who have mobility restrictions and can't take a sleep mask off by themselves should not wear one, experts say.
Yes, kids can wear sleep masks, so long as they’re able to put it on and take it off by themselves, says Winter.
There are a few factors that greatly impact our sleep quality and quantity, including temperature, sound and light. The main concern as far as light goes is exposure right before or during bed, which can affect the circadian rhythms that dictate our sleep-wake cycle, experts told us.
When we see light during the day, mechanisms in our eyes feed back into parts of the brain that keep time, telling it to produce cortisol, a hormone that helps keep us awake and alert. Then, when our eyes perceive darkness at night, those same mechanisms communicate with the brain, telling it to produce melatonin, a hormone that makes us feel sleepy and relaxed, says Winter. Exposure to light at night can delay melatonin production, which may mean it takes us longer to fall asleep or prevent us from entering a deep sleep. With that being said, try to aim for total darkness when you’re going to bed to get the best sleep possible.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-cooling-pillows-ncna1273969,The best cooling pillows for hot sleepers,,"When it comes to getting quality rest, the temperature of your body — and the items around you — are key. “A cool sleep environment supports the natural dip in your body temperature that occurs in the evening, signaling it’s time to sleep,” says Seth Davis, a certified sleep coach and owner of Sleepably, a sleep services company. “If the environment is too hot, it can interfere with this process and make falling asleep more difficult.”
Cooling pillows, along with an air conditioner, are helpful options to have on hand since our heads are a significant source of heat, according to Davis. If your upper body gets particularly hot, a cooling pillow, which releases hot air instead of trapping it, might be a worthwhile investment.
To help you shop, we spoke with two sleep coaches for their pillow recommendations and guidance. We also included  some highly rated options based on expert recommendations.
SKIP AHEAD How we picked the best cooling pillows | Best cooling pillows | How to shop for cooling pillows
When building this list we focused on three key factors, which our experts recommend keeping in mind when considering a cooling pillow:
All of the cooling pillows we rounded up below are either direct recommendations from our experts, products NBC Select staff members have tried themselves or have at least a 4-star average rating from 500 reviews or more on Amazon.
This NBC Select Wellness Award winner earned high marks for its cooling foam and customizable design. Before ordering, you fill out a questionnaire to customize it to your unique sleep position and preferences. If you want basic cooling, you’ll get a pillow with a breathable eucalyptus surface. If you require something a bit more heavy-duty, the brand will send you a pillow with extra-cooling fibers. NBC Select associate updates editor Zoe Malin, who received the pillow from the brand, says it’s definitely worth getting if you’re a hot sleeper. “I’ve probably never spent more than like $30 on a pillow, but after trying this one, I completely understand why investing in a high-quality option is worth it,” she says. “It’s  great thickness and made my head, neck and back feel supported while sleeping.”
Dimensions: 24 x 16 in. (original size), 34 x 16 in. (king size) | Warranty: 1 year
This affordable pair of cooling pillows, which have a 4.4-average star rating from more than  21,300 reviews on Amazon, are ideal for side, back or stomach sleepers, according to the brand. The filling is made from microfiber, which is more cooling than down, and its cover is also made of the same breathable, sweat-absorbing fabric that’s used for the filling, according to Himoon.  Plus, they don’t have an off putting out-of-the-package smell, which is common with many bedding items, according to the brand.
Dimensions: 18 x 26 in. (standard), 19 x 29 in. (queen) and 19 x 34 in. (king) | Warranty: n/a
Tempur-Pedic makes some of the best cooling products for sleep, according to experts in our guide to the best cooling mattresses. This cooling pillow, which has a 4.3-star average rating from 3,834 reviews on Amazon, has a removable, machine-washable cover. It’s also made with a dual-sided cooling gel that adapts to your shape when you lay on it, according to the brand.
Dimensions: 27  x 19 in. (queen) and 35 x 19 in. (king) | Warranty: 5 years
This ergonomic foam pillow is made with air-circulating properties that keep heat from accumulating. The Casper pillow and an NBC Select Wellness Award winner also helps with head and neck alignment — you can choose between two pillow heights depending on how much support you want (the brand offers a short questionnaire to find out which could be best for you). “I’ve slept on a lot of pillows, but there is something about the way that this one supports my head while still feeling cloud-like,” says NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson, who received the pillow from Casper.
Dimensions: 18 x 26 in. (standard) and 16 x 32 in. (king) | Warranty: N/a
Davis recommends this supportive and breathable option, which is designed to keep its shape while wicking warmth away using its foam, graphite and cooling gel materials. While the foam pillow itself isn’t washable, the pillow cover — which is made from breathable micro polyamide and polyester — is. The brand recommends washing it in cold water with light colors.
Dimensions:  25 x 16 in. (standard) and 34 x 16 in. (king) | Warranty: 3 years
Latex pillows are naturally cooler than pillows made from memory foam, according to our experts.  This sustainable option from Birch, which has a 4.2-star average rating from 563 reviews on the brand’s site, is made with natural latex from Southeast Asia. The cover’s also made of 100%  organic cotton certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard, and the pillow itself is free of any polyurethane-based foams and harsh chemicals, according to the brand.
Dimensions: 28 x 20 in. (standard) and 36 x 20 in. (king) | Warranty: 1 year
This pillow, which has a 4.4-average star rating from 225,694 reviews on Amazon, has a gel fiber filling and breathable cover that give it its cooling properties. It’s Oeko-Tex Standard-Certified, which means it’s made without toxic substances. It’s also ideal for all back-, stomach- or side-sleepers since it has a firm construction that keeps its shape over time, according to the brand.
Dimensions: 26 x 20 in. (queen) and 30 x 20 in. (king) | Warranty: N/a
Another recommendation from Davis, this pillow has a honeycomb-patterned layer at its core that encourages airflow so you don’t overheat — it also provides neck and head support, according to the brand. Purple also  has pillows in both standard and king sizes, with either a low, medium or tall height. That means that you can customize the size of the pillow based on your body size. If you have broad shoulders, you can choose one that’s on the taller side. It’s also covered in a mesh-like, breathable fabric that encourages even more airflow so you don’t overheat, according to Purple.
Dimensions: 26 x 1 x 5.5 in. (standard low), 34 x 17 x 5.5 in. (king low), 26 x 17 x 6.5 in. (standard medium), 34 x 17 x 6.5 in. (king medium), 28 x 17 x 7.5 in. (standard tall) and 34 x 17 x 7.5 in. (king tall) | Warranty: 1 year
Here’s what experts recommend you keep in mind before you buy:
Fabric: The material of a pillow cover (not to be confused with a pillow case) influences whether it dissipates heat or traps it.Cotton, Tencel, bamboo and even wool are all breathable fabrics that encourage airflow and wick moisture away, according to our experts. You should also prioritize fabrics that have Oeko-Tex certification, which means it’s made without harmful textile substances. “We spend a third of our lives sleeping and we want to make sure that the materials that we are sleeping on are safe,” says Kelly Murray, a  certified pediatric and adult sleep coach Finally, you should avoid synthetic fabrics since many tend to have a tighter weave that prevents air from moving through.
Fill: Pay attention to what’s inside your pillow. Some pillows are able to absorb heat and still stay cool. Cooling gel and wool are the common materials to do so. “I prefer wool fill for hot sleepers as it is excellent for thermal regulation and is moisture-wicking,” says Murray
Ventilation and airflow: Many pillows are made of memory foam, a material that adapts to your head shape and can make for a more comfortable sleep. Unless memory foam has proper ventilation, it can get very hot. So, it’s best to look for memory foam pillows that have holes or channels that allow for air to flow through, says Davis. If a cooling pillow doesn’t have memory foam, you still want to make sure the inside allows for proper airflow. Experts suggest looking for pillows that feel light, as options with dense insides often prevent ventilation.

Blackout curtains can also help regulate your sleep quality — studies have found that shifts in light exposure before you rise can disrupt circadian rhythm (the internal process that regulates sleep).
If you want blackout curtains for your home, we spoke to experts about what to consider when shopping for them. We also included their top picks for the best blackout curtains below, including options tested by NBC Select staff.
SKIP AHEAD How we picked the best blackout curtains | The best blackout curtains | How to shop for blackout curtains
In addition to blocking out light, blackout curtains can double as decor, much like other shades, blinds or curtains you’d install. Because of this, the one you choose largely depends on your personal preferences and your home’s aesthetic. Experts recommend thinking about the following factors while shopping:
The blackout curtains below are all highly rated, and available in various sizes and drapery styles. Options recommended by experts and tested by NBC Select staff are also included.
According to NBC Select social editor Sadhana Daruvri, this Bed and Bath Award winner  successfully blocks light and quiets street noise. She says the curtain loops made installation quick and easy — plus, her apartment feels cooler. These curtains, available in four colors and three sizes, have a cross-weave pattern that gives them a natural texture, according to the brand.
Material: 100% cotton | Size: 48 in. wide and 84, 96, or 108  in. long | Drapery style: Fabric loops | Care: Dry clean only
Another Bed and Bath Award-winner, these curtains fit Daruvuri’s windows perfectly and were easy to install over her curtain rod, she says. They deliver a 100% total blackout, according to the brand, and are thermal-insulated and made from recycled materials. Daruvuri also says that her room felt cooler and less noisy with these curtains, which are available in five colors and three sizes.
Material: Polyester | Size: 40 in. wide and 63, 84, or 95  in. long | Drapery style: Pole pocket | Care: Machine washable
Price is based on 40 in. wide and 84 in. long cotton curtains
Beth Brown, an interior designer and owner of Beth Brown Interiors in Atlanta, and Pamela O’Brien, principal interior designer at Pamela Hope Designs, recommend The Shade Store as a great resource to customize the exact type of blackout curtain you want. “With over eight drapery styles and more than 650 fabric materials, you can basically create whatever type of blackout curtain you have in mind,” says Brown. However, due to the customization feature and their overall quality, both experts say The Shade Store will cost more than your average home goods or big box retailer stores.
Material: Customizable | Size range: Customizable | Drapery style: Customizable | Care: Depends on fabric you choose
O’Brien recommends Pottery Barn’s blackout curtains due to their range of styles and colors “that work well with most people’s houses.” The brand’s Emery Linen Blackout Curtain is “a wonderful linen curtain at an affordable price point,” says Susan Peters, owner and interior designer for 9108 Designs. It’s sold as a single panel and Peters adds that “it doesn’t give off a ‘blackout’ vibe.” The curtain comes with hooks to use with the built-in fabric loops. You can also purchase clips or round rings separately.
Material: Linen and cotton blend | Size range: 50-100 in. wide and 84-108 in. long | Drapery style: Fabric loops, rod pocket or back tabs | Care: Dry clean
These woven curtains have a gold stud trim and come individually or as a set of two in one of three colors: Nude Blush, Black or Ivory. Peters emphasizes PBteen’s combination of quality and design details. “Don’t let the ‘teen’ part fool you — this curtain is appropriate for all ages,” she adds. “Pottery Barn across the board makes some amazing blackout curtains.”
Material: Cotton canvas | Size range: 52 in. wide and 63-108 in. long | Drapery style: Pole pockets | Care: Dry clean
These thermal insulated drapes, which I’ve used, can block up to 99% light, according to the brand. Brown agrees that they can be a good option for the bedroom. The curtains are available in 24 fade-resistant colors and they come with two panels per package to accommodate various types of windows and styles.
Material: Polyester blend | Size range: 29-55 in. wide and 45-96 in. long | Drapery style: Grommets | Care: Machine washable
Our experts agree that Pottery Barn Kids has good quality blackout curtain options for a nursery or child’s room. “They have really set a high bar for the style of blackout curtains by selling an abundance of unique, stylish curtains in various colors,” says Peters.
One of her favorites is this curtain. While ruffles add fun details, they’re also available with a simple pleat design if you’re looking for a basic style.
Material: Cotton weave | Size range: 44 in. wide and 63-96 in. long | Drapery style: Four-in-one top treatment, choose from pole pocket, belt loop, clip rings or drapery rings | Care: Dry clean
Placing a blackout curtain liner under your regular curtain can be an effective (and often more economical) way to get the blackout effect, according to Peters. “You can buy any curtains that fit your style and pair them with a blackout curtain or blackout curtain liner,” she said. Our experts recommend this blackout liner that comes with two panels and drapery rings, and blocks out light up to 99%, according to the brand.
Material: Fabric | Size: 27-50 in. wide and 59-92 in. long | Drapery style: Fabric loops | Care: Machine washable
“This selection accomplishes all of your needs for a beautifully designed blackout curtain that’s still reasonably priced,” says Beth Brown, an interior designer and owner of Beth Brown Interiors in Atlanta. You can buy individually or in a set of two, along with separate ring clips.
Material: Polyester | Size: 44 in. wide and 80-104 in. long | Drapery style: Pole pockets | Care: Dry clean
“This is a super economical choice that ships quickly and comes in a multitude of colors and patterns,” says Brown. “Given the fabric type, they do a nice job of blocking outside noise and insulating rooms for energy efficiency.” They come with two panels and Velcro ties to pull them back. Plus, they’re made in an Oeko-TEX standard factory. And with their reasonable price point and range of styles, Brown says they’re an ideal choice for rooms that change often — like kids’ rooms — or for renters.
Material: Polyester and a triple weave fabric | Size: 42-52 in. wide and 63-96 in. long | Drapery style: Grommets or rod pockets | Care: Machine washable
The best blackout curtains for your room depend on several elements, including drapery style, size and price point. “It’s important to think about how these curtains are being used and where they’ll be located in the home to evaluate what makes sense for your long-term lifestyle needs,” says Brown. Below are some factors experts recommend thinking through while shopping.
If you’re looking for patterns, ruffles or any other stylish elements, Brown suggests looking in the kids and teens sections, even if you’re not shopping for a kid’s room.
“Blackout curtains for grown-ups tend to be more plain — kids’ options usually offer a little something more to them,” she says. Buying curtains from kids’ sites can also save you a little money since they’re usually much cheaper than adult styles, she adds.
No matter what style you choose, always read the fine print before making your final purchase to avoid potential disappointment. “Be sure that you see the word ‘blackout’ in the description as opposed to ‘room darkening’ or ‘light filtering,’” says Peters. “These other two options may not block as much of the light from your room.”
While there are multiple drapery styles and curtain sizes to choose from, experts agree these all depend on your personal preferences and the shape and size of your windows.
Drapery style — or how the drapes hang from a curtain rod — is one of the most important things to consider when shopping for blackout curtains, according to our experts. Here are the different types:
“Using draperies with rings is much more user-friendly, and if you want blackout-lined drapes, you will likely open and close them every day,” says O’Brien. She adds that rings tend to glide along a rod easily, while rod pockets and grommets are “clunky, more difficult to open and close and don’t look as pretty and polished.” Ultimately, though, this decision comes down to personal preference.
O’Brien also says that curtains with blackout lining are heavier than typical curtains, so investing in a good quality drapery rod is important. “Don’t buy the thinnest, least expensive rod — you don’t want it to sag or break,” she says, adding that shoppers should look for a rod that has a larger diameter of about one inch that can hold more fabric. And while there’s a price jump, both O’Brien and Brown recommend a traverse rod, which features a baton or string that you pull to open and close the curtains for additional ease.
Minimizing how much light leaks into the room can be a matter of sizing. “You don’t want to buy drapery that’s exactly the size of your window because light is going to leak out along all the edges,” said O’Brien.
Depending on the length of your ceiling and where the window is located, Brown suggests measuring at least 8-10inches from the sides of the window, if possible, so the curtains are wider than your actual windows. And as a rule of thumb for floor-length curtains, Brown recommends they “kiss the floor,” meaning curtains should be an inch or so above the ground. Our experts emphasized that hiring a professional to measure the right size curtain can help avoid mistakes and costly replacements.
The term “blackout curtain” often refers to drapes made of a double-lined, tightly woven fabric designed to block out light completely, Brown explains. There are also built-in blackout liners made to completely block out light, which is accomplished through “a coating that’s applied to the fabric [that] blocks the little pores in the weave,” says Brown. “This material is thick and offers thermal insulation benefits, blocks out noise and creates ultimate privacy.”
Besides keeping the morning sun out of your eyes, there are other benefits:
Blackout curtains are best made out of heavy, close-knit fabrics, such as polyester. These materials are solid enough to block light, and are also heavy enough to help insulate the room against cold and noise.
Blackout curtains can come in all colors, and all are effective — the “blacking out” effect is caused by the curtain’s interior, meaning that the exterior can be any color and still work well at blocking light.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-body-pillows-rcna142765,Is there actually a difference between body pillows and pregnancy pillows?,,"Standard pillows keep your head and neck comfortable overnight, but the rest of your body might need extra support, too. If you experience back, hip or knee pain in bed, wake up with a tingly feeling in your arms and legs or just need help getting cozy, a body pillow is worth investing in to improve your sleep quality.
“You want to feel ‘nothing’ while you’re sleeping, meaning have no feeling of discomfort anywhere,” says Colleen Louw, a therapeutic pain specialist and certification director at Evidence in Motion. “A body pillow can help you find the optimal position that puts less stress on your joints and other tissues, promotes blood flow and keeps your spine aligned.”
I spoke to experts about how to shop for a body pillow, who is an ideal candidate for one and what benefits (and drawbacks) you should be aware of before bringing one home. I  also rounded up a handful of body pillows across sizes and shapes.

While shopping for a body pillow, experts recommend thinking about the following factors, all of which I considered while putting together our list of favorites.
To recommend the best body pillows, I rounded up options that align with expert guidance. All the body pillows on our list are expert or NBC Select staff picks.
Buffy’s Wiggle Pillow, which won an NBC Select Bed and Bath Award, is beloved by many staff members for sleeping and lounging. “It works for padding my lower back when I’m sitting on the couch and as a way to elevate my neck and legs when I’m in bed,” says NBC Select associate reporter Ashley Morris. “I also like using it as a cozy stand for my iPad when I’m watching movies in bed.” The pillow is tube-shaped and extra long at 82 inches, making it a great option for those who are tall. It’s also versatile since it’s flexible enough to twist in different positions or tie it in a knot. The pillow comes with a removable, machine-washable cover that gets softer with every wash, according to the brand. You can also buy additional linen and sherpa covers in various colors and patterns.
Shape: cylindrical | Size: 82 x 8 in. | Fill: recycled plastic | Cover material: lyocell fiber blend | Washability: machine-washable cover, dry clean pillow insert
“I’m a side sleeper, but I started noticing that I was pivoting more and more toward my stomach, which I know is not a good sleeping position, so I got this pillow to support me better,” says NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz. “I love how wide it is, and it’s easy to rest my arms on or over it, depending on positioning.” Coop’s body pillow is filled with memory foam and microfiber, which you can remove to customize its loft (thickness). It comes encased in a soft, removable, machine-washable cover.
Shape: rectangular | Size: 54 x 20 in. | Fill: memory foam and microfiber | Cover material: rayon and polyester blend | Washability: machine-washable cover and inner lining
“I started using this body pillow when I was pregnant and I continued to use it long after my daughter was born,” says NBC Select contributing editor Bethany Heitman. “I also find it great for propping myself up while I watch TV in bed.” The pillow is shaped like an “L” so you can hug it, resting your head on the curve and placing the long side between your knees for support. The medium-firm pillow comes with a removable, machine-washable cover.
Shape: L-shaped | Size: 65 x 31 in. | Fill: polyester | Cover material: jersey knit | Washability: machine-washable cover
“I used this pillow throughout both of my pregnancies, and I still use it now because it feels like a warm hug,” says NBC commerce senior photo editor Becca Delman. “The soft material is so nice, and the pillow’s U-shape lets you adjust it around your body. It’s great to hold up your bump when you’re laying on your side.” The pillow has a removable, machine-washable cover, and it offers back, hip, leg, belly, head and neck support, according to the brand.
Shape: U-shaped | Size: 57 x 28 in. | Fill: polyester | Cover material: velvet | Washability: machine-washable cover
Using the Bearaby Cuddler was my first experience with a body pillow, and I was surprised by how much more comfortable I felt throughout the night when I snuggled up with it. I don’t always sleep in the same position, so I love being able to curve it into any shape I want, ensuring that it always supports my body from head to toe. The pillow is made from a squish-able foam that cushions my joints, and even after about two years of use, it’s maintained its overall feel. The Cuddler comes with a breathable, removable, machine-washable cotton cover. You can buy additional knit and linen covers separately.
Shape: cylindrical | Size: 75 x 8 in. | Fill: natural latex foam | Cover material: cotton | Washability: machine-washable cover
Wall says Pluto’s body pillow is a popular option. It’s about 9 inches thick, so it’s very plush, and it comes with a quilted, removable, machine-washable cover. The pillow is made from hypoallergenic materials, according to the brand. Pluto offers a 125-night trial with your purchase — if you don’t like it, you can return it for a refund.
Shape: rectangular | Size: 54 x 21 in. | Fill: synthetic fiber | Cover material: microfiber | Washability: machine-washable cover and pillow insert
While a standard pillow is designed to cradle your head and neck, a body pillow can support other areas, like your back, hips, arms and legs while sleeping on your side, says Dr. Valerie Cacho, an integrative sleep physician and women’s sleep expert. To align your spine, you can hug the upper part of the body pillow and put the lower part between your knees. Maintaining proper, neutral alignment while sleeping prevents joint closure, which can cause discomfort and pain, and helps keep your blood flowing, says Louw. “You must keep blood flowing while you’re asleep or your brain will want to keep waking you up to restore blood flow to joints and other tissues,” she says.
Body pillows are also beneficial for snorers or those who have difficulty breathing on their back, says Cacho. “They can help people stay on their side, reducing the effects gravity has on the tongue and upper airway, thus allowing more airflow during sleep,” she says.
Anyone who experiences neck, back, hip, knee or ankle pain while sleeping should consider using a body pillow, especially if discomfort causes you to wake up throughout the night, says Louw. They’re also useful during pregnancy to support the abdomen and alleviate related lower back pain.
There’s essentially no difference between a pregnancy pillow and a body pillow, and the names are often used interchangeably, says Louw. Because of this, anyone can use a body pillow as a pregnancy pillow, or vice versa.
That said, pillows labeled “pregnancy pillows” tend to be U-shaped with two long sides connected by a curve in the middle. People rest their head on the curve, draping one long side behind them and the other in front of them, so the pillow props up their back while supporting their growing bump. Sleeping with a U-shaped body pillow stabilizes those who are pregnant and prevents them from being able to move around much in their sleep, which keeps them in one comfortable spot, says Louw.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-white-noise-machine-ncna1261366,"The best white noise machines, tested and approved",,"Anyone experiencing difficulty falling asleep — or staying asleep — has likely tried several tools and tricks to get better rest, like cooling sheets and wedge pillows. One gadget that experts often recommend: white noise machines.
“If someone has difficulty sleeping because of various sounds, whether those environmental sounds are constant or sporadic, then a white noise machine may help to smooth out that noise,” explains Dr. Michael Gradisar, head of sleep science at Sleep Cycle, a sleep tracking app. In addition to helping with sleep, a white noise machine can also be used to drown out distracting noise while working on trying to concentrate.
We asked Gradisar and two other experts about the benefits of white noise and the features to prioritize while shopping for a machine. Our list also includes models we’ve tested extensively.
SKIP AHEAD How we picked the best white noise machines | The best white noise machines | What to consider while shopping for a white noise machine | White noise machine benefits | What are the different types of color noises? | Why trust NBC Select?
Beyond simply playing white noise, sleep experts say there are a few other features you should look for when shopping.

Our list includes a mix of favorites tested by NBC Select staff and highly rated options that align with our expert guidance.
The LectroFan Evo, an NBC Select Wellness Award winner, is a compact model with 10 fan sounds, 10 white, pink and brown noise variations and two ocean sounds. The machine offers precise volume control, a timer to automatically turn off sounds and an audio connector for headphones or a portable speaker. “I love this sound machine,” says editorial projects manager Rebecca Rodriguez, who often struggles with anxiety before bed. “I don’t really need anything fancy out of a sound machine and this one is simple, small and relaxing.“
Bonus features: nature sounds, headphone jack, multiple white noise variants
Sunrise alarm clocks, like the Hatch Restore 3, gradually emit light to gently encourage you out of your slumber instead of suddenly jolting you awake as standard alarm clocks do. This machine has a white, brown and pink noise setting and you can adjust the volume to your liking. “After using it for months, I can safely say that the Hatch Restore 3 (which the brand sent me to try) has altered my sleep for the better,” says Zoe Malin, NBC Select reporter. “I no longer dread waking up because I have the device’s beautiful lightscape and serene noise to look forward to.”
Bonus features: sunrise light, clock, nature sounds, instrumental music, podcast pairing, brown and pink noise
The Yogasleep Dohm Uno is a good option for those who want a simple, affordable, no-nonsense white noise machine. It comes with a one-year limited warranty and a single-dial mode that adjusts tone and volume to create a more personalized sound environment for sleep. I own two of these. I keep one outside my toddler’s door to block out household noises while she sleeps and the other in my bedroom to do the same. I love how simple it is to plug it in and flip the switch. There is no volume knob, but you can slightly lower the sound by turning the top to cover some of the speaker vents.
Bonus features: adjustable tone, available in a different color
This simple white noise machine from Adaptive Sound Technologies offers 10 fan sounds and 10 ambient noise variations (including white, pink and brown noise). It is powered by either AC or USB and you can adjust the volume with simple up and down buttons. Malin also uses this sound machine and says it’s ideal for anyone who wants a no-frills device that’s easy to use. “It has a built-in timer, which is great for anyone who doesn’t like to leave the sound machine on all night, and due to its small size, I can fit it in a suitcase or weekender bag while traveling,” she says. Since it retails for less than $50 and offers 20 different sounds, including brown and pink noise, it’s arguably the best value white noise machine on this list.
Bonus features: pink and brown noise, available in a different color
The smallest white noise machine on our list, this option has six different sounds to choose from. It can also be charged and used without a cord, making it easy to move around. “I had never used a sound machine before trying this product, but I was delighted by how easy it is to set up and put to use,” says Cory Fernandez, commerce editor at NBC Select. “It’s also super compact, lightweight and easy to bring with you when you travel.” It’s only around the circumference of a soda can and around half the height. Plus, since you can use it without a cord, you can bring it with you to a private workout or meditation session. You can also put it on a 10-, 30- or 60-minute timer, depending on what you plan on using it for.
Bonus features: nature sounds, meditation sounds, portability, 10 volume settings
You can use this sound machine when traveling or keep it on a bedside table, thanks to its slender shape. “I’ve owned this sound machine for almost six years and it’s still in perfect condition. I originally bought it for travel because I can’t sleep without a noise machine, and apps on my phone just weren’t cutting it,” says Malin, who notes she uses the above Hatch model at home and this one on the go. “This sound machine is battery operated, slim enough to throw in a suitcase without taking up too much room, and lets me customize the volume and sound I want to hear.” In addition to white noise, this machine plays rain, thunder, ocean and brook noises. You can choose between a timer of 15, 30 or 60 minutes, and since it has a flat bottom, you don’t have to worry about accidentally knocking it over in the middle of the night.
Bonus features: nature sounds
This small, square-shaped sound machine, which has a 4.5-star average rating from 62,301 reviews on Amazon, has more than 30 volume settings so you can find the exact one that fits your preferences. In addition to white, brown and pink noise, it makes sounds such as a running brook, birds, a campfire and waves. You can also set it on a timer for 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes or let it run continuously while you sleep. The speaker faces upward and all of the controls are on the side.
Bonus features: nature sounds, 30+ volume settings, multi-hour timer
If you are shopping for a white noise machine, the experts we spoke to suggest keeping the following in mind:
White noise machines emit calming sounds to create a gentle, constant noise that many find soothing and helpful when trying to fall asleep. “The main way that white noise machines help with sleep is that they can mask other noises, absorbing wayward sounds that might otherwise disturb sleep — it’s like a blanket of sound that prevents other noises from getting through,” says Dr. Michael Grandner, who serves as director for both the Sleep and Health Research Program and the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Clinic. Here’s a breakdown of its main benefits:
Aside from white noise, sound machines sometimes distribute pink and brown noise, which differ in overall pitch frequency, according to Lynelle Schneeberg, PsyD, a fellow at American Academy of Sleep Medicine and an assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine. “White noise has a higher pitch than brown noise while brown noise reminds some people of ocean waves,” she says. “The sound a person chooses is really just a matter of personal preference.” White noise machines are more widely available than those that play pink or brown noise. Here’s a breakdown of the different types of noises:

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/weighted-stuffed-animals-ncna1300519,Weighted stuffed animals that can help adults and kids relax,,"Chances are you’ve heard about the potential benefits of using a weighted blanket — for example, research has found that they can help decrease anxiety and help with insomnia. Looking for something a little lighter, more portable and, let’s face it, cuter? Weighted stuffed animals are the answer. Less cumbersome than their blanket counterparts, weighted stuffed animals offer similar calming benefits and are a great option for kids, although anyone can use them, says Lynelle Schneeberg, a licensed clinical psychologist and assistant professor at the Yale School of Medicine.
I talked to experts to learn what you should know about weighted stuffed animals before buying one. I also rounded up a handful of highly rated options to purchase for yourself or a loved one, some of which NBC Select staff members tested.
SKIP AHEAD The best weighted stuffed animals to shop
While shopping for weighted stuffed animals, experts recommend considering the following factors.
All of the weighted stuffed animals I recommend below come in multiple styles, so if you’re looking for something specific, like a certain color or character, be sure to browse the full selections on brands' websites.
Warmies offers dozens of weighted stuffed animals in various sizes, weights, styles and characters, so you're guaranteed to find something for the child in your life, regardless of their age or preferences. The brand sells a weighted sloth, bear, lion and shark, for example, plus animal wraps and pairs of hugging animals. Each stuffed animal is filled with flaxseed and dried lavender to promote relaxation, according to the brand. You can also place them in the microwave and freezer.
Warmies sent Bianca Alvarez, NBC Select associate reporter, its Dumpling and Sloth Junior stuffies, which she gave her young siblings. Warmies' Sloth Junior is one of the brand's smaller stuffed animals, and Alvarez says it doesn't take up much room in their beds, making it a great addition to bedtime. Her 12-year-old sister claimed the dumpling, which she lays with while doing homework or studying. ""It really makes stressful situations that much calmer for her, and allows her to easily transition into going to bed,"" says Alvarez.
Weight: Model dependent  | Dimensions: Model dependent
Bearaby’s weighted stuffed animals are filled with terraclay, a biodegradable material, and covered in a soft cotton knit fabric. They’re available in seven characters: Elli Elephant, Remi Rabbit, Benji Bear, Daisy Dino, Darcy Dog, Suzy Sloth and Cody Cow. Each weighted stuffed animal has large, plush, extra heavy paws that you can squeeze like a stress ball. They’re also machine-washable and come packed inside a canvas bag.
A post shared by NBC Select (@nbcselect)
Bearaby sent Rebecca Rodriguez, NBC Select editorial projects manager, one of its weighted stuffed animals to try earlier this year and she fell in love with it immediately. “I sleep with Cody Cow every night, and when I take naps on the couch, I bring him to the living room from my bedroom,” she says. “He’s the perfect size to wrap my arms around and he makes me feel calmer because the weight against my chest feels like a hug.” Rodriguez also appreciates that the weighted stuffed animal is on the firmer side so it supports her head it she rests against it.
Weight: 3.5 lbs. | Dimensions: 16.75x8.75 in.
Hugimals’ puppy is weighted with a removable pouch of non-toxic glass beads, so you can easily machine wash the plush cover as needed. Beyond Charlie the Puppy, Hugimals sells other weighted stuffed animals like Emory the Elephant, Quinn the Koala, Frankie the Cat and Sam the Sloth. The brand sent me the koala to test and I was impressed by its overall construction. It's plush enough to feel cozy, yet firm enough to sit up on its own. The fabric exterior is soft against my skin, too. At 4.5 pounds, I felt light pressure  on my legs when I placed the weighted stuffed animal on my lap, but it's definitely manageable for kids to tote around.
Weight: 4.5 lbs. | Dimensions: 20x8x6 in.
This puppy is designed to rest across your lap while you’re in bed, sitting in an office chair or laying on the couch. It’s filled with microbeads and covered in hypoallergenic polyester fabric. The stuffed animal’s outer cover and weighted insert are machine-washable.
Weight: 3.6 lbs. | Dimensions: 29x8 in.
The weight of this triceratops dinosaur is distributed across six zones, so it offers even pressure no matter how you hug or snuggle with it. The stuffed animal is filled with glass beads that don’t make any sound as they move, according to the brand.
Weight: 5 lbs. | Dimensions: 25.2x7.87 in.
Bearaby’s Hugget — a Select Wellness Award winner — is a great weighted stuffed animal alternative. I own one and hug it whenever I’m lounging on the couch, plus I keep it out in my living room at all times because its knot design doubles as a piece of home decor. The weighted pillow is made from Melofoam, a plant-based material, and is covered in an organic cotton fabric. Bearaby’s Huggets are approved by the American Chiropractic Association (ACA).
Weight: 0.5, 1 or 3 lbs. | Dimensions: 4 in. (small), 8 in. (medium) or 11 in. (large)
“Weighted stuffed animals are a riff on weighted blankets,” says Schneeberg. They usually weigh between 1 pound and 5 pounds, and they can get their weight from materials like dried flaxseed, beads or layers of fabric.
Weighted stuffed animals are smaller than weighted blankets, so they cover less of the body and you can hold them on your lap or sleep with them (usually with your arms wrapped around them), experts say. While anyone can use a weighted stuffed animal, they’re geared toward children: Weighted blankets are often too large and heavy for kids to maneuver by themselves, while weighted stuffed animals are smaller, lighter and similar to other toys they may already have at home, says Dimitriu.
Like weighted blankets, the benefits of weighted stuffed animals center around deep pressure stimulation, which uses gentle pressure to induce feeling safe, cozy and calm. “They both provide pressure the same way a hug, massage or baby swaddle would,” says Schneeberg. And while people anecdotally say weighted blankets and weighted stuffed animals make them feel less anxious or stressed, as well as help them sleep, there’s no hard research supporting one or the other, says Dimitru. In the end, it’s a matter of comfort and personal preference. So if you’re curious about weighted stuffed animals, they’re worth a try.
When introducing weighted stuffed animals to children, be conscious of how you do it, says Schneeberg. If kids use weighted stuffed animals to help them fall asleep every night, for instance, they may become reliant on them at bedtime, otherwise known as a sleep onset association, she says. Kids want consistency with their bedtime routine, and a disruption like having their weighted stuffed animal taken away — if it gets lost or you can’t bring it on a trip, for example — may cause them to have trouble sleeping.
Yes, it’s safe for adults and kids to sleep with a weighted stuffed animal, as long as they can move it by themselves, experts say. For example, a child should be able to pick it up and carry it easily. One exception is babies younger than 1 year, who should have an empty crib. Do not put stuffed animals of any sort near them, says Schneeberg.

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-silk-pillowcases-rcna142781,The 9 best silk pillowcases of 2025,,"Even if you have one of the best pillows, your pillowcase can lead to frizz and wrinkles. “This friction on your face can lead to sleep lines, which over time, with repeated pressure, can develop into more permanent facial lines,” says Dr. Anna Chacon, a board-certified dermatologist in Miami, Florida. “Moreover, the absorbency of regular pillowcases can strip the skin of natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation.”
Using a silk pillowcase can help avoid this. “The natural material is less likely to absorb moisture and natural oils from your skin [and hair], helping to keep it hydrated and reducing the potential for irritation,” says Chacon. “Furthermore, silk’s smooth surface can reduce the friction between your skin and the pillowcase, which may help to prevent the formation of sleep lines and wrinkles.”

To narrow down the best silk pillowcases, I used the criteria shared by the dermatologists I spoke to. In addition to meeting the expert-given criteria, these pillowcases either come highly recommended by NBC Select staffers or have at least a 4.0-star average rating from over 1,000 reviews.
Made from pure mulberry silk with a 22 momme, this pillowcase won an NBC Select Wellness Award because it’s soft, comfortable and reduces frizz. “I’ve had this pillowcase for years and it’s still in great condition,” says NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown. “I can’t sleep with a headwrap or bonnet because I’m a hot sleeper, so silk pillowcases are a must for keeping my curls in tact.”
Silk type: mulberry silk | Closure: zipper | Machine washable: yes
This pillowcase is made of 100% mulberry silk and has a hidden zipper to keep it closed. It has a momme grading of 19, making it a heavier-weight silk that feels luxurious, according to the brand. Choose between 24 colors, such as burgundy, silver, and white, and four sizes: standard, queen, king, and toddler. This pillowcase has a 4.6-star average rating from over 24,900 reviews on Amazon.

SpaSilk’s pillow, which has a 4.3-star average rating from over 3,400 reviews on Amazon, is made from 100% silk and is hypoallergenic, meaning it’s great for sensitive skin. It’s available in queen and king sizes. To keep your pillow secure, it has an envelope flap closure.
Silk type: charmeuse silk | Closure: envelope flap | Machine washable: yes
Talk about options. This silk pillowcase comes in 53 colors and three sizes — but that’s not the only benefit. “Not only has this pillowcase made my super sensitive skin feel much less red and irritated in the morning, but it also helps me sleep so much better at night thanks to the soft and cooling fabric,” says NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio, who has shared her love of Blissy’s pillowcase before. “Plus, the fabric’s breathability is great when the months turn warmer, especially since I’m a hot sleeper.”

Silk type: mulberry silk | Closure: zipper | Machine washable: yes
Silk pillowcases have several perks for both your skin and hair. “They keep your skin cool while you sleep, so your face may sweat less. They also do a better job keeping your skin hydrated because they absorb less moisture than cotton pillowcases,” says Dr. Brendan Camp, a board-certified dermatologist with MDCS Dermatology. “Silk is also hypoallergenic and for people with sensitive skin, or whose skin reacts to certain fabrics, silk is gentle on the skin.”
Silk may also help with fine lines. “While it’s an overstatement to say that regular pillowcases directly cause wrinkles, they can potentially contribute to their formation due to the friction caused by rougher materials,” says Chacon. “This friction can lead to sleep lines, which over time, with repeated pressure, can develop into more permanent facial lines.”
When it comes to your hair, silk pillowcases’ ability to prevent friction means your hair won’t rub against it and get frizzy. Similar to your skin, silk also won’t draw moisture out of your strands.
Most silk pillowcases are made from mulberry silk, which comes from silkworms that feed on the mulberry plant. That said, there are other types of silks that you may see when shopping. The only difference is that other silks come from other types of silkworms, spiders or plants.
I also recommend a charmeuse pillowcase on this list. Charmeuse is a type of weave rather than a type of material and enhances shine on one side, leaving the other more dull.
Think of it this way: Silk is a material (like cotton or polyester), whereas satin is a type of weave (like cable knit or basket weave). A satin weave produces a glossy surface, so you notice more shine. Silk can be woven with a satin weave, so some silk pillowcases say they are silk satin.
The experts I spoke to agree that silk pillowcases work for everyone and can benefit all skin and hair types. Those with facial hair are the only people who may want to think twice. “Because silk may be more susceptible to snag or wear and tear, those with stubble or coarse facial hair may notice disruptions in the fabric,” says Camp.
“Silk pillowcases tend to require additional care,” says Camp. While a cotton pillowcase can be thrown in the washer and dryer, some silk cases require a more gentle approach. Always check the care instructions that come with your silk pillowcase. Generally speaking, you should hand wash or clean silk pillowcases on a gentle cycle and air dry, says Camp.

When it comes to cooling sheets, the right fabric can go a long way. The experts we spoke to recommend keeping the following factors in mind:
Below, we’ve rounded up expert-recommended cooling sheets and Select staff favorites to help you have a restful, temperature-regulated sleep.
Bamboo sheets, like this option from Cozy Earth, are a favorite among Dr. Harris and NBC Select  updates editor Mili Godio, who tried them for NBC Select’s Wellness Awards. “I’m a very hot sleeper and they’re the most cooling ones I’ve tried,” she says. “They’re also super soft and lightweight without feeling like I’m slipping around.” The sheets are made from 100% viscose from bamboo fabric and fit both regular and deep pocket mattresses up to 20 inches. They are available in seven neutral colors, like white, driftwood or oat.

Made of 100% long-staple Egyptian cotton, these percale weave sheets were Select’s 2023 Wellness Award Winner for the best overall sheets. The Oeko-Tex certified sheets are structured, yet smooth to the touch, says associate updates editor Zoe Malin and Parachute says they get softer with each wash. The set comes in eight colors with a fitted sheet and two pillowcases but no top sheet.
Sizes: Twin to California King | What’s included: One fitted sheet and two pillowcases | Oeko-Tex certified: Yes
These linen sheets, which are made from 100%  European flax fibers, are another cooling option for those who run hot. “I’m such a hot sleeper and I love these sheets,” says NBC Select commerce editor Lindsay Schneider who tested this linen set from Brooklinen. They’re stonewashed and woven with a breathable and cooling pattern, according to the brand, which makes them ideal for particularly warm evenings.

These linen sheets from Parachute come recommended by Harris, who says that they’re “made using natural lightweight materials that promote airflow and wick away heat.”. The Oeko-Tex certified sheets, also a favorite of Select editorial director Lauren Swanson, are made of European flax and are currently available in 12 colors.

Swanson is also a fan of this linen sheet set from Riley Home. They’re made from euroflax Belgian linen and have a super soft garment-washed finish, according to the brand. The sheets are only available in white with the option to add a flat sheet.
Sizes: Queen to King | What’s included: One fitted sheet and two pillowcase | Oeko-Tex certified: Yes
We included this sheet set in our roundup of the best bed sheets. The sheets, which have a 4.4-star average rating from 3,388 reviews on Amazon, are made of a cooling, moisture-wicking fabric that helps prevent sweating and regulate body temperature, according to the brand. Plus, they get softer after each wash and don’t shrink, fade or pill, according to the brand.

When looking for cooling sheets, it’s important to pay attention to the weave and whether they are designed with phase-change materials.
If you run hot, you should look out for breathable materials like cotton, linen, or bamboo, according to Harris, who says they “allow for better airflow and temperature regulation.” Materials that have moisture-wicking capabilities also can help “pull moisture away from the body and promote a cooler and drier sleep environment.” She also recommends avoiding synthetic materials, such as polyester or acrylic, as they have poor breathability, or heavy fabrics such as flannel, velvet, or fleece, which are designed for warmth and insulation.
Harris says cooling sheets with an open weave, like percale, wick moisture away. Separately, some sheets may also incorporate natural or synthetic cooling technologies such as phase change materials or cooling gel-infused fibers (though we did not include these in this guide).

https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-sleep-sacks-rcna143196,"The best sleep sacks, tried by babies and parents",,"Any parent with an infant can tell you that getting a baby to sleep can sometimes feel harder than solving the Pythagorean theorem. There are wake windows to consider, feeding times and so much more. On top of all that, you can’t just throw a baby into a cozy bed with a bunch of blankets to create a warm atmosphere. Blankets are a big no-no when it comes to sleeping infants, according to safe sleep guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). A baby can get tangled up in a blanket, making it unsafe.
Instead, experts recommend sleep sacks to keep babies warm while they snooze. “A sleep sack is simply a zip-up ‘bag’ that your baby or toddler can wear as an alternative to a blanket — it’s essentially a “wearable blanket,” says Cara Dumaplin, a baby sleep expert and founder of Taking Cara Babies, which offers online sleep classes. To help you figure out the best sleep sack for your baby’s needs, we spoke with 3 experts and asked them to identify what to look for when you shop — plus, got their recommendations on top sleep sacks currently available.

Some sleep sacks have arms, others are sleeveless, some are lightweight and some are heavy wool — in other words, figuring out what you need can be tricky due to the sheer velocity of options. It’s also worth noting some of it will simply come down to your baby’s preferences. But, to help you narrow it down, we asked experts for the key things to pay attention to while on the hunt for a sleep sack. Here’s what they said:
We used the above expert guidance to narrow down a list of the best sleep sacks for babies and toddlers. We included swaddles and regular sleep sacks to meet most needs. The list below is made up of expert and NBC staff favorites, as well as highly rated options that meet the expert guidelines above.
Nesbitt recommends this sleep sack for infants who still need to be swaddled. It is made from 100% cotton and fits infants between seven and fourteen pounds and up to 21 inches long. The swaddle part has Velcro, which means you can adjust it to be as snug as needed for your baby. These swaddle sleep sacks come in a pack of three.
Another recommendation from Nesbitt, this swaddle is made from polyester and stretchy Spandex, allowing you to get a snug fit. According to the brand, the material is also moisture-wicking to reduce the risk of overheating. The top part can be velcroed together to create the swaddle, and the bottom ties together to close but can be untied so you don’t have to unswaddle your baby to do a diaper change. With your purchase, you also get a delicates laundry bag to wash your swaddle in.
This was my go-to swaddle when my daughter was a newborn. A pediatrician developed it. Inside the zip-up sack is a velcro band to secure your baby’s arms close to their body. There’s a two-way zipper, making it easy to change diapers without releasing your baby’s arms, and the swaddle is made of cotton and mesh panels for breathability. This sleep sack is available in three sizes — small (for babies between five and 12 pounds), medium (for babies between 12 and 18 pounds) and large (for babies between 18 and 26 pounds).
Like the SwaddleMe, this swaddle sleep sack comes in a pack of three, and has adjustable velcro to keep your baby’s arms close to their body and the bottom zippers open for easy diaper changes. This swaddle comes in two sizes — small/medium (for babies who are seven to 14 pounds) and large (for babies who are 14 to 18 pounds) — and a 1.0 or 1.5 tog. It has a 4.4-star average rating from over 5,575 reviews on Amazon.
Some babies don’t enjoy having their arms secured down at their sides or across their chest. This swaddle sleep sack, which has a 4.6-star average from over 23,290 reviews on Amazon, has a wing-like shape in the shoulder area that allows for a little more freedom while still providing enough support and security that they won’t wake themselves up if their Moro reflex is triggered. There is a two-way zipper to allow for diaper changes and the sleep sack is made from cotton and Elastane. The weight of the fabric is ideal for moderate room temperatures between 68 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the brand.
“I am a fan of the Halo sleep sacks. They are excellent quality, a great price point, and have a wide range of sizes and options available,” says Sarah Bossio, a certified pediatric sleep expert and founder of Your Zen Baby Sleep. “I personally was able to reuse all of the Halo swaddles and sleep sacks for both of my children and continue to recommend them to clients and friends alike.” This sleep sack is made from 100% cotton, has a two-way zipper and is available in different sizes (small, medium and large) and togs. This version is a .5 tog, appropriate for rooms between 72 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. It is also available in a 1.0 and 1.5 tog.
My daughter has been wearing sleep sacks from this brand since she was six months old — she is now three. The material, a combo of rayon made from bamboo and Spandex, is super soft and the bags are extra long, so your child has lots of room to move around in them. They also come in many fun colors, like emerald, raspberry and taro. They come in a .5, 1.0 and 2.5 tog and are available in sizes extra small through extra large. They’re one of the only sleep sack brands I have found that go up to that size, allowing kids up to 47 inches tall to wear them.
Nesbitt also recommends the sleep sacks from Burt’s Bees as an affordable option. They come in small, medium, large and extra large — covering your baby from newborn through 24 months — and are available in a .5 or 1.5 tog. The sleep sack is made from 100% organic cotton and available in 24 patterns, including honey bee cloud, midnight stripe, elephants and more. The zipper opens from the bottom to make diaper changes easier and there is a zipper guard to prevent it from rubbing against sensitive skin.
“My grandma saw this sleep sack on Shark Tank and ordered it for my son,” says NBC Select senior photo editor Rebecca Delman. “I love how it feels and I swear he sleeps better when he wears it to bed.” Unlike the others on this list, this sleep sack has leg holes, making it good for walking toddlers. It is a 1.0 tog and is available in sizes 12 months — 2T, 2T-3T, 3T-5T and 5T-7T. It also features a two-way zipper and pockets.
Made with a 100% merino wool lining and 100% organic cotton outer, this sleep sack has a 4.8-star average rating from over 2,980 reviews on Amazon. Wool is a naturally temperature-regulating material, so this sleep sack works in all seasons, according to the brand. It comes in one size, which will fit babies between two and 24 months. Rather than a zipper, this sleep sack fastens at the shoulders and it has seat belt holes, allowing your baby to wear it in a car or stroller.
Babies can start wearing sleep sacks from the time they are born. “ For infants, approximately between ages 0-12 weeks old, utilizing a tight-fitting swaddle can not only help a baby regulate their body temperature but also prevents the baby from startling themselves awake while they still have their Moro reflex,” says Bossio. After 12 weeks, infants can move to a regular sleep sack that allows them to move more freely. “Once a child is walking and over 12 months old, you may choose to use a sleep sack with holes at the feet so that they can safely roam their crib but still have warmth and comfort overnight,” adds Bossio.
“The AAP recommends that children sleep in a free and clear space and any blankets, pillows, bumpers, stuffed animals, etc.,” says Bossio. “I recommend babies and toddlers remain in their sleep sacks while they are still sleeping in their cribs. Once they transition to the big kid bed, this is a perfect time to allow them to sleep underneath a blanket without their sleep sack.”
To answer this question, you’ll want to consider the tog (thermal overall grade) of the sleep sack you're putting your child in and the temperature in their sleep room. If it is warmer, you may want to go more lightweight with their pajamas. If the sleep sack is on the lighter side or the room is cool, you may want to put them in warmer pajamas.
Though weighted sleep sacks are on the market, the experts we spoke with recommend staying away from them. “The AAP says nothing weighted should be on or near baby so make sure to avoid anything that is weighted,” says Dumaplin.
