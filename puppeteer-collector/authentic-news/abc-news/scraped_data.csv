Disability Access","The state government has implemented a ban on preferential bookings in a bid to ensure a fairer and more reliable access taxi system.
South Australian Transport Minister, Tom Koutsantonis said his department received multiple reports and complaints about drivers using coercion to ensure passengers called them directly for accessible trips.
The government also says more than 500 people a month with an access taxi booking are being forced to wait more than 30 minutes for an accessible vehicle, despite some operators claiming there is not sufficient work, or that there are too many access taxis operating.
On Monday, a mother and her son with a disability waited two hours for an access taxi before a Good Samaritan drove them to an Adelaide hospital in his truck.

Mr Koutsantonis says from May 19, passengers will no longer be able to request specific drivers during dedicated hours.
""I think it's fair to say that access cabs are broken,"" he said.
""Nearly 60 per cent of all work is being preferenced which is quite frankly open to corruption and fraud, so we are removing that so a larger pool of drivers is available.
""What we're doing is trying to remove the rorts and allow the system to dispatch the closest possible driver to make sure we can get a good outcome.""
The government says access cabs need to become more reliable. (ABC News: Michael Clements)
Currently, a $25 lifting fee is paid to drivers by the government — applied to trips where access taxi customers have used a wheelchair or ride-on mobility aide to get in and out of a taxi vehicle.
The fee is designed to replace waiting time fees, and support additional costs including fuel, and the purchase and replacement of accessible vehicles and equipment, without additional cost to the customer.
But the government said about 60 per cent of operators had allegedly ""attempted to falsely claim"" a lifting fee for ""jobs they did not complete"".
""There are some drivers that are collecting thousands if not over $100,000 a year in these lifting fees, and we are cracking down on this,"" Mr Koutsantonis said.
""If you want to get access to the booking fee, you take the driver you're given by the central booking agency which will give the job to the closest available driver which is the fairest system.""
He added there would be a level of discretion allowed for people living with disabilities which made it necessary to travel with a particular driver with ""a familiar face"" or ""someone they're comfortable with"".
He said that request would need to be made in writing to the department's access taxi transport team.
The latest changes come after the government announced sweeping reforms to the taxi and ridesharing sector last year. (ABC News: Alice Pavlovic)
Mr Koutasantonis added the changes would also prevent drivers from ""coercing"" customers.
""People complain to me about being coerced by drivers saying they'll have to wait for hours unless they preference certain, particular drivers to get a booking,"" he said.
""This is a way of removing those rorts to make sure when you call an access cab, you get one.
""I just can't allow this to continue, and I will not.""
The government says the latest change is on top of a broader reform package currently being implemented in the taxi, access cab, rideshare and chauffeur sector.
In a statement, a spokesperson for taxi operator 13cabs said it welcomed the government's decision to ban preferential bookings.
""We remain committed to working with the South Australian government as part of its plan to overhaul this sector,"" the statement read.
The spokesperson said they did not believe 13cabs would be impacted, and that it had not received any reports their drivers had used coercion.
President of the Taxi Council of SA, John Trainer said he understood that it was difficult to balance the number of accessible taxis available with the number of customers wanting to travel.
""The minister is clearly trying to reduce the number of access cabs that are committed to privately arranged 'preference' jobs during peak times to maximise the proportion of the access cabs in the fleet that are available in specified hours,"" he said.
""Fortunately, provision is still available for special cases where the disabled passenger needs a specific driver for specific conditions.""
But some drivers and customers have expressed concern over the changes.

Dudley Afford is legally blind and lives with spastic quadriplegia, a form of cerebral palsy which impacts movement in the arms and legs.
The 37-year-old Adelaide man relies on access taxis for transportation and said he is ‘angry and anxious’ about the change, which comes into effect next week.
“It so sudden without any planning for clients like me,” Mr Afford.
“I have already had to change my plans for tomorrow as this has got to me. What will I do next week?”
Mr Afford currently uses a regular driver and says he gets anxiety and panic attacks with unknown drivers.
“Some drivers go so fast around corners I get a sore back for days,” he said.
“The driver I book, understands me, drives absolutely well, has a clean taxi and helps me to get in and out of the taxi as well as makes me feel safe.”
“If I lose him I won't be able to use taxis, especially in the winter in the cold and wet.”
Access taxi operator Hugo Siu [left] says he is disappointed drivers and customers were not consulted by the government. (Supplied)
Access taxi operator Hugo Siu said the announcement was ""shocking"" and that he was also opposed to the changes.
He said there had been no consultation with drivers or customers, and ""one-way implementation from the minister"".
Mr Siu said many customers had ""good relationships"" with their drivers and were ""panicking"" about the upcoming changes.
""They are vulnerable … they need someone they can trust, someone reliable who can take them shopping, take them to medical appointments on time.""
He said the booking system was ""failing"" customers.
""It's penalising those drivers who have good relationships with the customer, that really look after the customer,"" he said.
""Why don't they talk to the drivers, why don't they talk to the customers before making any changes?""
He said there also needed to be extra incentives for drivers to work longer hours on weekends and public holidays.
""We believe if the minister listened to this, and implemented this, 90 to 95 per cent of the issue would be solved, and I can guarantee Jodie (Oliver's mother), the interstate traveller, won't be left behind.""","OBy Olivia Mason, Rachael Merritt",4h ago
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-16/nsw-pfas-chemicals-blue-mountains-water-report/105300768,Likely sources of PFAS chemicals in Blue Mountains water catchment revealed,"Topic:
Water","Two historic petrol tanker fires and a Rural Fire Brigade station have been identified as the most likely sources of so-called ""forever chemicals"" in the drinking water catchment in the NSW Blue Mountains.
WaterNSW on Friday handed down the findings of its seven-month initial investigation into the source of PFAS chemicals in the Adams Creek and Medlow catchments, which include Medlow Dam and Greaves Creek Dam.
The dams were disconnected from the drinking water supply in August 2024 after testing found they contained concentrations of PFAS chemicals.
The WaterNSW report found a 1992 petrol tanker crash and subsequent explosion on the Great Western Highway at Medlow Bath is one of three likely sources of PFAS contamination in the adjacent water catchments.
Historic footage of the crash shows firefighting foam spilling down an embankment that leads to Adams Creek, which subsequently feeds into Medlow Dam.

The WaterNSW report also found a second crash in 2002 involving a taxi and a petrol tanker carrying more than 36,000 litres of unleaded and diesel fuel on the Great Western Highway at Medlow Bath was another likely source of contamination.
The report noted that firefighting foam was used in the emergency response at both crashes and that the chemical ""signature"" identified in sampling was ""consistent with the historical use of Aqueous Fire Fighting Foam (AFF)"".
The Medlow Bath Rural Fire Brigade Station, located on the Great Western Highway, was found to be another potential source of PFAS contamination due to the storage and use of firefighting foams, testing of fire systems and uncontrolled releases into the environment.
The WaterNSW report confirmed claims made by the local Stop PFAS action group, which conducted its own investigation into the source of contamination — coming to the same conclusion last October.
The findings also back up claims that PFAS chemicals persist in the environment, in this case 32 years after the original contamination event.

In a statement, WaterNSW said Medlow Dam and Greaves Creek Dam, of which Adams Creek is a tributary, would remain disconnected from the Blue Mountains water supply system.
""The dams will only be returned to the raw water supply network once WaterNSW is confident appropriate permanent mitigation measures are in place,"" the statement said.
""With these disconnections in place and according to the most recent monitoring results, NSW Health and Sydney Water have advised drinking water in the Blue Mountains meets the existing Australian Drinking Water Guidelines and is safe to drink.""
WaterNSW collected more than 250 water and sediment samples from 37 locations throughout the Adams Creek and Medlow catchments as part of its investigation.
The report found concentrations of PFAS were higher in the upper Adams Creek catchment than further downstream in the Medlow Greaves catchment, suggesting ""any contamination may be moving downstream … via rainfall and surface water runoff"".
WaterNSW said its findings had been reviewed by the NSW PFAS Technical Advisory Group and the Environment Protection Authority (EPA).
""The EPA has recommended that a detailed site investigation should now be undertaken consistent with the National Environment Protection Measure 1999,"" it stated.
""The detailed investigation undertaken by WaterNSW and supported by the EPA will help inform potential remediation options.""
WaterNSW manages the state's storage dams and supplies untreated or ""raw water"" to Sydney Water for treatment and supply to taps.
The NSW Rural Fire Service and Fire & Rescue NSW began phasing out the use of PFAS in 2000 and fully discontinued its use by 2007.","JBy Jessica Kidd, XBy Xanthe Gregory",8h ago
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-16/doctors-say-genital-herpes-underreported-due-to-shame-and-stigma/105289814,Woman diagnosed with genital herpes as teen says shame was crippling,"Topic:
Sexual Health","Growing up in regional Queensland, Jasmyn Gaggiano was relatively naive when it came to sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
It was not something she was taught about at school, or by her parents.
So it came as a shock for Ms Gaggiano, now 23, when she was diagnosed with genital herpes in the months after becoming sexually active as a teenager.
Ms Gaggiano wants to encourage others to speak out to break down stigma. (Supplied: Jasmyn Gaggiano)
A nurse was the first to tell her it could be herpes after her symptoms left her unable to get out of bed.
""I couldn't go to the toilet, I struggled to move — it was horrible,"" she said.
It was her nonna, who she was staying with at the time, who decided she needed to go to hospital.
""[The nurse] looked at it and she said, 'Look, I'm going to be honest with you … I think this is genital herpes,'"" Ms Gaggiano said.
""And I said, 'What's herpes?'""
Sexual transmitted infections have continued to grow across Australia over the last three decades, with chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis spiking in New South Wales alone. The reasons why are complex, experts say.
When tests confirmed genital herpes, otherwise known as HSV-2, Ms Gaggiano said she was initially not bothered.
""I was like, 'Well, I don't need to tell anyone. I've got a boyfriend,'"" she said.
""And then we broke up and it sort of just hit me like a truck ... I was like, 'I'm going to have to tell people now.'""
Ms Gaggiano said feelings of shame and isolation quickly set in.
""I thought, 'Everyone's going to find out. No one's going to want to be friends with me. No one's going to ever want to love me,'"" she said.
It took Ms Gaggiano two years to feel confident enough to talk to someone other than her mum and nonna about her diagnosis.
During that time, she even moved to a school in a different town.
""I lived with that secret for a few years until I turned 17 or 18 and I had a chat with my friend [who] confided in me that she had it too,"" she said.

After speaking out, Ms Gaggiano felt empowered to start posting about her experience online at the age of 18.
""I really wanted to put a post out there and just tell everyone,"" she said.
""I felt like I had my control ripped away from me … like I didn't choose to get it.""
Since sharing her story, more than 200 people have contacted her to share their own experiences.
Queensland Health Department data suggests about one in eight sexually active Australians have genital herpes.
Gino Pecoraro says genital herpes is potentially more common than thought. (AAP: Russell Freeman)
But according to National Association of Specialist Obstetricians and Gynaecologists president Gino Pecoraro, it could be more common.
""It's hard to get an accurate incidence rate because a lot of people just suffer in silence and don't necessarily go and get it diagnosed or let people know that they've got it because of a stigma associated with it,"" Dr Pecoraro said.
Common symptoms include:
Genital herpes is described as one of the most common STIs and can be caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or 2.
The more common HSV-1, or cold sores, can lead to genital herpes through oral sex.
Dr Pecoraro said transmission could occur in several other ways, including from asymptomatic people or it could be passed on to a baby during pregnancy.
At first, Ms Gaggiano said it was ""daunting"" to inform potential partners about her genital herpes diagnosis.
But that changed when she realised ""everybody deserves a choice"".
Ms Gaggiano said she managed her symptoms by visiting her GP for medication if an outbreak occurred, which she said was thankfully rare.
She said she hoped the more she and others talked about genital herpes, the more normalised it would become.
""It's just a massive cycle and it won't stop until we talk about it and educate ourselves,"" Ms Gaggiano said.

Sustainable Living","Easily dismissed as a ""hard sell"" to squeamish consumers, Australia's insect industry wants to be the nation's next agricultural powerhouse.
As it explores the use of insects in everything from human consumption to pet food and waste recycling, the industry admits there are some critical barriers still to overcome.
It hopes to address those with a $2 million research program led by the University of Adelaide that will help develop food standards, market opportunities and public education.
Professor Kerry Wilkinson from the university's School of Agriculture, Food and Wine said public perception and a lack of standards and regulation were some of the critical hurdles to the sector's growth within Australia.
""It's an emerging industry … still relatively young but absolutely growing and increasing its footprint, and that's really being underpinned by the amazing potential for what insects can do,"" Professor Wilkinson said.
""We can use them to manage food waste problems, but the insects themselves also represent a really high-value and nutritious protein source.
The global insect industry is forecast to be worth billions of dollars in the coming years. (Landline: Glyn Jones)
Professor Wilkinson's research began more than a decade ago, focusing on mealworms and crickets as food, but has expanded to a multitude of potential uses.
""There's a whole range of applications and for me as a researcher it's really exciting to see the other things that insects can be used for — things like biofuels and pharmaceuticals,"" she said.
""There's potential to use them in pet food, and we've found that most pet owners are actually more comfortable with the idea of feeding their dogs with insect-based pet food than plant-based pet food.""
Supported by AgriFutures Australia, Professor Wilkinson has assembled a research team across the nation to tackle the challenge of ""social licence"", but also barriers like biosecurity and food safety.

In South Australia's Coonawarra, winery owner Luke Tocaciu has been offering a ""Crickets and Cabernet"" edible insect and wine tasting for the past year.
He said many visitors to the cellar door had been open to trying edible insects for the first time.
""We've had lots of different reactions. People are surprised they taste good,"" Mr Tocaciu said.
The business was inspired to offer tastings due to edible insects' sustainability.
""It doesn't take a lot of energy to produce these insects and they are quite high in protein,"" he said.
""It's a really innovative space [and] I think it will be a growing industry in Australia.""

She said insects were one of the most exciting opportunities in Australian agriculture today.
""So any way we can produce feed ingredients in Australia without taxing our existing supply chain is an absolute win.
""We need to put more time and energy into these sorts of inputs because any way we can do that means we can reduce costs for farmers.
""We can also create a much more stable feed security plan for Australia moving forward.""

""No effects from the treatment, the surgeries or anything that we'd been through.""
Kate, now 40, was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017 after she discovered abnormalities while breastfeeding her first baby, a son who is now eight.

She had a mastectomy on her left breast and was given ongoing medication, which she came off in 2021 so she and her husband Kriss Hardman could expand their family.
In 2023, when she was pregnant with her third child, the cancer returned in her right breast.
""I was 23 weeks pregnant when I was diagnosed for the second time with breast cancer, but it was bilateral … so I had a mastectomy on the right [breast],"" Kate said.
At 28 weeks, she began chemotherapy.
""I started my chemotherapy and then I started to get a sore neck … it got increasingly worse … I was having spasms in it.""

Her husband described the prognosis as overwhelming.
""Everything is on your brain, a million miles an hour,"" he said.
But after the initial shock, the couple decided it was time to shift their perspective and make the most of their time together.

""Don't wait to live your life,"" Ms Hardman said.
Along with their kids — their son, and their daughters, aged three and one — they packed their lives into a caravan almost two months ago and hit the road.
The family plans to travel around Australia for 18 months, to create memories and to raise awareness about breast and testicular cancer, which Kriss has been successfully treated for.

""My oncologist gave me a three-month supply of chemotherapy tablets,"" Kate said.
""How it works is every three months, I have to give them notes of where I'm going, and I get my referral sent to that hospital.
""I also have to do monthly blood tests, which get sent back to my oncologist in Darwin.""
Every four weeks, Kriss Hardman gives his wife her hormone suppressant injection. (Supplied: Kate Hardman)
Kate says that while she does suffer some side effects from the medication, they are manageable and don't limit her daily life.
Raising awareness is also a personal mission for Kriss, 36, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2020.
""I was lucky, I had some surgery and caught it early,"" he said.
""I don't think I would have caught it as early had I not had a wife who had breast cancer.
""I would have put it off. I would have been one of those blokes that said, 'I'll go next week, next month', and then by the time you put it off and don't go, maybe it's too late.""
The Hardmans are urging people to have regular check-ups with their GPs.
""It can save your life. It saved mine. If I had left it, I might not be here,"" Kriss said.

Kate said cancer could impact anyone.
And they still have plenty of goals to tick off.
""We've still got countries and places written down in her little book somewhere that says I want to go and see this, do this, I want to experience this,"" Kriss said.
""That's what I want to achieve while she is here … I want to tick off as many of these places as we can.""

Babies","Warning: This story contains information and images relating to stillbirth.
For Ellen Pinkstone, the loss of her stillborn baby was a heartbreaking moment.
But what happened next only made matters worse.
Ms Pinkstone, 23, gave birth to her son, Sage, in September 2023 at Port Macquarie Base Hospital on the New South Wales Mid North Coast.
Ms Pinkstone and her partner, Aiden Dempsey, spent three days recovering in hospital after the birth and spending time with their stillborn son.
She said her nightmare experience was made even worse by the ""traumatising and distressing"" treatment of hospital staff.

The words of one staff member cut her deepest at a time when she just wanted to see her son.
""She said she would go get 'it' from the morgue,"" Ms Pinkstone said.
Ms Pinkstone said Sage was taken to and from her care in a bag with handles.
""The black bag, tightly wrapped around his fragile form and carried away, swinging back and forth,"" she said.
""It was undignified.
Ms Pinkstone is now calling for better bereavement support and staff training.
In Australia, six babies are stillborn each day, affecting more than 2,000 Australian women and families each year.

Blair Whitechurch never imagined her first delivery as a student midwife would be the most traumatic experience of her life.
The 43-year-old mother of two is no stranger to childbirth.
But the first baby she helped deliver as a student midwife — a girl named Rose — was stillborn at 39 weeks.
Ms Whitechurch said she had felt completely unprepared.
""I did all the wrong things. I vomited and fainted,"" she said.
Ms Whitechurch says she has loved studying to become a midwife. (Supplied: Blair Whitechurch)
Rose's birth in March 2022 was the first of about 30 deliveries Ms Whitechurch would need to attend as part of her training.
She said her study to that point had failed to prepare her for the reality of a stillbirth.
""I felt emotionally terrorised for her [the mother]. I felt so ill-equipped to support her and I felt emotionally unprepared for me to see what I saw,"" she said.
""I was completely out of my depth.""
Australian Nursing and Midwifery Union strategic lead for midwifery, Jasmine Kirk, has backed Ms Whitechurch's claims that students do not receive enough bereavement training.
""Ideally, it would be covered multiple times to different levels of complexity,"" Ms Kirk said.
She said training during midwifery degrees could be minimal.
""That can be as minimal as a single slide in a single lecture or a sentence in an online course,"" she said.
Eliza Strauss, a midwife of 20 years, runs independent bereavement training sessions nationally.
She said many health professionals told her they did not know how to help during a stillbirth.
""They often mention maybe it was an hour's lecture, or they watched a video on stillbirth … things haven't really changed,"" Ms Strauss said.
""It really needs to go to state and federal levels to get government involved to include bereavement training in workplaces and universities.""
The federal government released a National Stillbirth Action Plan in 2020 that included a push for national guidelines on bereavement care following stillbirth, as well as a national evidence-based, culturally safe stillbirth education program for health professionals.
It identified a need for consistent education and training reflecting best practice in stillbirth prevention and care.
A spokesperson for the federal Department of Health said the government had invested $23.2 million over four years to support families who experienced stillbirth or miscarriage.
The spokesperson said mandating bereavement training would be a decision for state and territory governments and individual training universities or medical colleges.
The government also was developing new Australian postnatal care guidelines that would provide health professionals with evidence-based, best practice guidelines on providing optimal care to women during the postnatal period.
This included bereavement care after pregnancy loss, stillbirth or neonatal death.
Sage was born on the September 1, 2023. (Supplied: Ellen Pinkstone)
After her experience, Ms Pinkstone contacted to the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission, which gave the hospital ""clear expectations"" to improve its practices to ensure an emotionally safe environment for patients and staff.
The commission found the hospital's use of a portable carrier was not best practice.
It concluded that the hospital had implemented changes ""to promote enhanced engagement and inclusion during this delicate time"".
A Mid North Coast Local Health District spokesperson said the health service recognised there had been shortcomings in the care.
The health service has apologised to Ms Pinkstone and ""thoroughly reviewed"" her concerns and implemented changes.
This includes the use of a cot on wheels instead of a portable carrier, and improving bereavement care for families experiencing loss.
""Mid North Coast Local Health District will continue to improve our individualised bereavement care to women and families,"" a spokesperson said.
""[The district] is guided by NSW Health policies and procedures on stillbirth. A district-led guideline is being developed.""
Ms Pinkstone welcomed the hospital's changes but said the experience still haunted her.
""The hardest part of our son being stillborn wasn't that he was stillborn, it was that we were treated so poorly,"" she said.
""The bereavement care wasn't there.""
The first comprehensive national guidelines for the treatment of early pregnancy loss have just been released, aiming to improve data collection and medical research.
According to the Stillbirth Centre of Research Excellence, the needs of parents who have stillborn children are frequently not met, and there is little guidance for clinicians on how to provide optimal care for these families.
Some hospitals, such as Melbourne's Royal Women's Hospital, have dedicated rooms and bereavement experts, but some say more work needs to be done.

Crime","The Bondi Junction stabbing inquest has revealed numerous ""concerning"" red flags in Joel Cauchi's behaviour in the lead-up to the attack, including his ""obsession"" with observing schoolgirls' sport.
The five-week inquest has heard from a number of key witnesses about Cauchi's stabbing rampage at the Westfield Bondi Junction on April 13 last year that killed six people and injured 10.
WARNING: This story contains content that readers may find distressing.
On Thursday, the inquiry heard that police in July 2022 received information from a staff member at an all girls' boarding school in Queensland with concerns that a man had been contacting the school and the local netball association via Facebook, telephone and in person.
The man was Joel Cauchi.
""Joel had been… requesting permission to attend sporting events held at the school. The sporting events included a swimming carnival, netball and gymnastics,"" Counsel Assisting the Coroner, Peggy Dwyer SC, recounted to the court.
""The staff member had become concerned due to the persistent behaviour of Joel.""
Cauchi was originally from Queensland and lived in the state before relocating to New South Wales in the final years of his life.
On July 27, 2022, an intelligence report was generated on the incident.
The report was then evaluated on December 28, 2022, where it said: ""Nil offences committed as part of this report. Concerning behaviour only. Mr Cauchi does not appear to have been subject to any similar behaviour since.""
The report acknowledged that Cauchi had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and that there had been ""35 attempts to speak with Cauchi on his listed number without success"".
Sergeant Tracy Morris, a mental health intervention coordinator with Queensland Police, was asked if the school's staff member was right to be concerned with the ""obsessed behaviour"" exhibited by Cauchi considering he ""did not have a child at that school"".
She was also asked by Dr Dwyer if it was concerning for Cauchi to be exhibiting ""some level of obsession with seeing the girls"".
Sergeant Morris agreed on both occasions to the questions.
A Queensland Police constable — who was called to Cauchi's family home in 2023 over a knife collection dispute — was asked if Cauchi' s 2022 communications with the boarding school ever came to her attention.
""No,"" she said.

Earlier in the inquest, Dr Dwyer said the browsing history on Cauchi's devices in the years leading up to the Bondi stabbing ""suggested a preoccupation with death and murder"".
There were bookmark pages that included ""12 common traits of serial killers"" and ""21 famous serial killers and their creepy backstories"".
There were also searches including ""what women look for in men"", ""dating advice"" and ""how to find a woman"".
The topics searched by Cauchi gave ""an indication of his mindset"" leading up to the 2024 attack, Andrew Paul Marks said in his statement as the detective chief inspector of the NSW Police homicide squad.

John Pietsch, a GP from Toowoomba, had a consultation with Cauchi on November 23, 2023, in which he noticed some ""red flags"".
Cauchi had requested a medical certificate from the GP to renew his driver's licence, which had to be done annually due to his medical condition of schizophrenia.
Joel Cauchi had an ""obsession"" to observe schoolgirls' sports during a period in 2022, the inquest heard. (Supplied)
It was Cauchi's first time visiting Dr Pietsch, who acknowledged that guidelines warned health professionals to be wary of ""drivers who are not regular patients"" requesting a medical certificate for their licence.
As per notes of the consultation, Dr Pietsch said Cauchi had ""poor eye contact"" and an ""unusual affect"" but he was ""well kept"" and exhibited ""no overt bizarre behaviours"".
""He wasn't forthcoming… he was socially awkward and difficult to converse with,"" Dr Pietsch told the court.
Upon contacting Cauchi's mother and gathering further medical information, the GP found Cauchi's ""significant mental health history"".
Dr Pietsch said he felt ""assured"" by Cauchi's mother, as she hadn't raised any concerns about her son's current mental state, and she had allegedly suggested the conditional licence was due to the drowsy side effects of her son's former medication that he was no longer on in 2023.
Dr Pietsch provided a certificate for Cauchi to renew his licence.
Reflecting on the interaction, the GP said that given Cauchi ""wasn't psychotic at the time"" and had plans to return to NSW the next day, there was little he could do to plug him back into the mental health system.

Vaccines and Immunity","Vaccination rates among children and teens have reached ""critical"" levels, according to experts, who are warning deaths are inevitable if Australia does not do more to turn around a steady decline in immunisation rates.
Figures from the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS), released on Thursday, show a widespread decline in immunisations for a range of illnesses over the past five years.
In some cases, rates are now below the threshold required to ensure herd immunity.
The data includes vaccines for a wide range of diseases, including whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus, rotavirus, pneumococcal, polio, hepatitis B, four types of meningococcal, measles, mumps and rubella, as well as the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for teens.
Gary Grohmann, director of the Immunisation Coalition and former consultant to the World Health Organization, described the figures as ""absolutely alarming"".
The figures show the proportion of children up-to-date with their immunisations by the age of 12 months had fallen from 94.8 per cent to 91.6 per cent since 2020.
The percentage of those fully vaccinated by age two was down from 92.1 per cent to 89.4 per cent in the same time frame, and those who had received all required immunisations for age five fell from 94.8 per cent to 92.7 per cent.
The most concerning falls were among teens where uptake of the HPV vaccine — which helps protect against cervical cancer in girls and other genital cancers in boys — has dropped from 84.9 per cent to 77.9 per cent among boys and from 86.6 per cent to 81.1 per cent among girls in five years.
""When you look at the adolescent data where it's dropping well below 80 per cent that is really concerning,"" Dr Grohmann said.
""If you're starting to get into the 80 per cent [range], then it really is getting critical. We know as virologists, microbiologists, that we do need about 95 per cent of the whole population vaccinated.""
Dr Grohmann was most concerned about parts of Australia where recent data revealed as few as 75 per cent of two-year-olds have had their required vaccinations.
""It is a numbers game. There will be more hospitalisations. And although we have really good medical care in Australia, it could be that children will die of measles or get serious disease.
""It means basically that disease spread will increase and unfortunately hospitalisations and possibly deaths to viruses like measles might also occur.""
Australians have been warned to watch out for symptoms of measles after a spike in cases.
The numbers have put Australia's vaccination program back to levels not seen since 2014, said Frank Beard, an associate director at the NCIRS which collated the figures.
He told the ABC the drop in vaccinations undid work to boost rates that saw measles almost eliminated nationally prior to the pandemic.
""It is definitely a concern that there's a decreasing trend since the pandemic,"" Dr Beard said.
""Herd protection is always a concern, and particularly for diseases like measles.""
Bruce and Ashleigh Langoulant have firsthand experience of the impacts of a vaccine-preventable disease.
Ashleigh, now 35, was just six months old when she came down with meningitis brought on by pneumococcal infection.
Mr Langoulant said even though it happened in 1989, he still vividly remembers rushing his baby daughter to the emergency room with seizures, a fever and a raised fontanelle.
""She was almost lifeless,"" he said.

His little girl rapidly declined over the next 24 hours.
She survived but with profound intellectual and physical disability.
She has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and she is deaf, non-verbal and uses a wheelchair.
""I don't even know if she knows we're her parents,"" Mr Langoulant said.
When Ashleigh was born, there was no vaccine yet for pneumococcal.
In the early 2000s when one was developed, Mr Langoulant, as chair of the Meningitis Centre Australia, was crucial to getting it listed on the National Immunisation Program.
He's at a loss as to why parents would not take up a free vaccine.
""Ash was the unvaccinated child. We didn't have a choice and we're still living it 35 years later,"" he said.
""Ash is in a wheelchair because she got a bacterial infection which is vaccine-preventable.
""This is what happens if you don't vaccinate.""
For the Langoulant family, Ash's experience is her legacy to the world.
""She has this natural presence which is a gift,"" Mr Langoulant said.
Dr Grohmann and Dr Beard both said more widespread public health measures seen during the pandemic, such as vaccine clinics, mobile and pop-up clinics and after-hours clinics, were needed to help increase vaccine uptake.
The National Vaccination Insights project run in collaboration with NCIRS found that for about one in 10 patients, the cost of medical appointments was a barrier to getting vaccines, and just getting an appointment on time was a barrier for a similar number.
A survey of 2,000 people found about six in 10 people said a hurdle for them was ""feeling distressed"" when thinking about vaccinating their child.
Australia's childhood vaccination rates declining
General distrust of vaccines and health information continued to be barriers, as well.
Of those parents with unvaccinated children, 46.7 per cent would ""not feel guilty"" if their child got sick with a vaccine-preventable disease and 47.9 per cent do not believe vaccines are safe for a child.
""Vaccination coverage is heading in the wrong direction, and so to turn it around, we need to have a range of strategies to improve it,"" Dr Beard said.
Dr Grohmann said medical professionals had a key role to play in educating patients, particularly as more people got more medical information online and the misinformation became widespread.
""It's really important that they get the message that vaccination is really important and protects the whole community. And most importantly, they're effective and safe,"" he said.
Dr Beard said the decrease in teens getting vaccinated for HPV was also driven by a rise in school avoidance after the pandemic.
""Adolescent vaccination is predominantly conducted in school settings and we know that school attendance has still been lower than it was before the pandemic,"" he said.",Unknown,16h ago

Polio","Two cases of poliovirus type 2 have been detected in children who live just over 500 kilometres north-east of Queensland's Cape York, and a ""national emergency response"" has been triggered by Australia's closest international neighbour.
The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed on Thursday that polio was detected in Papua New Guinea (PNG) from a wastewater sample in the city of Lae and an environmental sample in the nation's capital, Port Moresby.
The World Health Organization says the PNG outbreak is linked to strains circulating in Indonesia, posing a serious risk to other countries in the region.
Further testing by the WHO, PNG Department of Health, UNICEF and local provincial health authorities then confirmed the virus in the two healthy children in Lae, and genetic sequencing showed the strain was linked to polio circulating in Indonesia.
The WHO says wild poliovirus type 2 was eradicated in 1999 and type 3 was wiped out in 2020. As of 2022, there were just two countries still impacted by wild poliovirus type 1 — Pakistan and Afghanistan.
So, how in 2025 is the virus still being detected in some of Australia's closest neighbouring nations and what is the risk of it spreading here?
The WHO describes polio, also known as poliomyelitis, as ""a highly infectious viral disease that largely affects children under 5 years of age"". There is no cure and can only be prevented through vaccines.
The organisation says it can be spread person-to-person, mostly through inadvertent consumption of infected faecal matter, but it can also be transmitted through contaminated water or food.

The Australian Department of Health says polio is ""a serious disease that can lead to long-term disability, paralysis and death"".
The federal department also says most people who are infected by polio recover completely, ""but a small number experience muscle and nerve damage that result in lifelong disability.""
Australia's virtual public health information service, Healthdirect, says that 95 per cent of people who are infected by poliovirus experience no symptoms, despite the virus being able to incubate for up to 35 days.
How did a disease that had not been seen in the Asia-Pacific region for almost two decades suddenly reappear?
Other patients develop flu-like symptoms, like a fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, a sore throat, weak muscles and a headache for as long as 10 days from the point of infection, according to Healthdirect.
For less than one in every 100 infected people, symptoms can also include severe muscle weakness known as acute flaccid paralysis that typically impacts a person's limbs. The virus can be fatal if it impacts the diaphragm and a person's breathing.
For almost 40 years, the world has been fighting to keep levels of polio as close to zero as possible.
In 1988, the WHO assembly resolved to eradicate the virus internationally with a ""Global Polio Eradication Initiative"", supported by national governments and global disease prevention groups.
Since then, the organisation says that cases worldwide have dropped by 99 per cent and across the three strains of the virus, type 2 has been officially eradicated for 26 years and type 3 for five years.
The Australian government says the country has been polio-free since 2000, and in 2022 the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS) said that 93.9 per cent of children aged one were considered immunised after receiving three doses of the polio vaccine.
The government's current data shows that while that figure has reduced slightly for one--year-old babies, more than 95 per cent of two-year-old children and almost 94 per cent of three-year-old children are immunised.
Australia also has its own polio surveillance program, which the government says is publicly-funded ""to prevent, prepare for, monitor and respond to the threat"" both domestically and abroad.
That program works to detect cases of polio that may have been imported into Australia from other countries, and to mitigate local transmission while also engaging with the WHO.
In PNG, the WHO says that polio was wiped out in 2000 but the country has been susceptible to cases due to low immunisation rates and ""suboptimal"" surveillance.
The country experienced a small polio outbreak in 2018 but it was brought under control the same year and there have been no detected cases until now.
Further abroad, there are just two countries that the WHO says continue to be impacted by endemic polio — Afghanistan and Pakistan. A nation is considered endemic when there is transmission of wild strains of the virus.
Another 20 countries are considered to be polio-free, however, the WHO had not certified that data by 2023, and there are 173 nations confirmed to have eradicated the virus.
Notes distributed by the WHO's representative in PNG, Dr Sevil Huseynova, on Thursday suggested that the latest polio outbreak in the country can be attributed low vaccine rates and the virus's transmissibility.
""As these challenges significantly increase, the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks and hinder our ability to detect and respond to cases promptly.
""Polio is a highly infectious disease, and in communities with low polio immunisation rates, the virus quickly spreads from one person to another.""
The WHO and UNICEF have also quickly mobilised to respond to the outbreak with widespread surveillance of any cases of acute flaccid paralysis, a three-stage immunisation program aimed at protecting children and boosting the nation's vaccine rates to prevent further spread.
Linda Selvey, an honorary associate professor at the University of Queensland's School of Public Health, told ABC radio's PM program on Thursday that the risk of polio spreading to Australia ""would be fairly low"".
Australia has not had a major outbreak of polio since 1961, and Australian children are now vaccinated against the virus as part of their routine immunisation as infants.
Dr Selvey has worked on polio eradication programs in the past in India and Nepal and said that for PNG, the impact of the virus's spread could be dire.
PNG polio outbreak confirmed by WHO
""I'm concerned about the outbreak from the perspective of the people in Papua New Guinea in particular because they generally have very low immunisation coverage,"" she said.
""While they haven't actually had a clinical case of polio, it would be quite possible.
""The other thing is because health services are not great in many parts of PNG, a child might get polio without it being detected, so then that means there's a chance of surface spread.""
Despite that risk and the WHO saying on Thursday that ""polio anywhere is a threat everywhere"", Dr Selvey says Australia's immunisation rates provide the country with a high level of protection.

""We're only at risk if we have a population who's not immune. Generally, I think our immunisation coverage in Australia is still pretty good, even though it has fallen in the last few years,"" she said.
""We also have very good sanitation and so-on, we don't generally live in particularly crowded areas. I would think that the risk would be fairly low.
""The greatest risk would be in the parts of Queensland, in particular in the Torres Strait, where there's closer movement of people between Papua New Guinea and Australia and also where the housing and so on is less optimal.""
In interim 2024 youth vaccination figures released by the NCIRS on Thursday, childhood immunisation rates were shown to have continued declining since the COVID-19 pandemic.
The data showed that last year 91.6 per cent of one-year-old babies were considered fully vaccinated, down from 94.8 per cent in 2020.
For children aged two, the rate was 89.4 per cent in 2024, down from 92 per cent four years prior, and it had dropped from 94.8 per cent in 2020 to 92.7 per cent last year for five-year-old children.
Complete childhood vaccination includes immunisations for diseases like Hepatitis B, Diptheria, Rotavirus, Meningococcal B, Influenza and polio by the age of five, according to the National Immunisation Program Schedule.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said in a statement on Thursday that Australia is working to support the immediate immunisation response in PNG.
""Australia is working closely with Papua New Guinea, the World Health Organization and UNICEF to help respond to the detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus,"" a DFAT spokesperson said.

It comes after Darwin Private Hospital operator Healthscope announced it would be closing the facility's birthing ward from June 6, a move that will leave expectant parents with no other option but to give birth at the public Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH).
The NT government previously flagged plans to offer two new options for private postnatal care for affected families — a ""luxury retreat"" at a ""boutique"" Darwin hotel and an at-home service.
With more details now released, here's what we know about the new care options.
Privately-insured families will be able to stay at the Mercure Resort near the Darwin Airport to receive postnatal care. (ABC News: Tiffany Parker)
Private maternity patients will first give birth at RDH before receiving postnatal care at a hotel or in their own home.
Women across the Northern Territory are heading interstate to give birth or delaying a pregnancy altogether, as the only private maternity ward closes.
The Mercure Darwin Airport Resort has been announced as the Darwin hotel that will provide expectant parents with a private postnatal stay option from June 1.
NT Health Minister Steve Edgington says private maternity patients will be reserved a ""deluxe king suite"" room, where they will be able to stay for up to four nights post-birth and receive postnatal care by visiting RDH midwives.
The midwives will be available 24/7 on-call to assist patients with wounds, postnatal assessments, feeding, baby weighing and general newborn care.

Mr Edgington says NT Health eventually hopes to secure a private midwifery provider to take over this service from RDH midwives.
The government says the hotel rooms will be fitted with a cot, nursing chair, baby bath and change table, with room service also included.
NT Health general manager of corporate strategy and performance, Alison Jeanne, says there will be a ""ring-fence"" around rooms reserved for postnatal care to ensure they remain available for eligible patients.
Private patients who face complications during or after birth will need to remain at RDH until it's safe for them to be discharged.

The ""return home sooner"" package is the alternative postnatal care option available to private maternity patients as of June 1.
The government says this service will allow parents and their newborn to receive support in their own home, after being discharged from hospital.
Maternity services at Healthscope private hospitals in Hobart and Darwin will be closed, restricting access to private birthing services.
Support provided for families will include meal preparation and cleaning, and the same midwifery support offered to those who choose the hotel option.
The government has not specified how many days after birth this service will be provided for.
The NT government says patients with Medibank, Bupa and the Australian Health Service Alliance, with cover for pregnancy and birth hospital care, will have access to the private postnatal packages.
These three major insurers cover ""around 93 per cent of the women affected"", the government says.
""I have been advised by NT Health that all insurers have agreed to support care options for women and families post-birth,"" Mr Edgington said on Thursday.

Patients with a different health insurer are encouraged to contact the government.
""NT Health will contact their fund to determine if the fund will cover them for the announced packages,"" a government spokesperson said.
The government says the costs of the services will be covered by private health insurers.
NT Health-led information sessions will be held next week at the Mercure Darwin Airport Resort, for expectant families to view the accommodation and discuss their care with RDH specialist staff.
NT Health says small group and one-on-one sessions will be made available to families the week starting May 26, so they can discuss with staff ""the services, models of care and discharge support, as well as what to expect during birth, staying in the hospital and postnatal care"".
Steve Edgington has asked the federal government for $35 million to upgrade RDH's maternity ward. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Edgington said he had written to the federal Health Minister, Mark Butler, requesting $35 million to help the NT government make ""some modifications"" to RDH's maternity ward.
The Tasmanian government in February successfully secured $6 million from the Commonwealth to expand maternity services in Hobart hospitals, after Healthscope also announced the closure of its birthing ward there.
Mr Edgington flip-flopped on whether RDH could manage the extra patients from the private system long-term, saying at first the government had requested the $35 million because it was looking at how to ""cope with the additional 250 births per year"".
He later said: ""We've made it very clear that 250 additional births can be consumed within the current arrangements at the Royal Darwin Hospital"".",Grace Atta,Thu 15 May

Polio","The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed deep concern and says neighbouring countries are at risk as it declares an outbreak of polio virus in Papua New Guinea.
Community transmission of the virus was confirmed in the city of Lae, after a screening program detected the fast-spreading virus in stool samples from two healthy children.
Poliovirus Type 2 has also been found in environmental samples in the capital Port Moresby.
WHO representative in PNG, Dr Sevil Huseynova, said the outbreak posed a serious risk to young children in PNG, where less than 50 per cent of the population immunised against the disease.
""In communities with low polio immunisation rates, the virus quickly spreads from one person to another,"" she said.
Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that mainly affects children under the age of five.
The virus is transmitted through the faeces and saliva of an infected person — often passed on via contaminated hands, food, or water — before it makes its way into somebody's gut.
Most people infected with polio show no symptoms; the ones that do generally get a flu-like illness.
But in rare cases, the virus invades the nervous system, leaving one in 200 people with irreversible paralysis.
PNG experienced a small polio outbreak in 2018 but it was brought under control the same year and there have been no detected cases until now.
The WHO said the recently detected virus was genetically linked to strains circulating in Indonesia, which shares a land border with PNG.
Dr Huseynova said because the virus spreads rapidly, it also posed a risk to other nations.

""Polio anywhere is a threat everywhere, especially to our children. Polio in Papua New Guinea can spread to neighbouring countries and anywhere in the world,"" Dr Huseynova said.
The PNG Department of Health has launched a rapid response program with assistance from the WHO, UNICEF and the Australian government.
It will focus on vaccinating people, especially children under five years of age, in target areas, along with monitoring and surveillance.
How did a disease that had not been seen in the Asia-Pacific region for almost two decades suddenly reappear?
PNG Health Minister Elias Kapavore said the outbreak was likely due to low immunisation rates.
""WHO requires us to have immunisation coverage of above 80 per cent at the moment, unfortunately our coverage is below 50 per cent and that has been a huge concern to us,"" he said.
""Many of our parents do not take that responsibility to bring their children or babies to be immunised.""
He said no clinical cases had been detected at this stage and the two children who were exposed to the virus were vaccinated and therefore did not become infected or symptomatic.
The mass immunisation program will target around 3.5 million vaccinated and unvaccinated children between the ages of 0 and 10.
In Australia, a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said the federal government was supporting PNG's response to the outbreak with ""targeted technical assistance"".
""Australia is working closely with Papua New Guinea, the World Health Organization and UNICEF to help respond to the detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.
""Australia is proud to be PNG's partner of choice and we will continue to work with PNG to support the health and development of its people, and to ensure a healthy region.""
UNICEF PNG country representative Veera Mendonca said she was confident the outbreak could be contained with a rapid action plan.
""If you're immunised and you have the virus, it has no effect on you … if you're immunised, no problem. This is why it is important for every child to be immunised,"" she said.
She commended the PNG government for its efforts in improving vaccine coverage in the country prior to the outbreak by ensuring stocks and cold chains in remote areas.
""In the country we have areas with only eight per cent coverage. But we also have 82 per cent coverage — so we know it is possible,"" Ms Mendonca said.",Unknown,Thu 15 May

Healthcare Facilities","One of the joint venture partners chosen to build Perth's new maternity hospital has entered voluntary administration after months of uncertainty, but the Western Australian government is adamant the project remains on track.
Builder Roberts Co was chosen last December alongside European construction giant Webuild as joint venture partners for the hospital, designed as a replacement for the ageing King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEMH).
The new $1.8 billion Women and Babies Hospital, to be co-located with Fiona Stanley Hospital (FSH) in Murdoch, is scheduled to open its doors by 2029.
The WA premier announces plans to build a maternity hospital at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre will no longer go ahead, instead committing almost $2b to a site in Perth's south.
But the parent entity of Roberts Co, RCAH Group, was recently wound down, with its New South Wales arm sold to a Middle East developer.
The Victorian arm of the business entered administration in March, while the WA branch followed suit last week.
Global management firm FTI Consulting has been appointed to examine the financial position of Roberts Co and RCAH Group.
Construction of the hospital had been due to begin later this year, and it is unclear if the loss of Roberts Co will force the government to find a new builder to partner Webuild, which has a 70 per cent stake in the project.
Health Infrastructure Minister John Carey said negotiations with Webuild were continuing, but did not specify if a new junior partner would join the project.
John Carey says the hospital remains on track to open by 2029, despite the loss of Roberts Co. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)
""Like all major projects from time to time you do experience these hurdles,"" he told ABC Radio Perth.
""We do have confidence in Webuild, given their history as one of the biggest contractors in the world. There is no question about their ability to deliver this project.""
Mr Carey said details of discussions would remain secret, but there was no change to the project's timeline.
Shadow WA Health Minister Libby Mettam said the short timeline between December's joint venture announcement and the departure of Roberts Co defied explanation.
""This partner was brought on because of hospital infrastructure building experience and it raises questions,"" she said.
""[Mr Carey] is not up front about when he knew about the troubles of Roberts Co, and it is just not believable that they will be able to start construction this year.""
Libby Mettam has her doubts about the timeline of the maternity hospital project. (ABC News: Bridget McArthur)
Opposition Leader Basil Zempilas described it as a ""chronic failure"" of the Cook government.
""It is time for the Cook Labor Government, and the Premier in particular, to stop spinning, and being straight with the people of Western Australia.""
In a statement, FTI Consulting confirmed Roberts Co had also sold its WA business interests, and administrators would examine those transactions before reporting to creditors.
""We are aware there is interest from stakeholders of the business to propose a deed of company arrangement (DOCA) with the view of providing a better return to creditors in a timely manner, which will be considered in due course,"" the statement said.
The state government announced the hospital project in April 2023, saying the facility would be built at FSH.
That raised concerns among clinicians about travel distances between the new campus and Perth Children's Hospital (PCH), with KEMH's former head of anaesthesia Tim Pavy claiming lives would be at risk.
The then-WA health minister Amber-Jade Sanderson downplayed those fears, saying the hospital would include improved neo-natal facilities.
Doctors fear plans to move WA's main women's and babies' hospital 20 kilometres from its current location risk increased ""mortality and morbidity"" of critically unwell infants.
The Liberals entered the state election also criticising the plan and claiming babies would die as a result, saying they would build the hospital on a car park site at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre in Nedlands.
The Australian Medical Association WA said it wanted maternity, paediatric and adult medical services to be ""tri-located"" at one site.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-15/queensland-study-reveals-link-vitamin-d-mental-disorders-babies/105290774,New study reveals vitamin D deficient babies at higher risk of mental disorders,"Topic:
Pregnancy and Childbirth","Newborns who are deficient in vitamin D have a higher chance of developing mental disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), researchers have found.
In the largest study of its kind, they tested the vitamin D status of more than 70,000 people as babies, using dried blood spots kept on filter paper from their heel prick tests in the first few days of life.
Should you worry if you're not getting as much sunlight as you did over summer?
University of Queensland (UQ) psychiatric researcher John McGrath led the painstaking study, which analysed vitamin D levels from a sample of people born between 1981 and 2005 in Denmark, where the filter paper from the tests is kept.
They compared vitamin D data from a random selection of the Danish population without mental disorders to people with autism, schizophrenia, ADHD, major depression, bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa.
""We found that low vitamin D was linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia, autism and ADHD,"" Professor McGrath said.
""We don't think that vitamin D during adulthood has anything to do with these disorders. We're talking about low vitamin D during early brain development.
Professor McGrath, of UQ's Queensland Brain Institute, said the new evidence suggested optimal vitamin D during early life is ""not only important to build strong bones, but also to build healthy brains"".
He described ""very low"" vitamin D as being less than 25 nanomoles per litre of blood.
While the study adds to previous research suggesting low maternal vitamin D involvement in schizophrenia, autism and ADHD, he stressed that mental health disorders are multi-factorial, with a wide range of genetics and environmental factors also playing a key role.
John McGrath says the findings suggest vitamin D is important for building healthy brains. (Supplied)
""We know that many other factors can impact on orderly brain development, such as prenatal infection,"" Professor McGrath said.
""Obstetric complications and childhood trauma may also be linked to later mental disorders.""
In schizophrenia, smoking cannabis in adolescence is considered a trigger in susceptible people.
Professor McGrath has spent the past three decades trying to identify risk factors, such as low vitamin D, that can be modified in the hope that it will decrease the incidence of the disorders.
The findings from the latest study suggest that if vitamin D is a true causal factor, 15 per cent of schizophrenia cases, 9 per cent of ADHD, and 5 per cent of autism could have been prevented if all participants had vitamin D levels of more than 21 nanomoles per litre of blood as a newborn.
But Professor McGrath said those estimates were based on people living in Denmark, not in Australia, where individuals are less likely to be vitamin D deficient.
Vitamin D is often referred to as ""the sunshine vitamin"" because the sun is one of the best sources. It is also found in some foods and can be taken as a supplement.
In Australia, vitamin D supplementation in margarine is mandatory.
Speaking on behalf of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG), Amanda Henry said families should not be ""either unduly alarmed or overly hopeful"" about the study findings.

""We're definitely not talking here that this explains everything about these conditions,"" she said.
Professor Henry, who was not involved in the research, said RANZCOG guidelines already recommended that women take vitamin D as part of pregnancy supplementation.
But she said routine vitamin D screening was not recommended.

""Vitamin D is one of the topics that's currently under development to be actively updated,"" Professor Henry said.
""We're waiting on the latest research on that to be integrated, then we will have updated guidance for mums and families around Australia in terms of what to do with vitamin D and many other things in pregnancy.

Alternative Energy","Jeromie Fitzpatrick never thought he would leave his farm in the New South Wales central west.
But the proposed construction of a $1.5 billion waste-to-energy incinerator on the outskirts of Parkes has him, and many in the community, reconsidering.
""It is raising some serious questions as to my future, my family's future,"" Mr Fitzpatrick said.
The Parkes Energy Recovery facility would have the capacity to turn 600,000 tonnes of waste into energy each year with the ability to power 80,000 homes.
The vast majority of rubbish, which is non-recyclable, would be transferred from Sydney to Parkes via train.
Jeromie Fitzpatrick is a sheep, cattle and crop producer in Parkes. (ABC Central West: Hamish Cole)
It has prompted thousands of locals to join a campaign demanding to know why waste from the city should be transported more than 350 kilometres to the rural community.
A similar facility was proposed for Eastern Creek in Sydney in 2018, however, the Independent Planning Commission knocked back the proposal due to health concerns.
In 2022, the NSW government passed legislation banning waste-to-energy facilities in all bar four locations across the state, with Parkes, Lithgow, Goulburn and Richmond the only exemptions.
Parkes is home to more than 10,000 people. (ABC Central West: Hamish Cole)
Ben Stead has launched a community group, the Parkes Clean Future Alliance, with a petition in opposition to the project gathering thousands of signatures.
""How is it safe here but not everywhere else?"" Mr Stead said.
Mr Stead said concerns over the impact of the incinerator had forced him to rethink his plans to build a house near the site of the proposed incinerator.
The facility would see 60 train loads of rubbish from Sydney per day transferred to the proposed facility at the Parkes Special Activation precinct, which is owned by the state government and located 3km out of town.
Jeromie Fitzpatrick says the facility will destroy the reputation of the agricultural sector in the region. (ABC Central West: Hamish Cole)
Mr Fitzpatrick's farm is less than 10km from the site.
He said if the technology ""is so safe"" then the facility should be built in the city.
For decades, Victorians burned their rubbish in backyard incinerators. It's now back in vogue, with five waste-to-energy facilities under development across the state.
""If it is not good enough in Sydney and Eastern Creek because it is too dangerous for the community … then it is too dangerous here.""
The director of the Parkes Energy Recovery project Edward Nicholas said the state government chose the location for the incinerator, but they ""would be happy"" to build it in Sydney if required.
""The same technology to keep it safe in residential Sydney is the same technology that we will be using to keep it safe for people, land, water and livestock in Parkes.""
The facility uses thermal technology to burn the waste, generating steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity.
The emissions from the burnt waste are filtered before being released into the air.
There are more than 2,000 large-scale waste-to-energy facilities across the world, including one operational in Western Australia and another under construction.
There are proposals for more than half a dozen of the incinerators to be built across Victoria, NSW and Queensland.

Mr Nicholas said the facility would use ""safe, proven, reliable technology"" and NSW had among the strictest guidelines in the world.
""The NSW Environment Protection Authority and Department of Planning have put in place a regime that is as strict as anywhere else in the world,"" he said.
""These are facilities that are in some places like downtown Copenhagen … as close as 200 metres from residents.
""The fact that it is safe in that sort of environment should give people comfort.""

The technology proposed for the Parkes Energy Recovery plant is the same as the two sites in Western Australia.
Mr Nicholas said real-time ""emission monitoring"" data would be included as part of the project and publicly available for residents to view.
Peter Tait is a member of the Public Health Association of Australia and was a clinical senior lecturer in population health at the Australian National University medical school.
He is also the author of a study that assessed reports linking older waste incinerators with a range of adverse health effects, such as cancer clusters and birth defects.
Dr Peter Tait says ingestion and inhalation are the main ways people are exposed to chemicals from waste to energy facilities. (ABC Central West: Hamish Cole)
Dr Tait said while the technology posed a low risk to human health, there was ""not no risk"".
""Old incinerators were quite toxin-producing so there is evidence of raised health outcomes including asthma, some cancers and some congenital abnormalities,"" he said.
""There are lots of toxic products produced, mostly dioxins as well as heavy metals.""
Dr Tait said incinerators built in the past decade were ""assumed"" to be much safer due to technological developments and higher standards.
The Parkes Shire Council is yet to form a position on the proposal, but Mayor Neil Westcott said avoiding any threat to human health was ""non-negotiable"".

Exercise and Fitness","Shireen Rigby knows all too well the extreme work that goes into being a competitive bodybuilder and the toll it can take mentally.
She saw the benefits of swapping out her high-intensity workouts for low-pressure social exercising, and she's not alone.
Alternative low-pressure exercise groups are increasing in popularity with the appeal of socialising, without stress or excessive sweating, drawing in the crowds.
""I've gone through body building; I've done CrossFit and been quite competitive and experienced the pressure … to maintain that sort of intensity,"" Ms Rigby said.
The pair say the group is all about moving the body ""without breaking any records"". (Supplied: Salty Steps)
The exercise physiologist, along with her dietitian housemate Keira Murray, wanted to create a space where people could exercise socially in a way that didn't have to be physically demanding.
""In our practice, we've seen that social isolation was a huge component in people's health,"" Ms Rigby said.
The duo started Salty Steps, a Sunday morning gathering in Yeppoon in central Queensland.

""We really wanted to create something that was no pressure,"" Ms Rigby said.
""It's a 30-minute walk at your own pace with no pressure, followed by a guided breath meditation, then we have the option of going for a swim.""
It is a more relaxed alternative to the higher-intensity run clubs that have sprung up around Australia.
In Rockhampton, Mum Miles Club brings a wave of strollers to the street.
The new club, founded earlier this year, has grown significantly from week to week.
""We either get a coffee before or after, or a play at the playground for the kids,"" founder Georgia Howard said.
""We've got mums of all stages of motherhood, we've got pregnant mums, we've got mums trying for babies, mums with newborns.

Ms Howard said the group also encouraged important conversations.
""There's a lot of domestic and family violence going on … and you see a lot of women in hard situations,"" she said.
""I think knowing you've got that group of support, having that person walk with you and beside you, is nice and comforting.""
An all-female hiking group has exploded in popularity in north Queensland as women seek friendship and fulfilment without the need for alcohol.
CQUniversity physical activity researcher Anetta Van Itallie said it was that kind of connection that was drawing crowds to low-key social exercise groups.
""It's definitely more than just physical, to be honest, when you look at the social connection and the mental wellbeing side of being with others,"" she said.
""Looking into habit research and how we can start exercising and being physically active every day, we know that it's got to be fun, we know it's got to be satisfying.
""I think people are moving away from your traditional sports and the level of commitment that is required from them.""

Sian Anstis wanted to combine her love for adventuring and meeting new people in ways that didn't revolve around drinking, so she created Hike Club Social.
""I think people are really jumping at the opportunity to meet people organically again,"" she said.
""We've lost a lot of community, I think, with social media, so to use it to be able to bring people back together again feels really good.""
Hike Club Social has started venturing interstate. (Supplied: Sian Antsis)
The club is based in Brisbane and travels around Queensland for different hikes and social activities.
""There have been camping events, we've been out on boat days going snorkelling, and we've even gone interstate to Tasmania for a multi-day hike,"" Ms Anstis said.
It is the same sentiment that Yeppoon's walking group shares.
""We love connecting people and that's a huge part of why we started Salty Steps,"" Ms Rigby said.
""We know that everyone lives busy lives, and it's such a great way to not only catch up with your friends but do a bit of exercise.""

Doctors and Medical Professionals","West Australian doctors say they're worried about new laws that put the burden on them to assess if someone is fit to hold a firearm licence, their peak body says.
The WA government has introduced the sweeping new laws in the wake of the high-profile murders of Jennifer Petelczyc and her 18-year-old daughter Gretl.
Among a suite of new requirements to get and keep a firearms licence, gun owners have been required to submit a certificate from their GP confirming they are mentally and physically fit to own a firearm.
But a recent poll of doctors by the Royal Australian College of GPs (RACGP) found 80 per cent said ""no"" when asked whether they'd be willing to provide a firearms health assessment for their patients.
Dr Mariam Bahamia, deputy chair of the RACGP in WA said its members held many concerns about the fitness tests.
""The RACGP supports measures that reduce the potential for firearms harms,"" Dr Bahamia told ABC Radio Perth.
Dr Bahamia said for GPs in rural and remote areas, conducting fitness tests and in particular — refusing someone certification — could place them under pressure in a small community.
""These GPs live alongside their patients in the same community,"" she said.
""We wouldn't want any new laws having unintended consequences, such as straining community relationships or the therapeutic relationship that a GP has with their patients.
Sweeping new firearm licencing laws in WA have took effect on March 31 and include a requirement for a health assessment from a GP. (ABC News: Sharon Kennedy)
She said doctors also have reservations about saying whether a person is suitable to possess a firearm for five years on the basis of one assessment.
""The question really broadly being asked is whether the individual has anything that could impact their ability to have the safe use and possession of a firearm, which could impact themselves or others.
""GPs have been reluctant to become proxy decision makers as to the eligibility to be granted a firearm authority.
""We are not the only decision makers when it comes to the new firearm authority laws, there are many, many different stages that applicants have to go through. But for us, this is new.""
The WA government says its new firearms laws are the toughest in the country, “making explicit that the possession and use of a firearm is a privilege but not a right”, according to the police minister.
Unlike drivers licence assessments, which mainly involve judging a patients' physical and cognitive capacity, the firearms assessments require complex judgements about a patient's mental health.
""With the firearm license, there's a heavy emphasis on mental health and perhaps, substance abuse and history of violence or suicidal ideation and the cognitive stability of a patient.
""We have to have information about past psychiatric diagnoses and medications, and there's a different complexity and professional judgement involved when issuing a firearm health authority.
""In a way we're being asked to judge risk based sometimes on incomplete information.""
Dr Bahamia said the system was still in the first weeks of implementation and as time passes, the RACGP would get a clearer picture of what GPs are experiencing.
Commander Lawrence Panaia from WA Police said doctors should not be concerned about being held responsible if someone misuses a firearm after passing a health assessment.
""We worked for about the last 18 months with the health department and the Royal College of GPs to get these health assessments,"" Commander Panaia said.
""If that's a service that a patient is asking them to provide, it's their choice whether they do or don't.
""But what they've also got to remember is that the commissioner of police is the final decision maker in granting someone a licence, not the medical profession.
""At the end of the day, they're protected.""

Courts","A popular Gold Coast bakery that operated without a food licence for seven months has been fined $40,000 after health inspectors found live pigeons, an infestation of flies, congealed food waste and mould.
Pane Organico Italian Bakery was charged with 35 offences under the Food Standards Act, including selling unsuitable food, handling food for sale in a way that will or likely make food unsuitable, and contravening condition of licence.
On Wednesday, Southport Magistrates Court heard that Pane Organico's director and baker, Luigi Incampo, was present when Gold Coast City Council health officers inspected the bakery on multiple occasions in October 2022, December 2023 and July 2024.
Incampo pleaded guilty.
Special counsel representing the City of Gold Coast, Jaclyn Poulton, told the court inspectors found ""mould congealed on a trolley"" next to an ""uncovered bucket of cream"" along with a ""thick layer of fat"" over a cooking surface where ""dust had accumulated"".
Ms Poulton showed the court photographs of a fly on prosciutto, an uncleaned meat slicer, live pigeons within the bakery, congealed food waste around an egg white container and an accumulation of grease around drains.
Other photos showed feathers on the floor of the food preparation area.
Pane Organico's food licence was suspended on February 9, 2024, but the business continued operating for seven months and did not return its licence to council officers as required, the court heard.
Pane Organico's representative Philip Whitehead told the court the bakery had been operating since August 2018 and, though it remained registered with ASIC, had now ""closed doors"".
He said Incampo did not excuse ""the overall lack of cleanliness"" but that he worked up to 14 hours a day and had only three sales staff employed to assist him.
Mr Whitehead said the bakery had also seen sales decline due to construction on the light-rail project nearby.
He said Incampo, 72, regretted the incidents but could not keep up with the demands of city health inspectors.
In sentencing, Justice Lisa O'Neill said the bakery had shown a ""repeated failure to remedy breaches"" and that microbiological testing had shown some of the food could have caused sickness.

Courts","A psychiatrist who treated Joel Cauchi has conceded she was wrong to suggest the Bondi Junction stabber was not psychotic at the time of the 2024 attack.
Dr A, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, saw Cauchi for his treatment-resistant schizophrenia between 2012 and 2020.
WARNING: This story contains content that readers may find distressing.
At the coronial inquest on Tuesday, Dr A argued Cauchi's stabbing rampage had ""nothing to do with psychosis"" but was influenced by his ""hatred towards women"".
Evidence from other psychiatric experts has been clear and unanimous that Cauchi was ""floridly psychotic"" on the day of the attack.
On Wednesday under cross-examination by Sue Chrysanthou SC, who represents some of the victims' families, the barrister argued Dr A's evidence was ""dishonest"".
""It was conjecture on my part and I should not have said that,"" Dr A responded, withdrawing her initial evidence.
The psychiatrist was questioned heavily over apparent disparities in the specific schizophrenia she diagnosed Cauchi with.
Dr A argued she had diagnosed Cauchi with first episode schizophrenia despite her email to Cauchi's GP in 2012 confirming she had diagnosed him with chronic paranoid and disorganised schizophrenia.
A chronic diagnosis would suggest a requirement of lifelong care and treatment, which includes antipsychotic medication.
""It was a working diagnosis,"" Dr A said, though no notes were produced to the court showing a revised non-chronic diagnosis.
""There was no evidence that he heard voices,"" Dr A said, to which Ms Chrysanthou acknowledged an email from Cauchi's mother to Dr A's clinic in November 2019.
Ms Cauchi had reported concerns her son was ""now hearing voices"" and writing notes he was ""under satanic control"".
Dr A told the court during a cross-examination there was ""no evidence"" that Cauchi heard voices. (Supplied)
The barrister suggested it was an early warning sign of relapse or psychosis.
Dr A argued Ms Cauchi was a ""beautiful mother but not a psychiatrist"".
""That is not evidence. That is just outside description. It was an opinion of the mother.""
The court heard tense back-and-forth between Ms Chrysanthou and Dr A on Wednesday, including one point where the psychiatrist told the barrister, ""I don't think you have any degree in medicine"".
Ms Chrysanthou suggested that early warning signs of relapse in schizophrenia were a sign or evidence of psychosis.
""That's not true I have to educate you,"" Dr A said, to which the barrister replied: ""I don't want to be educated, I just want you to answer the question.""
Ms Chrysanthou asked Dr A why she did not effectively provide a handover in clinical notes and files after a request from Cauchi's new medical centre in November 2020.
Sue Chrysanthou SC argued that Dr A's evidence on Tuesday was ""dishonest"". (ABC News: Greg Bigelow)
""It was impractical … If they're not happy, they [should] come back for more,"" she said, suggesting the medical centre should have followed up.
""I felt as a private psychiatrist I had done the exit … I can't change the system.""
Dr A's barrister, Mark Lynch, asked the psychiatrist whether she had done her utmost to tell the truth when giving her evidence at the inquest.

Health","Another person has died from soil-borne disease melioidosis in Queensland, bringing this year's death toll from the disease to 31.
The latest Queensland Health figures show one person in Townsville has died from the infection in the past week.
There have also been four new melioidosis cases reported in the same period.
Three of those cases were around Cairns and the other was in the Townsville region.  Townsville Public Health Unit director Steven Donohue said the latest death illustrated how serious the illness could be.
""As you can imagine, this is concerning,"" Dr Donohue said.
The elderly, heavy drinkers, and those with chronic health conditions are most at risk.
Melioidosis is a rare disease caused by bacteria found in soil and water in northern Australia and South-East Asia.
The bacteria enters the body through cuts or inhalation, so cases soared after record-breaking flooding.
Henry Street was among streets flooded in Townsville in March 2025. (ABC North Qld: Georgia Loney)
Queensland Health said it had received 221 melioidosis notifications this year, which experts have described as a significant outbreak.Most of the cases have been in Cairns and Townsville, including a cluster in Townsville's northern suburbs.
Symptoms include fever and coughing, which can be mistaken for other illnesses, and the disease can develop into fatal sepsis.
Intravenous antibiotics are often needed for months to treat melioidosis. (ABC North Qld: Georgia Loney)
Dr Donohue said reports of new cases had died down significantly as the weather dried up.
""So far as we can see, the outbreak that we've had this year is probably over,"" he said.
Steven Donohue says cases of melioidosis continue to be detected in North Queensland. (ABC News)
The number of cases has soared since flooding, as people cleaned up after the floods and came into contact with the bacteria.
Health authorities have continued to urge people to cover up when working outside.
There is also a theory that more than a decade of construction works on the Bruce Highway has stirred up clay-like soil believed to harbour the bacteria.
The Queensland government has said that stringent environmental protection protocols reduced the risk of soil-borne diseases leaving worksites.
Dr Donohue said there was a range of reasons for the outbreak.
""It's entirely plausible that a number of the cases in the south of Cairns, near the Bruce Highway upgrade may be linked to that, but of course there are a number of factors,"" he said.
""We know that melioidosis tends to affect older people, and those with immune problems, or diseases like diabetes, kidney disease, as well as people's behaviour.""",Unknown,Wed 14 May

AFL","The AFL Players' Association (AFLPA) says they are disappointed in the immediate handling of a player's serious on-field injury after play was not stopped despite a clear concussion.
Collingwood forward Lachie Schultz was badly concussed in the Magpies' win over Fremantle at Perth Stadium last Thursday when he attempted to tackle Dockers defender Jordan Clark.
He went to ground and was clearly concussed, with his arm involuntarily held up in the air.
Audio obtained by Channel 7's The Agenda Setters revealed on Tuesday night that field umpires were aware Schultz was injured when they allowed play to continue while he was sprawled out on the turf. This is despite later telling the AFL they had not seen him.
""It is now clear that the umpires noticed Lachie Schultz's injury and had the opportunity to stop the play to ensure he left the field safely,"" AFLPA CEO Paul Marsh said.
""What this highlights to us is that the process of dealing with vital health and safety issues on the field is unclear, and there are many recent examples of the industry needing to better prepare everyone for when these situations occur.
""Equally, we are disappointed that the AFL failed to appropriately review a serious on-field incident but acknowledge that they have taken responsibility for this.""
The audio revealed one umpire heard saying: ""We have got an injured player in the middle. I am watching … We are OK. We are OK.""
After Collingwood moved the ball inside 50, some of Schultz's teammates appealed for medical help. In the audio, an umpire is heard telling a player on the ground: ""We can only stop the play if the ball is coming near or if they instruct us to.""
This contradicts a statement released by the AFL last Friday, which said play should have been stopped but the four umpires had not seen Schultz on the ground: ""The umpires did not see the injured player at the time, so play continued. Upon review, if the umpires were aware, play would have been stopped.""
AFL football boss Laura Kane said the AFL had initially been given the wrong information by the umpires but took full responsibility for the error.
""The statement we released was incorrect, but we were given the wrong information from the umpires,"" she said in a statement provided to Channel 7.
""It's inconsistent with the vision. They [the umpires] were going off memory and not the vision and we should always look at the vision.
""All the field umpires from the game have all been coached this afternoon that they should have stopped the game.""
Marsh added the union welcomed the opportunity to work with the industry to continually strengthen health and safety protocols for members, particularly given the seriousness of head injuries.

Abortion","A bill expanding access to abortion has passed both houses of the New South Wales parliament.
MPs were given a conscience vote on the bill brought by Greens MP Amanda Cohn, which will allow nurse-practitioners and endorsed midwives to prescribe abortion medication for early stage pregnancies.
The bill passed the lower house, 65 votes to 20 on Wednesday afternoon, with the support of the premier and opposition leader.
It passed the upper house — where it was introduced — last week, with major amendments.
Coalition and Labor MPs were given a conscience vote on the matter and, until Tuesday night, Mr Speakman had declined to publicly state his position.
NSW Premier Chris Minns supported the bill. (ABC News: Nick Dole)
Under Dr Cohn's original bill, doctors with moral objections to abortion would be legally required to refer a patient to another practitioner who would provide the service.
Some mandatory reporting requirements would also be abolished.
However, these proposals were among those stripped from the bill in the upper house last week, due to lack of support.
Dr Cohn said the Greens were ""incredibly proud to have put abortion access on the political agenda"".
""At a time when advocates for women's rights and reproductive rights have been anxious that our hard-fought rights could be eroded, it's significant for the NSW parliament, across party lines, to not only safeguard reproductive rights in NSW, but improve them,"" she said in a statement.
Earlier, NSW Opposition Leader Mark Speakman accused a prominent anti-abortion campaigner of ""brazen bullying"", declaring he would not ""cave in"" in the face of political threats.
He told parliament on Tuesday that he would support the bill and said some arguments of anti-abortion campaigners were based on ""misinformation"".
""I think on balance, the bill will make no material difference to the rate of abortion in New South Wales,"" he said.
""[It] will not interfere with freedom of conscience, but will probably lead to better — not worse — health outcomes for many pregnant women seeking abortions.""

Mr Speakman singled out high-profile anti-abortion campaigner Joanna Howe over an email she sent him on Monday night.
In the chamber, he read out what he said was an extract.
Mr Speakman said Dr Howe then ""threatened"" his leadership, leaving him in a state of ""shock.""
He continued reading from the email.

Dr Howe, a legal professor at the University of Adelaide, is one of the most vocal critics of abortion in the country.
Last year, she was banned from parts of South Australia's parliament and last week, she appeared alongside former prime minister Tony Abbott at a major anti-abortion rally outside NSW parliament.
In a video posted online, Dr Howe said she would post the full email exchange between herself and the opposition leader.
""Am I a bully or is Mark Speakman just a precious snowflake who can't handle the democratic process?"" she said.
The ABC contacted her for comment.
Shortly after Mr Speakman concluded, one of his newest Liberal colleagues spoke in opposition to the bill.
A bill to expand abortion services in New South Wales will face a crucial vote in the lower house this week.
Epping MP Monica Tudehope said the bill ""undermines the healthcare of women"".
""There appears to have been limited consultation with nurses and midwives as to whether they are seeking an expanded scope of practice to be able to administer the abortion medication,"" she said.
""Labelling nurses and midwives as experienced does not magically make the drugs being administered any safer.
""While no longer in the bill, I think it is worth particularly calling out the egregious provision that attempted to remove the ability for medical professions, for doctors, to act according to their conscience.""",Unknown,Wed 14 May

Mental Health","""Just one more breath, just one more day and just one more conversation"" is the mantra Brooke McIntosh repeats to herself as she edges closer to becoming the fastest woman to run continuously around Australia.
The 29-year-old entrepreneur has been running at least 80 kilometres a day — the equivalent of about two marathons — since she left her hometown of Perth on March 3.
She is on a mission to complete a 14,080km lap of the country in 180 days while raising $1.4 million for mental health charity the Blue Tree Project.
Ms McIntosh was welcomed by an excited cohort from Kiama High School on Monday. (Supplied)
Ms McIntosh has already crossed the Nullarbor, been through Adelaide, Melbourne, Canberra and is weaving through the Illawarra until she reaches Sydney's Coogee Beach by late Wednesday.
""It's beautiful out here,"" Ms McIntosh told ABC Illawarra Breakfast while running through Wollongong on Tuesday.
Deborah De Williams was the first woman to complete a non-stop run of Australia, finishing the 18,026km journey in 408 days.
Ms McIntosh is hoping to crush that record, as well as a Guinness World Record, by completing the feat with no full rest days.

She will have run for almost 70 consecutive days by the time she reaches Sydney but says her body is well-adjusted.
""The first four weeks was like, 'What are you doing to me?'"" Ms McIntosh said.
""[Now] it's like, 'This is what we're doing — running around Australia to raise awareness about mental health every day.'""
In 2022, Nedd Brockmann burst into the public consciousness by running the width of Australia from Perth to Bondi.
He clocked up 3,800km in 47 days and raised $2.5 million for homelessness charity Mobilise.
After spending the night in Helensburgh, Ms McIntosh headed for Coogee at around 10am on Wednesday.  (Supplied)
What Ms McIntosh has set out to achieve is another level of endurance at almost five times the distance and duration.
But like Mr Brockmann, she finds great pride in pushing her body to the limit.
""It's insane, but for me, it's all just one more step or conversation,"" Ms McIntosh said.
Brooke was supported by her brother, Richmond player Kamdyn McIntosh, in Melbourne last month. (Supplied)
Ms McIntosh has grappled with mental health challenges from a young age and chose to become an advocate following a near-fatal truck accident three years ago.
""I just don't want anyone to experience the depths of darkness alone,"" she said.
The WA-grown movement is booming across Australia's east coast, and has even made it to Antarctica to achieve the founder's goal of having a tree on every continent.
""I believe if we have the courage to have just one more conversation, we realise that a problem shared is a problem halved and that the world is a beautiful place.""
The Blue Tree Project is an initiative that aims to encourage people to have tough conversations about mental health.
The charity has painted more than 1,300 trees bright blue as a symbol for change.
Ms McIntosh said she had received a great response during the run.
""Some people just pull over on the highway for a quick yarn … the community [support] is insane,"" she said.
After she rests her feet overnight in Sydney, Ms McIntosh will continue her journey into Queensland and the Northern Territory before arriving back in Perth by late August.

Child Abuse","The national children's commissioner wants a cabinet minister for children and is calling on governments to ""act on evidence"" from child protection reports.
An ABC investigation into Australia's $2 billion residential care system finds children in three of the biggest states are being preyed upon by child sex abusers.
On Tuesday, the ABC reported that vulnerable children in group homes were being sexually abused by people luring them with substances.
The investigation unearthed cases of a senior worker contacting a child sex abuser as part of a ""safety"" check on a child, the current sexual exploitation of a girl at risk of death, and a department's attempt to avoid responsibility for decisions that led to assaults.
Commissioner Anne Hollonds said the revelations were ""really distressing"".
""We're not seeing the political will to act to transform how we monitor the conditions that we place these children in.""
She told AM's Sabra Lane there needed to be ""independent monitoring and oversight"" of how children in out-of-home care were being cared for.
Anne Hollonds says there needs to be change in how children's conditions are monitored. (ABC News: Billy Cooper)
One in three children in Victoria's residential care homes are believed to be sexually exploited, according to data from the state's children's commission.
Queensland's child protection department did not know how many of its almost 2,000 residential care kids were sexually abused in the last financial year.
It said across the whole system — residential and foster care combined — 21 of 123 sexual abuse reports were found to be substantiated.
The New South Wales government only provided the number of substantiated reports.
Of the 1,445 children in residential care, six were abused by adults and 14 by other children.
Residential care is a $2 billion system for vulnerable children. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)
Ms Hollonds said it was time for the federal government to step up because states and territories were not meeting their responsibility to keep children safe.
""States and territories really struggle to get on top of this,"" she said.
""What we need is nationally coordinated reform and I think that requires the Commonwealth government to get involved.""
Ms Hollonds told AM the safety and wellbeing of children had to be ""a national priority"".
Ms Hollonds said she had overseen many reports, and that more than 3,000 recommendations had been ""repeated endlessly"" over the years.
""It's not a lack of knowledge that's the problem — it's a lack of accountability for action,"" she said.
The ABC's investigation detailed experiences of a Victorian girl currently in residential care, whose mother fears she will die from the exploitation she has endured since she was 12.
Victorian shadow minister for child protection, Roma Britnell, said the ongoing sexual abuse of children in care was the state Labor government's ""most shameful failure"".
""Through either sheer incompetence or a lack of care, this government has failed to protect our most vulnerable children,"" she said.
""The full extent of abuse and exploitation in residential care has been hidden by the minister.
""Inexperienced and young child protection workers are being left in charge, leading to a high turnover rate.
""Children as young as six are being placed in residential care homes due to the government's failures within the child protection system.""
Victoria's acting children's commissioner, Meena Singh, said years-old recommendations to address sexual exploitation in residential care were ""yet to be fully implemented"" by the department.
""Key among them is our call for a statewide coordinated response between agencies — including the Department of Families, Fairness and Housing, residential care providers, and Victoria Police — to prevent, monitor, and respond to child sexual exploitation in residential care,"" she said.
Ms Singh said the government had provided ""insufficient"" funding to address the issue.
The Victorian department said it invested an additional $548 million two budgets ago to improve outcomes for residential care children over four years.
Only 2.4 per cent, or $13.4 million, of that funding is allocated specifically towards action on child sexual exploitation, although the department said the wider funding also had ""elements"" complementary to tackling exploitation.
A Victorian government spokesperson said the abuse or neglect of any child placed in out-of-home care was unacceptable.
""Residential care providers are independently regulated by the Social Services Regulator and must follow strict guidelines and protocols.
""The department undertakes a review when a quality-of-care concern is raised in relation to an agency.""
7.30 has been given a rare glimpse inside the AFP's Child Protection Triage Unit, where investigators often confront the worst examples of child exploitation.
The spokesperson said the Victorian government had, over the past five years, ""invested $4 billion to strengthen child protection and family services"".
The Queensland child protection department said it was ""always looking for ways to improve how we support children through reviews of practice guidance and planned case reviews"".
The department said it was committed to moving towards a dual carer model for residential care facilities 24 hours a day, delivering Queensland's first secure care facility to children in ""certain circumstances"", piloting a new professional foster care program for children with complex needs who are currently in residential care, and increasing the allowance for extracurricular activities and education support.",Unknown,Wed 14 May

ADHD","Harriet Torres had just celebrated her 42nd birthday when she was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 2022.
As her psychiatrist revealed the diagnosis, she burst into tears.
""I kind of knew going in that I was probably going to get a diagnosis, but to have someone actually confirm that was really a powerful thing.
""It turned off a negative voice in my head that had been there my whole life, so it was almost instant.""
Ms Torrens, an administrator at the Australian National University, was prescribed medication to help her manage her ADHD traits, which included hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity.
Concerta helped Harriet Torrens manage her ADHD traits for more than two years, but she had to swap to another medication when an increased dose was unavailable. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy)
The drug — a long-acting stimulant called Concerta — had an almost immediate impact.
""It's important to highlight that medication is only one tool, but it has been a very useful tool for me,"" she said.
""I have both hyperactive and inattentive ADHD, which is tricky, but medication allows me to structure my day and my thoughts better.
For more than two years, it worked beautifully.
Then in February, Ms Torrens's psychiatrist recommended increasing her dose, only for her to find the dosage had become unavailable.
Australia has been in the grips of an ADHD medication shortage since late last year, with the Therapeutic Goods Administration warning it is likely to persist until at least the end of this year.
Harriet Torrens says the medication she is on now requires taking a number of tablets throughout the day. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy)
The causes of the shortages are complex, with manufacturing and supply chain issues playing a part as well as increased demand for the medications across the globe.
Concerta, Ritalin and Teva XR are in the shortest supply in Australia, with Rubifen expected to join that list next month.
Thankfully for Ms Torrens, her general practitioner Laura Chapman had a few options to choose from.
She first tried mixing two drugs that had not been impacted by the shortage, but the side effects were problematic, with Ms Torrens slipping quickly into ""a real depression"".
A shift to another drug has been much more effective, though it involves Ms Torrens taking a number of tablets across the day rather than one first thing in the morning.
Laura Chapman says many of her patients have told her they are phoning multiple pharmacies to fill their prescriptions and still coming up short. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy)
""It has changed my whole routine and it's more expensive, so it's been quite difficult,"" Ms Torrens said.
Dr Chapman said Ms Torrens's experience was becoming increasingly common, with many of her patients reportedly phoning multiple pharmacies to fill their prescriptions and coming up short.
The shortage has had somewhat of a cascading effect, with drugs becoming harder to get as more people switch their prescriptions from one to another.
Dr Chapman said she felt frustrated at being forced to ""cobble together"" prescriptions to come up with a mix of available drugs to help her ""distressed"" patients simply function.
""By that I mean we often need to pivot a person's pharmacological treatment to agents that are different and therefore not ideal.
""So, taking a bit of creative license, which is not always in the patient's best interest.""
Laura Chapman says people with ADHD often struggle with executive dysfunction. (ABC News: Rosie King)
Dr Chapman said often the solution was more expensive and involved the patient taking a smaller dose of medication multiple times a day, like in Ms Torrens's case.
She said that was particularly onerous for people with ADHD who typically struggle to manage their executive function.
And even then, Dr Chapman said she could not promise there would not be a shortage of the new drugs she prescribed.
General paediatrician Kim Bland said the impact the drug shortage was having on families in Canberra was ""heartbreaking"", with some parents going without entirely or making compromises like rationing doses to their children.
""They'll give their child medication on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and hope they've got enough learning on those days that they can go without their medication on Thursday and Friday,"" Dr Bland said.
Kim Bland says the drug shortage was seeing some parents ration doses to their children or go without entirely. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy)
""There are families not giving it in school holidays and on weekends when they normally would, and mums and dads are taking the brunt of that challenge with executive function, memory, focus and emotional regulation because they want to prioritise their child being able to regulate at school.
Dr Bland said she had spoken to parents who had called every pharmacy in the ACT as well as those in towns over the border in New South Wales to find medications, with little luck.
""Some of my families have just worked their way through the first shortage, transitioned to a new medication, only to be told that's going into shortage as well,"" she said.
""So, they really have nowhere else to go — I'm worried many of them have just given up because there's no options left for them.""
Kim Bland would like to see more medications made in Australia. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy)
For children with ADHD, being unmedicated can have a serious impact on their ability to learn and retain information and lead to significant emotional dysregulation.
Dr Bland said if left untreated over a long period, it could cause such significant disengagement with school that a child's education would suffer long-term.
She said the ""free market"" was partly to blame, with medications ultimately going to the country willing to pay the most for them.
""But also, only 10 per cent of our medications are made in Australia, and that makes us very vulnerable.
""It's quite a long-term dream, but I would really like to see some kind of buffer where some of these medications could be made here.""
Simon Blacker says some pharmacies are buying extra ADHD medications to ensure supply, meaning others go without. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy)
In pharmacies across Canberra, a Hunger Games-style battle to secure what stock is available has developed.
ACT Pharmacy Guild branch president and community pharmacist Simon Blacker said ongoing drug shortages since the pandemic had led to a habit of pharmacies buying as much as they could safely store when medications were in stock.
""That obviously means other pharmacies and patients are missing out, and that's the unintended consequence of drug shortages — and we wish it didn't happen, but it's a challenging time.
""It's often described as a Hunger Games effect, but we are in a global economy.""
Harriet Torrens says she was very fortunate to have an accessible GP who could adjust her prescription. (ABC News: Rosie King)
As for Ms Torrens, her new mix of medications is proving effective — and, perhaps just as importantly, available for now.
But it was not lost on her how different her experience could have been.
""I am very fortunate because I have an excellent GP, who I have access to pretty readily,"" Ms Torrens said.
""The minute I wrote her an email, she was onto it, but I'm really aware that not everyone is in that situation.
""I was also fortunate to have just had an appointment with my psychiatrist, and she had given my GP a lot of scope to support me with adjustments to my prescription.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-14/us-pharmaceutical-price-action-and-tariffs-still-expected/105273074,Trump's pharmaceutical 'tariff wall' is coming — is Australia ready?,"Topic:
Pharmaceuticals","Pharmaceutical companies around the world are steeling themselves for another major tariff announcement from the Trump administration that could make exporting medicine into the US more expensive.
Australia exports about $US1.6 billion ($2.5 billion) worth of medicines and healthcare products to the US each year, which makes up around 40 per cent of our total pharmaceutical exports across the globe.
But local manufacturers say they are only expecting to feel a moderate ripple from any fresh US trade restrictions.
Mr Trump's ""Liberation Day"" announcement last month slapped a 10 per cent baseline tariff on exports from many countries, including Australia, and while medical devices were included, pharmaceuticals were spared.
But last week the US president warned specific pharmaceutical tariffs were coming ""over the next two weeks"" and would force manufacturers to ""leave China"" and start making more products in the US.
""… [There's] going to be a tariff wall put up, and they won't be happy about it,"" he said.
While the world awaits that wall, Mr Trump has signed executive orders aimed at speeding up drug approvals and another that promises to bring down the cost of medicines.
US drug companies were told to voluntarily lower their prices in the next 30 days to match prices in comparable countries, otherwise, the government may step in and impose the price.
President Donald Trump gives an example of how much a breast cancer treatment costs in the US compared to Australia.
It is a policy called the ""most favoured nation"" and some experts say it would push prices up in other countries as drug companies try to recoup lost profits in the US.
Jared Mondschein, director of research at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, predicted countries like Australia would have to pay more or lose access to some new, innovative products.
But Matt Grudnoff, senior economist at the Australia Institute, said Australian consumers shouldn't panic.
""Our government has enormous bargaining power when it comes to setting the price of drugs here and just because [companies are] no longer able to earn super profits in the US, that doesn't take away from the market tussle here,"" he said.
""If the US pharmaceutical companies could get a better price out of Australia, they would do it regardless of how much they're gouging the US.""
It is really US consumers who will feel the pain of any tariffs in this space.
Analysts are expecting big price hikes in the US for generic drugs, which make up a big portion of prescriptions and operate on small margins.
Australian manufacturers who can not shift their operations to America may see demand drop if they have to compete with US-made medicines.
But if there is no alternative drug in the US market — for example, Australian-patented drugs — American consumers will be forced to pay the higher cost.
However, do not expect prices to change here in Australia.
""I don't think it will have a huge effect on us,"" said Professor Anthony Scott from Monash's Centre for Health Economics.
Pharmaceutical imports into Australia exceed what we send to the US by around $US1 billion ($1.6 billion) so if we were to go down the path of reciprocal tariffs — where we put a tariff on US pharmaceuticals coming in — there would be major repercussions.
""If we retaliated, that would mean the US products that come here would go up in price,"" Director of Health at the Grattan Institute, Peter Breadon, said.
That would be dangerous because Australia imports around 21 per cent of total pharmaceuticals from the US, making it the largest single supplier.
With that in mind, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has already ruled out any retaliatory action.
""We will not join a race to the bottom that leads to higher prices and slower growth,"" he said in April.
Entangled in this whole tariff business is the fact US drug companies have never been fans of Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)
That is because the PBS is about keeping prices down for Australians.
Instead of some medicines costing thousands of dollars per script, we only have to fork out a $31.60 co-payment if a medicine is listed on the PBS. The government picks up the rest of the cost.
The scheme forces drug companies into tough negotiations with the federal government on price so the company does not just dictate what the medicine is worth.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the US administration's tariffs ""have no basis in logic"" and he will stand up for the PBS. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)
The powerful pharma lobby in the US (PhRMA) said this was unfair and undervalued American innovations, so has long pushed the US government to take action against Australia.
But there is almost no chance the PhRMA could influence Australia to change the PBS — it has been described by political leaders as ""sacrosanct"" and Labor even went to the election with a promise to reduce the co-payment to $25 by next year.
""The PBS is an Australian institution … it will never be up for negotiation,"" Mr Albanese said last month.
We do not know when the pharmaceutical-specific tariffs will be announced, but medical devices imported to the US have been subjected to tariffs for the last month and American hospitals have been bracing for increased costs and disrupted patient care.
It is expected there will be shortages there of essential supplies such as syringes, surgical gloves, anaesthesia instruments and pulse oximeters because a lot of these come into the US from China.
China was hit by a sky-high 145 per cent tariff by Mr Trump but that was just dropped to 30 per cent for 90 days while trade negotiations resumed.
However, two of Australia's biggest exporters of medical devices to the US have found a way to avoid these tariffs.
ResMed said it's products receive ""favourable tariff treatment"". (Supplied)
Cochlear is a manufacturer of cochlear implants and ResMed is a sleep technology giant. Both companies have manufacturing facilities in Sydney.
They found an exemption to the tariffs, relying on a US law that provides for duty-free importation of products for people with disabilities.
Mr Trump signalled they could be in the ""neighbourhood"" of 25 per cent and reporting suggested that could increase the cost of drugs in the US by around $US51 billion annually.
The US relies a lot on China, Europe and India for pharmaceuticals but Australia is a much smaller contributor, mostly exporting blood products and vaccines made by CSL.
CSL is one of Australia's biggest companies and has two manufacturing facilities in Melbourne that make influenza vaccines, antivenoms and biotherapies to treat autoimmune disorders.
But CSL also has a massive presence in the US, where it employs more than 19,000 people across 44 states, which is about 60 per cent of its global workforce.
This significant US footprint puts CSL in a good position to respond to any forthcoming pharmaceutical tariffs as they can ramp up US production.

Their US plasma products will still have to undergo some processing in Australia, but CSL is banking on Mr Trump carving out an exemption to safeguard supplies of this critical product.
Telix Pharmaceuticals is another Australian company in a similar boat.
It makes targeted radiation therapies for cancers and has facilities in Melbourne but also has manufacturing and distribution infrastructure in the US.
""Telix Pharmaceuticals does not expect any material impact on its business or supply chain as the result of the international trade tariffs levied by the US government … the majority of Telix's workforce is based in the US,"" a spokesperson said.

Mental Health","Researchers have identified 25 genes they believe cause obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
In the largest global study of the disorder, they compared genetic data from more than 50,000 people worldwide who have the debilitating condition, with the DNA of about two million people who do not have OCD.
Medical researcher Eske Derks, one of the study's senior authors, said it was the first time ""actual genes that play a role in OCD"" had been found.
The senior group leader of QIMR Berghofer's translational neuro-genomics laboratory, said the study had identified about 250 genes linked to OCD, including 25 they believe to be causal.
Professor Eske Derks says OCD has traditionally been an understudied area. (Supplied: QIMR Berghofer)
""We found a really large number of genes which are shared with anxiety disorders, depression and also with anorexia nervosa,"" Professor Derks said.
""There's a lot of overlap in the genes that cause these different mental health conditions.""
She said twin studies had already revealed OCD was a heritable condition, but environmental factors, such as stressful life events also played a role.
Professor Derks said she hoped the latest research, published in Nature Genetics, would help reduce the stigma surrounding the disorder.
OCD is characterised by obsessive thoughts and behaviours, such as compulsive cleaning, checking things and hoarding.
But it can take many forms including people worrying about harming others, having doubts about relationships, intrusive sexual thoughts, or persistent concern about their responsibilities in life.
OCD is one of the World Health Organisation's ten leading causes of disability.
More than half a million Australians will experience obsessive compulsive disorder in their lifetimes. So what is it, and how is it treated?
Professor Derks said the researchers hoped to use the genetic information to help find more targeted drugs for severe cases of OCD, which affects an estimated 500,000 Australians.
""The next steps for our research team is to use these genetic discoveries to identify existing drugs, currently being used to treat other conditions, that may be effective for OCD patients, paving the way for more innovative treatment options,"" she said.

But she said that would require more funding.
""It's understudied.""
Brisbane-based clinical psychologist and OCD specialist Emily O'Leary said gold standard treatment for someone with moderate to severe OCD was a combination of psychological therapy and medication.
""Early intervention is usually linked with better outcomes,"" she said.
""The longer someone lives with OCD, the harder it can be to treat.
Emily O’Leary hopes genetic research will lead to a blood test for OCD. (Supplied)
""On average, it takes about 10 years from the outset of diagnosis to receive psychological help. By the time they reach us, many are unwell.""
Dr O'Leary said she hoped emerging genetic research would eventually lead to a blood test for OCD — helping identify those at risk and opening the door to early intervention.

Courts","Joel Cauchi's ""compulsive"" fixation on pornography in the years prior to the Bondi Junction stabbing attack was an ""early warning sign of relapse"" in his previous schizophrenia diagnosis, his psychiatrist has argued.
The coronial inquest into the 2024 attack was told on Tuesday Dr A, a psychiatrist who cannot be identified for legal reasons, monitored Cauchi while he was taking antipsychotic medication for his treatment-resistant schizophrenia at a clinic in regional Queensland between 2012 and 2020.
WARNING: This story contains content that readers may find distressing.
Cauchi had been living in Queensland before relocating to New South Wales in the final years of his life.
On April 13, 2024 he took six lives at Westfield Bondi Junction and was shot dead by NSW Police Inspector Amy Scott.
For four years prior, Cauchi was completely unmedicated after being weaned off the medication in consultation with Dr A.
On November 12, 2019, Cauchi emailed the clinic's reception with concerns about his porn usage.
""Can we please cover some ideas for a porn-free phone … I want a totally porn-free internet on my devices,"" he requested.
""I knew that it might have tormented him,"" Dr A told the court, reflecting on Cauchi's religiosity.
""That was the first time I knew he had developed a compulsive interest in porn… He wanted it. He was chasing it.""
Counsel Assisting the Coroner, Peggy Dwyer, SC, asked Dr A if she had found Cauchi's compulsion ""concerning"", which she agreed.
Dr A acknowledged Cauchi's behaviour at the time was ""an early warning sign of relapse"", and she recommenced prescribing his antipsychotic medication.
However, Cauchi did not take it.
""Honestly, I thought he was going to take it,"" she said.
By the end of 2019, Cauchi was completely weaned off his medication. (Supplied)
Cauchi's mother had contacted the clinic, the receptionist's record saying: ""Joel is very unwell since he came off his medication. She [Joel's mother] would like him to be reviewed as he was doing so much better when he was on [medication].""
Dr Dwyer asked Dr A if she believed Cauchi was suffering from psychosis at the time of the 2024 stabbing attack.
""I honestly believe, in my opinion, that was nothing to do with psychosis. It might have been due to his frustrations sexually, pornography, and hatred towards women,"" Dr A responded.
The inquest into the Bondi Junction stabbings has heard the security control room was empty when the attack started.
Dr Dwyer said the evidence from other psychiatric experts was ""clear and unanimous that Mr Joel Cauchi was floridly psychotic"" on the day of the attack.
""Do you accept that after Joel was discharged from the clinic he fell through the cracks?"" Dr Dwyer asked, to which Dr A agreed.
However, she denied the suggestion that Cauchi should never have been taken off his medication, and she denied the suggestion that she refused to accept failings in her care of Cauchi.
On Wednesday under cross examination by Sue Chrysanthou SC, who represents some of the victims' families, the barrister argued it was ""dishonest"" for Dr A to suggest that Cauchi was not psychotic on the day of the attack.
""It was conjecture on my part and I should not have said that,"" Dr A responded.
Dr A was questioned by Dr Dwyer as to her decision to wean Cauchi off his antipsychotic medication.
""During my eight years of treatment, he never showed any signs of positive symptoms, never showed signs of relapse,"" Dr A argued.
Positive symptoms in relation to a schizophrenia diagnosis can relate to any change in behaviour or thoughts, such as hallucinations or delusions, the court heard.
The inquest was previously told Cauchi's mother contacted the clinic in 2019 expressing concerns about her son's thoughts, including fears he was ""hearing voices"".
Four years earlier, Dr A had requested a second opinion from a colleague, who had previously treated Cauchi, about the decision to decrease his dosage.
""I just wanted a second opinion and I got it,"" Dr A told the court.
By April 2018, Dr A had written down in her notes after a consultation with Cauchi that he was ""the best I have seen him"".
She also wrote that Cauchi was ""grateful to be given the opportunity"" to stop the antipsychotic medication, with the support of his mother.
By the end of 2019, Cauchi was weaned off his medication completely.
A second psychiatrist's opinion was not sought in this decision.
""It was not necessary,"" Dr A said.
""In selective cases you can consider taking them off psychotic [medication]. I was listening to the patient. Medication is [one] part of psychiatric care.
""I was diligent and careful.""
Earlier on Tuesday, Dr A told the court the loss of life in the attack ""devastated"" her, adding, ""No psychiatrist in the world would wish on themselves for this trauma to happen.""

Public Health","SA Health has apologised to a Port Lincoln man left waiting nine days for surgery on his broken leg at the Royal Adelaide Hospital.
Stephen Rees, a father of two toddlers, was airlifted from Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula to the RAH on May 4 after shattering bones in his lower leg and severely dislocating his ankle in a football game the day before.
Central Adelaide Local Health Network's executive director of operations and performance, Rachael Kay, said the medical team had assessed his injury each day and ""determined that he was clinically ready for surgery on Friday, May 9"".
""I would like to apologise to Mr Rees and understand this must be frustrating.""

Mr Rees said he had fasted each morning and sometimes all day in preparation for surgery but was bumped each time by a more urgent case.
""[I'm] fed up — I just want to get home and see my family,"" he said.
After a nine-day wait, Mr Rees was wheeled in for surgery on Tuesday morning and the operation went well.
The day before, Mr Rees was told the RAH was looking into having him transferred to a private hospital for the operation, where he understood it would be paid for by the public health system.
Prior to this, Mr Rees' family had been making enquiries about getting the surgery done privately despite him not having private cover just to get him home.
""Other than that, my options were to sit here and wait.
""I've just sort of had enough … they kept bumping me and saying there are other more important cases than me even though I've been here for over a week.""

Mr Rees said he needed plates and screws to mend his snapped tibia and shattered fibula.
""The small bone in my leg is shattered, essentially, so they need to piece it back together and [put in] a couple of plates and a heap of screws,"" he said.
Mr Rees said one of the nurses had advised him generally, after three days, a patient's case was escalated to improve the chances of surgery.",Jodie Hamilton,Tue 13 May

Cycling","E-bike and e-scooter riders will be subject to strict speed and age limits under a proposal to legalise the devices in NSW.
A parliamentary inquiry sifted through hundreds of submissions over the rapid spread of e-bike and e-scooter use across the state.
The submissions revealed something many have known for some time — people feel passionately about the introduction of e-bikes and other such vehicles to roads and footpaths.
The NSW government released a response to the inquiry on Tuesday, with a slate of new recommendations to temper their use.
Those include a default speed limit between 10 kilometres per hour and 20kph on shared paths to help protect pedestrians, and a maximum speed of 20kph on roads.
Footpaths would also remain off-limits.
Under the current laws, e-scooters are illegal to ride on public roads and paths across the state, except in specific shared e-scooter trial areas.
Cycling advocates say e-bikes and other micromobility options help relieve congestion and offer more transport options other than cars.
The NSW government said about 1.3 million e-devices were being used around the state.
Bicycle NSW, an advocacy body for cyclists, said in its submission it strongly supported the spread of micromobility devices.
E-bikes, the group said, hugely contributed to efforts to decarbonise transport and create quieter, calmer streets.
""They provide access to work, education and recreation opportunities, and offer incredible independence to the 40 per cent of the population that can't drive, whether that is due to age, disability, low income or by choice,"" Bicycle NSW wrote in its submission.
The group attached photos of a high school in Manly Vale, which had one bike parked outside in July 2022, but 93 two years later, representing about 8.5 per cent of students there.

""Governments dream of this order of mode shift,"" the group wrote.
Lachlan Littlemore, a Sydney resident, said the city's growth and transport options had made it difficult and time-consuming for many commuters.
A 40-kilometre commute that would take an hour in the car, he said, can be done on an e-bike in 90 minutes, longer, but ""90 per cent on bike trails with pleasant views of Parramatta River"".
Abigail Sheppard, an avid cyclist living in Sydney's Surry Hills, said in her submission she regularly rode her push bike around Centennial Park for exercise.
The ""use and abuse"" of e-bikes, Ms Sheppard said, made cycling and shared paths far more dangerous.
She described a collision with an e-bike rider who was going ""much too fast"" before he crashed into her own bicycle, crushing her fingers between the two.
""I want cycling to be encouraged and I want to see less cars on the road,"" she wrote.
""Accordingly, I do not want e-bikes banned altogether, because they are, in principle, a very good thing.
Many residents expressed concerns about the speed of e-bikes, their interactions with pedestrians, other cyclists and those that may have mobility or vision impairments. (Supplied: Bicycle Network)
The NSW branch of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons said emergency departments had seen a ""substantial"" increase in injuries since the introduction of e-bikes, including deaths among some riders.
""The most common injuries caused by electric scooter-related traumas are primarily upper limb fractures and head and facial injuries,"" it wrote.
""Whilst some of these injuries are minor and only require admission to an emergency department, or treatment by a GP, there are many that require longer stays in hospital, with treatment from surgical teams and subsequent prolonged rehabilitation.""
Many residents were deeply concerned with the scourge of e-bikes left on footpaths, blocking bus stations and impeding the elderly and mobility- or vision-impaired.
""E-Bike riders seem to want to have maximum respect from motorists while freely breaking road rules, riding on footpaths at speed, and not wearing helmets,"" Robert Carrick wrote.
""It is also not acceptable for e-bike operators to simply dump bikes on residential streets, blocking footpaths and creating a trip hazard for the elderly.""
Many submissions agreed NSW needed more infrastructure to deal with a surge in e-mobility devices. (City of Sydney: Simon Woods)
Many advocacy groups seem to agree that more infrastructure and guidance is needed to address the boom in e-mobility devices.
Ashfield Bicycle Users Group, an advocacy group for residents of the area, said while e-bikes had the opportunity to draw users and reduce pressure on other modes of transportation, the uptake in new riders will stall without new infrastructure.
The Inner West Council Bicycle Working Group agreed, noting bicycles were an essential piece of current and future transport options. But the government, the group noted, should increase efforts to build cycleways, lower car speed limits and make other adjustments to share transport space between different modes.
""Our position is that policies that reduce the mode share of cars by encouraging mode shift to mass transit and active travel should be of the highest priority,"" the working group wrote.",Nick Visser,Tue 13 May

Doctors and Medical Professionals","The Office of the Health Ombudsman has issued a warning to the public as it investigates alleged wrongdoing by a Queensland massage clinic director.
Health Ombudsman Dr Lynne Coulson Barr said the office has identified significant concerns with the health services and treatment provided by David Zhen and his company H20MASSAGE, saying they could worsen patients' conditions or put them in serious risk of harm.
The OHO placed an interim order on David Zhen in June last year, prohibiting him from providing health services to the public.
""Mr Zhen has placed his patients at high risk of serious harm by providing health services and treatments that could be dangerous and ineffective,"" Dr Coulson Barr said.
The OHO said it was investigating claims Mr Zhen provided dangerous and ineffective treatments and advice including claiming to treat and cure serious health conditions, discouraging patients from seeking conventional medical advice, and a lack of infection control procedures.
Mr Zhen has allegedly treated people from Australia and overseas, including China, but the OHO said it has been unable to identify every patient.
Authorities have urged anyone who received treatment by Mr Zhen to get in contact, and recommended patients should always verify their health provider with the Ahpra registry and OHO website.
""We urge members of the public who have received a health service from Mr Zhen to seek medical advice from a registered medical practitioner, and to contact the OHO,"" Dr Coulson Barr said.

Viruses","Measles cases have reached the highest number of infections nationwide in six years.
The National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System shows 71 measles cases have been reported across the country this year so far.
This already exceeds the total for 2024 and is the highest number recorded since 2019, when there were 284 cases.
This year, 14 cases were reported in people aged 25-29 years old, and children aged 0-4 years old had the second highest number of infections recorded.
In 2025, Victoria had recorded 26 infections, New South Wales 21, and Western Australia 18.
Health officials have issued a nationwide call to prevent the spread.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 14 outbreaks have been recorded this year, with 93 per cent of confirmed cases being outbreak-associated.
In April, medical professionals urged travellers to stay vigilant amid a global rise in cases in the United States and other parts of the world.
Ramya Raman, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners vice-president and Western Australia chair, told the ABC the rise in cases could be because people were travelling overseas more frequently.
The vaccination rate could also be a contributing factor, Dr Raman said.
""We are below the 95 per cent vaccination rate that we need for herd immunity, so overseas arrivals and local infection spreading and the infectiousness of the actual condition is probably all contributing to that,"" she said.
The measles virus has not been widely circulating in Australia for some time, largely due to many people already receiving two doses of the vaccine which reduces the chances of catching the virus.
Two doses of the MMR (Mumps, Measles, and Rubella) vaccine was introduced to the national childhood immunisation schedule in the early 90s.
But Australians born before then might have received only one dose and be ""partially vaccinated"", Dr Raman said.
""If you were born after 1965 and haven't already had two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, you can get up to two free MMR vaccinations through your GP,"" she said.
Studies suggest that one bout of measles usually results in lifelong immunity.

Measles is a highly infectious, itchy rash with a fever, which typically affects children, but medicos are now seeing a spike in older age groups.
People struck down with measles usually have a rash and flu-like symptoms.
It begins with the ""prodrome phase"" which lasts about two to four days.
Australia was declared measles-free in 2014, but imported cases are still sometimes diagnosed. So, what does it do to your body, and what sort of threat can it pose to the population?
A person can experience a fever that exceeds 38 degrees Celsius, as well as a cough, runny nose and conjunctivitis — redness and swelling of the eyes.
""Often, patients look quite unwell during this time as well, and then as the illness progresses, the rash starts,"" Dr Raman said.
The measles rash usually begins three to five days after the prodrome phase.
The rash is usually red, and raised, and can be flat. It typically starts on the face, around the hairline, and then spreads down into the neck, the trunk, the arms, legs, and feet.
""[The measles rash] is initially spotty, then merges over time to become blotchy patches. And it's always a little bit trickier to see these spots on patients with darker skin tones,"" Dr Raman said.
Most people struck down with measles recover after taking a couple of weeks of bed rest, plenty of fluids, and some paracetamol to ease the pain and fever.
In some cases, people can develop serious — and potentially fatal — complications such as:
Measles can be a nasty virus, especially for the vulnerable, elderly or immunocompromised.
The Australian Immunisation Handbook recommends vaccination for people born during or since 1966 who have not received the two doses, particularly healthcare workers, childhood educators, and carers.
Dr Raman suggests pregnant women should not get the vaccine but instead speak with their GP.
She said it was important to see a healthcare professional if you suspect you have the measles to prevent its spread.
""This is a highly contagious virus, but it's also important for patients to seek medical attention if they're not feeling quite well.""",Unknown,Tue 13 May

Composting","Lionel Machen had been filling his home vegetable garden with compost from a council-owned organic waste facility for years when he heard rumours it might be contaminated.
Based in Dardanup, about 180 kilometres south of Perth, Bunbury Harvey Regional Council (BHRC) has been turning kerbside food organics and garden organics (FOGO) waste from more than 40,000 South West households into compost for more than a decade.
It then sells the compost back to residents, as well as donating the product to school and community gardens.
The ABC can now confirm samples of the compost tested by the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) in May and October last year contained a group of toxic ""forever chemicals"" called PFAS ""above laboratory detection limits"".
Nick Edwards says contaminated FOGO waste has been a growing issue in recent years. (ABC South West WA: Ella Loneragan)
Mr Machen said the scale of the health risk was unclear but he had started removing the compost from his garden to be safe.
""You can't get any real answers from anyone,"" he said.
The facility stopped selling the compost and ceased all FOGO processing in December.
Local governments have started diverting it to landfill as they explore alternative solutions.
Federal guidelines warn PFAS can bioaccumulate in plants and animals with adverse impacts, and some varieties are recognised internationally as being toxic to humans and wildlife.
PFAS chemicals are now almost impossible to avoid — they are in our cookware, clothes and food packaging, even types that claim to be compostable.
Western Sydney University Adjunct professor of chemistry Roy Tasker said the priority was to minimise any chance of consuming it directly.
He said early studies of animals suggested the chemical was associated with increased rates of cancer, bladder issues, immunological issues and reproductive problems.
""There's sufficient evidence to be concerned about PFAS in our bodies,"" Professor Tasker said.
DWER said the FOGO waste was likely contaminated by household waste and plastics mixed up in green bins before it reached the facility.
Nick Edwards says it's unusual to find larger bits of waste like this in the sifted compost pile. (ABC South West WA: Ella Loneragan)
It said concentrations were generally low but any waste containing detectable levels of PFAS was unsuitable for recycling.
However, it declined to comment on whether people should remove the contaminated product from their gardens.
BHRC chief executive Nick Edwards said while the council stopped selling the compost out of caution he did not think it was unsafe.
He said preliminary results of independent testing commissioned by BHRC had not detected PFAS, though he would not share the name of the company conducting the testing.
""It's important the focus is on the results rather than the company that's doing them,"" he said.
Mr Machen started noticing bits of plastic in the compost he was buying from BHRC. (ABC South West WA: Bridget McArthur)
Mr Edwards said he was committed to reopening as soon as possible but it would take a whole-of-community effort.
The facility has struggled in recent years to manage growing volumes of contaminated waste and is now considering relocating to a new enclosed operation on a neighbouring site.
Mr Edwards said the waste was largely processed manually, then put through an 8-millimetre sieve before being sold.
Mr Machen, who has found several larger items like a plastic toy lion and a roll of sticky tape in the compost, said decontamination measures were clearly falling short.
Jill Cross, a member of the Dardanup Environmental Action Group, said residents were worried by the time PFAS was better understood it would be too late.
Jill Cross is pushing for answers on the potential public health impacts of a local waste management facility. (ABC South West WA: Bridget McArthur)
""It will be in the dust which will blow onto agricultural land and into Dardanup town site,"" she said.
""It will blow on people's roofs, into their water tanks.""
Ms Cross said she wanted better site regulation and more regular updates on contamination risks.
In 2016, BHRC successfully pushed back on several aspects of DWER's proposed composting standards, including the mandate that organic processing facilities be enclosed to prevent the spread of pollutants and minimise methane emissions.
In 2023, it was found in breach of safe composting standards, posing a contamination risk to surrounding waterways.

When asked if BHRC had since complied with required changes, DWER said it could not comment as the council was the subject of an ""ongoing investigation"".
Mr Edwards told the ABC the facility met some but not all of the requirements by the deadline and was working with DWER on the remainder.
Meanwhile, Professor Tasker called for stronger national regulations to prevent the use of PFAS in any products in the first place.",Unknown,Tue 13 May
https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2025-05-13/miscarriage-early-pregnancy-loss-national-guidelines-australia/105281702,New national guidelines for miscarriage and early pregnancy loss released,"Topic:
Pregnancy and Childbirth","Australia's first comprehensive national guidelines for the treatment of early pregnancy loss have been welcomed by women's health experts.
The clinical guidelines, developed by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG), are designed to provide a benchmark for best practice medical care.
""We don't actually have a standard of care for miscarriage in Australia because every health service does something slightly different and every clinician probably does something slightly different,"" Nisha Khot, obstetrician and president-elect of RANZCOG, said.
There are now Australian clinical guidelines for the treatment of miscarriage. Hear more on the Health Report.
Early pregnancy loss is common in Australia; it's estimated up to one in four pregnancies end in miscarriage, and more than 100,000 couples are affected by miscarriage every year.
The clinical guidelines, published in late April, provide recommendations for the treatment of miscarriage, recurrent miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy up to 14 weeks gestation.
Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg implants and grows outside the uterus.
Dr Khot said in addition to providing health professionals with up-to-date evidence on the medical and surgical management of pregnancy loss, the guidelines were about ensuring empathy was ""central to all the care we provide"".
Dr Nisha Khot is president-elect of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. (Supplied)
Among the recommendations is a new definition of recurrent miscarriage, which was previously defined as a woman having three consecutive miscarriages.
""[The new guidelines] have very specifically said that it is two miscarriages and they don't need to be consecutive for women to be able to access further testing to find out the cause,"" Dr Khot said.
Isy Oderberg, co-founder of the Early Pregnancy Loss Coalition, said the guidelines would go a long way to supporting women and families who experience early pregnancy loss.
""The time to just tell patients to go home and try again is over,"" Ms Oderberg said.
""We need to offer patients proper care, proper oversight, let them know they're not alone, and not compound any grief they are already feeling with substandard care or a lack of empathy.""
Ms Oderberg, who had seven miscarriages on her way to having two living children, said miscarriage care varied significantly across the country and often came down to luck.
""There are times when you go and seek care and you have an incredible, empathetic, knowledgeable clinician who can give you the right guidance and treat you well, both from a medical point of view but also in terms of empathy,"" she said.
""But there are many, many horror stories.
""It varies wildly and it gets worse when the person is from a marginalised or minority group, or if they're in a regional or rural area.""
Culturally, there has long been a discomfort around early pregnancy loss, she said, which has contributed to poor understanding of patients' needs and how to best support them.
""We've seen a lot of doctors be dismissive … because it's just seen as a natural part of the reproductive cycle, which to some extent it is, but that doesn't lessen the grief.""
A global review of evidence in 2021 found the impact and consequences of miscarriage were ""underestimated"". It called for a comprehensive overhaul of the medical care and advice offered to women who have miscarriages.
The new Australian guidelines recommend that communication with patients is ""clear, empathetic and respectful"" and that health professionals take care with terminology and use of certain phrases when discussing early pregnancy loss.
""If the patient refers to their loss as a baby, [doctors] have to take that lead and refer to it in the same way,"" Ms Oderberg said.
""It compounds a patient's grief if they don't take that lead, and use words like 'spontaneous abortion', which is still commonly used by a lot of doctors.""
In 2024, the federal government committed $9.5 million to miscarriage support and research, including funding a scoping study for a national miscarriage data collection.
Ms Oderberg said it was important to understand where early pregnancy loss occurred, who was most affected, and whether rates were increasing.
Sydney's Royal Hospital for women helps other parents who are experiencing perinatal loss.
""The reason we need miscarriage data is because you can't create any sort of health policy without knowing who you're creating it for, where they are, how many people need the service … it's a fundamental plank of any decent policy.""
The Early Pregnancy Loss Coalition is now hoping to develop a national miscarriage road map, similar to the National Stillbirth Action and Implementation Plan, in order to look long-term at patient pathways, quality of care, and research funding.
""A lot of what happens in this space of early pregnancy loss is not well understood because it is not well researched,"" Dr Khot said.
""That is because there hasn't been funding for research in this area.""
In addition to further research, she said more psychological support was needed for women and families experiencing early pregnancy loss.
""Whether that be counselling or mental health support, these are things women should have access to without additional costs.""

While the most controversial aspects of the bill were stripped out in the upper house last week, Labor and Coalition MPs will still be granted a conscience vote on what Premier Chris Minns says is a ""vexed issue"".
The bill, introduced by upper house Greens MP Amanda Cohn, aims to expand women's access to abortion by allowing nurse practitioners to supply medication to terminate pregnancies, up to nine weeks' gestation.
Endorsed midwives would also be allowed to supply the medication, known as MS-2 Step.
Under the changes, endorsed midwives would be allowed to supply abortion medication MS-2 Step. (ABC News: Lani Oataway)
Amendments to the bill specify that nurse practitioners and midwives must be acting within their scope of practice. In other words, they must have the necessary training and skills.
Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT have already allowed a similar expansion of services.
The move to expand access to abortion drugs is in line with the recommendations of a review into abortion legislation published last year.
Access to abortion services in regional areas also became a hot topic in November when Orange and Queanbeyan hospitals temporarily stopped performing some surgical termination procedures.
As part of an ABC investigation, almost 20 clinicians and health professionals privately raised concerns that conscientious objection was being used to obstruct access to abortion care in NSW.
The bill was introduced by upper house Greens MP Amanda Cohn. (ABC Sydney: Andrew Whitington)
Under Dr Cohn's initial bill, doctors with moral objections to abortion would be legally required to refer a patient to another practitioner who would provide the service.
However, that proposal did not have enough support in the upper house and has now been removed.
Opponents argued that forcing conscientious objectors to actively refer patients to abortion services went too far.
While that section has now been stripped out of the bill, it was a major focus of a large anti-abortion protest outside parliament last week, which was also attended by religious leaders.
Former prime minister Tony Abbott told the crowd Dr Cohn's proposal represented a ""fundamental assault on freedom of conscience"".
Tony Abbott attended a Sydney rally in opposition to the bill. (Facebook: Tony Abbott)
The premier also described it as a ""step too far"".
""I wouldn't have supported it under any circumstances,"" he said on Monday.
""I think that would have actually driven some doctors out of the profession, the exact opposite of what we need.""
Dr Cohn's original bill also sought a legal requirement for abortion services to be provided within a ""reasonable distance"" of people's homes wherever they live in the state.
Chris Minns says the original bill would have driven doctors out of the system. (ABC News)
Opponents of that proposal argued it was unworkable to legislate such a guarantee, especially when cardiac and cancer care did not get the same treatment.
That section was also removed from the bill, as was a proposal to scrap some mandatory reporting requirements for abortions.
The Coalition and Labor will let their MPs vote according to their own beliefs, and it is expected the pared-back bill will pass.
The premier said it was Labor policy to allow conscience votes on any questions surrounding abortion.
The Coalition and Labor have allowed a conscience vote for their MPs. (Facebook: Parliament of NSW)
""Breaking up party discipline is not something leaders are ordinarily in favour of, but in the right context … you have to exercise your own ethics and your own conscience,"" Mr Minns said.
""Sometimes conscience votes are criticised, but often they get quite thoughtful contributions.""
With most of the wider bill stripped away, the premier said he would support nurse practitioners and endorsed midwives supplying abortion drugs.

Despite his rare diagnosis, she said there was a stark lack of understanding of her now 25-year-old son's disability.
Kids are rarely diagnosed for FASD until they're in the criminal justice system. But with the right support, they can thrive.

FASD is a lifelong disability resulting from alcohol exposure during pregnancy.
People with FASD can struggle with attention, memory and regulating emotions or behaviours.
They can be impulsive, easily misled and struggle to grasp consequences.
There is currently no accurate data for FASD prevalence in Australia.
But international studies indicate up to 5 per cent of children in Western countries have the condition.

Until now, there have not been any national clinical guidelines for the condition in Australia.
But today, a new suite of approved guidelines to help assess and diagnose FASD has been released.
Dr Spiller said it was a significant step forward.

Natasha Reid, a clinical psychologist from the University of Queensland's Child Health Research Centre, led the four-year research project to develop the guidelines.
Involving more than 40 organisations, the project saw researchers complete a ""comprehensive review"" of people's lived experiences with FASD assessment.
They also examined more than 300 research papers, in a ""world-first"" evidence review.
Finally, they extensively consulted with more than 120 health professionals, researchers and cultural experts, as well as families and carers of people living with FASD.

Dr Reid said while an Australian guide to FASD diagnosis was developed in 2016, this was the first set of clinical practice guidelines in the country.
This meant they were developed using a ""rigorous process"" through the National Health and Medical Research Council.
She hoped this ""really high standard"" would give more clinicians the ""confidence"" to diagnose FASD.

To get a FASD diagnosis, a person needs to be assessed by a neuropsychologist, paediatrician, speech pathologist and occupational therapist.
While there are ""one-stop shop"" FASD clinics across the country, they are metro-based and can have ""extensive"" waitlists.
But Dr Reid said the guidelines would allow a more ""flexible"" approach to diagnosis.

While Dr Spiller welcomed the guidelines, she said health practitioners must be properly trained in how to use them.

Food and Drink","Kava smuggling into the Northern Territory's remote Indigenous communities is on the rise, with local leaders fearing the black market price of the drink is draining family finances and fuelling social problems.
Police and Indigenous leaders say the amount of kava being smuggled into communities has surged in the years since the Morrison government relaxed import restrictions on the beverage.
Commercial imports of kava, a drink with sedative effects widely used in Pacific Islands, resumed in 2021 as part of a diplomatic push to strengthen Australia's relations in the region.
But it remains banned in the NT due to its past misuse in some parts of Arnhem Land.
Kava has been smuggled into Arnhem Land for decades.  (Reuters: David Gray)
Kava has been smuggled into the region's communities since the 1990s, but the illicit trade slowed following a federal government ban on commercial imports in 2007, before import restrictions were subsequently watered down.
Now, local community leaders say smuggling is on the rise again — and there are fears the trade is draining family finances, with illicit powdered kava costing up to $1,000 per kilogram.
""Those people who smuggle kava find there's a bit of pocket money that they create, but it doesn't help the people out here,"" Yingiya Guyula, who represents the Arnhem Land electorate of Mulka in the NT's legislative assembly, said.
Yingiya Guyula has warned kava smuggling is impacting families in Arnhem Land.  (ABC News: Peter Garnish)
Mr Guyula said there had been an increase in social problems caused by excessive use of the exorbitantly priced, black market kava.
Acting Sergeant Nicholas Mitchell, from the NT Police Force dog operations unit, said police were intercepting more kava bound for remote communities, with ""an uptick"" in seizures over the past six months.
Five busts during that time involved quantities ranging from 120 to 250 kilograms of kava.
Northern Territory reports rise in kava smuggling | Pacific Beat
With kava being sold for up to $1,000 per kilogram on the black market — 20 times what it costs outside the NT — criminals were trying to chase big profits, Acting Sergeant Mitchell said.
Kava is sold commercially in Australia as a soluble powder — made from the roots of kava plants found throughout Pacific Islands — and importers require a permit.
The drink, which has huge traditional significance in Pacific Islands, has now become a commercial product, with kava bars appearing as far away as New York.
For more than a decade, the only way to bring kava into Australia was on a flight from a Pacific country where it was grown, with a limit of two kilograms for personal use.

That changed in 2019 when then-prime minister Scott Morrison, during a visit to Vanuatu, announced a dramatic relaxation of the rules as part of his so-called ""Pacific Step-up"" policy to strengthen relations with Pacific nations.
The personal limit was increased to four kilograms, and then in 2021, commercial imports of kava were allowed.
Between 2021 and 2024, more than 400 tonnes of kava were imported from Tonga, Fiji and Vanuatu, according to Food Standards Australia New Zealand.

But experts say it is unclear whether the increase in supply is driving the rise in smuggling to the NT.
Alan Clough, professor of public health at James Cook University, said it was too early to determine a definitive link.

""Just the synchronicity of it makes it highly suspicious, but it would take some really good data and some really good data analysis to draw a conclusion about that,"" he said.
Professor Clough, who has spent decades researching the impacts of kava on communities in Arnhem Land, said the social and economic impact of the illicit kava trade was clear.
""I estimated at one stage, in the Arnhem Land communities, that probably one dollar out of every six dollars that the community had available as cash was going to the illegal kava dealers,"" he said.
Locals and experts say the ban on kava in the Northern Territory has never worked — and that smugglers have continued to bring it into remote communities.
They say with commercial imports likely to continue, it's time to rethink how kava is regulated in the territory.
Mr Guyula said despite the harm, many people saw drinking kava — with its relaxing, slightly euphoric effects — as a less harmful alternative to alcohol and other drugs.

And they want it legalised under community-driven controls.
""For a cost that would keep the family going, still have pocket money for their children and families and food.""
A critic says the commercialisation of the drug is potentially dangerous and culturally insensitive, but others say the ""great alternative to alcohol"" has never been hard to source in the west.
A pilot of the new kava import controls introduced by the Morrison government ended in late 2023.
The relaxed restrictions will continue until the federal government makes a decision on future arrangements, according to the Office of Drug Control.
An evaluation of the pilot found there had been ""positive cultural, social and economic outcomes"" for Pacific Islander communities but there was ""limited evidence available to assess impacts on Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait communities"" and noted further monitoring was required.",Unknown,Tue 13 May

Courts","A nurse who treated Joel Cauchi while he was still medicated for his schizophrenia said she ""vomited"" when she heard he was responsible for the Bondi Junction Westfield stabbing attack.
The mental health nurse monitored Cauchi while he was taking antipsychotic medication for his treatment-resistant schizophrenia at a clinic in regional Queensland between August 2015 and October 2017.
WARNING: This story contains content that readers may find distressing.
Cauchi grew up in Toowoomba, Queensland, but at the time of the attack was experiencing homelessness in Sydney, the court heard.
On Monday, the coronial inquest into the mass stabbing heard Cauchi had been attending the practice monthly for almost a decade, until he was discharged when he moved to Brisbane in March 2020.
Six people were killed when Joel Cauchi went on a stabbing rampage at Westfield Bondi Junction in April, 2024. (ABC News: Monish Nand)
He was then referred back to his general practitioner and did not continue receiving psychiatric care.
The nurse, known as RN2, told the court she ""vomited"", was ""incredibly shocked"" and had a ""visceral response"" when she learned Cauchi had fatally stabbed six people inside the shopping centre on April 13, 2024.
""It really doesn't make any sense.""
The court heard he was weaned off antipsychotic medication entirely in June 2018, and later stopped taking his prescription used to treat his obsessive-compulsive disorder.
RN2 told the court she had never heard of a patient being weaned off the psychotropic medication Cauchi was taking completely, without it being replaced by another.
During the time he was treated by RN2, the dose of his schizophrenia medication was being gradually reduced.
Clinical notes presented to the court reported that Cauchi was feeling ""significantly better"" and saw a reduction in cognitive side effects from the medication over months.
The nurse described him as being ""very conscientious in regard to his mental health"".
""He was quite diligent and monitoring signs of relapse, he didn't want to get unwell … He had anxiety around it.
""He wanted to get the support and make sure he did the right thing.""
A series of warnings are all being considered ""missed opportunities"" in the Bondi Junction stabbing.
The nurse stopped treating Cauchi when she resigned from the practice in 2017 but later returned and was no longer clinically treating the man.
In February 2020, his mother Michele Cauchi called the clinic expressing concerns about her son's behaviour.
Ms Cauchi told the nurse she was worried her son became ""irritable"" when she mentioned that his unit was untidy, and that she was concerned he would become homeless if he moved to Brisbane.
The nurse conceded this was ""potentially"" an early warning sign of relapse and denied he had shown any predisposition to violence.
She said when she told Cauchi's psychiatrist about the conversation with his mother, the doctor ""noted it, but didn't appear overly concerned"".
The inquest later heard from a second mental health nurse who treated Cauchi at the same practice from January 2018 until he was discharged.
The woman, referred to in court as RN3, recalled the former patient suffering insomnia after stopping medication for schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
In November 2019, Cauchi emailed the health clinic asking if his psychiatrist had ""some ideas for a porn-free phone and other devices"".
The following day, Ms Cauchi also sent his psychiatrist an email concerned about her son's mental health.
She said Cauchi was leaving an ""excessive"" number of notes around the house, believing he was under ""satanic control.""
""He isn't doing very well since going off [medication] and I know you thought that it wasn't having any effect but I have noticed a gradual decline in his condition,"" his mother wrote.
""I would like to see him being able to successfully live independently and be doing as well as he was a year ago when he first moved out of home.""
Joel Cauchi's mother sent an email to his psychiatrist saying he believed he was under ""satanic control"", the court heard. (Supplied)
When RN3 was asked if it appeared the man was hearing voices at the time, she agreed.
Shortly after, the nurse spoke to Cauchi recommending that he resume taking medication for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Patient records revealed Cauchi's father was ""adamant that he did not want his son to go on medication as it will kill him"".
""[His] father spoke that he himself had been traumatised by demons when awake and hears voices and is not on medication"", the nurse wrote.
The nurse said she was ""surprised"" to learn Cauchi had been discharged without follow-up from another mental health service.
She also accepted he became ""lost"" in the system after moving to Brisbane.
RN3 echoed RN2's sentiments when she told the court she was ""quite shocked"" to find out Cauchi was behind the stabbing.
""The Joel we knew was not the person who did what happened on the 13th of April,"" she said, speaking through tears.
The inquest is expected to run until Friday, May 30.",Courtney Barrett Peters,Mon 12 May

Scams and Fraud","A Perth boxer accused of falsely claiming she had cancer to solicit more than $37,000 in donations does not know how to pay the money back, a WA court has heard.
Tara Michelle Enoka was last year charged with gaining benefit by fraud, after an online fundraiser was set up through GoFundMe in 2021 to assist with treatment costs.
In a video posted to YouTube from the 'Stand with Tara' channel, Enoka claimed she was battling breast and cervical cancer.
Tara Enoka made a public plea for donations on YouTube.  (YouTube)
""My whole life I've never been the type of person that's ever asked anybody for help, and in the last couple of weeks, I've learned it's okay to ask for help,"" she said in the video.
""We are fundraising, we are raising the money to help pay for the treatments that I need to potentially save my life, so that I can be here for my kids to watch them grow up.""
The video has more than 2,000 views, with a page description stating the channel was set up to raise money for Enoka's treatment, and to ""track her journey"".
In January Enoka pleaded guilty to the downgraded charge of possession of stolen or unlawfully obtained property.
She had been due to be sentenced on Monday but this did not occur, with Enoka's defence counsel telling the Magistrates Court in Joondalup the 36-year-old was unsure how to comply with an order to surrender the stolen property.
The court heard she had received the order two months ago, and was eager to start making payments to mitigate any sentence the court imposed, but hadn't received any direction on how to do so.
A GoFundMe spokesperson said the organisation was aware of the matter, and all donors have been refunded.
""GoFundMe has a zero tolerance policy for misuse of our platform and cooperates with police investigations of those charged with wrongdoing,"" the spokesperson said.
""All donors to the fundraiser in question were refunded in June 2024, under GoFundMe's Giving Guarantee, after charges were laid against the beneficiary.""
Magistrate Raelene Johnston said the matter was serious, and imprisonment was a possibility.

She said the court would require the cash to be forfeited before Enoka's next court appearance, or for her to provide evidence showing how she intended to pay.
The charge carries a maximum penalty of two years in jail or a fine of $24,000.
Enoka is due to appear in court again in August, with the court hearing she was unable to attend earlier due to her participation in an overseas fight event.
She spoke only to confirm her name, and did not address the media outside court.

Disabilities","A mother and her son with a disability waited two hours for an access taxi before a Good Samaritan drove them to an Adelaide hospital.
Eleven-year-old Oliver, who uses a mobility aid, travelled from Toowoomba to attend a medical appointment at Adelaide Memorial Hospital to wean him off a feeding drip.
His mother Jodie Sandy booked a disability cab from an Adelaide CBD hotel they were staying at, but on Monday morning the ride never arrived.
Ms Sandy said she made desperate calls to three taxi services but received text messages that no access cab driver was available.
Jodie Sandy says her experience of getting an access cab in Adelaide is appalling. (ABC News: Che Chorley)
As the appointment time came and went, Ms Sandy rang ABC Radio Adelaide after waiting two hours for a ride.
""I'm the most casual, relaxed person you'd ever ever meet but this morning has been one horrendous episode,"" she said.
""In my little fit of hot mess, I was called rude, I was called every name under the sun and I said [to the taxi company], 'this service is appalling'.""
The interview was interrupted when Ms Sandy stopped for a truck driver outside the hotel.
""Can you get me to the hospital? With all our gear in the back? You're on radio,"" Jodie was heard speaking to the driver.
""Pull on in, I'll give you $100.
""I did it, I jumped out and he stopped for me,"" she told radio presenters Sonya, Jules and Rory.

The mother said Oliver, who has cerebral palsy and has been unwell since birth, needed to be in Adelaide for an intensive tube wean, which could take one to two weeks.
""This is the best in Australia for a tube wean,"" she said.
""We starved Oliver, in most layman's terms, to help him to orally feed so his brain switches in and goes, 'My tummy is hungry, I'm going to put something in my mouth try and chew and swallow safely so I don't have to be fed by the peg.'
""This will be our fourth go with Oliver, every time we have done it previously because of his medical condition he becomes very unwell, so this was my last crack.""
She estimated she had spent $25,000 to $30,000 for the medical procedures.
Oliver still managed to see a doctor on Monday despite the transport issues, Ms Sandy said.
Driver Dee Chhoy said he was on his normal route through the city when he noticed Ms Sandy and her son on the street.
""She looked real stressed,"" Mr Chhoy said.

""She was on the phone talking to someone, she was crying.""
Mr Chhoy said he looped back around to ask the woman if everything was alright.

""She was shocked herself that I stopped but I'm sure there's a lot of other people that would have stopped if they saw it,"" he said.
Asked how his passengers enjoyed the ride, Mr Chhoy said with a smile: ""The young fella loved it, kept playing with the steering wheel while I was driving, but I managed.""

Transport Minister Tom Koutsantonis said Ms Sandy's experience was ""outrageous"" and ""completely unacceptable"".
""There's an entire fleet of access cab drivers who keep on telling me over and over again that there's not enough work for them to survive, that they're not getting enough revenue, yet people are somehow waiting up to two hours for an access cab.""
Tom Koutsantonis says the government recently announced a buyback scheme for access cab plates. (ABC News: Lincoln Rothall)
Mr Koutsantonis says despite more than 100 access cab plates being available in Adelaide, the current model is ""broken"".
""Given the subsidies that are in place, some drivers are doing exceptionally well working eight to nine hour shifts, others are finding it hard to get work at all,"" he said.
""What you're finding is there's a two-tier system here where some drivers are doing the right thing, other drivers have bilateral arrangements with their own customers and get preferential.
""Through the preferencing system that we've got in our access cab system which means that you can preference a driver, which means that driver can be off for large parts of a day working on one customer because they have these subsidies.""
Over the years, the SA government has extended a $25 lifting fee for access cab drivers to help passengers with mobility needs.
Earlier this year, legislation passed to allow the government to buy back access cab plates.
""I want to see a model where the incentive by owner-operators is removed and it's a service delivery model rather than a for-profit model by individuals who own a van,"" he said.
Access cab operator Hugo Siu said situations like Oliver's occurred as a ""consequence of policy changes"" which came into place in July last year, along with ""a lack of clear public information"".
He said the system now prioritises SA Transport Subsidy Scheme cardholders over those from interstate which left visitors like Oliver at a ""significant disadvantage"".
""Many Access Cab drivers are deeply frustrated by this outcome,"" Mr Siu said.
""They take pride in serving people with disabilities and mobility needs, and many feel disheartened by the limitations placed on their ability to assist those without SATSS cards.""
He said access cab drivers would be would be ""very keen to engage in constructive dialogue with the government to help design a new Access Cab model — one that is fair, sustainable, and ultimately benefits all users and drivers alike"".
A spokesperson for 13cabs told the ABC the company had been in contact with Ms Sandy.
""We are contacting the passenger to work through what occurred, offer our sincere apologies and ensure that we can help her in the future,"" the spokesperson said.
""The incident highlights a broader issue with accessible transport in Adelaide. We remain committed to working with the South Australian Government as part of its plan to overhaul this sector and ensure events like this no longer occur.
""We hope that any future plan ensures commercial viability while making sure that those who agree to supply these services do so in a way that provides some of our most vulnerable citizens with reliable transport services.""

Brain Tumor","Tasmanian Ken Fleming is a passionate Liverpool FC fan, but there's a piece of memorabilia in his footy collection that evokes bittersweet memories.
On the wall of his home gym in Tranmere near Hobart is a signed edition of former Liverpool footballer Adam Lallana's playing shirt, framed with a letter penned by the footballer in honour of Mr Fleming's son Jack, who died aged 21 of an incurable brain tumour.
Jack was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in 2016, after complaining of a headache and experiencing a seizure. He died 22 months later.
Lallana's letter and signed shirt were in response to an email Jack had partially written to the player, his father's idol, before his death in 2018.
Adam Lallana's signed player's top was framed with a letter he wrote to Mr Fleming about Jack's death. (Supplied)
Mr Fleming discovered it after his son had died and posted it to Lallana with his own letter to honour his son's wishes.
""When I got onto his computer after he died, I found this very poorly written letter to Adam Lallana just saying that my father's doing so much for me,"" Mr Fleming told ABC Hobart.
Jack had been studying commerce/law at the University of Tasmania when he was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive and deadly form of brain cancer.
In his letter to Lallana, Jack asks the football player for some signed memorabilia for his father, who, he writes ""has been helping me tremendously since I got diagnosed"".
""I can honestly say that the only reason I have survived over 12 months is because of him.""
Jack Fleming died of brain cancer at the age of 21. (Supplied)
He told Lallana the memorabilia would be a surprise for his dad, though Mr Fleming learned later that his wife and brothers knew about it.
""Jack was an extremely bright kid at uni and doing extremely well. But towards the end as the cancer took over, it scrambled his brain,"" Mr Fleming said.
""The letter was very poorly constructed. But clearly, I could see the set-up and what he was trying to do.
""I sent it to Adam, added my context and Adam sent back the shirt which I've since framed with the most beautiful letter saying that he would keep the letter in his locker, you know, just to remind him he had two boys, and he knew what I was going through.
""So it meant a lot.""
In his return letter, Lallana tells Mr Fleming how deeply Jack's letter had affected him and promises ""to keep Jack's letter in my locker at the training ground for the entire season"".
Lallana wrote back to say that he would keep Jack's letter in his locker. (AP: Peter Byrne)
""I am a father of two young boys — so my immediate thoughts are those of a fellow parent,"" he writes.
""His inspirational words will provide me with an ongoing reminder of his courage, but also the responsibility we have as professional footballers to give everything always, because of the love and support of people like your Jack.
""With love and compassion, You'll Never Walk Alone.""
Mr Fleming said he was moved to tears by Lallana's words.
""I didn't know if I would get a response, but I wanted to honour Jack's wishes. Then Adam wrote back with this beautiful letter; it was a very cathartic moment.""
In the months following his son's death, Mr Fleming reached out to other public figures including former US president Joe Biden whose son Beau had died of a glioblastoma brain tumour a few years earlier, and US senator John McCain before he likewise died in 2018 from the disease.
He also shared his son and family's experience in the book, Jack's Story: The life and death of Jack Fleming, and has advocated for new brain cancer treatments and research.
""Both Joe Biden and senator John McCain wrote back to me,"" Mr Fleming said.
""It's about connecting with like souls and understanding their grief and pain. It's about trying to find sanity in a world that's gone mad.
""I never thought this would happen to any of my children. Our life changed; there were no more rules after Jack died.""
Former US president Joe Biden wrote to Mr Fleming about the death of Jack. (Supplied)
On June 5, 2018, Senator McCain thanked Mr Fleming for sending him a copy of Jack's Story, and in December that year Joe Biden also replied.
""As you know glioblastoma cancer has touched my life and those that I love dearly,"" Mr Biden wrote.
""Our sons gave us so much more than they knew, so much for us to cherish.""
Senator McCain said he appreciated ""the bravery it took to write this book about what it is really like inside a life with a glioblastoma multiforme"".
Also known as GBM, glioblastoma multiforme is the deadliest form of brain cancer; it is fast growing and can strike at any age.
Former Australian of the Year Professor Richard Scolyer says he may only have a few months to live as he faces his brain cancer diagnosis.
Former Australian of the Year Richard Scolyer was diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma in 2023 and took part in experimental immunotherapy treatment, but recently revealed his brain cancer had returned and he had only months to live.
Mr Fleming said the correspondence he had with others affected by GBM, including Adam Lallana, provide some solace during moments of intense grief, ""when all hell breaks out"".
""That was the outcome [of connecting with Lallana], that beautiful shirt and beautiful memories,"" he said.

Aids and HIV","Women living with HIV are calling on medical professionals to normalise HIV testing for women and increase access to support services in regional areas, amid concerns they have been de-prioritised by the health sector.
Human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, spreads through bodily fluids and attacks the body's immune system, increasing a patient's viral load.
It can be treated with medications that reduce and suppress the viral load, meaning the virus no longer poses a risk to a person's health and cannot be transmitted.
But getting treatment begins with diagnosis.
HIV can be tested for through a blood test. (Supplied: Pexels / Amornthep Srina)
New data from the University of New South Wales's (UNSW) Kirby Institute shows over half of the women living with HIV in the Northern Territory and Western Australia were diagnosed late, years after experiencing a deterioration of their health.
Nationally, 38 per cent of women living with the virus are diagnosed late.
Skye McGregor, an epidemiologist at the Kirby Institute specialising in HIV surveillance and research, said women were much more likely to experience late diagnosis of HIV.

She said it could mean someone was unknowingly living with HIV for years, to a point the virus could have seriously damaged their body.
In the 1990s, Del Batton had only heard of HIV in passing.
""Like many people, I always understood it basically was a gay disease and never considered I might be at risk,"" the NT resident said.
Del never thought she would be at risk of contracting HIV. (ABC News: Dane Hirst)
As a busy working mother with a young daughter, it was only when she began the process of IVF that she was tested for the first time.
""The first thing they do when you set out to do IVF is they do a raft of blood tests,"" she said.
""They came back and said 'you have tested positive for HIV'.
""I went sort of, 'wow'.""
Despite battling a month of illness a year before her diagnosis, she said her doctor had not considered a HIV test at the time.
""Why would he?"" Ms Batton said.
""I was happily married, had a four-year-old daughter and was trying to have a second child.""
Del was only tested for HIV when she sought IVF treatment. (ABC News: Dane Hirst)
Almost 20 years on, HIV researchers say the primary routine HIV screening for women is still through antenatal care in pregnancy.
Now an advocate, Ms Batton said reasons women were typically diagnosed late included medical professionals' biases around the virus and women having less access than men to information.
Last year, the ninth national HIV strategy removed women as a priority group for HIV elimination strategies instead grouping them under 'All people living with HIV'.
Dr McGregor said while there were higher rates of HIV in gay and bisexual men, women living with HIV faced unique risks that were not being sufficiently addressed.
She said the lack of testing for women meant their rates of HIV had not decreased as much as it had for men.
Dovato is one of the medications that doctors prescribe to treat patients with HIV. (ABC News: Dane Hirst)
""At a 10-year timeframe we can see that among men, there's been a 36 per cent decrease in HIV diagnosis in this time versus only a 6 per cent decrease among women,"" she said.
Advocates say a large part of the challenge of living with HIV isn't treatment, it's the deeply ingrained stigma that exists in society.
Dr McGregor said women were also under-represented in HIV research, which had impacted the quality of health information available to them.
""We have a lot of work to do around stigma and discrimination,"" she said.
""HIV is still a stigmatised infection, and we need to work further as a society to understand that this really prevents people from getting tested.""
Jane Costello was diagnosed with HIV more than 20 years ago.
She now runs one of Australia's largest support networks for people living with the virus, Positive Living NSW, which provides women-focused support groups.
The groups provide support to women living with HIV in areas like reproductive health, dating, pregnancy and menopause.

The NT has recently taken steps towards starting a women's focused support group, but Ms Batton said it was often difficult to get funding.
Women in other regional and remote areas are also hoping to start groups, but cash flow into HIV support organisations across Australia has run low in recent years.
Ms Costello and Ms Batton are both calling for more funding for HIV support services for women, and more targeted awareness campaigns.

Dengue Fever","A Queensland city that had been declared ""essentially dengue-free"" has recorded its first locally-transmitted case of the mosquito-borne illness in seven years.
Cairns, in the state's far north, used to have yearly outbreaks of dengue fever, including one in 2008-09 which infected nearly 1,000 people.
Then in 2011 the Monash University-owned World Mosquito Program (WMP) started releasing large numbers of dengue-resistant mosquitoes in the city which stopped them spreading the virus to humans.
The last time someone contracted dengue fever in the region was in 2018 on the Atherton Tablelands.
All cases since then were acquired overseas or interstate.
But the Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service (CHHHS) has now confirmed a person who had not travelled outside the region had ""recently"" contracted dengue fever.
It said the patient was in a stable condition and receiving treatment at home.
CHHHS public health director Jacqui Murdoch said the unit was looking into how the person may have become infected.

Dr Murdoch said the risk to the public was low due to high numbers of mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia bacteria in the Cairns region.
Wolbachia increases the mosquitoes' resistance to dengue, thereby reducing their ability to transmit the virus to humans.
Local doctors have been urged to be alert to dengue symptoms and test potential cases for the virus.
Dengue fever occurs in the tropics and sub-tropics worldwide and can be fatal in severe cases.
It causes symptoms including fever, extreme fatigue, intense headache and muscle and joint pain, but some patients suffer internal bleeding, known as haemorrhagic fever, which can cause death.
The World Health Organization recorded more than 13 million dengue cases and 9,990 deaths in 2024.
Since 2011, WMP has released Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the Wolbachia bacteria in the Cairns and Townsville regions and more than a dozen countries.

Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the primary spreaders of dengue, although another species — Aedes albopictus (commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito) — can also carry the virus.
WMP said long-term monitoring showed ""Wolbachia had become self-sustaining at high levels"" and stopped the local transmission of dengue in Cairns and Townsville for many years.
But in January, Townsville recorded its first locally-acquired dengue case in five years and had a cluster of cases in March.
Dr Murdoch said dengue was one of many infections transmitted by mosquitoes in northern Queensland, including Ross River virus, malaria, Barmah Forest virus, and chikungunya.
She said it was important to prevent mosquitoes from biting in the first place by wearing light-coloured, long-sleeved clothing, using repellent containing DEET or picaridin, and reducing breeding sites.",Unknown,Mon 12 May

Doctors attributed the diagnosis to his exposure to carcinogenic materials.
""You never think it's going to happen to you,"" Simon said.
'It's like being slapped in the face with a wet fish. It was pretty hard. I knew as soon as the surgeon said that, that was it.""

Tracie recalled the agony of the long drive home from Box Hill Hospital to Traralgon to tell the couple's three adult children the life-changing news.
""We were trying to find the words to tell our kids,"" she said.
""I was just so broken. I just could not get my head around what they had just said to us, what that actually meant.""

In his technical role with the CFA, Simon worked on major fires across the state, including the fatal Black Saturday and Black Summer bushfires.
His job was to set up all of the gear required at district headquarters and command centres on fire sites, including at the toxic Hazelwood Mine fire in 2014.
But the long-term health implications of what he was being exposed to never crossed his mind.

Simon said incident control staff were provided with standard PS2 masks and PPE gear, while firefighters who went down into the mine were issued with breathing apparatus.
""I can remember walking into the training building, and there's a corridor that's probably about 20 metres long, and I couldn't see halfway down the corridor,"" he said.
The Lund family initially kept Simon's diagnosis private, keeping their minds busy with work.
Overwhelmed with feelings of grief and dread, they navigated the bleak practicalities of treatment plans, palliative care, updating wills, and sorting out superannuation.
The Firefighters' Presumptive Rights Compensation and Fire Services Legislation Amendment (Reform) Act 2019 ensures Victorian firefighters who are diagnosed with certain cancers are entitled to compensation.
His treating oncologist found there was a ""sufficient probability"" that Simon's exposure to smoke, fumes, ash and dust from fires, including chemical fires and significant coal mine fires, had ""at least partly contributed to his risk of developing gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma"".
But as he was employed in an IT role, Simon was not eligible for presumptive rights.

His initial WorkCover claim was rejected and, as his health declined, Simon found himself burdened with the administrative nightmare of having to prove that he had physically attended fires and been exposed to carcinogenic risk.
That involved gathering evidence such as 25 years' worth of photos, pay slips, call-out records, and information on fire conditions to support his second WorkCover claim.
It was a traumatic and exhausting exercise that cost Simon and Tracie much of the precious time they had left together.

Finally, with the help of lawyers, Simon's WorkCover claim was accepted.
But the challenges he encountered in proving his claim would motivate the Lund family to campaign for presumptive legislation to be expanded to include professional, technical, and administrative CFA employees.
A spokesperson for the state government said it would continue to monitor whether Victoria's presumptive compensation legislation appropriately reflected the increased risks some emergency service workers could face due to their service.
Last month, Simon was presented with a National Service Medal from the Governor-General for his service with the CFA.

The Lunds were overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and offers of support from their Latrobe Valley community after Simon's diagnosis.
""Some days we are OK, sometimes we're really focused, almost like warriors, thinking we're going conquer this, we're going to change the legislation, everything is going to be alright,"" Simon said earlier this month.
""And then there are other days where we physically can't get out of bed.""

Earlier this year Simon fulfilled a lifelong dream, purchasing a Holden SS Crewman ute, which he planned to take out for a spin when he was up to it.
Simon hoped that he and Tracie could go out for an ice-cream date and spin in his ute in their precious time left. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)
""[Simon's] idea of a date was to get me in the ute and drive down to the ice cream shop at Traralgon and buy me ice cream,"" Tracie said.
On advice from a friend, Tracie and Simon also indulged in booking a ""yes"" holiday, making lasting memories with the kids on a trip to New Zealand.
During the holiday, Simon, a former naval officer, enjoyed a bumpy dinner cruise on rough seas, while the rest of the family groaned with seasickness.
""We weren't under cover, it was absolutely freezing, the boat was going up and down, and I'm going, 'I'm absolutely loving this!'"" Simon said.

Simon had been particularly humbled by the people who had reached out in his final months to say what he meant to them.
""The only way our family can make any sense of it is to channel that anger, that despair, the fear and the dread into something positive to try and make some change for all the staff that will come after us,"" Tracie said.
Simon and Tracie Lund spent as much time as they could with each other in Simon's final days. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)
Last week, Simon was in palliative care, his gruelling rounds of cancer treatment having ended.
On Monday, he died surrounded by his family.
""It's with shattered hearts that we share that Simon passed away peacefully in the early hours of this morning,"" Tracie said in a statement.
""Our family is devastated. The grief is enormous, raw, aching and all-consuming.

Mental Wellbeing","Unwind with… is a regular column that explores the simple ways interesting people take care of themselves through periods of change or upheaval.
Dimity May is a seedling grower who lives on the edge of Glaziers Bay in south-east Lutruwita/Tasmania. with her partner, Mark Egan, and two sons.
Dimity May says it's been rewarding watching the property she purchased with her partner ""come back to life"". (Supplied: Dimity May)
After the birth of her second son, the 42-year-old left her marketing and communications job in Canberra, on the land of the Ngunnawal people, to pursue her small business.
""That little window of time where I was out of work and not earning my usual salary gave us the space to think about it, but also to take that leap.""
Her passion for gardening began during the maternity leave she took with her first son. Her children are now aged 9 and 6.
Dimity says growing seedlings was possible in her small backyard and she didn't intend for it to become a business.
When it did, she ran it for three years, before the family relocated to southern Tasmania after 10 years in Canberra.
""It's funny because everyone we know here had this sort of vague idea that we've moved to the country for a quieter life … and all of a sudden you're busier than ever, but for me anyway it's really fulfilling and incredibly rewarding,"" she says.
Dimity May says the family sets time aside to spend together, such as an afternoon at their beach spot. (Supplied: Dimity May)
We were sort of in limbo in Canberra. We were trying to find land [to buy] but were pretty much priced out.
During her first stint of maternity leave, Dimity says she ""became obsessed with growing"" as a hobby. (Supplied: Dimity May)
We started looking further afield and Tassie was always really appealing for a whole number of reasons, but it's harder to get work down here for my partner. He was applying for all sorts of things and got offered a job in Hobart.
The place we ended up buying we just saw on the market and jumped at it. We'd barely been to the little town that's closest, barely looked at the house.
We've been really lucky, considering how little thought we put into it. It's just sort of the perfect place to land.
Knowing the level of fulfilment I get from the work, versus the work that I was doing before, was just such a strong drive.
It's so much more rewarding and not just for me, certainly not financially, but in terms of the lifestyle that it's brought to our family.
Gardening and being immersed in nature and having your hands in the soil also brings real mood-lifting benefits.
That's probably been the biggest challenge. Moving to a property there are so many jobs, and they all feel really pressing and really expensive.
Dimity's partner Mark Egan and their two sons. (Supplied: Dimity May)
We've struggled with that balance, and not just spending the weekend powering through and basically ignoring the kids.
We've had to be more intentional about how we spend our time.
We dedicate time away from the property. Whether it's a weekend away, going out for a bushwalk, or to the beach for the day. We've got a beautiful little swim spot near us.
Without the structure of a normal working day … It can get really blurry.
A big thing has been making time to eat well. I'm shocking for running around and shoving something in so at least you're not hungry anymore.
But, it's such a fundamental part of whether you feel good or not. I'm trying to really prioritise that and actually stop, cook meals and sit.
I love going out in the evening at that sort of sunset time and doing the easy jobs.
There's still a lot of stuff to do, but I'll always do the ""cheat"" things, like watering the garden, picking flowers or a bit of gentle weeding.
Just taking it all in and soaking up that time.

Heart Disease","West Australian farmer Nigel Norwood survived a cardiac arrest thanks to the calm and informed actions of his wife, teenage sons and fellow campers.
The 47-year-old father of two came perilously close to losing his life during a camping trip at Alexander Bay, a pristine beach about 100 kilometres from the nearest hospital in Esperance.
Now, the Scaddan farmer and his family are urging others to have their heart health checked.
Nigel was revived thanks to his sons Liam, left, and Bevan. (Supplied: Lynne Norwood)
Lynne Norwood said there had been no obvious signs to suggest that something was wrong with her husband's heart.
But about 6pm on January 28 everything happened all at once.
""We'd been out on the beach all afternoon and we were about to get ready for dinner,"" she said.
""Both boys said to me 'Mum, Mum, something's wrong with Dad'.
""By this stage his head had fallen forward. He was unresponsive.""
With no mobile coverage, Mrs Norwood ran to access another camping party's Starlink satellite.

Meanwhile 16-year-old Liam, aided by a bystander, performed CPR on his father.
The eldest son Bevan, 19, raced to retrieve a St John defibrillator from the toilet block.
""Everything was going through my mind,"" Mrs Norwood said.
""The visual side of things was very confronting.""
After the third shock from the defibrillator there was ""massive elation"" when they felt a pulse.
""Nigel was placed into the recovery position and we could visually see that he'd become responsive and things were starting to significantly improve,"" Mrs Norwood said.
Mr Norwood was taken to Esperance Hospital and then flown to Fiona Stanley in Perth.
After several weeks of recovery he was now feeling ""fine"".
""It's like it never happened,"" he said.
Nigel says his recovery is going well but he's not taking things for granted. (Supplied: Lynne Norwood)
His few remaining memories from the dramatic afternoon include catching a herring and walking to the toilet block.
However, he said his brush with death had given him a timely reminder to ""live in the now"".
He urged others to ""go and have a check-up"", acknowledging the specific dangers facing farmers who often worked alone in areas where mobile reception was limited.
Mrs Norwood stressed the importance of knowing the difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest.
""We were conveyed to Perth … thinking that Nigel had a heart attack,"" she said.
""It wasn't until all the tests came back clear that the medical staff said it was cardiac arrest.
""When your heart stops you just need to get it going again.
There are 11,000 St John defibrillators across WA locations. (ABC News: Hayden Smith)
She also emphasised the importance of having first-aid training while being aware of the locations of portable St John defibrillators.
St John WA paramedic and resuscitation improvement specialist Jason Belcher said it was a remarkable success story.
""Nigel would unequivocally not have survived without the efforts of family and bystanders,"" he said.
St John has 11,000 registered defibrillators across Western Australia.
It has been an eventful time for the Norwood family. (Supplied: Lynne Norwood)
If it was not for the attention he paid during a recent first-aid course at his Perth high school Liam Norwood is adamant his father would not be alive today.
""Dad wouldn't be sitting next to me if it wasn't for that training,"" he said.
Bevan Norwood told the ABC it was as though his father had ""fallen asleep"" in his camp chair.
""We instantly knew something wasn't quite right,"" he said.

""They are busy, rambunctious, but I wouldn't change it,"" she laughs.
WARNING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains the name of a child who has died.
Cherisse's youngest, Angus, is now five, and she is also known as mum to her partner's twins — Douglas and Dylan — who she's raised since they were about four.
""They beautifully acknowledge that they have two mums.""
Cherisse thought she may never have children, now she is mother to three boys. (ABC: Grenville Turner)
But this picture is missing Senna — a child who came too early and died too soon after birth.
""I love to say her name, I love to speak about her memory,"" Cherisse said.
Senna was named after the legendary Formula One race car driver, but it also happens to be the name of a beautiful yellow flower.
""I love to share the story of how she was born and how she's been in our lives. And the boys love talking about it and acknowledge that they have a sister.""
Mother's Day took on new meaning when Cherisse Buzzacott lost her baby girl at 22 weeks. (ABC: Grenville Turner)
The Arrernte midwife recalls that in her 20s, before she became a mum, people would ask, ""When is it your turn?""
She felt the weight of expectation as women around her would have multiple babies in the time she was trying for one.
Over eight years she would have four miscarriages — one while receiving an award on stage for being a midwife.
When baby Senna was born prematurely at 22 weeks, she died soon after.
""I was that person that was having grief and loss, but I was supporting some of the happiest times for people,"" she said.
""I always thought if I never have a baby, and this is my life, then this is what I do. I help other women have babies.""
Now, watching Angus swinging on the monkey bars, she reflects on the hardships she's overcome and the happiness that lay on the other side.
""Having my son has just been everything that I imagined, but also so much better,"" she said.
""I've had all these experiences, and I've waited this long, and I finally got him.""

Whadjuk Noongar journalist Narelda Jacobs now spends her mornings in Sydney with her eight-week-old baby Sanna strapped to her chest, walking around the neighbourhood to give her partner a break at home.
As the mum of a 30-year-old, Narelda always thought she would have more kids, but the opportunity never presented itself — until now.
Narelda is on day duty while her wife Karina, who has been up and down all night feeding, sleeps.
""While Karina is the one that gave birth and is breastfeeding, everything we do, we're doing together.""
Narelda first became a mum at 19 years old with her daughter Jade. The pregnancy wasn't planned, and she says she still had so much to learn about the world.
Narelda was very excited for her first daughter Jade to meet her baby sister Sanna for the first time.  (Supplied: Narelda Jacobs)
""I had fallen pregnant out of wedlock … It was a shotgun wedding when I married Jade's dad, there was also some shame associated with being pregnant.""
The marriage only lasted a few months, and she found herself a single mum.
""Jade is loved an enormous amount. It didn't impact the amount of the love I have for her, it is just very different experiences now and you can't compare them.""
All these years later Narelda has forged a successful television career, and after marrying Karina last year, she said there is no shortage of love this time around either.
""Everyone should have two mums,"" Narelda laughs.
""There are two mums changing a nappy, there are two mums getting a new outfit, there are two mums bathing the baby … How lucky is this kid?""
Narelda Jacobs has taken a year off to spend time with her new baby girl.  (Supplied: Narelda Jacobs)
Sanna is named after Finland's youngest ever prime minister, Sanna Marin. Narelda said the former leader was everything they aspire their daughter to be.
""We've just really loved watching her be more observant and more aware of the world around her,"" Narelda gushed.
But when they announced Sanna's birth on social media, Narelda said the nasty comments outnumbered the good ones.
""People are often surprised when they learn that homophobia exists.
""How great for you that you don't ever have to experience homophobia but for us it's an everyday thing online.""
The pair decided to create what they've called a ""satirical picture book for adults"". Titled 'If Queers Weren't Meant to Have Kids', it's due to be released later this year.
""We hope that it will challenge people's thinking around rainbow families and how they're created, and the importance of including them.""
In turn, they hope by normalising their family, their child will have fewer questions to answer from other kids at day care.
With extended families interstate, Narelda says it's their ""chosen family"" who will rally around with support and are ""dying to babysit"".
""It's like a ready-made village.""
Cherisse said her boys are loved by three big families. (ABC: Grenville Turner)
Cherisse's five-year-old describes Mother's Day as ""about love and kind"" — a precious insight from a boy who rules the roost in their house.
Cherisse and her boys will celebrate the day with kangaroo tail cooked over a fire and will sing songs as the embers burn.
Mother's Day is always ""bittersweet"" for Cherisse, and each year they make a trip to Senna's grave to place toys and trinkets.
Cherisse knows her partner Mica, and her three sons Douglas, Dylan and Angus will spoil her with gifts and food on Mother’s Day. (ABC: Grenville Turner)
""Although I have three amazing sons, I don't have my daughter here with me.
""I'm still able to get up and celebrate, and not kind of sit in sadness, but it is more about that memory and reflection and just talking about it, that, you know, she did exist.""
She explained that not everyone would do what she does, and that culturally just speaking her name wasn't always accepted, but this is right for her.
The midwife, who now works in health advocacy, encourages anyone who has gone through loss and grief to find their own personal way of healing.
""If you are a mum and you've experienced loss, you know loss of your own mum, loss of a baby, loss of a pregnancy, miscarriage, I feel like it's your choice to choose how you spend Mother's Day,"" the midwife said.
""It's not up to other people to determine.""
Narelda says she and Karina have done a lot in a short time — become a couple, got married and have a baby — but she couldn't be happier. (Supplied: Narelda Jacobs)
Narelda Jacobs said her focus will be on ensuring her wife Karina has a great first Mother's Day, but she doesn't expect they will be able to leave the house for long.
""She has done an exceptional job from throughout pregnancy and with the birth experience and now catering for every need of the little one, it's just been a joy to watch, and she does it with loving eyes and just a reassuring voice constantly.""
Mother's Day is one day where Narelda says the value of the unpaid and under-recognised work mums do can be celebrated.
""I'm looking at the blessing that it is to be a mum, to bring to life a new creation.""
After working hard for years, Narelda says the family are taking time out to connect. (Supplied: Narelda Jacobs/ Jade Dolman)
After 25 years as a journalist and presenter on Network 10, Narelda has taken the year off to be present and try to ""slow down"".

Artificial Intelligence","It's been 10 years since Jenny Baird has been able to speak freely to her son.
Like his father before him, Northern Territory man Daniel Lalara has Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), which has slowly stolen his ability to speak and his independence.
Indigenous readers are advised that this article contains the name and image of a person who has died, used with the permission of his family.
But artificial intelligence is now giving him back his voice, with psychologist Damien Howard producing his song, For My Children, after experimenting with AI to combat a steep decline in his ability to communicate.
""It's like bringing 'Daniel' back again,"" Ms Baird said.
""I think it's absolutely brilliant.""
Daniel Lalara wrote For My Children for his daughter Mikaela who has also been diagnosed with MJD. (Supplied: Jenny Baird)
Dr Howard used a series of prompts from Mr Lalara, collating his words with the help of ChatGPT and Suno.AI into an upbeat jazz tune with artificial vocals.
Dr Howard said the key was ""to make sure that what's being expressed is what Dan wants to say"".
""Through the medium [of] music — it is very powerful, very emotional,"" he said.
The final product is a heartfelt, three-and-a-half minute letter to Mr Lalara's teenage daughter, who is herself now coming to terms with her own MJD diagnosis.
When she heard the results, Ms Baird said ""it just blew me away"".
Jenny Baird helped set up the MJD Foundation to help communities grappling with some of the highest rates of the disease in the world. (ABC News: Robert Baird)
""I still get teary and emotional hearing [the song], because I think it's a really wonderful way for someone who can't communicate verbally to be able to communicate with family,"" she said.
Childhood friend Libby Collins was also brought to tears hearing Mr Lalara ""speak"" for the first time in years.
""To hear fully-formed sentences and sentiment from Daniel after such a long time was really lovely to hear,"" she said.
""Daniel is completely cognitive and he just doesn't have the means to physically be able to speak to you.
""So to be able to use AI to afford that possibility to somebody else, is really the best use of AI I can think of.""
Libby Collins says Daniel Lalara ""was the cheeky, run-amok one"" when they were growing up together in Darwin. (Supplied: Jenny Baird)
Through a complicated process with Dr Howard using yes-and-no questions, word prompts and the help of ChatGPT, Mr Lalara was able to write a statement about his experience creating the song.
""When I moved to Darwin for more support I had to rely on support workers who weren't family, they didn't understand me the same way,"" he said.
""People were guessing wrong what I wanted to say — I'd try to correct them, but it was often exhausting.
""Being able to share something so real made me feel proud again, like I was still doing what I needed to do as a father.
""[It] helped me to feel less trapped.""
Growing up between Darwin and Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Ms Collins remembers Mr Lalara as a mall rat, spending endless hours around Darwin's Casuarina Shopping Centre.
""He was the cheeky, run-amok one, the best at hide-and-seek,"" she said.
After leaving school Mr Lalara worked as a ranger at Litchfield National Park but had to resign when symptoms of the disease, which causes nerve cells to prematurely die, began taking over his body and his life.

MJD typically progresses over five to 10 years to a total lack of voluntary muscle control and permanent disability, with no known cure.
Each child of a person with the defective gene has a 50 per cent chance of developing it themselves and the mutation also ""expands"" with each generation, resulting in earlier onset and progression to severe symptoms.
The rate of MJD in some remote NT Indigenous communities is the highest in the world, with recent studies showing almost 1 in 100 people in the Groote Eylandt archipelago carry the defective gene — compared with 1 in 100,000 worldwide.
In 2014, geneticist John MacMillan told the ABC the isolation of remote Aboriginal communities meant the genetic pool remained small and the likelihood of the disease passing to children was increased.
""The combination of geographic isolation, language isolation, cultural and social isolation, when you add them all together will often result in very high frequencies of specific diseases in some specific areas,"" he said.
Daniel Lalara says he feels ""less trapped"" after expressing himself through a song written for his family with the help of AI. (ABC News: Robert Baird)
Ms Collins and Ms Baird are board members of the MJD Foundation, which was set up in response to the territory's shockingly high prevalence of the disease after Ms Baird struggled to care for her husband Warren, who also had MJD.
""There was really no support, it was hit-and-miss and I was navigating who could do this or who could do that,"" she said.
Research into the cause and possible treatment of the disease has accelerated since the foundation was set up in 2008, with researchers from across the globe meeting in Darwin this week to present their work.
Damien Howard says hearing Daniel Lalara's song for the first time was ""very powerful, very emotional"". (ABC News: Robert Baird)
After premiering the song at the conference, Dr Howard said the enthusiasm in the room was palpable, with a number of families approaching him for advice about adopting the technology.
When asked if he is hopeful of using AI to help him ""talk"" in more depth with his friends and family, Mr Lalara gives an enthusiastic nod — and Ms Collins will be there to listen.
""To be able to hear from him and what he's really been thinking and feeling is a special gift through AI, I think,"" she said.
VIDEO - For my children
When I felt the first signs, my steps grew slow, worry settled deep, like water's flow. But I found strength in living true, and that's my hope, my wish for you.
So, my children, go and laugh, and play, hold on to joy in every day. Fish, hunt, and dance — let life shine bright, live each moment with all your might.
I felt anger, and it burned so strong, when my body stopped me from moving along. But with help from family, friend by friend, I learned to try, to find a way to bend.
Ask for help when you need it near, there's no shame — just love right there. Do what makes you feel complete, with support, life's good and sweet.
Some feel alone, feel set apart, but family holds us, heart to heart. We stand together, strong and true, and that's my gift, my strength for you.
I know the fears, the path ahead, I'll listen close to what's unsaid. I've walked these steps, I feel your fight, and I'll stand with you, day and night.
I learned to feel for others' pain, to show kindness like soft rain. But for myself, I found I had to care, to treat myself with love that's fair.
My children, love yourselves each day, and live your lives in your own way. Ask for what you need to grow, there's beauty in you — just let it show.","Robert Baird, Tilda Colling",Sun 11 May

Health","After years of drastic, unexplained mood swings in the lead-up to her period, a Perth mother was handed a lifeline in the form of a four-letter diagnosis.
Kris Stanley, 36, went to the doctor in 2021 when she started feeling suicidal every month.
The appointment was the first time she had heard of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, commonly known as PMDD.
""It was like someone had turned the lights on,"" she said.
""It was almost liberating … to have something to research, to sink your teeth into.
Kris Stanley was diagnosed with PMDD in 2021 and wants to make more women aware of the condition.  (ABC News: Grace Burmas)
Among other symptoms, PMDD can cause severe depression and anxiety during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, due to a sensitivity to the natural changes in hormones.
Kris would try to push through this quick onset of depression and helplessness for the sake of her family.
""As a mum we don't always get the opportunity to put the rest of life on hold,"" she said.
""We always have to overcome and be as strong as we can be.
""I'm a pretty strong person but PMDD has definitely brought me down a few times.""
When she got her diagnosis, it gave her license to talk openly with her sons and partner about what was really going on, teaching them not only about PMDD, but the phases of the menstrual cycle in general.
She said it's a topic not worth sugar coating.
Kris Stanley says she talks openly about PMDD with her family.  (ABC News: Grace Burmas)
""I like to give the boys a heads up so they can be a little bit more understanding,"" Kris said.
""The more information they're armed with and the more empathetic they can be as humans and as men towards their loved ones, then hopefully we can get a little bit more understanding for women in general when they're going through something that is pretty full on.""
Thousands of Australian women deal with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD, and symptoms can include extreme mood changes, depression and anxiety.
Dr Niamh Leonard was the general practitioner and women's health specialist who identified Kris's symptoms as PMDD.
She has noticed a steady rise in diagnoses over the past few years and a peak in patients aged 35 and older.
""It's a time when women often have young families, maybe getting back into the workforce or trying to further their careers and are really unable to function properly,"" she said.
""It's a very difficult age and time.""
Dr Niamh Leonard says there has been a rise in PMDD diagnoses over the past few years.  (ABC News: Grace Burmas)
There's a suite of reasons that could explain why people are often diagnosed later in their reproductive life.
Dr Leonard said it could be a link to perimenopause or the fact the condition was only recognised as a psychological disorder just over a decade ago.
But she said the cultural issues surrounding women's health cannot be ignored.
""Many women have masked for so long,"" Dr Leonard said.
""Women in general just try to push through and sometimes they're afraid to speak about how dark their thoughts are at times.

Crime","Police have seized more than a tonne of cocaine worth over $600 million after allegedly finding the drugs on a boat off the New South Wales Mid North Coast.
Officers intercepted the vessel about nine nautical miles off the coast of Nambucca Heads on Friday morning.
They allegedly found more than 1,000 bricks of cocaine, weighing just over a tonne in total.
They estimate the drugs have a street value of $623 million and would constitute more than a million individual doses.
Police said the origin of the drugs was still being investigated.

Police were alerted to the operation when a motor cruiser boat was purchased for $500,000 with cash in Sydney's Sutherland Shire last month.
Police said they tracked the vessel north along the coast, while monitoring the communications and movements of those associated with the purchase.
Two men, aged 24 and 26, were arrested on board the boat and three others were arrested in a vehicle near South West Rocks.

Police also executed search warrants in homes around Newcastle, seizing electronic devices, documents and cash.

AFP Assistant Commissioner Stephen Dametto described the incident as a ""sophisticated criminal plot"".
""Allegedly collecting hundreds of kilograms of cocaine at sea shows the length organised crime will go to for their own greed and profit,"" he said.
""Australia's vast coastline is attractive to organised crime groups, who attempt to exploit this by trying to import drugs using boats.

Pharmaceuticals","A shortage of the weight-loss drug Ozempic to treat type 2 diabetes has opened up new markets for the Tasmanian alkaloid poppy sector.
It's the shot in the arm northern Tasmanian pharmaceutical business Extractas Bioscience needed.
For nearly a decade the poppy processor has struggled with a global oversupply of narcotic material for painkillers, because of a crackdown on opioid prescriptions and cuts to elective surgeries during the COVID pandemic.
But in the past two years there's been a noticeable shift in sales.
A worldwide shortage of diabetes medicine Ozempic — driven by an unexpected increase in demand for off-label prescribing for weight loss — is partly responsible.
Extractas Bioscience produces many base pharmaceutical ingredients from its poppies, not just the materials that go into oxycodone painkillers.
Some of those ingredients are highly sought after for medications that suppress appetite.
Ross Murdoch says new markets are opening up for Tasmanian poppy products. (ABC News: Laurissa Smith)
""We're seeing an increase in thebaine and oripavine, that are used as the basis for these,"" chief executive Ross Murdoch said.
""So we're actually finding that demand has increased enormously on the back of Ozempic, driving this anti-obesity type treatment.
""We fit into both the treatment of the diabetes and the obesity associated with that, as well as getting the benefit of the expanding market.""

After flowering, the dry poppy capsules are harvested in late summer.

""We extract the drug out of that, we dry it and put it into containers,"" Mr Murdoch said.
""We then ship it around the world to wholesalers and other companies that make it into the APIs [active pharmaceutical ingredients] and into the drugs.""
The raw ingredients extracted from the company's entire poppy production amounts to roughly 100 tonnes annually and goes into about four main products.
Often, a range of pharmaceutical compounds can be extracted from the one poppy plant.

The patented thebaine poppy variety is used to extract materials for medication that can reverse an opioid overdose or treat an opioid addiction, as well as form the base ingredient for weight-loss medicines.
Alklaoids from the same poppy are used to make the oxycodone family of painkillers, commonly branded as Endone or OxyContin.
The Tasmanian poppy industry experienced a big drop in demand for these after prescription policies changed in 2015, but Mr Murdoch said there had been a slight resurgence.
""Most of the companies, if not all the companies, we sell to in the world have worked through their inventory level,"" he said.
""So they are really demanding what they're going to manufacture without an ability to slow down their demand.
""We don't have the inventory, so we also are needing to grow what they demand.
This year the business is planning to contract nearly 9,000 hectares of poppies, triple the area from three years ago.
The market turnaround comes as staff and growers from across the decades celebrate 50 years of the company's involvement in the poppy processing business.
Today, Extractas Bioscience employs 140 people, and contracts around 150 farmers to grow poppies for the company across Tasmania.
The business, which was previously known as Tasmanian Alkaloids, was initially set up as a joint venture between Abbott Laboratories and Ciech Polfa in 1975.

In 1982, US company Johnson and Johnson took it over.
It spent decades cultivating a more versatile, opiate-rich poppy that drug manufacturers wanted, particularly in the multi-billion dollar pain medication market in the US.
Tasmanian Premier Jeremy Rockliff's father Rick was one of the first employees with Tasmanian Alkaloids, and spent more than 40 years with the company.
""He continued growing poppies right up until the time he passed away so it means a lot,"" Mr Rockliff said of his father.
""It was his passion and our passion as well as a family.

In 2016, Johnson and Johnson sold Tasmanian Alkaloids to US private equity firm SK Capital.
In 2020, it renamed the business Extractas Bioscience to reflect its expanding portfolio of plant extracts, which at the time, included medicinal cannabis.
After such a prolonged downturn in the market, Poppy Growers Tasmania president Michael Nichols believes the industry is finally turning a corner.

When she was 18 years old she started smoking ice, using it off and on for about a decade.
She was addicted, and in order to use, she had to sell.

Eventually she was caught by police and charged with supply and possession.
""I was really numb at the time I was incarcerated. I had been on a warpath trying to destroy my life for the previous two years,"" Ms Isaac says.
While she was charged in early 2017, it wasn't until the end of 2018 when she was finally sent to prison after months of destructive behaviour she says was fuelled by trauma.
She says when she was first charged she was released on bail with no orders to treat her addiction and no tools or resources at her disposal — which allowed her to continue offending.
Ms Isaac feels fortunate for her post-prison life. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)
The now 34-year-old has well and truly moved on from a life that was dominated by drugs and crime.
She has a postgraduate degree in criminology and works full time in advocacy.
Through her charity, ""Project:herSELF"", she is helping women transition out of prison and into a positive life.
The number of women incarcerated in Australia has more than doubled since 2000. (ABC News: Richard Mockler)
Ms Isaac believes most women struggle to pick up the pieces of their lives when they live in prison.
""Prisons aren't therapeutic. They don't offer women the chance to heal from the life they were living,"" she says.
Drawing on data from the international World Prison Brief database, Ms Isaac says Australia has imprisoned 3,473 women as of June 2024.
Like her mother, Tarnika became addicted to drugs and went to prison.
Half of these women were held on remand and not yet found guilty, and around 1,000 of those were in Queensland.
""Adjusted for population growth, it has more than doubled since records began in 2000,"" she says.
""These numbers represent people. Women, mothers, sisters, aunties and daughters. The glue that holds our social fabric together.""
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that nationally the female prison population grew by 64 per cent between 2009 and 2019. This compares with an increase of 45 per cent for the male prison population.
3,473 women are incarcerated in Australia. (ABC News: Richard Mockler)
She believes that stigma, as well as a lack of support means that many women go back to the lives they were living before.
""You feel like you are walking around with this label on your head like 'I've been in prison, I've been addicted to drugs',"" she says.
""You are shrouded in so much shame and stigma and discrimination.""
She says she found it particularly hard when it came to searching for a job, having been knocked back for jobs she was over-qualified for and even terminated from another when she was asked to disclose her conviction history.
Professor Susan Dennison is from Griffith University's School of Criminology and Criminal Justice.
She says the rapid increase in the incarceration of women can in part be attributed to the level of disadvantage these women experienced prior to their incarceration, including poverty, homelessness, substance abuse and domestic violence.

""We have about a third of women who have been homeless prior to incarceration,"" she says.
A report from the Queensland Sentencing Advisory Council found that one third of sentenced women and girls in the period between 2005 and 2019 had been charged before and that the number of women who received prison sentences had increased significantly.
In the 2005/06 financial year, women received imprisonment sentences 485 times, while in 2018/19 the number had risen to 2,128.

Professor Dennison said about 70 per cent of women in prison have been locked up before.
""An inability to get access to this kind of support that they need when they need it leaves them very vulnerable to offending,"" she says.
Suzanne Brumby, an associate professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice with the University of Southern Queensland, has spent 20 years working with people in prison and upon their release.
Despite the growing number of adult female prisoners across Australia, advocates say there are few gender-specific support services to help them transition back into the community.
She says there needs to be greater emphasis put on using peer support with people with lived experience to help the transition into life outside prison.
""Automatically you get a synergy when there's that shared experience and a shared goal,"" Professor Brumby says.
""It's probably the most valuable thing for helping people get on with their life once they're back in the community.""
She says politically she would like to see more courage from leaders when it comes to policies that help people reintegrate into society.
""At a social level, I think I would say that everybody has a role to play in re-integration. It is everybody's business because a safe community is everybody's business,"" she says.
""Sometimes it is just about being a friend, just accepting someone despite their past.
""A lot of these things we can't measure and so they don't become the emphasis in re-entry programs or in anything that's government funded because we can't KPI things like feeling values, feeling a sense of community.""

Ms Isaac says while she was able to use her time in prison to get clean, she quickly found the new life she had dreamt of while inside was not going to come easy.
""I didn't know how to advocate for myself and find a job. I didn't know anything about living life as a contributing member to society because I was so disconnected from that before,"" she says.
She says each point of contact with a government or social service had given her self esteem a blow, as she was reminded of her criminal convictions.
Experts are calling for more support to help with the transition to life outside prison. (ABC News)
When looking at the numbers, she often thinks about other women she met in prison.
""One gave birth to baby twins just days before she was eligible for release, separated from them straight after birth until her release date came,"" she says.
She says there are countless others who lose their homes and jobs for crimes most would deem not worthy of prison, like driving unlicensed or low level drug offences.
""Another who defended herself against her knife wielding husband. While she got out with her life, she paid for it by being charged and sentenced for six years,' she says.
It's these women she wants to help transition out of prison and into a positive life.

Her charity works through one-on-one sessions, every week with a mentor over 12 weeks.
She also goes into prisons with a release planning project.
""We support women to self-determine their plans for release, with a journal that has all the elements women need to consider when planning for release into their community,"" she says.
""In an informal setting we help women with practical support; writing resumes, discussing relationships, connecting them in with existing services, and just lending an ear from a place of knowing.""
It's about building a community that wraps around and helps women find their way to a positive future.
""The women who are in prison are smart, resourceful and resilient. They are incredible,"" she says.
""If we as a community can see how much these women can offer we can see communities start to thrive.""

They give her support and are an extension of herself.
""My first best friend is my prosthetic leg and my second is my wheelchair,"" she told ABC NEWS this week.
In a matter of weeks, Ms France and her two best friends will enter the House of Representatives with pride.
""I'm proud of my leg,"" she said, sitting on a park bench with titanium ankle crossed over human knee.
It's also clear that she's proud to be the new MP for the Queensland seat of Dickson and proud of doing it as a woman with disability.
Ms France's victory in last week's election brought much excitement to the disability community, but the excitement had nothing to do with party politics.
Labor's Ali France has toppled Opposition Leader Peter Dutton in his seat of Dickson. It was the former journalist and para-athlete's third time running in the seat.
There are 5.5 million Australians living with disability. That's 20 per cent of the population.
For many of them, life can be challenging, not because of their disability but because of the world simply not being built for them.
Transport and housing are often not accessible and people with disability continue to experience discrimination in every aspect of their lives including employment, health and education.
It's hard to understand what that's like unless you've experienced it yourself.
Ali France says she was ""underestimated"" and ""pitied"" when she returned to work with a disability. (ABC NEWS: Mary Lloyd)
But anyone can be impacted by disability at any point — something Ms France knows, having lost her leg in a car accident 14 years ago.
Before that, Ms France said she was ""completely naïve"" to the issues people with disability face every day.
Even with a decades-long career in journalism and public relations under her belt, returning to her job after having a leg amputated was a struggle.
""I [was] underestimated, pitied … it was really difficult,"" she said.
Taking up canoeing as a para-athlete helped restore her confidence.
When Ms France starts in Canberra, she'll be part of a small cohort of federal parliamentarians who live with disability.
The Greens' Jordon Steele-John, who lives with cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, entered the Senate in 2017.
There might've been others, but few with a visible presence. It's important we respect everyone's choice to disclose or not.
But it's that visibility advocate Elly Desmarchelier — who doorknocked for Ms France during her election campaign — said would prove powerful.
""It's in little girls being able to look up at the TV and see a disabled woman in parliament and it being a totally normal thing.""
The visibility of Ali France's disability will be a powerful thing to see in parliament, disability advocates say. (ABC NEWS: Mary Lloyd)
Ms France is almost certainly also the first member of a federal government to be a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) participant.
Nic Avery, from NDIS advocacy organisation Every Australian Counts, said having Ms France sharing her unique perspective at such a high level would be invaluable.
""Lived experience is the difference between hearing that something is difficult and having experienced those barriers yourself.""
There's a lot for the new Albanese government to do for Australians with disability.
Among them are restoring trust in, and the sustainability of, the NDIS, as well as negotiating with the states and territories on the rollout of the much-anticipated foundational supports for those outside the scheme.
On the eve of a new parliament, these are three areas disability advocates want addressed, write Evan Young and Nas Campanella.
Ms Avery said changes to the NDIS introduced last year were done without proper consultation.
She believes having another disabled voice in parliament will make a difference.
""We really need the opportunity for the government to work with us,"" she said.
But Ms Desmarchelier argues it's not Ms France's job to fix the NDIS and suggestions from some in the community that she should be given that portfolio is an unfair expectation of a first term MP.
""That conversation is backwards,"" she said.
""All policy is disability policy … and when we make the NDIS minister the go-to on disability we are making ourselves smaller in the government.""
While Ms France said disability issues will always be a focus, being her authentic self in serving the people of Dickson is her number one priority.
""There's lots of people in my community who've already spoken to me about their ideas and thoughts about the NDIS and I want people to always know that that is a passion of mine,"" she said.
Ms France recently lost her eldest son Henry to cancer.
She said being the local member is a chance to repay her community for their support privately and at the ballot box.
She hasn't shied away from showing emotion or talking about those tough times.
Ali France is passionate about disability issues, but says serving the people of Dickson is her number one priority. (ABC NEWS: Brendan Esposito)
But like most people with disability, the term ""inspirational"" doesn't sit well with her.
She hopes that by redefining what it means to be strong and bringing a unique perspective, she can make a difference to politics and the next generation of Australians with disability.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said 14 outbreaks had been recorded this year, with 93 per cent of confirmed cases being outbreak-associated.
As of May 9, Texas's state health department has confirmed 709 cases, 92 per cent of which have been hospitalised over the course of the outbreak, which began three months ago.
""There have been two fatalities in school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area [West Texas],"" the health department said in a statement.

Other states with active outbreaks — which the CDC defines as three or more related cases — include New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Indiana, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
Fifty-seven per cent of Texas’s cases were in Gaines County, which has a population of 22,892, where the virus had been spreading in a close-knit, under-vaccinated community, the Associated Press (AP) reported.

So far, three deaths — including an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico who died of a measles-related illness — have been confirmed in 2025.
North America has two other ongoing outbreaks, all of which are caused by the same measles strain, according to the AP.
One outbreak in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 1,440 cases from mid-October through May 6, representing a 197-case increase in a week.
The Mexican state of Chihuahua reported 1,041 measles cases and one death as of Friday, local time, according to data from the state health ministry.

Courts","A lost email concerning Joel Cauchi's declining mental health, an overlooked emergency assessment and a briefly-empty CCTV security room are all being considered ""missed opportunities"" in the Bondi Junction stabbing.
Within the space of over three minutes on the afternoon of April 13, 2024, the lives of many were irreparably changed when Cauchi killed six people.
WARNING: This story contains content that readers may find distressing.
In week two of the coronial inquest, questions were put to Queensland Police about what could have been done to avoid the mass casualty event.
Cauchi grew up in Toowoomba, Queensland, but at the time of the attack was experiencing homelessness in Sydney, the court heard.
Security and management at Bondi Junction Westfield were also asked about their response to the attack on the day and potential mishandling.
Cauchi — who had been ""fixated"" on his father taking his knife collection — was visited by two officers on January 8, 2023.
Later that day, they emailed an internal police mental health coordinator requesting a follow-up on Cauchi's mental health.
Sergeant Tracy Morris, a mental health intervention coordinator, was on leave at the time the email was sent.
The relieving officer, Senior Constable Peter McDiarmid, missed the email, telling the court: ""Unfortunately it was an oversight and I did not manage to follow up.""
When asked by Counsel Assisting the Coroner Peggy Dwyer SC if the incident was a ""missed opportunity by police"", Constable McDiarmid said ""I accept that"".
On the stand, Sergeant Morris became emotional, saying: ""His oversight on that email is devastating and is not indicative of him as an officer … On any day I could receive 30 to 40 emails … it's fast becoming an overwhelming role.""
Clockwise from top left: Yixuan Cheng, Faraz Tahir, Jade Young, Pikria Darchia, Dawn Singleton and Ashlee Good were killed.  (Supplied)
Constable Hope Porter, one of the officers who had the interaction with Cauchi in January 2023, wished she had ""followed up"" on their email correspondence.
""Everybody is doing the best with what they have … We do have a mental health co-responder now that we do use, and they are invaluable,"" she said.
Questions over whether Cauchi should have been detained and transported to an emergency department following the January 2023 interaction with police were made by Dr Dwyer.
An emergency examination authority (EEA) is the legal mechanism by which a person's behaviour indicates they are at immediate risk of ""serious harm"" in relation to mental health.
The related legislation allows police to involuntarily take a person to a public sector health service facility, such as an emergency department, for an examination.
The attending officers in January 2023 chose not to take Cauchi for an emergency assessment, partly because of ""confusion"". (Supplied)
The attending officers on the day chose not to take Cauchi for an emergency assessment, partly because there was ""confusion"" around the serious harm element of the EEA criteria.
Dr Dwyer asked Sergeant Morris whether hypothetically she had been one of the officers on the scene that day, if she would have implemented an EEA.
""There may have been an opportunity for an emergency examination authority, based on my skill set,"" she said.
When asked by Dr Dwyer if the legislation needed to be amended for clarity on what constitutes serious harm, Sergeant Morris agreed.
A security boss who was supervising on the day of the attack said it was protocol that regardless of how long or short a break they were taking — including visiting the bathroom — they needed to ensure there was a fellow officer to relieve their CCTV watch.
A female officer, referred to as CR1, left the control room to go to the bathroom at 3:32pm on April 13, meaning there was no active CCTV monitoring in place when Cauchi began his attack.
The court was told CR1 had struggled performing in the role, with a reassessment of her ability a discussion point among her managers.

The security boss, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, told the inquest he wished he had been present in the CCTV control room during the incident.
""It's one of my strengths, I could have assisted … but we'll never know,"" he said.
He said it would be preferable to implement a policy for two officers to be in the CCTV control room at any given time, rather than one.
The security boss told the inquest that April 13 was ""truly traumatic"" for all Westfield staff involved.
""Not everyone understands the fear and chaos we faced. I know that some of you are still carrying the weight of that day and that life hasn't been the same for you since,"" he said in a statement directed towards his team.
Out of those in his team who were present on the day of the attack, ""only two of us are still working full-time"", he said.
""I don't want to take away anything from anyone,"" he noted, extending his ""heartfelt condolences"" to the victims' loved ones.

He was once an Australian champion show dog, before becoming a therapy dog in 2018, and now works at Canberra Hospital's Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
Harry is the ideal dog for the role because of his warm, disciplined and deeply attentive nature.
The cocker spaniel has also recently participated in a study on the role of therapy dogs in patient care.
Kathleen Cook conducted the research project while working as a registered ICU nurse. (ABC News: Lily Nothling)
The five-year research project Harry has been a part of was focused on long-term ICU patients and family members at the Canberra Hospital, examining how interactions with therapy dogs impacted their anxiety levels.
Kathleen Cook was the principal investigator for the research project, which she conducted while working as a registered nurse in the ICU.
She said she undertook the study because existing research was limited, despite the benefits of therapy dogs being widely recognised.
Harry was the original participant in this project, but not the only one.
There were a total of five teams, in partnership with Delta Therapy Dogs, who provide volunteers and their dogs as therapy teams for hospitals, workplaces, schools and other facilities.
Megan Kelly, Harry's owner, said he was intrinsically motivated to help others.
""Oh my goodness — this is the most well-behaved dog I have ever seen in my life,"" Ms Cook recalls saying when she met Harry.
After six months of approvals and testing Harry was ready to go.
Megan Kelly says Harry and the other therapy dogs provide patients and their families with a sense of hope. (ABC News: Lily Nothling)
As part of the study, patients and their visiting family members recorded their anxiety levels before and after being visited by the therapy dogs.
Patients also had their vital signs recorded.
Researchers found that the therapy dogs helped reduce patient and family anxiety. But they also noted lower levels of pain in the patients.
Ms Cook said they had received ""amazing"" feedback from patients.
She also noted the dogs provided patients and their families with a sense of hope of recovery.
Nurse Jess Kim works in the ICU and emergency teams at the Canberra Hospital and helps run the therapy program, which is continuing despite the research coming to an end.
Ms Kim said the program helped the patients, who often had to undergo invasive procedures, to relax before and afterwards.
She said a few weeks earlier, a patient in the ICU had a visit from Harry and immediately remembered the cocker spaniel from a visit to the ICU five years ago.
While the patients have benefited, staff have also seen positive impacts.
ICU therapy dogs like Harry spend a one-hour shift with a patient, either sitting with them or heading outside to chase after a ball and run around. (ABC News: Lily Nothling)
Each shift for a therapy dog is an hour long.
Once the dogs head into work, they will sit with a patient, on a chair or on their bed, ensuring that infection control protocols are followed.
Sometimes the patients and the dogs head outside to the courtyard to throw a ball or have a run around.
Harry's owner Ms Kelly said once he had finished a shift, he usually fell straight asleep in the car on the way home.
""It's actually quite draining for dogs to give this much love and care for one hour, so that's why we recommend that it's only ever one hour,"" she said.
Ms Kelly said the volunteers played an important role as ""circuit breakers"", as she is one of the only non-medical people who come into the ward.
""People open up about their home life, their pets and who they're missing back at home and how they want to get better,"" she said.

Ms Kelly said Harry was also a big poser, and patients loved taking photos with him.
The program still operates in the ICU at Canberra Hospital, and Harry remains a friendly face waddling up and down the corridors, offering a sense of calm in a stressful environment.
Ms Cook said the research has led to the establishment of a similar program at St George Hospital in Sydney and she hoped other hospitals would soon start to follow.
Harry also has quite the following on social media, she said.
""We have so many direct messages with requests for services in other parts of the hospital, but Harry is solely an ICU dog,"" she said.",Imogen McDonald,Fri 9 May

Drug Offences","Police say they have disrupted an alleged criminal network in north-east Victoria following arrests in Cobram and Wangaratta.
The investigation into the alleged syndicate began in 2023 and has so far resulted in 298 charges and numerous drugs and weapon seizures.
On Wednesday five people were arrested and four firearms were seized, according to police.
""This marks one of the most substantial blows on alleged drug and firearms traffickers in our region in recent years,"" Detective Inspector Anthony Town said.
A 32-year-old Wangaratta man was charged with trafficking a commercial quantity of MDMA and possessing a traffickable quantity of firearms.
A 36-year-old man, also from Wangaratta, was also charged with the same crimes and remanded to a later date.

""We've significantly disrupted an alleged criminal network operating right in our own backyard,"" Inspector Town said.
""Organised crime groups trafficking drugs and firearms have no place in our community.
Since the investigation commenced police said they had seized more than 5,000 MDMA tablets, cocaine, cannabis and other drugs including fentanyl, steroids and viagra.
Officers said they had also confiscated more than 1 kilogram of methylamphetamine, 18 guns, a large amount of ammunition and 20 allegedly stolen vehicles.

WA has the lowest percentage of people under the age of 65 who have received the flu vaccination, according to data from the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance.
The percentage of people who have received the flu vaccine in WA was in the single digits for all age groups under 65.
Just 1.8 per cent of children aged five to 15 were vaccinated against the flu as of May 4.
Perth Children's Hospital paediatrician Professor Chris Blyth said it's crucial West Australians are vaccinated ahead of the flu season.

Professor Blyth said vaccine uptake was worse than usual.
""We are lagging behind as a country — we're not doing as well as we usually do in influenza vaccine uptake,"" he said.
Professor Blyth said one of the main contributing factors for the low uptake is ""vaccine hesitancy"".
A record number of influenza cases has been recorded in Australia, jumping 50 per cent from the same period last year. Experts are predicting flu season to come earlier than usual.
""We've come through a really tumultuous time through COVID,"" he said.
The paediatrician also urged young families to ensure they're up to date with other vaccinations, including for whooping cough and RSV.
""RSV is the most common cause of hospitalisation for children in the first year of life.""

The WA Government is running a free influenza vaccine program until the end of June for anyone older than six months.

Refugees","An Iranian refugee has failed in a bid to sue the federal government for mental health injuries caused by five years of immigration detention.
The trial in South Australia's Supreme Court was seen as a test case for dozens of other refugees who were detained under similar circumstances.
Payam Saadat was held in immigration detention in Western Australia and then South Australia after arriving on Ashmore Reef in 2000.
The trial heard Mr Saadat fled Iran where he had been detained, tortured and physically abused before seeking asylum in Australia.
His lawyer argued during the trial that the government knew, or should have known, that he was suffering from or vulnerable to a psychiatric illness either caused or made worse by his immigration detention.
Mr Saadat launched legal action against the Commonwealth in 2021. (ABC News: Lincoln Rothall)
Mr Saadat arrived in Australia after a 29-day journey by boat to Ashmore Reef.
A Howard-era asylum seeker, Mr Saadat was detained on mainland Australia, first at Curtin in Western Australia from 2000 to 2002, and then at Baxter detention centre in South Australia, for almost three years.
In 2021, he launched a case against the federal government over mental injuries he alleged he suffered while he was held in detention.
The matter was regarded as a ""test case"" because Mr Saadat was the first of more than 60 immigration detainees with claims against the Commonwealth and two private companies contracted to run detention centres in the state.

His statement of claim against the government asserted that if he was not suffering a mental illness when he arrived at Baxter, he developed one there – a chronic adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.
On Friday, Justice Tim Stanley handed down the ""over 600 page"" judgement setting out reasons as to why he reached the decision he did.
However, he said he would not be publishing the reasons until next week, while lawyers consider whether some of the information needs to be redacted.
Outside court, Mr Saadat said he is ""disappointed"" with the decision.
""I am disappointed but this is the decision and I have to respect that,"" he said.
""I didn't expect this result but it's happened … I have to move on.""
From 2000 to 2002, Mr Saadat was detained in WA's Curtin detention centre.
Mr Saadat said his time in detention was ""very bad"".
""It's the worst time in my life,"" he said.
Mr Saadat's solicitor Mal Byrne said they will ""take time"" to review the judgement and ""consider an appeal"".
""We will continue to stand by our client Payam and try and help him navigate his way through this difficult journey,"" he said.
Mr Byrne said it's too early to say whether it will act as a test case for the other detainees.
""We need to review the judgement and consider why the claim was dismissed, it may have no bearing at all on the other cases.""",Unknown,Fri 9 May

Parenting Teenagers","It's a show about adolescents and it has got the adults talking or, shall we say, frightened.
Netflix's British drama about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a female classmate has experts weighing in with advice for parents.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has suggested schools show their students the series, which focuses on toxic masculinity, loneliness and the gender divide.
It's something British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has already backed in the UK.
But what do young people think about it?
Should it be used as an educational tool in schools, or are there other ways to get the message across?
Ella says the show will be beneficial for older teens. (BTN High: Michelle Wakim)
Ella, 18, says the series, though fictional, is very ""confronting"" and could shock younger teens.
""I feel like there's an age that you should be showing that,"" she says.
However, Emily, 16, believes in the old ""show, don't tell"" adage.
Emily says the show has been the talk of their school. (BTN High: Michelle Wakim)
She says when the show first came out, it quickly became a conversation starter.
""It was definitely a lot of talk in my school with all my friends,"" Emily says.
""Have you watched this? Have you not? Yeah, a lot on TikTok as well.
""When I hear that someone hasn't watched it, I'm really surprised.""
Can Netflix series Adolescence educate boys? (PM)
She says conversations have their place but nothing is as powerful as seeing the effects of misogyny.
""Showing is different, visualising it, actually seeing the impacts and violence and all of that,"" Emily says.
Imogen, 18, is also in the ""show-it-in-schools camp"".
""It's very educational,"" she says.
""It just shows how it is really like. It's … scary. It's like real life. It happens.""
But there are some teens like Beau, 15, who think the show is too ""dramatic"" and their parents are taking it too seriously.
Beau (centre) says the show doesn't represent real life. (BTN High: Michelle Wakim)
""They have seen it. Mum started saying stuff about the show and I can kind of see where she's coming from,"" he says.
""But I feel like the parents think about it a lot deeper than [it] actually is, and they take every meaning, every small thing in the show to heart.""

He says though the show is trying to educate parents about cyberbullying and the online world that teens inhabit, the series has made it out to be ""a lot deeper than it should be"".
""I think it's a lot more dramatic than it is,"" Beau says.
""I don't think it should be shown in schools because it's not really too accurate. I don't see [much] of that stuff happening in schools.""
The show, which gives insight to adults about the world of young people and online misogyny, is certainly popular.
According to Netflix, it has clocked more than 124 million views.
Child and adolescent psychologist Deirdre Brandner says it is important to remember that Adolescence is aimed at adults and is not a ""teaching tool"".
""This was a series made by Netflix to entertain adults,"" Ms Brander says.

""It wasn't a documentary series. It's not a learning series. It's not a teaching series.
""So there's a real danger in, yet again, asking our schools to take on responsibilities that they shouldn't have to.""
Tomorrow Man's Tom Harkin says Adolescence should inspire education. (Supplied: Tom Harkin)
Tom Harkin, co-founder and creative director of men's mental health service Tomorrow Man, agrees.
""As a standalone educational tool, no, I don't think it should be shown,"" he says.
Mr Harkin says some of the content would be challenging to watch in a classroom environment.
""I think taking the show as it is and watching all four episodes could be a dangerous one,"" he says.
""[Especially] if teachers are showing this within classrooms and they're not being equipped to understand the depth of the themes or the vicarious trauma that could be caused within the room.""
Why Netflix's Adolescence is a cautionary tale for every parent. (The Radio National Hour)
Female teachers are being sworn at, sexually harassed and physically threatened in high schools by male students. They say young men are bringing the misogynistic ideas of Andrew Tate and other online influencers into the classroom.
Regardless of whether it is appropriate for classrooms or not, most agree the show can be a way to launch tricky conversations and bridge age and gender gaps.
Child psychologist Deirdre Brandner says parents lack insight into the online space, the natural habitat of the young.
She says that can be a barrier to open and honest discussions.
""Us parents, us oldies, did not grow up in the digital age … so we don't understand what's happening,"" Ms Brandner says.
Mr Harkin runs workshops with young people focusing on breaking down harmful gender stereotypes.
He says the lack of understanding between the genders also needs to be addressed.
""That's something that we should be paying attention to,"" Mr Harkin says.
""Why is it so shocking for adults to be hearing and seeing this and, yet, young people are kind of going, 'Yeah, that's the world that I am kind of in. They are the kind of themes that are going on', and obviously being impacted by them.""
Watching Adolescence with my son made me realise the reality of the school kids in the show is the shared reality of our own child.
Mr Harkin says there is an ""empathy gap"" between the genders.
""We need to bridge the gender divide,"" he says.
""The disconnect between each other, it's going to have more really poor outcomes that I think we're all going to shed tears over.
""And it's not going to go away because Adolescence or the latest news piece falls out of the cycle.""
Michael (right) says it's important to talk about the themes the TV show highlights. (BTN High: Michelle Wakim)
Michael, 18, says he doesn't believe movies or TV shows are the right format to discuss topics like misogyny.
""But we should definitely be learning these things like we do about other stuff, like consent,"" he says.
""Because it is quite important.""
Bella says schools need to address misogyny. (BTN High: Michelle Wakim)
Bella, 16, says it is not about dictating to men what to do but about teaching respect.
""I am not saying to the males: 'You do that, you do this,'"" she says.
For Ella, discussions about the themes of violence and misogyny need to happen sooner rather than later.
""I think it is really important that it is taught early on,"" she says.

Courts","A First Nations teenager experiencing mental ill-health who took his own life after being released on home detention bail ""would have been better placed had he not received bail"" and remained in prison, a coroner has found.
The teen died on September 14, 2019, just three days after being released from the high dependency unit (HDU) in Yatala Labour Prison, in Adelaide's north, on September 11, 2019.
In findings handed down this week, South Australian Deputy State Coroner Ian White said that while in prison on charges of affray and property damage, the 18-year-old was ""physically safe from taking his own life"".
""It pains me to say that, from what we know now and his observed behaviours and words, [the teen] would have been better placed had he not received bail and remained at Yatala in HDU at that time in September 2019,"" he said.
""This goes against every principle concerning the detriment to Aboriginal people of being in custody awaiting their outcome of criminal charges against them.
The teenager was released from the high dependency unit within Yatala Labour Prison in 2019. (ABC News: Che Chorley )
He said the teen was a ""very troubled and disadvantaged young Aboriginal man"".
The findings note the teen was granted release on electronically-monitored bail during a hearing at Elizabeth Magistrates Court, but that the court was not told of his ""struggles"" while in custody.
Mr White said prison health staff had identified the teen as ""clearly experiencing psychotic symptoms"" requiring constant supervision, placing him in the HDU.
""Inadvertently, [the teen] was released without any referral to see a psychiatrist,"" Mr White said.
The day after his release to live with his sister, the teen attended a Department for Correctional Services office and ""almost immediately"" began making ""concerning statements including about harming others and being possessed by the devil"".
A compliance officer made a referral to the Acute Crisis Intervention Service, who advised the compliance officer to call SAPOL and request a welfare check.
SAPOL did not conduct a welfare check, the coroner found. (ABC News: Che Chorley)
But, Mr White said SAPOL ""did not honour the request"".
""SAPOL never conducted this welfare check, thus losing the chance to change the course of events by making a potential assessment and ensuring follow-up care,"" he said.
Meanwhile another referral was made to the Northern Community Mental Health Service about 5pm on September 12, 2019, but not allocated until midday the next day, Friday, September 13.
The allocated staff member attempted to visit the teen, but had an old address and discovered his new residence fell outside the team's catchment area.
According to the findings, the staff member had resolved to find the correct address the following Monday, because a response had been triaged as ""non-urgent"" despite the teen having symptoms which ""would ordinarily necessitate a rapid response"".
The teenager was released from Yatala without any referral to see a psychiatrist, the coroner found. (ABC News: Che Chorley)
The findings note two other DCS staff members visited the teen on the Friday, and noted his ""quiet and withdrawn"" demeanour and that he was ""suffering from some kind of mental health condition"" but said the teen repeatedly assured them ""everything was fine"".
Mr White said an expert consultant psychiatrist who gave evidence at the inquest had identified ""missed opportunities to obtain urgent psychiatric assessment and treatment"" for the teen.
He made three recommendations around improved information sharing between the state's youth and adult prisons and between public health clinicians and prison health, and to permanently implement  improvements made since the teen's death.
Chris Picton says the government will give ""serious consideration"" to the recommendations. (ABC News)
In a statement, Health Minister Chris Picton extended his sympathies to the teen's family.
""The state government will give serious consideration to the recommendations in the Deputy State Coroner's report,"" he said.
A Department for Correctional Services spokesperson similarly said any death like the teen's was ""sad and tragic"".
""The department has received the coroner's report and will give his recommendations active consideration,"" the spokesperson said.
South Australian Police (SAPOL) also said it was considering the findings and will ""make further assessment regarding the relevance of the findings to SAPOL's current policies and practices"".

Queen of the daytime talk show, Oprah Winfrey can't hide her excitement.
""I love bread!"" she says, hands gesticulating in the air.
She was, of course, advertising weight loss program Weight Watchers, now known as WW.
Oprah Winfrey was one of the most famous faces of Weight Watchers.  (Supplied: Weight Watchers )
In 2015, Winfrey became the public face of the program, but only nine years later the relationship would sour.
Winfrey announced she was stepping down from the board last year ""to eliminate any perceived conflict of interest around her taking weight-loss medications"".
Perhaps it was a sign of things to come.
On Tuesday, local time, the US company announced it was filing for bankruptcy, citing a ""rapidly changing weight management landscape"".
So, from a celebrity-spruiked success to a relic of diet culture — how did we get here?
It was Brooklyn housewife Jean Nidetch who first envisaged the company which would become a global juggernaut.
After years of binge-eating and fad diets, Nidetch came up with a system in which she periodically met with a group of her friends who were also interested in losing weight, and together they charted their progress and offered encouragement.
Her first official meeting in 1963 attracted more than 400 women.
Just five years later, WW had amassed 1 million members worldwide.
Jean Nidetch spruiked a diet where a community of women helped support each other's weight-loss journey.  (Weight Watchers Facebook page)
Even in the beginning, Nidetch was quick to differentiate it from other diets.
""The word 'diet' is one we refrain from using at WW because one usually goes on a diet to lose weight, and then ultimately goes off the diet,"" she said in 1968.
""We refer, instead, to a 'program' of re-educating one's eating habits, which then becomes a way of life.""
Australia was among the first international bases, opening in Sydney in 1969.
The phenomenon would eventually grow to more than 400 locations in every state and territory.

Nidetch would continue to cash in — from cookbooks, frozen meals and even scales — and Weight Watchers not only became a diet but a bankable brand.
In 1978, she sold the brand to HJ Heinz Co (the sauce brand) for a whopping $US71 million ($541 million today, with adjusted inflation).
An undeniable part of WW was its celebrity influence.
Excluding Winfrey, the brand was known for recruiting celebrities to divulge their before-and-afters to the public, including Jessica Simpson, Jennifer Hudson and even Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson.
Sarah Ferguson was one of the brand's more unlikely spokeswoman, saying she had lost about 40 kilograms thanks to the diet.  (Reuters )
Simpson, who was brutally ridiculed for her weight after the birth of her daughter in 2012, said she felt ""pressured"" to lose weight as she spruiked the program.
""My body, like my life, is a work in progress, but I'm getting there with Weight Watchers,"" Simpson says in one commercial, between long shots of herself smiling on the beach.

But it wasn't just celebs.
Every day people found a community in the weekly weigh-ins, and were able to stay motivated by a group of judgement-free peers.
But while the program was praised for its flexibility and social aspects, it was also criticised by dieticians for not being run by medical professional but instead ""coaches"".
In 2018, the brand also garnered controversy for offering free memberships for teenagers aged 13 to 17.
Australian influencers and their fitness and nutrition guides were all the rage in the mid-to-late 2010s. We asked experts if their advice holds up today.
It later responded acknowledging teen years are a ""critical life stage"" and that it was not providing a diet but ""healthy habits for life"".
At times, it also struggled to differentiate itself in a market full of diet alternatives such as similarly celebrity-endorsed rival Jenny Craig.
As the years went on, the world of nutrition changed rapidly, and in 2023, Jenny Craig filed for bankruptcy.
In an attempt to shift towards wellness, Weight Watchers abandoned its iconic name to not mention weight, rebranding to WW in 2018.
Adding the tagline ""Wellness that Works"" amid a cultural move away from diet culture and growing competition from phone apps, social media influencers and online programs.
In 2023, struggling to adapt to the changing world, the company introduced its own clinic — which provided telehealth access to weight loss medications such as semaglutide (better known as Ozempic or Wegovy).
But despite WW's restructure, a new generation of consumers were leaving WW behind, and turning to TikTok and Instagram for a health information instead.
Emily Denniss, a lecturer at the Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition at Deakin University who researches the relationship between social media use and dietary patterns, said people have moved away from traditional restrictive diets in what she calls a ""rebranding of diet culture"".
""Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers have failed because they haven't changed how they are talking about weight-loss,"" Dr Denniss said.
There are many online fitness programs, but looking past marketing terminology to find a program that best suits your health and fitness goals can be challenging.
Nicholas Fuller, an associate professor at the University of Sydney's Central Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health, who researches at The Boden Initiative — a centre focused on the global obesity epidemic — said people have been following the same approach to weight loss for the past five decades.
""There are so many programs out there and only three have real-world evidence.
“Continuous calorie restriction doesn’t work — people are fed up of being stuck in this cycle of losing and regaining weight”
Flinders University researchers say young adults who use diet and fitness apps are more likely to obsess over diet.
Natalie Spicer, the Butterfly Foundation's head of clinical and support services, said diet culture has not disappeared, but evolved.
""The demise of weight loss organisations is sadly not an indicator of a move away from the diet culture we live in, but more a move towards quick fix solutions like injectable weight loss medications,"" Ms Spicer said.
""Many of the same harmful ideals are now repackaged under the guise of 'wellness', 'clean eating', and 'health optimisation'.""
The company says it has about $US1.15 billion in debt, according to its bankruptcy announcement.
Parent company WW International Inc said it has the support of nearly three-quarters of its debt holders.
It expects to emerge from bankruptcy within 45 days, if not sooner.
""For more than 62 years, WeightWatchers has empowered millions of members to make informed, healthy choices, staying resilient as trends have come and gone,"" Weight Watchers CEO Tara Comonte said.
""As the conversation around weight shifts toward long-term health, our commitment to delivering the most trusted, science-backed, and holistic solutions — grounded in community support and lasting results — has never been stronger, or more important.""",Unknown,Thu 8 May

Rayn Sadik, 20, and Yousif Al-Asadi, 23, were jailed for three years with a non-parole period of 18 months in South Australia's District Court in January, but the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions appealed that sentence, suggesting it was ""manifestly inadequate"".
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal granted the appeal and re-sentenced the men to six years and nine months in prison and set new non-parole periods of four years.
In the appeal judgement, the court found that re-sentencing was required because ""the length of the sentences were so disproportionately low as to amount to an error of principle that undermines public confidence in the administration of justice"".
""It is a remarkable feature of the sentences imposed in this case that they are out of step with the sentences relied on and the subject of submissions before the sentencing judge,"" the judgement states.
The court said once other similar cases were considered, it was ""clear that the sentences imposed in this case are too low"".
Previously, the court had heard both men pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug.
It heard the pair was involved in the attempted importation of substances weighing 139kg, which contained ""114.76 kilograms of cocaine with a purity of 82.5 per cent"" early last year.
The cocaine had a street value of $17.1 million.
The cocaine was first imported to Western Australia hidden inside four luxury buses on board a cargo ship before the Australian Federal Police and Australian Border Force removed ""139 brick-shaped wrapped in black plastic"" and replaced them with an ""inert substance"" which they kept under surveillance as they were shipped into Port Adelaide.
Four of the imported packages contained Apple Air Tag tracking devices.
When the men were originally sentenced in January, Judge Joana Fuller said that although the men knew they were doing something criminal, they had not understood the ""nature or gravity"" until they were inside the buses removing the packages.
""Objectively, the offending is extremely serious, the total street value of the cocaine is astronomical,"" she said.
""While I accept that each of you performed an essential role by collecting the unlawfully imported drugs — or what you thought were the unlawfully imported drugs — anyone who found themselves in similarly difficult circumstances would have been importuned to become involved in the same way you were.
""As Mr [David] Edwardson KC frankly put it; you were both muppets.""
Judge Fuller had said the pair had been instructed by their drug dealers to follow the drugs from WA to SA in order to pay off drug debts they had accumulated.
She said she had taken the remorse, personal circumstances and lack of prior offending of both men into consideration when imposing a sentence.
In the judgement, the court found Judge Fuller had ""made something out of what she described as the pressure the respondents were under when they continued with their involvement once they realised the magnitude of the criminal enterprise"".
""There was no evidence or material before the sentencing judge to justify findings such as these,"" the judgement says.
The judgement notes that while the men were not the main players, their involvement was ""not fleeting"" and they stood to gain financially.
In both cases, the sentences were backdated to begin in February 2024, when the men were taken into custody.
The men, who were originally eligible to apply for parole in August, will now not be eligible to apply until February 2028.",Jordanna Schriever,Thu 8 May

Cancer","Richard Scolyer, the world-renowned pathologist and former Australian of the Year, says he may only have a few months to live after his brain cancer returned earlier this year.
Professor Scolyer, 58, was diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma in 2023 and was given just six to eight months to live.
But an experimental immunotherapy treatment he was given managed to keep the cancer at bay for almost two years with no recurrence.
The treatment was developed by his colleague, Melanoma Institute Australia medical director Georgina Long.
It used the same immune therapies she had pioneered for melanoma and initially showed promising results.

Professors Scolyer and Long were jointly named Australian of the Year in 2024 for their work.
However, Professor Scolyer revealed in March of this year that after undergoing scans, he had received the heartbreaking news that his brain cancer had come back.
He told ABC News Breakfast on Thursday he's not sure how much time he has left.
""I'm still here and still able to chat to you so I'm pretty pleased about that,"" he said. ""Who knows how long I've got. Could be months, could be less.""
Professor Scolyer says he's focused on spending the time he has left doing the things he loves most.
""I love my life. I love the interactions I have with so many people.
""I guess in reality, I have focused down on the things that I like doing. Spending more time with my family is number one, but also contributing to society. It's something I've done for a long, long time.

""I've been a specialist for more than 25 years now. So a lot of things that I've done I don't want to give up just like that.""
His book, Brainstorm, won the Social Impact Book of the Year at the Australian Book Industry Awards in Melbourne on Wednesday night. Co-written with Garry Maddox, the book explores Professor Scolyer's extraordinary journey through brain cancer treatment.
He told News Breakfast he was ""delighted"" to be recognised.
""But ultimately, we're trying to make a difference for brain cancer patients. I hope that's where it ends up.""
Professor Scolyer says he had more fun than he'd expected writing the book, calling it a ""great journey"".

""I thought initially it might be just about the tough journey, but when I was approached about doing this, you get to talk about whole aspects of life and it's a lot of fun reminiscing on things, particularly when you're younger, the fun that you have.""
He says he hopes the book will help make a difference with discussions around brain cancer.
""When you think about it, brain cancer treatment for the sort I've had, basically no-one is cured from it. And that doesn't sit with me right.
""Melanoma, if it had spread around your body, what we call stage 4 melanoma, everyone died about 15 years ago. Now we're curing close to 60 per cent of such patients.
""There are a lot of reasons why it's harder to treat brain cancer than melanoma, but to use some of the learnings that we've made at an earlier phase gives us a better chance.""
Now facing his own mortality, Professor Scolyer's advice to people is to enjoy life as much as possible.

Mr Hamilton was preparing to empty the grain silo on his property in Springsure, more than 300 kilometres south-west of Rockhampton, in February 2024.
He said what began as a ""routine day on the land"" changed in a single instant, when the silo gave way ""without warning"".

Finding him partially buried she raised the alarm and the local rescue helicopter service, CapRescue, was summoned.
Ms Hamilton assisted the crew with finding the isolated property, while local police, paramedics and firefighters stayed by Mr Hamilton's side, helping him and keeping him calm.
Neighbours also worked tirelessly to free him, digging with shovels.
""His [the neighbour's] blood ran cold when he came in and he got things happening,"" Mr Hamilton said.
Mr Hamilton said everyone's relief when the helicopter landed was palpable.
""They were calm, professional and knew exactly what to do.""
Having raised money for CapRescue for years as a trail runner in the annual Springsure Mountain Challenge, Mr Hamilton said he never thought he would be calling the service for help.
""I'm just lucky to still be here … [they] turned up when I needed them most. Without that flight, I wouldn't be here talking to you today.""
Mr Hamilton said an iron bar pinning his legs helped slow the blood flow to his foot, which was badly damaged.

Ms Hamilton said the couple wanted to share their story to remind other rural families to be prepared in case disaster struck.
""If you live on a property, ask yourself: 'If a chopper needed to land here, where would it go?'"" she said.
Mr Hamilton was flown to Rockhampton and then Brisbane after the accident and had multiple surgeries, followed by a long recovery.

He said it was emergency services, his friends, wife Michelle, and son Wylye that kept him going for the 5am morning runs.
CapRescue said stories like Mr Hamilton's were not uncommon, with the service called to more than 500 incidents throughout the central Queensland region each year.
It does not charge patients for emergency treatment and transfers and a third of its $15 million operating costs come from fundraising.
More than 12 months on from his incident, on Sunday Mr Hamilton will again compete in the Springsure Mountain Challenge, taking part in the 17km event with Ms Hamilton.

Cancer","Just four weeks after Trini Hale and her daughter Sharla Edwards finished last year's inaugural Lunchbox Rally to raise funds for cancer research, Ms Hale received an unexpected diagnosis of her own.
The mother of four from South Australia's Riverland said she had no symptoms before being diagnosed with kidney cancer in October 2024.
""It was found very coincidentally,"" she said.
""I was just having check-ups for other things … went for an ultrasound and came back with a diagnosis of kidney cancer.""
Now, following surgery, Ms Hale and 11-year-old Sharla are preparing for this year's Lunchbox Rally in September, knowing firsthand how cancer can strike at the heart of families without warning.

The Shitbox Rally initiative has raised more than $54 million for Cancer Council research since it began in 2010.
Due to demand, what started out as one outback event has now grown to five throughout the year.
Box Rallies founder and chief executive James Freeman said his team had met people from all over Australia.
The Lunchbox Rally is the young-person-friendly version.

Known as ""the Shitbox Rally for kids"", teams are made up of one adult and one child aged seven to 15, and the car must be valued at no more than $1,500.
The 2025 rally will see people from across Australia start and finish in Broken Hill, travelling for five days through South Australia's northern outback before returning.

Ms Hale and Sharla — who will celebrate her 12th birthday during the event — will participate under the team name Double Trouble.
They admit their mindset going into this year's event will be a bit different from last year.
When Ms Hale was diagnosed with clear cell renal cell carcinoma in October, she became one of more than 4,700 Australians who were given the grim news that they had kidney cancer last year.
According to the Cancer Council, kidney cancer is the seventh most common form of the disease in Australia, with an estimated one in 65 people diagnosed by the time they are 85.
Unlike other cancers, there is no national screening program for kidney cancer.

Fortunately, Ms Hale's cancer was discovered in its early stages.
She underwent a radical nephrectomy — removal of the affected kidney — in January this year.
""That sounded daunting to begin with, but then [I was] told you can live with one kidney, you don't even have to really change your lifestyle too much,"" Ms Hale said.
Leading up to her diagnosis, Ms Hale had participated in the 2023 Shitbox Rally with her partner, Stuart Edwards, and the 2024 Lunchbox Rally with Sharla.

""When we first started doing them, we were raising money for other family and friends we knew had been affected by cancer, not imagining it would be myself,"" she said.
""To now have it really affect our own family, it's a bit of an ironic situation.
""I completely understand how important the money is for the research [and] getting on top of early diagnoses.""

Sharla said she was looking forward to meeting new people and ""seeing the outback again"" with her mother in September.
""It was really fun [last year] because when you got back, you could play all these mini games with the people you met,"" she said.
Mr Freeman said the Lunchbox Rally allowed kids who were left behind during the Shitbox and Mysterybox rallies to participate.

""It's [also] about the fundraising … looking outside of themselves and their families and looking at what they can do for other people.""
With teams requiring at least $3,000 raised before they can participate in the Lunchbox Rally, Ms Hale said the Loxton and broader Riverland community had been supportive.
""We had a number of businesses come on board, and got a lot of family and friends that are continuing to sponsor us,"" she said.

The 48-year-old from South Perth/Whadjuk Noongar country says there's been one big takeaway from her doctor's visits, women's health podcasts and books — consuming adequate amounts of protein is a must.
""I'm trying as much as I can to incorporate protein, both animal and vegetable in my diet,"" she says.
""I eat protein for lunch and dinner, and I eat one to two boiled eggs every day.
""I'm always looking for protein fortified foods.""
Why is protein important during perimenopause and how much should we be consuming each day? We looked to three dietetic and nutrition experts to find out.
There are a couple of reasons, according to Shelley Wilkinson, a dietitian and senior research fellow at the University of Queensland's School of Pharmacy, in Meanjin/Brisbane.
Menopause is technically the single day 12 months after your last period. But perimenopause can last years. Here's what to look for and when to get help.
""It helps maintain our muscle mass and also promote feelings of fullness or satiety,"" she says.
She says during perimenopause, oestrogen levels begin to drop which decreases bone density as well as lean tissue, which is our muscle.
""By having enough protein in our diet, it helps with maintaining that muscle mass, and then it also helps us feel full, which might prevent that weight gain that generally occurs in perimenopause,"" she says.
""We want to maintain muscle mass to keep our metabolism strong and our body running well, it also keeps us feeling strong and stable as we go into older age.""
She says women with strong muscle mass are less likely to have falls as they get older, and keeping bones strong also helps prevent osteoporosis.
Dr Wilkinson says you don't have to know whether you're experiencing perimenopause to assess your protein intake.
""When we look at the national guidelines, they say 0.6 grams per kilogram each day for women between the ages of 19 and 70,"" she says.
""The daily protein recommendation say for a woman weighing 60 kilos, is 60 multiplied by point six, which is 36 grams a day.
""If they were 70 kilos, it's 42 grams a day.""
This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.
She says once women reach 50 years of age, the food groups they require change to include more calcium rich foods, which can also be a source of protein.
""It goes up to four serves of dairy a day and then meat and [protein] alternatives — you want two serves a day.""
She says people should be aiming to hit the five food groups every day with a balance of lean meats and poultry as well as plant protein.
""Half of the protein that people eat should come from those plant sources,"" she says.
""So that's nuts and seeds, a lot of legumes and lentils, red kidney beans, chickpeas, cannellini beans, tofu, soya beans, edamame, cashews, almonds, walnuts, pecans.""
She says instead of using processed protein powders, adding skim milk powder is the cheapest and most nutritious way to increase protein.
And be cautious of over-consuming, Dr Wilkinson says if you're taking too many calories in your body, it will store any extra food as fat.
A 2023 study by the International Society of Sports Nutrition found that active women in perimenopause and menopause may need slightly more protein, and have it distributed evenly across meals every three to four hours.
The work includes research by Stacy Sims, an internationally renowned exercise physiologist and nutritional scientist based in New Zealand.
Dr Stacy Sims (centre) says the amount of protein women need depends on their age, activity level and menstrual cycle status. (Supplied)
""For [these] perimenopausal and menopausal women, daily protein needs increase to about 2-2.3g per kg of body weight,"" Dr Sims says.
""As we age, our bodies become more resistant to the muscle-building effects of protein and exercise, requiring higher doses of both.""
She says that another study found that after eating, older women experienced a smaller increase in muscle protein synthesis (the metabolic process where amino acids are incorporated into new muscle protein), with some studies showing a drop of up to 40 per cent compared to younger women.
Ms De Silva credits feeling strong and healthy during perimenopause to the combination of extra protein and exercise.
""I'm doing strength exercising with weights, which I never used to do, I used to love cardio,"" she says.

Dr Wilkinson says if you need guidance on what's right for you, consult your GP.
She says GP's can write a chronic disease management plan which includes five subsidised visits a year to practitioners such as dieticians and exercise physiologists.
The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Associate Professor Dr Magdalena Simonis says while Menopause is not considered to be a chronic medical condition, a patient’s eligibility for a plan is a matter for their GP’s clinical judgement.
""A chronic disease management plan may be appropriate where, for example, a patient experiencing menopause has a fracture ... due to osteoporosis or a severe mood disorder that is resistant to hormone treatment,"" Dr Magdalena says.
Stephen Simpson, the former academic director of the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre, has been studying the impacts of protein on women experiencing perimenopause.
He recommends women consume healthy protein sources where possible to avoid what he calls the ""protein leveraging effect"" — when our body is craving protein, but we instead consume foods with lower concentrations of protein (processed foods).
""That combination means that our protein appetite is going to drive us to eat more to get to our protein target, and in so doing, you eat more calories than you need,"" he says.
Stephen Simpson says women experiencing perimenopause can be at greater risk of overeating and weight gain. (Supplied: University of Sydney)
""How it interacts, specifically with women during perimenopause, is that during that period … the hormonal changes that are happening start to break down lean tissue.
""That rides your protein appetite, and unless you increase the concentration of protein in the diet, you're going to be prone to eat even more calories to gain your now increased protein requirements and that's a bad combination.""
He says the good news is that you can make small dietary changes to ensure you're consuming foods with a high concentration of protein.
""The evidence suggests it's only about nine or 10 grams of protein extra required a day, so that's a relatively small amount,"" he says.
""They can be plant-based foods, obviously, the legumes, chickpeas.
""Or increasing your intake of dairy and animal-based proteins as well, they're both going to give you that little bit extra, and to do it in main meals rather than snacking.""

Marine Biology","A toxic algal bloom impacting multiple beaches across South Australia is nearly the size of Kangaroo Island, according to the state government.
Environment Minister Susan Close said the outbreak of Karenia mikimotoi, a type of micro-algae linked to the deaths of countless marine animals, has grown to an unprecedented scale.
""It is a larger bloom than we have ever seen before,"" Ms Close said.
""It is not far off the size of Kangaroo Island and in some parts it's as deep as 20 metres.
""We're talking about a very large algal bloom with a significant impact on marine life.""
Kangaroo Island is Australia's third largest island, measuring 4,405 square kilometres.
Beachgoers first sounded the alarm about the bloom back in March after thick foam and dead marine animals washed up on Waitpinga and Parsons beach on the Fleurieu Peninsula.

Multiple surfers reported feeling unwell at the time, with symptoms including coughing, sore eyes and blurry vision.
The algae is considered non-toxic to humans but can cause allergic reactions.
Since then, reports of dead marine life have spread to Kangaroo Island, Yorke Peninsula and beaches south of Adelaide.
Ms Close said the outbreak was being driven by a marine heatwave coupled with still ocean conditions.
She said water temperatures were currently 2.5 degrees warmer than usual, likely due to climate change.

""Normally we get that around the end of April – that hasn't happened yet.
""We need a big change in weather to break this thing up; there is nothing we can do to precipitate this.""
According to the Department of Primary Industries and Regions (PIRSA), algal blooms of this size and nature are ""rare"" in South Australia, with the last outbreak recorded in Coffin Bay in 2014.
""Similar outbreaks around the world have generally lasted between a week to several months depending on wind, rain and ocean temperature fluctuations,"" a PIRSA spokesperson said.
Concerns have been growing about the welfare of local marine life in the wake of numerous incidents, some of which have been described by experts as ""unusual"".
On Monday, authorities removed a dead white shark which had washed up on Henley Beach.
Authorities have removed a dead shark that washed up on an Adelaide beach on Monday.
Two other sharks were reported dead at Port Willunga and Port Moorowie in April, while a third was able to be returned to the waters near Ardrossan last week.
Ms Close said the researchers are working to determine the cause of death of the shark found at Henley with results due next week.
""We don't know for sure if that was affected by Karenia mikimotoi, although I believe that is a reasonable assumption that that is likely to have been the case given then the presentation of the animal,"" she said.
""Having a great white go up on the coast of Adelaide on a very popular beach, that is distressing to people.""
Last week, a woman was barbed by an eagle ray while surveying the impact the algae was having on the ecosystem along the Yorke Peninsula.
Marine biologist Dr Mike Bossley, who was leading the expedition, said he observed stingrays being more active and aggressive than normal, but it remains unclear how the algae can impact the behaviours of marine animals.
""Something has made these rays and sharks go a bit crazy and they're just unpredictable at the moment,"" Dr Bossley said.
""These microscopic algae can coat the gills of fish and it could be that they are basically being suffocated … that's what's causing them to act in strange ways.
As sharks, rays, and other marine life continue to wash up on South Australian beaches, citizen scientists are urged to record the scale of the lingering marine algal bloom event.
""I would recommend people give careful thought to whether they go in the water where the algal bloom is happening … it's quite dangerous.""
Ms Close said beachgoers should not enter the water if they believe algae is present.
""If you see that there is scum on the beach, if you see that there is discolouration in the water – stay away, don't go in,"" Ms Close said.
""And if you have been in, wash yourself down thoroughly.""",Rachael Merritt,Thu 8 May

TransitCare delivered more than 300,000 trips in the last financial year, but the Queensland-based not-for-profit organisation's CEO, Terry O'Toole, said they could not keep up with demand.
""We are having to refuse referrals coming in,"" he said.
Thousands of Australians rely on community transport services. (ABC News: Alice Pavlovic)
Community transport, funded through a mixture of federal, state and commercial contracts, offers transport for people over 65 and people with a disability in capital cities and regional communities.
With the additional pressures of rising vehicle costs, wages, and insurance combined with an ageing population, community transport providers like TransitCare were beginning to limit how many trips they could make a year.
In the past, TransitCare had been able to absorb over-delivery, but Mr O'Toole said they couldn't afford to do that anymore.
""We're having to comply with what the government says in certain instances.  We try to deliver the best service to as many people as possible.""
TransitCare now provides more than 300,000 trips annually. (Supplied)
Leanne Claussen, who has a disability, had been using community transport for many years, but when she moved to a different city, she was no longer within the geographical boundary of her provider.
The Queensland resident said the community transport service in her new area told her they didn't have suitable vehicles for her to access their service.
Ms Claussen, who has limited mobility due to having lymphedema, relied on community transport to drive her to work.
""If I was to walk from my house to a bus stop, I couldn't make that,"" she said
Leanne Claussen, who has a disability, says she is unable to access community transport. (Supplied)
For months, Ms Claussen funded her own transport, but it became too expensive and impacted her ability to go to work.
""I was paying $120 return trip by Uber every single time I went to work,"" she said.
She said travelling to work was costing more than she earned.
Ms Claussen, who was deemed not eligible for the NDIS, now receives support through My Aged Care for taxi rides but hoped to access community transport again.
She said the government needed to address the situation with community transport providers for other people with a disability.
Mr O'Toole wants the community transport sector to receive the same financial support as the taxi industry for transporting clients with a disability.
""If you do the work, you should get paid for it,"" he said.
TransitCare CEO Terry O'Toole says his company are refusing incoming referrals. (Supplied)
He said his company would make 18,000 trips for clients in wheelchairs every year — it had now jumped to nearly 30,000.
In Queensland, taxi companies received financial support such as a lift payment, where a driver of a wheelchair accessible taxi received an additional $25 for picking up a person who travelled in a wheelchair.
The lift payments are not part of the taxi fare so there are no additional cost to the person with a disability.
Mr O'Toole said it would make an ""enormous difference"" if community transport providers received the same payment.
""We can't provide anymore, and we certainly can't invest into any more vehicles because of the cost of vehicles that have gone up in the past five years,"" he said.
Queensland Transport Minister Brent Mickelberg said the state government supported transport services for people with disability, including through the Taxi Subsidy Scheme.

People With Disability Australia president Trinity Ford said accessible and affordable community transport was essential for people with disability to fully participate in society.

In total, the documents allege the mother deceived people, or dealt with money to a value totalling more than $20,000.
Previously, the court heard the six-year-old boy's head and eyebrows were shaved and that he was placed in a wheelchair and bandages to make it look like he had received radiotherapy.

Doctors and Medical Professionals","As a junior doctor in a busy New South Wales emergency department, Dr Fahad Khan expected long hours, high stress and the pressure of life-or-death decisions.
What he didn't expect was the creeping fear that his job might kill him.
Only weeks into his first year, after working multiple 15-hour shifts in a row, Dr Khan found himself slipping into microsleeps behind the wheel on the drive home.
""When I get to the lights I might fall asleep, and then I'll get a beep and a nice person swearing at me through the window.""

To survive the commute he came up with strategies: pulling over to nap or keeping a friend on the phone for the entire 40-minute drive.
For the past two months NSW doctors have taken to the streets, protesting what they say are dangerous working conditions — excessive hours, chronic understaffing and wages that are far below those of their peers interstate.
Their dispute with the NSW government has reached an impasse with no resolution in sight, according to the doctors' union, the Australian Salaried Medical Officers Federation (ASMOF).
Dr Khan, who is paid $38 an hour, said the situation is unsustainable.
A junior doctor in NSW makes $76,009 annually according to the award rate.
""I just think it's very disappointing that junior doctors have to, collectively, have a plan on how to not die when you're driving home,"" he said.
Dr Fahad Khan says one of his colleagues admitted to wetting the bed at night due to stress. (ABC News)
To endure the relentless pressure of the job, Dr Khan says he and his colleagues have found themselves confiding in each other about deeply personal, often distressing experiences.
He says he recalls one colleague getting kidney stones — twice — because he couldn't find the time to drink water or take a toilet break during punishing shifts.
Another doctor admitted to wetting the bed at night, overwhelmed by stress. One even discovered, to his horror, that he had soiled himself without realising it.
Dr Khan believes the NSW public health system has become toxic for doctors, with many fleeing to other states or leaving medicine altogether.
""An exodus would be a good way to describe it,"" he said.

Psychiatry registrar Dr Jemma Cho is one of them. Nine months ago she walked away from her medical career.
She had worked as a registrar at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney and Lismore Base Hospital, but says the working conditions left her emotionally depleted and disillusioned.
""I didn't feel like I was making a difference in the way that I wanted. I lost sense of meaning for my job and [it] just wasn't worth it anymore for me.""
Earlier this year, more then 200 NSW psychiatrists resigned from their jobs in protest over a pay dispute with the Minns government.
Their case will be decided by the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) which began hearing expert evidence on Wednesday.
Public hospital doctors went on strike over pay and conditions in Sydney in April. (ABC News: Abbey Haberecht)
In early April doctors across NSW walked off the job for three days in a rare and dramatic protest.
They called for a number of key changes including a guaranteed 10-hour break between shifts to ensure safe working hours, and pay parity with doctors in other states — which would require a 30 per cent increase.
But their demands were dismissed by the government as ""unrealistic"".
Premier Chris Minns said meeting those demands would cost taxpayers an additional $11 billion and further strain an already overburdened health budget.
Instead the government offered a 10.5 per cent pay rise spread over three years, an offer the doctors rejected.
Dr Tom Morrison says the NSW health system has ""deep cultural problems"". (Supplied)
Neurosurgery registrar Dr Tom Morrison, who represented the doctors during negotiations, said talks have stalled.
""I don't think it's ambitious to be asked to have safe working hours,"" Dr Morrison told 7.30.
""I don't think it's ambitious to not have to work 30 hours [continuously]  treating patients, and I don't think it's ambitious to be asked to be paid the same as every other state.""
Dr Morrison, based at Liverpool Hospital in Sydney, said tensions escalated sharply in the lead-up to the strike.
Two days before the planned walkout, the Department of Health sent a letter to doctors warning they could be referred to medical regulators if they proceeded.
The IRC had earlier ruled that doctors must not strike for at least three months.
Dr Morrison says he and his peers took that as a threat.
""These are bodies for serious professional misconduct, not for people who are standing up saying, 'we're working in an unsafe system',"" Dr Morrison said.

Then came the claim by the government that hundreds of chemotherapy appointments had been cancelled due to the strike. Days later Health minister Ryan Park's office admitted the information was incorrect.
Dr Morrison said the accusation was offensive and that he felt that the government was trying to suggest that doctors are putting patients' lives at risk.
""I don't think anything the government's done has encouraged doctors to work for NSW Health,"" he said.
Mr Park declined 7.30's request for an interview, and he didn’t respond to questions. Instead his office pointed to his statements made in previous press conferences.

While he sympathises with the NSW doctors' demands, including calls for a pay rise, Professor Braithwaite believes that increasing salaries won't solve the deeper issues within the system.
Many public hospitals are not operating efficiently, Professor Braithwaite says. (ABC News: Paulina Vidal)
""There's a case for them to be paid more … but after that you just reckon you deserved it, and that's what you're worth now — so it's only a sugar hit,"" he said.
Professor Braithwaite's research into modern healthcare systems, including NSW's public hospitals, has revealed that many of them could operate much more efficiently.
His findings show that 60 per cent of healthcare provided is of high quality, 30 per cent is wasted due to bureaucracy or inefficiencies, and 10 per cent results in actual harm to patients, including accidents and errors.
Shifting these numbers, he said, is essential for meaningful reform.
""These numbers have remained fairly sticky for a couple of decades,"" he said.
""It's not good enough"".

But five weeks out from the closure of the private maternity ward, the NT government is yet to secure private providers to deliver these services.
The closure of two major private maternity units in Darwin and Hobart are the latest in a long-running problem with birthing units closing around the country. Here's why it's happening.
Chief Minister Lia Finocchiaro said the tender process was still underway, but ""everything with the transition is on track"".
She was also confident RDH could take on the estimated 300 extra births per year.
""A lot of the staff who were in the maternity ward at the private hospital are now coming across to the public system,"" she told ABC Radio Darwin.
In announcing its Darwin closure, Healthscope said maternity services at Hobart Private Hospital would also close in August.

Federal Solomon MP Luke Gosling said the NT government had not requested similar support from the Commonwealth — a claim Ms Finocchiaro didn't deny.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-07/cold-water-immersion-does-science-support-hype/105237890,Evidence yet to back up claimed benefits of cold water therapy,"Topic:
Health","Every week in the UK, thousands of mostly middle-aged women take the plunge into freezing cold seawater.
Members of the ""Bluetits Chill Swimmers"" say the initiative has drastically improved their lives, but the jury is still out on the benefits of cold water immersion (CWI).
From ice baths to cold showers, the claimed benefits of CWI are prolific; a strengthened immune system, anti-inflammatory effects, mood boosts and improved sleep, among others.
But experts say there is more evidence for the harmful nature of CWI than its benefits — the nature of which remains ""speculative"" and ""anecdotal"".
In a paper published earlier this year, a group of researchers from the University of South Australia sought to answer the question of whether science supports the cold water fad.
Given that the benefits of CWI are increasingly marketed to the public, they looked for studies on the general population (rather than elite athletes).
ABC Sport and Deakin University have partnered to produce the first ABC Elite Athletes in Australian Women's Sport Survey.
They found just 11 papers considered ""quality"" enough to include, with a range of conflicting findings.
Researchers were unable to find any evidence of mood improvements, but some evidence for decreased stress levels (albeit only 12 hours after CWI).
They likewise failed to find any evidence of a positive impact on immune function.
But in a quirky finding, one of the 11 studies concluded that those who underwent CWI had a 29 per cent reduction in sickness absence. There was a twist, however: while this group took less leave from work, they reported being ill for the same number of days as other participants.
Tara Cain, a research assistant and lead author on the project, admits this is difficult to interpret.
""It could be that they had better resilience or willingness to push through, just based on their involvement in the trial,"" she said.

""We don't want being part of a study to affect how people act in their general life, but they could have wanted to make the effort to keep going to work, even if they were sick.""
The research team also found some evidence of improvements to sleep quality when CWI was combined with heat training, as well as self-reported quality of life measures, but Ms Cain cautions against drawing too much from their analysis.
There was no consensus among the papers, for example, on the method of CWI (e.g. ice baths vs cold showers), duration of CWI or cold water temperature, while only one study included female participants.
""I think the overarching message from this study is that there's such limited evidence out there that needs to be explored more to apply to the general population,"" Ms Cain said.
""Most of the information that's out there on social media is word of mouth, and anecdotal evidence.
Mike Tipton, a cold water expert from the University of Portsmouth in the UK, agrees there is little evidence to support the ""positive"" impacts of CWI.
In fact, Professor Tipton is comfortable claiming just one ""evidence-based"" benefit of CWI: ""perceived mental health benefits"", as illustrated in the example of the Bluetits.
The Bluetits Chill Swimmers are a popular group in the UK.  (Supplied: Bluetits Chill Swimmers)
""I've had some of the Bluetits ladies come up to me in tears telling me how this has changed their life, how they used to have mental health problems and don't have them anymore,"" he said.
""The problem with that is that the evidence is anecdotal. Anecdotal evidence is still evidence, but it's the weakest form.
""It's fine if that's what they want to do: I'm definitely not the fun police … but I want to make sure that I give them information to make sure they can do it as safely as possible.
""And as a scientist, I want to understand: what is the mechanism [that produces the effect]?""
Unfortunately, Professor Tipton says, there is much more evidence for how dangerous CWI is (than how beneficial).
As he explains it, human beings are ""tropical"" animals who ideally want to exist naked, in 26-28 degree air.
Taking that animal and plunging it into cold water (which he defines as 15 degrees Celsius or lower) induces a state of physiological stress termed ""cold shock"".
A lot of evidence around cold water immersion is anecdotal. (Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images)
At worst, cold shock is a precursor to drowning and cardiac arrest. As a standard occurrence, it will produce an acute inflammatory response.
""The body responds with a 'fight or flight' response driven by the sympathetic nervous system … [because] as far as it's concerned, it's under attack,"" Professor Tipton said.
As dangerous as cold water shock can be, it's also what might drive the potential ""benefits"" of CWI.
Repeated exposure to cold water, Professor Tipton explains, might ""habituate"" the body to this type of inflammatory stress response, with potential future benefits.
""Habituation is a decreased response to repeated stimuli… and a reduction in the alerting response that you get,"" he said.
Most people will have their ""worst"" reaction to an ice bath the second time they try it — because they're well aware of how cold it's going to be.

""After that, their 'stress' response will start to decline to the point where it's generally halved with about six three-minute immersions,"" Professor Tipton said.
Theoretically, he adds, CWI could be beneficial if the body learns to adapt this habituation response to other types of stress.
""At a cellular level, it may make you more resilient to stressors that evoke those kinds of responses,"" he said.
At present, however, he can point to only one study that lends weight to this theory.
His team conducted an experiment where they looked at people's responses to training at altitude.
They split participants into two groups, with both exercising in an altitude chamber. One group then did repeated warm water immersions, and the other did cold water immersions.
The cold water group performed much better in the second altitude training session than the warm water group.

""So the hypothesis is that the benefit that comes from cold water immersion is that physiologically you can habituate to stress. You become less responsive to those stressors, and maybe that generalises to other stressors.""
As promising as the ""habituation"" theory may be, Professor Tipton warns that the evidence base is still largely ""speculative"".
It's also possible that CWI could be subject to placebo effects.
Professor Tipton references a study from 2023 that looked at whether athletes who underwent CWI after a soccer match would see improvements in their recovery outcomes.
The athletes were split into three groups. One group underwent CWI, one group simply rested, and one was given a placebo: a drink they were told had been shown to reduce inflammation and improve muscle recovery.
Both the CWI and placebo groups showed improvements in recovery over the ""rest"" group, suggesting CWI may be no better than placebo (but still produces an effect).
According to Professor Tipton, the question of whether CWI is better than other forms of ""active"" recovery (such as walking, or yoga) is also unanswered.
As he puts it, this is the problem with most claims on the ""benefits"" of CWI: we still don't understand the ""mechanism"" behind its positive effects.
Going back to the anecdotal claims of the Bluetits Chill Swimmers, Professor Tipton argues there are many beneficial factors at play:
""Nobody has really done properly controlled studies to isolate the active ingredient in the experience of going for a dip… is [the benefit] coming from green therapy, blue therapy, exercise, meeting people, having cake and coffee, or all and any of those?""",KBy Kate O'Halloran,Wed 7 May

He doesn’t quite remember the trip there.
“I think I was quite stressed at the time and running on adrenaline,” Mr Craig said.

For as long as he can remember, the 34-year-old knew he wanted to be a dad.

Experiencing a busy and stressful few weeks after the birth, Mr Craig said his feelings started to change.
“I was on the edge. I just didn't really feel like myself.
He started losing his appetite and his sleep patterns also changed, which were characterised by the heightened stress and anxiety.
“I was in fight or flight mode. [I] didn't really know where to turn to, or who to talk to,” he said.
Ms Dawe said it was difficult watching these events impact her partner's mental health.
""It was an acutely stressful couple of weeks for our new little family and I think we both felt pretty powerless in the situation,"" she said.
The new father, who had a history of depression, then picked up the phone for help.
Mr Craig was at a medical appointment with his newborn son when he broke into tears.
“It just went from zero to 100 quite quickly in a very short amount of time,” he said.
Mr Craig called ForWhen, a free national helpline connecting new and expecting parents with mental health support.
“I immediately knew that they were familiar with what I was feeling,” he said.
The ForWhen clinicians have expertise in perinatal and infant mental health, which spans from the start of pregnancy to when the child is 12 months old.
The service also helps people who have recently lost a baby.
Erin Duncan is a Victorian care navigator with the service.
She said there had been an influx of new fathers calling in since ForWhen launched three years ago.
“We’ve absolutely seen an increase in the number of men. More often they’re referred by their partner or a health professional,” she said.
Erin Duncan regularly follows up with callers to check in on their mental health. (ABC News: Costa Haritos)
The service has supported more than 7,500 parents over the past three years, including hundreds of men.
Each phone call typically begins with a conversation about what the caller is experiencing, before a screening process to understand the stress on their family.
“Often it can be really hard for men to reach out for support, particularly in the perinatal period where they might see their needs are secondary to their partner's,” Ms Duncan said.
“If dads don’t reach out for support, then it’s going to impact the whole family.
“They kind of take a bit of a back role and put themselves second to everyone else.""
About 12 per cent of callers are from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, including a growing number of Indigenous couples.
ForWhen will often check in on people after their initial phone call to help parents navigate the complex journey into parenthood.
“It’s probably one of the biggest transitions that we go through in life, being a new parent,” Ms Duncan said.
Sean Menere is a counsellor at Solid Foundations in Melbourne’s inner-west, and has also seen more men seeking support.
“Postnatal depression in men is an abstract concept that people just haven’t really thought of up until the point that they’re experiencing it,” he said.
About one in 10 fathers experience poor mental health during the pregnancy phase or their child’s first year.
Researchers say those with a partner experiencing postnatal depression may be at risk.
Other contributing factors include a history of mental illness, relationship dissatisfaction and low family income.

“There’s emotional peaks and troughs that you may not have experienced before,” Mr Menere said.

“I think everything that I've gone through and my family's gone through, led me to pursue a different career, which is in counselling,” he said.
Mr Craig has completed his first trimester of study, while his son recently had his first birthday. Weeks later, he and Maddy got married.
He said since seeking professional help, he has become a better husband, father, and had more important conversations with his friends.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-07/homeless-housing-crisis-commercial-building-conversion/105088250,How an empty building in Melbourne's CBD was transformed into a home,"Topic:
Public Housing","Wrapped around the entrance of a building in Melbourne's CBD is a glossy artwork depicting a dark sky with luminous stars.
Perhaps it says here is a place where it will be possible to dream again — or at least get a good night's sleep.
Beyond the starry foyer is a six-story council-owned building. Called Make Room, it has been transformed into 50 homes for people who were experiencing homelessness. Before it was renovated, the building was being used for storage by the City of Melbourne. A graveyard of parade floats and memorabilia from past Moomba Festivals sat gathering dust in otherwise empty rooms.
In the middle of a housing crisis, when a sizeable amount of commercial real estate is sitting vacant, the Make Room project is billed as a blueprint for giving under-utilised buildings new life as residential spaces and lowering carbon emissions in the process.
And at a time when some councils are criminalising homelessness, Make Room is looking for a solution.
James King, CEO of non-profit housing provider Unison Housing which operates Make Room, says he's unaware of any other projects where a local council has taken the lead on addressing housing shortages and homelessness in this way. ""They put the property up and then they also underwrote the entire project,"" he says.

The empty building Make Room took over is a relic of a bygone young city. These days it is dwarfed by the glassy skyscrapers that surround it. When it was built as an electricity supply building it helped power ""the expansion of the city"", according to heritage review documents. Now, it might help create the city of the future again.
Almost a fifth of Melbourne's office spaces are empty, according to the Property Council of Australia – the highest CBD office vacancy in the country. While the national vacancy rate — for both CBD and non-CBD offices — was 14.7 per cent in January when the data was collated.
From a sustainability perspective, repurposing and recycling — rather than demolishing an existing structure and building a new one — is desirable. Building a new structure uses more materials and creates more embodied carbon — the carbon emissions associated with the materials and construction process.
But converting commercial buildings, particularly offices, into homes pose challenges.
The idea of turning offices underused in the wake of COVID into housing is a hot topic. But experts say such projects are few and far between in Australia for a reason, and creating affordable housing from office buildings is harder than it seems.
Gavin Salt of i2C Architects, which designed Make Room, says improving the building's accessibility and thermal performance while working within a heritage overlay was the most challenging aspect of the project. But Salt says the building had some characteristics (""great floor to floor heights and access to natural day light… [and] shape and building structure"") which lent itself easily to conversion — something many office buildings don't have.
The City of Melbourne has established guidelines to encourage building owners to repurpose under-utilised mid-tier office buildings — and improve their energy efficiency. Melbourne Lord Mayor Nick Reece says such transformations are key to addressing ""urban challenges such as a growing housing shortage”. It is also central to the council’s aim of reaching 100 per cent renewable energy use by 2030 and zero net emissions by 2040.
In 2023, then-Lord Major Sally Capp said commercial buildings accounted for “almost 60 per cent of the city’s carbon emissions”. “Melbourne needs to retrofit about 80 properties each year to meet our climate goals. Currently, we average seven,” she said.
Across the county, the commercial building sector is responsible for around 25 per cent of overall electricity use and 10 per cent of total carbon emissions in Australia, according to the federal environment department.

Make Room, which cost $24.9 million – $9.1 million paid by council and the rest by the state government and philanthropists – gives residents 12-month leases in small, self-contained studio apartments along with support-staff to help them build a life off the streets (this includes access to specialist health services such as mental health care, podiatry, physiotherapy, dietetics and dental care).
The Victorian government has provided $5.2 million over two years for on-site support and tenancy management. It did not respond to specific ABC questions asking if it would continue to fund Make Room after the initial operational funding is exhausted.
Make Room follows many of the principles of the Housing First policy developed in the US in the 1990s, which gives people experiencing homelessness immediate permanent housing, then provides wrap-around support services. The model doesn't place conditions, such as adherence to mental health or drug and alcohol treatment programs, as a prerequisite.
Celine Kostense, Unison's Housing First Practice Lead, says if people ""don't have to worry 'where am I going to sleep tonight?' what we see is that they can focus on different areas in their lives"". Maybe this is re-connecting with family, addressing health or substance abuse issues, learning how to become a responsible tenant, striving for a job or education or contributing to their local community.
Kostense, who is Dutch and has worked on Housing First programs in the Netherlands, says she'll never forget the first time she gave someone the keys to their own house in Amsterdam. ""It wasn't just the house, it was her life… That made me feel like I can literally work together with someone to create a new life.""

According to a 2022 evidence review by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, the Housing First model is ""highly effective"" in providing housing stability to people with a history of homelessness and a ""cost effective"" way to support people with complex needs.
But King calls Make Room a ""quasi"" Housing First project because it doesn't provide permanent housing — possibly the most fundamental aspect of the model. ""We're applying Housing First principles in the sense that it's trauma informed, it's immediate, there aren't conditions on [people] moving into the building and we address a range of other needs once they're housed, but that long-term permanent, secure housing I think is a really critical element [of Housing First].""
There is a question mark hanging above residents' heads at Make Room: where will they go next?
Make Room aims to transition residents into long-term accommodation within 12 months, but King says the time frame is flexible.
""If that housing and support is not available come the 12 months, I'm not in the business of making people homeless again. So those residents will stay,"" he says.
Part of Make Room's purpose, according to King, is breaking down stigma among housing providers who see former rough sleepers as ""a challenging cohort to house"".
""We're hoping that their time at Make Room will give a lot of Community Housing providers confidence that … [residents] can sustain a tenancy, that they can abide by their lease agreement, and they can be meaningful contributors to that community,"" he says.
One of the studio apartments at Make Room, which architect Gavin Salt says demonstrates the viability of converting commercial spaces to residential.
Then there is the larger problem that up to this point no-one has been able to solve: there simply isn't enough housing available. There are now more than 55,000 people on the waitlist for social housing in Victoria alone. Even if social housing were available, many residents would need continued supportive accommodation after their time at Make Room, King says.
The City of Melbourne's attempt to fund a pathway out of homelessness is a marked contrast to councils seeking to penalise rough sleepers. Recently, Moreton Bay Council declared all homeless camping on public land would be illegal and then began throwing homeless campers' tents into garbage trucks. In nearby Brisbane, Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner threatened to move on homeless people.
And in Melbourne, The Age reported that City of Port Phillip councillors are investigating changing local laws to prohibit people from sleeping rough on council land. (Although City of Port Phillip is also contributing $5.1 million to the development of 26 social housing units.)
""We're in the middle of a housing and homelessness crisis… we all need to play our part in creating and finding a solution,"" Melbourne Lord Mayor Nick Reece says.
Reece presides over a city which has an estimated shortfall of 6,000 affordable rentals. ""If we do nothing this will almost quadruple to more than 23,000 by 2036,"" he says.
Make Room demonstrates, according to Salt, ""the viability of converting commercial spaces to residential"" and he hopes it will inspire other projects.
""We need to look at innovative ways of providing more housing quicker and more efficiently,"" he says.
His colleague Claire Bowles says: ""There is a huge danger we won't meet our environmental commitments if we don't accelerate the case for the productive use of empty and underperforming buildings.
""Not only for the sake of sufficiency and embodied carbon but also for much needed housing and social infrastructure quicker and at a lower cost.""",Rhiannon Stevens,Wed 7 May

Safety","One of Australia's largest fast food outlets has been fined more than $150,000 after giving away thousands of free toys in meals without warning that they included deadly button batteries.
Hungry Jack's dispatched 27,850 Garfield toys powered by button batteries over 10 days in May last year, before recalling them.
The fast food chain was fined $150,240 for breaching Australian Consumer Law. (AAP: Mick Tsikas)
They included no warning about the button batteries the toys contained, or the risk they posed to children.
The toys otherwise complied with the national safety standard.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has the power to fine companies up to $10 million for breaches of consumer law or 10 per cent of annual turnover, depending on which is higher.
Aside from the lack of warning, the toys complied with the national safety standard. (Supplied: ACCC)
Hungry Jack's had an estimated revenue close to $2 billion last financial year.
For this breach, the ACCC fined the fast-food chain $150,240.
In a statement, Hungry Jack's said it took ""immediate steps to stop distribution, issue a product recall"" and contact its suppliers and authorities last year.
Andrea Shoesmith's four-year-old daughter Summer Steer died on Queensland's Sunshine Coast in 2013 after ingesting a button battery.
Ms Shoesmith has since campaigned against their use in Australia, which helped usher in new laws in 2023.

She said for Hungry Jack's to pay such a small fine relative to its revenue was ""disgusting"".
""If they've given out 27,000 of them, don't tell me there's not going to be one child affected by it, because there will be,"" she said.
The lithium button batteries are about the size of a 10-cent piece, and if swallowed can burn a hole through the oesophagus, and into organs or the spine.
""You go to Hungry Jack's and get a meal and get a loaded gun, and just hope for the best.""
Summer Steer was the first Australian child to die from swallowing a button battery. (Supplied: Andrea Shoesmith)
Kidsafe Queensland chief executive Susan Teerds said that unless someone realised immediately that a battery had been swallowed, it may take time for symptoms to show.
Baby Adèle is now on the road to recovery, but two months ago she was in intensive care after swallowing a button battery.
""Particularly if the button battery is now flat, it might not work your remote control to the garage door but it can still cause catastrophic injuries,"" she said.
Ms Teerds said even if the toys officially met the standard, they remained dangerous.
""Just because a product has a screw-down battery compartment, it doesn't mean that it is still a safe product,"" she said.
Susan Teerds says people should keep button batteries out of their homes. (ABC News)
Ms Shoesmith feared that even parents who were aware of the danger of button batteries may not know the Garfield toys had them because there was no warning.
""There will be some child that gets sick or dies from it, like Summer,"" she said.
""They just shouldn't be available, let alone putting them in child's packaging from Hungry Jack's. That's ridiculous.""
If someone believes a child has ingested a battery, they should call the Poisons Information Centre on 131126.

Emergency Services","Workplace bullying is a ""pervasive and deeply ingrained issue"" within the Tasmania Fire Service and State Emergency Service, and sexual harassment is ""prevalent, underreported, and often minimised"", a workplace culture review has found.
The independent cultural review, led by former Australian Sex Discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick, included a survey of 1,057 employees and volunteers, 140 confidential individual sessions, small group sessions, 24 confidential written submissions, and a review of literature, policies and organisational documents.
The review found bullying was ""widespread and persistent, across all seniorities and ranks"", according to survey respondents. (Tasmania Fire Service)
Tasmanian Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Jeremy Smith said the report acknowledged the culture was changing for the better, ""but TFS and SES has work to do to strengthen belonging and safety"", something he said the organisations were committed to.
Jeremy Smith told employees and volunteers ""who have been harmed by these behaviours, I am deeply sorry for the hurt you experienced"". (ABC News: Luke Bowden)
""Participants in the review highlighted a persistent boys' club"" mentality within the TFS and SES, ""contributing to exclusionary practices and a culture of manipulation and division,"" the report reads.
""This sentiment was echoed by all genders, demonstrating how the 'in-group versus out-group' dynamic affects various demographics.
""Participants described an environment where those within the inner circle received opportunities for training, advancement, and inclusion, while those on the outside faced isolation, limited opportunities, and a lack of support.
The review found while there had been some positive developments within the TFS and SES, namely stronger mental health support, emerging inclusive leadership, and a growing recognition of a need for change, challenges remained.
""Issues such as exclusionary practices, perceptions of favouritism, and divisions between different workforce groups continue to impact workplace culture,"" the report reads.
The review also found exclusion and bias persisted across various groups, including culturally and linguistically diverse individuals, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, LGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities and people who are neurodivergent.
The review found that the ""predominant belief"" among those who participated in the review was that bullying was ""widespread and persistent, across all seniorities and ranks"".
Of the participants, 23 per cent said they had experienced bullying in the past five years, and 15 per cent said they had experienced bullying in the past year.
The report found one in six, or 15 per cent, of respondents indicated they had experienced sexual harassment in the past five years — and one in 10, or 10 per cent, had experienced sexual harassment in the past year. (Tasmania SES)
For the TFS and SES, employees were more likely to report they had experienced bullying in the past five years (39 per cent and 38 per cent respectively) compared with TFS and SES volunteers (20 per cent and 22 per cent respectively).
One participant told the reviewer:
""I managed many staff in my previous job. In my entire time in that work, I've never seen what I've seen at TFS. [The bullying], it's been some of the darkest and most inhumane behaviour I've ever experienced. It's been damaging.""
""The data presented highlights the widespread nature of bullying, the serious health and wellbeing impacts for those affected, and the systemic cultural factors that allow it to persist,"" the report reads.
The review found there were some within the TFS and SES who perceived bullying as ""harmless banter or a matter of individual resilience"", but that:
""The overwhelming evidence suggests that bullying is a serious and systemic problem that cannot be ignored. A culture of silence, fear of retaliation, and lack of effective leadership intervention have allowed these behaviours have allowed these behaviours to persist.""
According to the report, as of June last year, 22 per cent of the TFS workforce was made up of women, up slightly from 18 per cent in 2020.
Of the 4,581 TFS volunteers, 79 per cent are male. TFS leadership roles are almost entirely occupied by men.
There are 711 SES volunteers, of whom approximately 35 per cent are female.
The review found that while there had been ""notable progress"" in relation to gender inclusion, ""significant barriers"" remained.
""Despite broad agreement that sexism is 'not tolerated,'"" the lived experiences of many women within the TFS and SES suggest otherwise. Everyday sexism, negative attitudes toward gender equality, and ongoing structural barriers continue to shape their experiences,"" the report reads.
""Some women report being undermined, overlooked for opportunities, or subjected to inappropriate behaviour, while men in the service have expressed concerns — often unfounded — about women's capability and the perceived impact of diversity efforts on merit-based selection.""
One participant said:
""I know what the organisation wants to hear—there's a massive push for gender equality, aiming for a 50/50 balance between males and females.
""But over the last 15 years, I haven't seen a white, male career firefighter featured in any of the organisation's materials. The pendulum has swung too far the other way.""
The review also found sexual harassment remained ""prevalent, underreported, and often minimised by those in positions of influence"".
It also found one in six, or 15 per cent, of respondents indicated they had experienced sexual harassment in the past five years — and one in 10, or 10 per cent, had experienced sexual harassment in the past year.
""The reluctance to acknowledge or address these behaviours perpetuates a culture where inappropriate conduct is tolerated, creating harm not only for individuals but for the overall effectiveness and reputation of the TFS and SES,"" the report reads.
The culture within the services ""remains dominated by an 'Alpha male' mentality"", the report found. (Tasmania Fire Service: A Zelinski)
Mr Smith said the experiences of bullying and sexual harassment were ""unacceptable"".
""I am committed, along with the SFC [State Fire Commission] and the TFS and SES Executive, to building safe and respectful workplaces.
""Today, the Executive and I have signed a Statement of Commitment, which is a declaration of our intent to act on the findings of the report and hold ourselves to account as leaders.

After months of preparation, Travis McElligott, 32, ran from Mount Isa to Gregory over the Labour Day long weekend in Queensland, with a team of passionate locals helping him raise more than $25,000.
The gruelling outback conditions — mouthfuls of flies, dust in the lungs, and a few run-ins with nature — were never going to stop Mr McElligott from getting his message out.

""We've lost some people close to us and I see a lot of people that that have lost friends,"" said Mr McElligott, who lives in Mount Isa.
""I decided to get off my arse and run 300 kilometres to raise awareness and a bit of money for mental health.""
Mr McElligott was joined by others on and off over the long three days. (ABC North West Qld: Maddie Nixon)
It's a sentiment shared by others in outback Queensland including Tony ""Tonka"" Toholke, the founder of Mount Isa's International Men's Day.
He became an advocate in the community after his own battle with mental health.

""I text them to check in on them, and every second week they come to my house, and we talk sh*t.""
Until professional services become easier to access, Mr Toholke said remote and regional locations like Mount Isa had to find ""small, community-based solutions"".

""We'll give them a bit of money to go to programs and get some help, because obviously, help is great to have, but it's also very expensive,"" Mr Toholke said.
Mr McElligott backed up his three-day run with the legendary Gregory River Canoe Marathon the following day.
The gruelling feat took a toll.
""I didn't think it was going to be that hard, but the end of day two was probably the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life,"" he said.

""We've constantly tried to eradicate the birds from the building but it doesn't seem to matter how many spikes, bits and pieces you do,"" he said.
Local bakery owner Emily Nguyen said the pigeons were more than an eyesore, they were also taking a financial toll.

Health","Medical professionals are at odds over whether a Victorian program that allowed patients to skip the GP and seek treatment from a pharmacist should be extended when the pilot ends in June.
The state government said it provided people, particularly women, with quick and inexpensive access to basic medicine and prescriptions.
But GPs argued it could put patients at risk because pharmacists were not trained to diagnose serious medical conditions that ""frequently masquerade as simple symptoms"".
Shepparton pharmacist Kate Boswell's pharmacy has participated in Victoria's Community Pharmacist Statewide Pilot since 2023.
It allowed the pharmacy to prescribe treatments for mild skin conditions and uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI).
Ms Boswell said the pharmacy also administered vaccines for travellers and helped people by prescribing medication without them having to wait for a GP appointment.
Ms Boswell wants to see the pharmacist pilot expanded to include more conditions. (ABC Shepparton: Charmaine Manuel)
""So we gave her medication, she had her wedding the day after, and then she went off and saw the doctor the following week and [they] confirmed it was shingles.""
Ms Boswell acknowledged that not all pharmacists would find the pilot suitable and some patients could be concerned about being treated outside of a doctor's office.
Carlie Streeter is a pharmacist based in Horsham, in Victoria's west, who also participated in the pilot.
She said pharmacists had to undertake extra training and the program was ""not about replacing the job of a GP"".
""We're absolutely working in partnership with them,"" she said.
""It's about … helping out when there is a need.""
Kialla West patient Garry Ainsworth participated in the pilot program.
Before he travelled to South Africa last December he received a hepatitis B vaccine from Ms Boswell's pharmacy.
""[It was] no different to going to the doctor as far as professionalism goes,"" Mr Ainsworth said.
He said an expansion of the pilot would benefit regional Victorians.
Garry Ainsworth says the program meant he didn't have to wait to see a GP. (Supplied: Garry Ainsworth)
However, he did have reservations about some treatments.
""I don't know about going to pharmacies for some other things — if I had a UTI I'd have to think about that a bit more, I suppose,"" he said.
""But for vaccinations, that's a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned.""
Australian Medical Association Victorian branch president Jill Tomlinson said she wanted to see a detailed evaluation of the program before any decision was made to expand it.
""The cost effectiveness, the clinical efficiency and the impact of the pharmacy pilot programme remains unclear,"" she said.
""So in the absence of publicly available evaluation data, we really can't assess whether the programme has delivered value for money or improved healthcare outcomes.""
Dr Jill Tomlinson says a detailed evaluation of the pilot needs to be conducted and released publicly. (ABC News)
Dr Tomlinson said Victoria's government was fiscally vulnerable and the AMA wanted more focus on improving preventative healthcare, claiming it would save $14 for every dollar invested.
Data from the Pharmacy Guild of Australia Victoria branch showed a third of Victorians were likely to pay for pharmacy services to prescribe available medications, rather than wait for a GP.
Pharmacy Guild Victoria branch president George Tambassis said treatments for asthma, nausea and hayfever should be included in the pilot.
""Making the program permanent, and broadening its scope, will give people greater control over their health while easing pressure on GPs and hospital emergency departments,"" he said.
A Victorian government spokesperson said health funding would be confirmed in the May 20 budget, with a focus on supporting families and frontline health services.
""Women are overwhelmingly reaping the benefits of this pilot, transforming what has previously been a difficult process to access basic UTI care or a quick pill prescription, into a simple and cost effective one,"" the spokesperson said.
The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) Victoria chair Anita Munoz said the expansion of the community pharmacist pilot was cause for concern.
""While pharmacists are trained in pharmacy and medicines, their training doesn't include the complexities of assessing patients and making diagnoses.
""Serious medical conditions frequently masquerade as simple symptoms; a UTI may well be herpes, and what looks like eczema can be a sign of underlying disease.""
Dr Anita Munoz says patient safety must come first. (Supplied)
Dr Munoz said the RACGP was also concerned about pharmacists prescribing medications because they stood to profit from it.
She said having pharmacists work within a general practice environment was the ""optimal way"" to provide care.

Cannabis","Australian farmers are warning of ""catastrophic failures"" in the medicinal cannabis industry if the government does not reduce its reliance on international imports.
A newly formed alliance argues gaps in supply are being plugged by lower-quality imports that it says are flooding the market.
A country's permitted supply is decided based on its demand for medicinal cannabis, but it may require imports when it cannot meet that level.
Domestic farmers say they could meet demand themselves, but due to rigorous and expensive licensing processes, local farmers say they are struggling to compete with cheaper imports.
Some have outsourced parts of their business overseas in an attempt to compete, something that is driving up costs.
The newly formed Australian Cannabis Cultivators Guild has warned of a ""bleak reality"" ahead if changes are not made to advantage local growers. (ABC Rural: Laurissa Smith)
The Australian Cannabis Cultivators Guild was formed on the back of Australian farmers' concerns. Its membership comprises more than 80 per cent of domestic-licensed medical cannabis production.
In a letter to the federal health minister, the guild warned of a ""bleak reality"" ahead.
""Without change, we expect to see catastrophic failures across local cultivators, resulting in bankruptcies which will impact Australian supply in the long term,"" the guild wrote.
The federal health minister has been contacted for comment.
The Therapuetic Goods Administration says it has brought in requirements for overseas manufacturers of medicinal cannabis, but local growers say they are still disadvantaged. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)
In 2023, 61 per cent of medicinal cannabis in Australia was imported, according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).
The TGA said in a statement it introduced requirements for overseas manufacturers, resulting in equivalent standards for all products supplied in Australia, regardless of where they're made.
""This addressed Australian producers' concerns about lack of a 'level playing field', which placed a higher regulatory burden on them due to the requirement for them to manufacture under GMP [Good Manufacturing Practice] in Australia,"" it said.
Tasmanian farmer Cade Turland said he and other farmers still faced inequities, believing overseas processes were not as lengthy or restrictive as those they had to undergo.
Australian medicinal cannabis growers are concerned about what they say is an unequal market. (ABC Rural: Laurissa Smith)
He said he worried imports were not regulated or tested as thoroughly as locally grown products.
The TGA said all products must comply with the Australian Quality Standard for medicinal cannabis.
Mr Turland said establishing a growing facility took anywhere between two and four years, meaning money was ""tied up for a long period of time"".
He said Australian farmers pay about $50,000 annually to maintain their medicinal cannabis licences, including costs like random and routine inspections, which were between $4,800 and $12,800.
According to the TGA, there are no fees for a licence and permit to import medicinal cannabis.
Mr Turland says setting up a medicinal cannabis growing facility can take anywhere between two and four years. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)
Speaking as part of the new alliance, Mr Turland said it was unfair that countries such as Canada — which is the biggest importer into Australia — can import to Australia, but does not allow Australia's exports in return.
""Because they have an oversupply and we have an under supply … what we find is that we don't even have access to these same markets,"" Mr Turland said.
Laws around cannabis use are changing in countries like France and Germany, and Australian farmers are hoping to make millions.
Mr Turland said domestic producers outsourcing production overseas meant Australia was missing out on an estimated 5,500 jobs.
The TGA said there were 29 cultivation and production permits and 10 manufacture permits for medicinal cannabis in Australia.
Mr Turland said that could meet local demand but ""imports are constantly stifling that growth for domestic producers"".
""This … flood of imports is ultimately squashing the ability for domestic producers to meet domestic demand,"" he said.
The TGA said the Office of Drug Control (ODC) published the amount of approved domestic cultivation on its website.
""As demand for medicinal cannabis continues to grow in Australia, the ODC is not able to comment on future supply needs and commercial decisions of licence holders to grow product.""
Mr Turland wants to see a domestic-first policy which would allow Australian growers to fill the supply amount permitted by the government, before handing importers any portion leftover — as happens with other industries.
The TGA said the decision on whether to enforce an Australian-first policy was not a decision for the ODC.
Craig Knight's business, Tasmanian Botanics, grows and manufactures cannabis into products on site.
Mr Knight said that meant imported cannabis products ""doesn't really affect us too much"".
""We're … set to compete,"" he said.
Craig Knight's business grows and manufactures medicinal cannabis products. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)
But Mr Knight acknowledged the current climate was challenging for others.
The amount of money Australians are spending on medicinal cannabis continues to skyrocket, with new data showing this year's sales are on track to double those from 2023.
Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson — who uses medicinal cannabis to treat chronic pain — said the current system ""alarmed"" him, and that he'd be raising the issue in parliament.
""I support the most rigorous standards possible to make sure that the medicine that we use is appropriate, that it's been checked, and that it goes through the appropriate checks and balances.""
Senator Whish-Wilson said he feared local growers would not immediately be able to make the move to manufacturing medicinal cannabis products.
The TGA said there were only two medicinal cannabis products approved on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) — Sativex (nabiximols) which is used to treat certain patients with multiple sclerosis and Epidyolex (cannabidiol) which is used for patients with certain seizure disorders.
""However, most medicinal cannabis products accessed in Australia are not on the ARTG and are referred to as 'unapproved' therapeutic goods,"" the agency said.
It said unapproved products were not assessed by the TGA for quality, safety or efficacy, and could only be accessed via the Special Access Scheme, the Authorised Prescriber Scheme and clinical trials.

But the tables turned two years ago when he acquired a permanent brain injury, forcing his mum — now 95 years of age — to become his full-time carer.
Dan, now 66, became ill in 2023 after contracting meningitis. The infection spread to his brain and he spent several months in hospital, including two months unconscious.
He needs support initiating most tasks, including those around the house, and requires supervision.
Ros Collins says finding the best fit for Dan has been difficult.  (ABC NEWS: Patrick Stone)
Ms Collins thought her son would be able to get support from the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), but because he's over 65, he's not eligible.
The day someone turns 65, they can no longer apply for the scheme. Dan was unconscious in hospital on his 65th birthday.
The age cap on the NDIS has long frustrated those it precludes and been the subject of discrimination claims. The government has repeatedly said the scheme was not set up to cater for older Australians and that is what the aged care system is for.

After trying various aged care options and finding them inappropriate, Ms Collins decided to bring her son home.
While Dan's savings and superannuation currently pay for a private carer and other services such as day programs, those funds will soon run dry.
Ms Collins said she was furious Dan could not access the NDIS and was worried about what would happen to him when she died.

Carolyn Smith, senior advocate at the Council for Intellectual Disability (CID), said it was common for elderly people who have adult children with disability to have those kinds of fears, even if they're eligible for government support.
She said while planning for death was difficult to think about, it was critical to not leave it ""until it's too late"".

Giving her son Eli autonomy over his own life has been a huge focus for Perth mother Jaquie Mills, 56.
Eli, 34, was born with Angelman syndrome, a genetic disorder causing developmental disability and nerve symptoms, which impacts every aspect of his life, including cognitive function and speech.

He loves music, theatre, trains and volunteering at the Perth Fringe Festival every year.
""What I really love and respect about Eli is his passion for life. He's got so many interests and he's so enthusiastic about them,"" Ms Mill said.
Eli has been living in his own home for 15 years, sharing with a long-time school friend of more than two decades and his wife.
Eli Dickensen communicates using pictures, synthesised voice technology and facial expressions.  (ABC NEWS: Mitchell Edgar)
To try and ensure that, Ms Mills set up a ""microboard"" — a group of people selected by Eli to assist him to make decisions for his future.
Microboards are legally binding, have a constitution and are usually made up of friends, family members, professionals or long-term community connections who are not paid.
""They're an intentional strategy to prevent social isolation for people with disability and to ensure that they're not left with only paid supports and services in their lives,"" Ms Mills said.
""They're also a really important safeguarding strategy. Members check in on people regularly and take note if there are any areas of concern … and they can take action.""
Jaquie Mills worries about Eli's autonomy and agency being supported as he grows older. (ABC NEWS: Mitchell Edgar)
Ms Mills is now managing director of a non-profit organisation called Microboards Australia, which helps other families create communities around people with disability.
Though she knows Eli best, Ms Mills said bringing others into the fold to understand her son's needs, preferences and communication style would be vital in maintaining his control over his future.
Lawyer Stephen Booth, who has spent three decades helping families with loved ones with intellectual disability, said putting plans in place — even if they weren't perfect to start with — was vital.
Mr Booth said carers stuck on where to begin could do so by answering basic questions, such as how many assets they have, how many children they have and how assets will be divided.
That process might also involve thinking about family dynamics and explaining to other children that an uneven split of assets wasn't because of a lack of affection or consideration, but based on a child with disability having a greater need.
Stephen Booth says it's crucial not to leave things too late. (ABC NEWS: Scott Preston)
As well as a will, Mr Booth said one of the most common arrangements parents put in place was setting up a trust.
""It's saying, 'here's some money or property, and I'm giving you, the trustees, the power to look after that for the beneficiary, the son or daughter with a disability'.""
When appointing a trustee, Mr Booth said it was important to consider their age, as well as their connection to the person with disability and ability to consult with them on decisions.
Mr Booth said many families opted for Special Disability Trusts, which offered potential tax and gifting concessions for those receiving the Disability Support Pension, but which also have higher administrative requirements.
Carolyn Smith says it's important to centre the person with disability in all conversations and decisions. (ABC NEWS: Scott Preston)
Above all, Carolyn Smith from CID said the most important thing was to make sure the person with disability was given the tools to make their own decisions, whatever that looked like.
As Ros Collins finds the best way forward for her son Dan, his happiness and safety continue to be her top priority.
Ros Collins is worried about funding Dan's ongoing support. (ABC NEWS: Patrick Stone)
With help from Dan's younger brothers, her aim is to find him a suitable place to call home and ways to fund the assistance he needs to pursue his passions, with support from carers who have become familiar to him.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-05/st-vincents-hospital-reviews-records-of-cancer-genetics-patients/105213036,Hundreds of patient records to be reviewed after hospital finds errors,"Topic:
Doctors and Medical Professionals","A major Sydney hospital is urgently reviewing more than 1,500 patient records after discovering a litany of errors and incorrect advice by one of its leading cancer specialists, the ABC can reveal.
St Vincent's Hospital discovered ""irregularities in the medical records"" of some patients seen between April 2022 and June 2023 by Allan Spigelman, a cancer genetic specialist and the former clinical director of St Vincent's Kinghorn Cancer Centre.
Professor Spigelman saw patients to assess, test and advise on their risk of hereditary cancer.
According to the hospital's website, the main goal of the service is in ""preventing cancer, enabling early detection and supporting patients through the process of genetic testing"".
In 2023, St Vincent's decided not to renew Professor Spigelman's contract after almost 20 years at the hospital.
The mistakes were discovered later that year, after he had left the hospital.
Allan Spigelman. (Facebook: Hunter Breast Cancer Public Forum)
The ABC learned of the investigation via a letter sent to affected patients, explaining their records were being reviewed because it ""did identify some issues with the advice and testing given to a select number of patients"" of Professor Spigelman.
When contacted for comment, St Vincent's Hospital provided a statement saying the review to date had found that the records for more than 500 of the specialist's patients had problems with ""poor clinical documentation, incomplete correspondence, and a lack of genetic counselling"".
For about 20 other patients, more serious errors were discovered which the hospital said posed a ""potential risk"" because he had provided ""incorrect information and advice"".
The doctor's mistakes caused an ""adverse clinical health outcome"" for one patient, the hospital said.
St Vincent's would not disclose details of the adverse event but stated it was still going through the process of ""confirming what took place and providing all necessary support for this patient"".
St Vincent's was at the centre of a scandal in 2016 when it was discovered another specialist had underdosed 100 cancer patients with chemotherapy.
St Vincent's said it was now reviewing all patient records starting from the beginning of the COVID pandemic when Professor Spigelman ""began making changes to the service model and seeing patients without the involvement of other clinicians"".
The hospital said the irregularities largely occurred when the clinician ""saw patients from his private office or rooms via telephone during the COVID pandemic"".
However, the errors identified in the review occurred after the pandemic, between April 2022 and June 2023.
St Vincent's Hospital appears to have been unaware of the changes made to consultations from early 2020, saying, ""as soon as the hospital became aware in September 2023 of irregularities in the clinician's approach, we moved to investigate whether there had been any impact on patient safety"".
It will now conduct a further extensive review involving what could be thousands more patients who Professor Spigelman saw over an earlier two-year period, starting from March 2020.

Professor Spigelman is an emeritus professor at the University of NSW and played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Kinghorn Cancer Centre, a joint venture between St Vincent's Hospital and the Garvan Institute of Medical Research.
Professor Spigelman did not reply to messages left by the ABC.
St Vincent's said it contacted the affected patients to inform them of the errors, ""to apologise and to provide follow-up care as needed"".
""St Vincent's has begun the process of contacting the broader group of patients to inform them of the lookback [review] and apologise for any inconvenience and stress caused by the review or its outcomes,"" the hospital said in a statement to the ABC.
St Vincent's said it referred the specialist to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and NSW Health in late 2023, shortly after learning of the problems.
AHPRA confirmed that the referral was passed on to the NSW regulator, the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC).
The HCCC said the commission was ""unable to confirm or deny whether a practitioner is subject to a complaint"".
Despite the findings of the St Vincent's review, Professor Spigelman continues to work in the NSW health system.
NSW Health said he was ""currently a part-time staff specialist and part-time director of the Hunter Family Cancer Genetics Service, supporting outpatient cancer clinics at Waratah and Maitland"".
NSW Health said the district's ""clinical governance unit recently undertook an initial review and assessment which did not identify any risk to patients"".
St Vincent's said it had reinstated its pre-pandemic model of care, which included oversight by multiple clinicians to ensure such irregularities did not happen again.",ABy Anne Connolly,Mon 5 May

Courts","A police officer described Joel Cauchi as ""fixated"" on knives when he responded to an altercation between the Bondi Junction killer and his father in Queensland.
Cauchi called Queensland Police at 6:50pm on January 8, 2023, saying his military collection including ""US army knives"" had been taken from his room by his father, where a physical altercation then ensued at the family residence.
WARNING: This story contains content that readers may find distressing.
His father told the responding officers the weapons were actually ""pigging knives"", the court heard at the coronial inquest into the fatal Bondi Junction Westfield stabbing.
Dawn Singleton, Jade Young, Yixuan Cheng, Ashlee Good, security guard Faraz Tahir and Pikria Darchia were killed in the attack on April 13, 2024.
Senior Constable Matthew McDonnell responded to the job with his partner Senior Constable Hope Porter.
The two officers, whose identities can now be revealed after a suppression order was lifted, noticed on their police system that Cauchi was flagged as being ""a weapons licence holder and also that he had schizophrenia"".
""My dad has taken some of my property. It's pretty expensive and he won't give it back,"" Cauchi said to Constable McDonnell in body-worn camera footage shown at the inquest.
""I tried to negotiate … he has refused.""
Reflecting on the interaction, Constable McDonnell told the court: ""At that point he started to become a little bit more fidgety.
""There was definitely complexity. He's able to legally possess these knives … the main risk factor we were concerned about there, that was raised by his parents, was his mental health.
Constable McDonnell asked Cauchi if he had laid hands on his father, to which he replied, ""Yes"".
When asked how his mental health was, Cauchi responded, ""It's been really good,"" and later clarified to Constable McDonnell that he was not on medication related to his diagnosis of schizophrenia.
""He was in such a rage about these collector items. My husband was concerned,"" Cauchi's mother told Constable Porter at the scene as per the body-worn camera footage.
""I don't think he's psychotic, but he's definitely not thinking straight. He needs to be on medication.""
At the inquest, Constable Porter told the court: ""She was asking for help. She knows her son.""
The inquest was told the incident had been coded in the police system as a ""domestic violence job"".
""In terms of domestic violence investigations … weapons is always one of those risk factors to take into consideration,"" Constable McDonnell told the court.
""He certainly wasn't aggressive. He was engaged in conversation.""
After being at the scene for approximately 40 minutes, Constables McDonnell and Porter determined a theft charge against Cauchi's father was not necessary, nor was a domestic violence order against Cauchi.
Records were kept about the incident in the police system.
""It was a tricky situation. The parents were happy that he remain there,"" Constable McDonnell told the court.
""There was nothing to show he was a threat to himself … He said he was just going to go straight to bed. I was satisfied that nobody's safety was in jeopardy.""
In the first of five weeks of a coronial inquest into the Westfield Bondi Junction stabbing,  the court heard about the confusion around a possible second offender and concerns the centre's alarms were too loud.
Constables McDonnell and Porter went on to send an email to an internal police mental health coordinator requesting a follow-up on Cauchi's mental health.
""Did you have concerns that Joel's behaviour may escalate?"", Counsel Assisting the Coroner Peggy Dwyer SC asked.
""There was concern we would get called back to the job if he didn't have some sort of intervention,"" Constable McDonnell replied.
The inquest was told the email sent was ""unfortunately"" lost.
The second week of the coronial inquest at the Coroners Court of NSW is set to examine Cauchi's mental health treatment and interactions with Queensland Police in the years prior to the attack.

Black Deaths In Custody","Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised this article includes the name and image of a person who has died, used with the permission of their family.
On the morning of Thursday April 3, Lynette Smith was woken by three police officers knocking on her front door.
Before long, Ms Smith was sitting down being informed that her youngest son, Lynton Ryan, had died.
""I just broke down,"" the 61-year-old told the ABC.
The previous afternoon, Mr Ryan had been found unresponsive in his cell at Eastern Goldfields Regional Prison in Kalgoorlie-Boulder, 600 kilometres east of Perth.
Lynton Ryan, 31, died after being found unresponsive in his cell. (Supplied)
Staff and first responders's efforts to revive the 31-year-old were unsuccessful.
In a statement, the Department of Justice said ""preliminary reports indicate there were no suspicious circumstances"".
While Ms Smith believes her son took his own life, she and her eldest son Shannon Smith are still waiting for answers.
""What happened in the last two hours?"" Mr Smith said.
""What is the exact cause of the death?""
Mr Smith said he also wanted to know how his younger brother ""fell through the cracks in the system"" to be found ""dead in his cell"".
""I looked at that cell,"" he said, after visiting the prison for a cultural smoking ceremony.
Mr Ryan was born in Port Pirie, South Australia, in 1993.
Mr Smith said his brother ""loved a laugh"" and enjoyed rock music.
However, he ""fell into the wrong hands"" after developing a marijuana habit at a young age.
A large part of Mr Ryan's life was spent behind bars, having been an inmate at Perth's Hakea and Acacia prisons before being transferred to Kalgoorlie-Boulder.

In 2023, the Kalgoorlie Magistrates Court heard that he had a history of violent offending.
But Mr Smith said his brother had recently been living in Kalgoorlie and, on this occasion, was only in prison for three days prior to his death.
It is understood he had been taken into custody for disorderly behaviour in town.
""What crime did he do to go to jail for three days? Did he physically harm anyone?"" Mr Smith said.
On the short ferry ride from Townsville to Palm Island, Alec Doomadgee prepared himself for cultural work marking the 20th anniversary of his brother's death.
Under West Australian law, any death in custody is subject to a mandatory coronial investigation.
Ahead of Mr Ryan's funeral later this month, Mr Smith said he feared it could take years before they knew exactly how he died.
""They have CCTV — why do we have to wait for so long?"" he said.
""Our mother's health is not good. She won't be around forever.""
The Department of Justice said it ""does not comment on circumstances surrounding a matter that is subject to a coronial inquest"".
Suicide prevention researcher and human rights advocate Gerry Georgatos said Mr Ryan's family deserved answers.
""He had mental health battles and they were always unaddressed in his experiences of going in and out of prison like it's a turnstile,"" he said.
It has now been 34 years since the final report was tabled for the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.
Gerry Georgatos says the prison system is broken. (ABC News: Jake Sturmer)
Throughout this time there have been 590 Indigenous deaths in custody.
Mr Georgatos said the number of young Indigenous prisoners who were dying of unnatural cause was concerning.
In 2022-'23 the median age of deaths in custody among First Nations prisoners was 43, compared to 67 for non-Indigenous prisoners.
""First Nations prisoners are dying younger,"" Mr Georgatos said.
Recommendation number 329 of the royal commission report, which called for a national standards body to draft legislation that would ensure prisoners's rights, was not accepted by the Australian Senate.
Mr Georgatos said legislating the rights of prisoners nationwide would help stem the flow of deaths in custody.
""What we don't want to see is hundreds more die in the decade ahead and thousands [more] be impacted,"" he said.
""If we don't give prisoners rights we're not going to transform lives.""",Hayden Smith,Mon 5 May

It's a scene that obstetrician Glen Mola is confronted with every morning when he walks into the maternity ward at the Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH), where he's worked since 1987.
The once-charming wooden building — known fondly as the Susu Mamas clinic — was erected in 1958, when Papua New Guinea was under Australian colonial rule.
Staff say the maternity ward at Port Moresby General Hospital is struggling to cope. (ABC News: Marian Faa)
""It's all PNG hardwood. It will never collapse,"" Dr Mola says, tapping the scuffed timber beneath his feet.
But he says the facility is in a state of severe neglect due to a lack of investment by hospital management.
""The walls are broken. The toilets are not working well. Some of the sinks are blocked. Lights are not working, taps don't work,"" Dr Mola says.
""There's no soap in the soap dispensers, no paper towels, so we dry our hands on our trousers. We need to do better.
""We're losing the ability to cope.""
A key part of the problem is PNG's rapidly expanding population.
""The facilities we have here are sufficient for about 10,000 women a year. And we exceeded 10,000 back in the 90s,"" Dr Mola says.
While the country hasn't held a reliable census in more than 24 years, estimates put the total population between 12 and 17 million.
It's clear that the capital, Port Moresby, is growing faster than many services can keep up with — Dr Mola's maternity ward included.
""People move into this city. I would say more than 1,000 a day, possibly,"" he estimates.
One of Papua New Guinea's most respected doctors, Glen Mola says he's disappointed to see services in decline. (ABC News: Marian Faa)
Frustrated with the conditions, Dr Mola and his team began documenting the state of care in the maternity ward last year.
In 2024, they found more than 7,000 women — about one in four — who visited the hospital to give birth received at least some of their care on the floor.
""Not being able to provide a bed for medical care is not just challenging from an ethical, social point. It's undignified, it's almost against rights, actually,"" Dr Mola says.
It also makes the work nearly impossible for staff.
""There's no way a midwife can sit down or kneel down on the floor beside you when there's blood and urine and [amniotic fluid] and faeces,"" he says.
Many of Papua New Guinea's remote hospitals are struggling to survive, with no money, limited supplies, and patients in dire need of their help.
Over the Easter long weekend, two women and two babies died, at least partly because of insufficient capacity, according to Dr Mola.
He explains that a relaxed, comfortable environment is crucial for promoting positive birth outcomes.
""Birthing women require quietness, calmness, an ambience that makes them confident and feel as though everything's OK and they're being looked after,"" he says.
""Anxiety and fear are very anti-having-the-baby. If you have a lot of anxiety and fear, then women don't birth well.""
As Dr Mola nears the end of his career, he is disappointed to see how things have gone downhill.
He's adamant it shouldn't be this way — and if everything had gone according to plan, he believes the clinic would be in a much better state today.
In 2022, the Japanese government committed $37 million in grant funding to revamp the Susu Mama wing with a new perinatal clinic that included more beds, a specialist ICU and laboratory.
Seventy projects outlined in a confidential PNG cabinet document include acquiring a luxury island in partnership with a Congolese rapper, exploring the potential for a world-class Formula 1 track, creating a ""Silicon Valley style hub"" for entrepreneurs and setting up a spy agency.
After more than 10 months of consultation with midwives, doctors, the Japanese embassy and developers, a comprehensive plan was presented to the hospital board.
But it was rejected because, according to Dr Mola, management believed it ""did not fit with their vision for the future development of PMGH"".
""The CEO looked at our plan and saw that it was going to be on this site and not on the site that he wants … so he can use this site for the hotel and shopping precinct,"" Dr Mola says.
He says the hospital's alternative plan is to build a new maternity wing in an eight-storey tower at a different site — which he argues is impractical.
PMGH chief executive Dr Paki Molumi declined to answer questions posed by the ABC.
In a statement, National Capital District governor Powes Parkop said the Japanese grant was not refused, but PMGH management believed the money should go towards upgrading a smaller hospital on the city's outskirts.
Port Moresby General Hospital CEO Dr Paki Molumi declined to answer questions about conditions in the hospital. (ABC News: Marian Faa)
""With more available land and growing infrastructure, [it] is ideally positioned to handle primary maternity and child health services for the city's rapidly growing population,"" Mr Parkop said.
He explained it was part of a larger plan to transition PMGH to a ""level 6"" hospital that will focus solely on specialised referrals and teaching, rather than serving direct admissions like maternity and child health cases.
High burial costs are forcing families to abandon the bodies of loved ones at Papua New Guinea's public morgue, and many are ending up in mass graves.
In the longer-term, the provincial health authority wants to bolster smaller hospitals around the city to deal with primary care.
But Dr Mola says the maternity ward needs urgent relief.
PNG's Prime Minister James Marape has, in principle, thrown his weight behind the call.
Mr Marape summoned Health Minister Elias Kapavore to discuss issues at the hospital on Friday — a meeting Dr Mola described as ""very positive"", with the PM pledging funding or the cause.
""There is a need right away. We need to attend to it. So, we will attend to the immediate need as well as the long-term need,"" Mr Marape told ABC.
And with the average woman in PNG having at least four children in her life, Dr Mola, and the women he cares for, are depending on that promise being fulfilled.",Unknown,Mon 5 May

The Nationals MP, and former deputy prime minister, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
Mr Joyce, 58, says he received the diagnosis following a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test, which he took at the insistence of his general practitioner.
""I had a PSA test, which all men should get,"" he said.
Mr Joyce said he returned an ""elevated"" result, leading to an MRI and biopsy before his diagnosis.

The maverick MP is positive about his prognosis and his capacity to continue in the role.
""If I thought it was very serious, of course I'd resign, but my doctors or surgeons say, 'You're very lucky you've got it early.'""
Having had no symptoms to indicate anything was wrong, Mr Joyce said his experience should encourage other men to get tested.
""I was lucky because I've got a very diligent general practitioner,"" he said.

Mr Joyce said the election campaign was a ""welcome distraction"" and he was adamant about keeping his diagnosis private during that time.
""I just didn't want to distract from the campaign,"" he said.
""I knew it would turn into a bit of a circus.
""I wanted the campaign to focus on the campaign and I didn't think this issue needed to be a part of that.""
Mr Joyce has also given a typically blunt appraisal of the federal election.

""I'll leave everything to the party room for their discussions on that,"" he said.
""As we know after any election that is an issue that is discussed.""
When asked about whether he had any aspirations to return to the party's top job, the former leader said he was ""not contending that at this time at all"".
""But once more I'll leave that to the party room, I think we need to have an honest conversation,"" he said.
Mr Joyce was more effusive when asked about departing Liberal leader Peter Dutton, who lost his own seat of Dickson to the ALP.
""Peter has done a tremendous job for our nation, and no-one can ever take that away from him,"" he said.
""In a funny way it's probably a bit of a blessing in disguise not to have to go back and go through the ignominy of standing in front of a baying crowd after an election like that.
""To go out in the very dignified way he did on election night was the best conclusion you can hope for in the situation you find yourself.""

Ms Robinson, who was born in 1945, said she was now on the wrong side of 80.
""That's what they call an OBE, over bloody 80,"" she laughed.

The trekkers are Rotary members and Mr Hutt says participants have raised $50,000 to help efforts to eradicate polio worldwide.
All but two countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan, have been declared free of the infectious disease that can, in rare cases, cause paralysis.
""Across the world, Rotary International, with the help of UNICEF and the World Health Organization, have pledged to eradicate polio,"" Mr Hutt said.
""But our main function is to create awareness by talking to governments and raising funds.""
The cause is a big reason why Ms Robinson decided to take on the challenge.
""This trip would not be happening, and I would not be doing it, if it wasn't for the fundraising aspect,"" she said.
After spending two nights in Nepal's capital Kathmandu, the trekkers began their hike in Lukla and will take a route to South Base Camp via Gokyo Lakes.
""We fly from Kathmandu to Lukla, which is apparently the most dangerous airstrip in the world because it's curved,"" Ms Robinson said.

For many adventurers, the attraction to breathtaking views on top of towering mountains is irresistible, but doctors are urging climbers to be aware of the dangers associated with altitude.
Then they walk around Gokyo Lake and over three high mountain passes.
Staying for two nights in some places, the group do acclimatisation walks where they go up 3 or 400 metres, then go back down and sleep lower.
The higher altitude makes each breath more laboured as oxygen decreases.
""It's not necessarily how fit you are, it's your ability to cope with the acclimatisation,"" Ms Robinson said.
Along the route to South Base Camp are tea houses where hikers stay the night. (Supplied: Laurelle Price)
In preparation, Ms Robinson has been regularly climbing Woodhill Mountain near Berry, an intermediate grade walk that is 4.5km return.
She also attended an altitude training centre in Sydney.
""You train in a room with altitude conditions of 3,500m, that gets you used to doing strenuous workouts with less oxygen,"" Ms Robinson said.
""You've got to watch out for headaches. Apparently, if you start getting headaches and start feeling nauseous, that's not good.""
Adventure of a lifetime.

Last year, at 74, Ms Price was recognised as the oldest woman to complete the Kokoda Track.
""I've been climbing to Drawing Room Rocks [near Berry] for probably 12 months because I had some trips overseas last year and I did Kokoda as well, so I just continued throughout the year,"" Ms Price said.
Ms Price is looking forward to reaching base camp a second time. (Supplied: Laurelle Price)
She completed a shorter route to South Base Camp in 2019 and is looking forward to immersing herself in the Himalayas and vibrant Sherpa culture once again.
""The walking is slow and steady; a nice, even walk so you can conserve energy especially in higher altitude,"" Ms Price said.
""It's just one step after the other and you take a rest all the time because you struggle for air more as it's only 50 per cent oxygen when you're at base camp.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2025-05-03/universal-antivenom-snake-research/105233130,Blood of man bitten by hundreds of snakes key to new antivenom,"Topic:
Animals","For 18 years, Wisconsin man Tim Friede has injected increasing amounts of venom into his body from the world's most deadly snakes.
His strange quest yielded results on Saturday, with a team of US researchers claiming to have created ""the most broadly effective"" snake antivenom to date.
After hundreds of injections and snake bites, Mr Friede's blood contained broad-spectrum immune proteins called antibodies, which were analysed and used to create an antibody ""cocktail"" that could potentially protect against 19 different species of snake.
The team's results have been published on Saturday in the journal Cell.
According to Jacob Glanville, one of the researchers working on the project, and CEO of start-up Centivax, Mr Friede's envenomed blood was the key to producing the snake antivenom.
The new antivenom described in the study is very different to traditional antivenoms, according to Peter Kwong, a biochemist at Columbia University and one of the study's authors.
""The current technology hasn't really changed in over 100 years,"" he said.
""Whereas with [this new] approach … you can use all the tools of modern antibody therapy.""
But while the team is extremely excited about their results, which has so far only been demonstrated to be effective in mice, other experts caution against too much hype.
If you were unlucky enough to get bitten by a snake tomorrow, the antivenom provided would be made in a similar way to what would have been provided decades ago.
Both then and now, antivenom is created using animal blood, like horses or other large mammals.
The animals are given small doses of the venom, and then over time given larger and larger doses. This helps the animal produce an increasing immune response without getting so sick they die.
""You're poisoning the animals over an extended period,"" Timothy Jackson, who is the co-head of the Australian Venom Research Unit at the University of Melbourne, said.
""They're probably feeling pretty crappy for a lot of the time because their immune system is fighting an active pathogen.""
The immune cells — or antibodies — in the horse plasma can be stored at local hospitals and health centres ready for use when required.
Usually the antivenom will either be for a particular snake, or for a few snakes located in one region — called a polyvalent antivenom.

This technique works well in places like Australia where there are effective ways to produce and distribute the antivenom, but less so in India and other countries in South-East Asia.
""I really don't like the claim that Australia has the world's most dangerous snakes,"" Dr Jackson said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) listed snakebite envenoming as a neglected tropical disease in June 2017 but while this resulted in a funding increase, millions of people are still being bitten by snakes in developing countries, many of those dying or becoming disabled through amputation.
The team found three antibodies, two of which were in Mr Friede's blood, that when used together produced a type of broad-spectrum antivenom.
This new antivenom was then tested in mice studies.
The mice were protected from the venom of most deadly snakes across one family called the elapids, including Australia's eastern brown snakes, inland taipans and tiger snakes.
""It got really exciting when we started seeing mice live,"" Professor Kwong said.
Out of the 19 species of venomous snakes tested, the researchers found the antivenom provided full protection in the mice against 13 snake species and partial protection for the remaining six.

Importantly, the process of creating the antivenom is also different. Mr Friede won't need to do regular donations to produce it.
Modern antibody therapy, like monoclonal antibody therapy used in cancer treatments, uses cells grown in labs to produce the product instead of antibodies regularly drawn from horses or other mammals.
The team hope they can produce a universal antivenom that protects against more species, no longer uses horses or other mammals to be created, and has a longer storage life than traditional antivenoms.
The American team isn't the only one using this antibody technique.
Other broad-spectrum antibodies for snake venom, including one called 95Mat5, have already been created by other teams of researchers.
According to Dr Glanville, Mr Friede's antibodies have been particularly honed over the years by rotating hundreds of times between 16 species of venomous snakes.
""This was his lifelong project,"" Dr Glanville said.
Mr Friede began injecting himself with venom back in the 2000s to try and create an immunity to his venomous pet snakes, but because antibodies can deplete after just a few weeks or months, he continued to regularly inject himself to ensure continued immunity.
Dr Glanville believes that particularly in the body, antibodies can evolve to optimise their performance.
""There's this emerging appreciation that sometimes living systems … can give rise to superior therapeutic properties.""
But Dr Jackson, who was not involved with the paper, said antivenoms could be created without using donors like Mr Friede.
""It's fun to put him in the loop, but it's not the only way of generating highly specific antibodies,"" he said.
It's also extremely dangerous, and Dr Glanville stresses that this is not something to be repeated.
""No-one else should do what Tim has done.
""He … produced something remarkable, but that means that there's no reason why anyone else needs to go try.""
There's still a long way to go before the team can produce a universal antivenom for human use.
The first issue is that the new antivenom doesn't work on vipers  — a large group of snakes found on most continents except Australia and Antarctica — so more toxins will need to be found to work on their particular toxins.
Vipers include include the saw-scaled vipers, which are responsible for the most snakebite cases and deaths in the world.
Saw-scaled vipers (Echis carinatus) are found in Africa, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. (FlickR: Frupus )
""Our goal is to produce a broad-spectrum cocktail for the vipers as well,"" Dr Glanville said.
""Then … we would have complete global protection from snake venom.""
The team also need to test the current products on larger animals, and then humans.
Because snake venoms have so many types of toxins, there's potential that some others may have been missed by just the three antibodies used.
""[The study] looks good on paper,"" Dr Jackson said.
""But is it actually neutralising all of the clinically relevant toxins?""
Larger, animal studies will need to be done, and the team is now looking at testing the cocktail on dogs bitten by snakes at an unnamed veterinary clinic in Australia.
Finally, potentially the biggest hurdle is ensuring that the drugs are cheap and available in locations around the world where they might be needed.
""Having a good drug is the easy part when it comes to dealing with a problem like snakebite,"" Dr Jackson said.
""The WHO has referred to snakebite, aptly, as a multi factorial crisis — there's a lot of factors here.""

Courts","Just over a year ago, Sydney was brought to a standstill after a man entered Westfield Bondi Junction with a knife.
Queensland man Joel Cauchi stabbed 16 people in a rampage that lasted just over three minutes on April 13, 2024. Six of the victims did not survive.
WARNING: This story contains content that readers may find distressing.
On Monday, a long-awaited coronial inquest began at the Coroners Court of NSW to probe how the attack unfolded.
Clockwise from top left: Yixuan Cheng, Faraz Tahir, Jade Young, Pikria Darchia, Dawn Singleton and Ashlee Good were killed. (Supplied)  (Supplied)
The beginning of the five-week inquest heard from a number of key witnesses, including NSW Police Inspector Amy Scott, who fatally shot Cauchi.
State Coroner Teresa O'Sullivan said her ""ultimate hope"" was to provide loved ones of the victims and the broader community ""with much-needed answers about how the tragic events … occurred"" and what can be done to prevent another Bondi in the future.
Here are some major questions answered during the ongoing inquest.
On the second day of the inquest, Inspector Scott recounted her experience on the day.
In her initial police interview, she said she had a ""number of different jobs"" that day, and she was visiting constables at local stations to give advice and check in.
After visiting Paddington, Rose Bay and Bondi police stations, she was driving away from Bondi up Bondi Road.
She acknowledged the Westfield job, which she knew required an ""urgent response"" at 3:35pm.
""At the time, I actually pulled over because I knew where most of my staff were and most of them were a little bit tied up,"" she said.
""So I thought I might be the first officer that will be able to get [there].
""I remember the radio operator said, 'Eastern Suburbs car, any car in the vicinity, we're getting multiple calls, multiple stabbings, multiple locations at Bondi Junction Westfield,' and I knew right then it was very real.""

She arrived outside Westfield two minutes later and was faced by civilians pleading for help and for her to ""get in there"".
""I considered [the scene] to be an active armed offender, and I also knew that I couldn't wait anymore for my colleagues to arrive, and I just had to go in,"" she said, recalling sharing her location and her intention to find the threat.
CCTV showed she was followed into Westfield by civilians Silas Despreaux and Damien Guerot, who had previously attempted to stop Cauchi with bollards.
""One of them tapped me on the back and said, 'You're on your own, [so] we're going with you,'"" she recounted of the French construction workers.
Chief Inspector Christopher Whalley, the senior police officer who attended the crime scene, relieved her about 20 minutes later, and both of them commended the efforts of young officers who stepped in to help afterwards.
Cauchi was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was a teenager.
On the morning of the attack, he travelled to Bondi Junction by train, Counsel Assisting the Coroner Peggy Dwyer SC said in her opening statement.
The court heard the 40-year-old walked around the Westfield until about 1:15pm, before travelling to nearby Bondi Beach on the bus.
After a suspected nap, he returned to Bondi Junction about 2:25pm, continuing to enter and exit the building ""in what appears to be an aimless manner"".
Dr Dwyer said at 3:22pm he re-entered the centre for the last time before heading towards Sourdough Bakery, where he stabbed his first victim Dawn Singleton, at about 3:30pm.
She emphasised there was no ""direct evidence indicating any motive associated with his plans"" but evidence showed insight into his ""inner turmoil"".

""Distressing"" phone records and web browsing indicated Cauchi was ""preoccupied with weapons, with violence and with mass killing"" from about 2022.
The court heard the ""Ka-bar knife"" used was purchased in February that year from a store in Punchbowl, in Sydney's south-west.
""There is certain evidence suggesting that Mr Cauchi's actions on 13 April 2024 may have been the subject of rudimentary planning for these reasons,"" Dr Dwyer said.
Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Paul Marks from the NSW Police homicide squad told the court there was ""obviously information that he was going to attack, but there's no evidence that I could find that it was an attack specifically on women"".
Thirteen of the people stabbed on the day were women, the court heard.
Peggy Dwyer said there was ""confusion"" around a second offender during the emergency response. (Supplied: Coroners Court of New South Wales)
During the opening statements by Dr Dwyer, the court heard there was ""some level of confusion as to whether of not Mr Cauchi was acting alone"".
She said police intelligence indicated there could have been a second offender, and an officer was sent to the Westfield CCTV control room to review footage.
At about 4:15pm, the riot squad investigated whether ""there might be a possible offender on the rooftop car park"".
Just before 4:30pm it was confirmed by police that Cauchi was the sole offender, but a minute later, NSW Ambulance had declared the site a ""hot zone"" having not heard that information.
Emergency services were faced with a ""chaotic environment"" in response to the stabbing, the court heard. (AAP: Steve Markham)
This declaration limited who could treat patients due to an ongoing threat, leading to the withdrawal of all paramedics inside the centre.
Ultimately, the court heard that delays and crossed wires had ""no impact on any clinical outcomes"" and all patients were taken outside by the time the hot zone was declared.
Chief Inspector Whalley was asked by counsel assisting the coroner, Emma Sullivan, whether there was a ""critical need for inter-agency communication around key pieces of information"" like the status of a second offender.
He agreed that it was an area for future improvement.
The court heard from Inspector Scott there were no alarms going off during her pursuit of Cauchi, and were only activated after he was shot.
""They were extremely loud and did hamper communication significantly,"" she said.
""I had my radio turned up really, really loud, like as high as it can, and I still was struggling to hear what other police were communicating.""
She said her sergeant had to speak with her face-to-face to plan and organise because ""it was just deafening"".
The court heard that the alarms rang out for more than 20 minutes after Cauchi was shot. (ABC News: Monish Nand)
Emergency ambulance responder Christopher Wilkinson described the alarm as ""quite noisy"" when trying to listen to radio communications and converse.
""There was a lot of noise, extraneous noise from the environment, and the alarm just didn't help,"" he said.
Dr Dwyer told the court the alarm rang out for about 23 minutes, and Inspector Scott told her the alarm made it difficult to hear announcements over the PA system.
Lawyer for Scentre, Dean Jordan SC, said the volume of the alarms at Westfield Bondi Junction had been tested and found to be compliant with the Australian standard which specifies the required volume for emergency alarms.
The inquest will recommence on Monday.
Witnesses from the Queensland Police Service (QPS) are expected to speak about their interactions with Cauchi after he stopped taking medication for schizophrenia and left the mental health system.
The court is also expected to hear about the complexities and challenges of police interacting with people experiencing mental illness.
Representatives from Queensland Police Service will be in Sydney to give evidence at the inquest. (ABC News: ABC News: Lucas Hill)
The evidence in the brief states Cauchi had several interactions with QPS, including officers called to his family home after his father ""confiscated a number of knives"" of a similar style used on April 13, 2024.
Later in the week, representatives for owner and operator of Westfield, Scentre Group, and security contractors Glad Group are slated to speak as well.
Finally, more witnesses from NSW Police and NSW Ambulances will be called up to give evidence on ""system issues"" in an active armed offender situation and a proposal for a 10-second triage rule.",MBy Millie Roberts,Sat 3 May

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-02/commercial-surrogacy-australia-international-legal-challenges/105238124,Children left in legal limbo amid Australia's complex surrogacy laws,"Topic:
Surrogacy","A child born to an overseas commercial surrogate is in legal limbo, with experts estimating hundreds of other Australian children are also living with uncertain parentage.
In January, a court refused to grant a parenting order to a Queensland couple who illegally used a commercial surrogacy service to have the baby boy born abroad.
The case has shone a spotlight on Australia's complex patchwork of surrogacy laws, which differ across the country, and the push for law reform.
A Brisbane couple could face prosecution after they admitted to using a commercial surrogacy service to have a baby abroad.
Federal Circuit and Family Court Justice Catherine Carew ordered documents in the Brisbane couple's case be referred to Queensland's Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to determine whether charges should be laid.
Her decision followed depositions showing the Brisbane couple had entered into a commercial surrogacy agreement, paying a company about $140,000, which resulted in the baby boy's birth overseas last year.
The Queensland Police Service has confirmed it is making enquiries.
Commercial surrogacy is where a surrogate is ""paid more than their reasonable expenses"", such as a fee or reward, to carry someone else's child.
The practice is illegal in all Australian states and territories for domestic surrogacy, with Queensland, NSW and the ACT also making it a crime for residents to pay surrogates abroad.
The offence in Queensland attracts a penalty of up to three years' jail.

An Australian government website says commercial surrogacy has been banned to ""protect the rights of each of the people involved in a surrogacy arrangement"".
Concerns around the arrangements include the exploitation of women, and the legal rights and citizenship of children born through surrogacy.
However, altruistic surrogacy — where a surrogate's expenses can be paid but the pregnancy cannot be used for personal profit — is legal in Australia.
Expenses can include the costs of medical treatment; travel costs, such as fuel and parking fees, life insurance; loss of income for time they need to take off for appointments during the pregnancy and birth; and allied health treatments, such as massage, and pre-natal supplements.
Surrogacy lawyer Stephen Page said more than 3,300 Australian children had been born to surrogates abroad, with ""hundreds"" having uncertain parentage in Australia.
Stephen Page says he's been advocating for legal reform for more than a decade. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)
According to the federal government website, ""legal parentage is usually not recognised in Australia for parents who commission a child under a commercial surrogacy arrangement"".
""This means by law the surrogate will remain the legal parent of the child,"" the website says.
The practice of surrogacy has been around since biblical times, and today it's a multi-billion-dollar industry. But is it ethical?
Accredited Family Law Specialist and Surrogacy Australia president Sarah Bevan said parentage orders were not available for Queensland-based parents who turn to international commercial surrogacy.
In the case of the Brisbane couple, an application for a parenting order was made to the court after the baby was born, despite the fact that commercial surrogacy is illegal in Queensland.
Surrogacy Australia board member Sam Everingham said many other couples avoided the courts, creating an ""underclass"" of children, born to overseas surrogates, who do not have a legal parent in Australia.

""It does create a real or potential problem for these children,"" he said.
""Officially, these kids are supposed to have a legal parent signing off consents for hospital admissions and for school.""
At the same time, he said the Commonwealth government was ""happy to process citizenship and passports for foreign surrogacy births"".
In a statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade  said it could not comment on individual cases.
Mr Page has been advocating for surrogacy law reform in Australia for more than a decade.
An increasing number of women are putting their hand up to become surrogate mothers.
He said state laws covering overseas surrogacy ""cannot be enforced and therefore should be repealed"".
To his knowledge, Mr Page said no-one in Australia had been successfully prosecuted for overseas commercial surrogacy.
That's despite at least three other Australian cases where judges had referred couples to prosecutors.
""It makes a mockery of the law,"" Mr Page said.
He's calling for uniform surrogacy laws across the country, suggesting surrogates should be compensated.
In the case of the Brisbane couple, their overseas surrogate was not employed at the time and was the primary carer for her own three children.
""The surrogate does not have a spouse or partner and is a sole parent,"" the court judgement said.
Advocates are calling for uniform surrogacy laws across Australia. (Unsplash/Aditya Romansa)
Because the couple engaged an overseas commercial surrogacy agency to ""make all the necessary arrangements"" for the birth of the baby, Justice Carew said ""there is no evidence of what payment or other benefits the surrogate received for her part in the surrogate arrangement"".
Mr Page believes women should be compensated for carrying someone else's child.
""The idea that a woman will take on the potential risk of death, and if she's not a family member or friend, will willingly put her hand up and be a surrogate, I think is fanciful.""

Infectious Diseases","United States Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has reprised his misleading claims about vaccines, including that the measles jab contains cells from aborted foetuses, at the same time the country is battling one of its worst outbreaks of the infection in 25 years.
Mr Kennedy's comments come as the US nears 900 cases of the measles nationwide and scientists have warned that the country is at a tipping point for the return of endemic measles, declared eradicated nationally in 2000.
Two children and an adult have died and hundreds more have been infected in the outbreak in Texas, which is centred in a Mennonite community and has spread to several neighbouring states, including New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas.

The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC)'s confirmed measles case count is 884 — triple the amount seen in all of 2024. The three-month outbreak in Texas accounts for the vast majority of cases, with 663 confirmed as of Tuesday.
North America has two other ongoing outbreaks, including one in Ontario, Canada which has resulted in 1,020 cases from mid-October through to April 23. The Mexican state of Chihuahua had 786 measles cases and one death as of Wednesday, according to data from the state health ministry.
Health officials in Mexico and the US say all three outbreaks are of the same measles strain.
Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs and is preventable through vaccines.
Mr Kennedy, who became the nation's top health official in February as part of the new Trump administration, has for decades helped sow doubts regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines, contributing to a decline in vaccination rates.
He says he is not opposed to vaccines, but has begun to revive some of the unproven or debunked theories he promoted as a lawyer and public figure, now from his perch at the US Health and Human Services Department.
Mr Kennedy Jr is a prominent vaccine sceptic and will now oversee vaccine recommendations and food safety as well as health insurance programs for roughly half the country.
""There are populations in our country, like the Mennonites in Texas, [who] were most afflicted, and they have religious objections to the vaccination, because the MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles, so they don't want to take it,"" Mr Kennedy said in an interview on Wednesday.
Mr Kennedy was referring to the combined Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine. The vaccines do not contain ""foetal debris"" from abortions or intact fetal cells, vaccine experts said.
The rubella portion of the vaccine is produced from a foetal cell line originating from an abortion that took place in the 1960s. The MMR vaccine does not contain the cells in its final form.
The cells are derived from foetal cells that have been replicated over decades in test tubes in laboratory settings, thousands of times removed from the original ones.
""The virus is grown in these cells, then this virus is purified, meaning everything other than the virus is filtered out, and all that's left is this attenuated virus that can't make you sick,""  Dr Miriam Laufer, the Interim Director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland, said.
According to a fact sheet on how vaccines are made from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania, the amount of DNA involved in final vaccine preparation is minimal, at billionths or trillionths of a gram.
""While the final vaccines do not contain intact foetal cells, they may contain trace amounts of cell-derived materials, such as fragments of DNA,"" Dr Paulo Verardi, a professor of Virology and Vaccinology at the University of Connecticut, said.
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr Kennedy also said this week that the mumps portion of the vaccine does not work and that there were safety concerns over it.
""The problem is really with the mumps portion of the vaccine and the combination. That combination was never safety tested,"" he said on Monday at a live televised town hall event.
Two doses of the MMR vaccine provide around 86 per cent protection against mumps, according to the CDC.
While it is true that vaccine protection can wane over time, the rate varies depending on the disease and vaccine, Dr Verardi and other vaccine experts said.
""For mumps in particular, immunity can decline, so adults vaccinated in childhood may become susceptible again,"" he said.

Dental Care","Expanding Medicare to cover more dental services has the support of about two-thirds of Australian dental practitioners recently surveyed.
Among the nearly 450 professionals who participated, including dentists, oral health therapists, and dental hygienists,support was strongest for a means-tested and capped dental scheme.
That would mean patients would be eligible for subsidised care based on their income, and only covered up to a certain financial limit.
Many of those surveyed reported their patients struggled to afford oral health care, and that affordability had become more of a problem in the past 12 months.
""We're in this cost of living crisis at the moment and … dentistry — which should be a necessary expenditure — has for a lot of people perhaps shifted over into a luxury item,"" said Matt Hopcraft, dentist and lead researcher.
""We see consequences of that play out in poor oral health in a lot of people.""
Both Labor and the Coalition have pledged billions of dollars towards health during the federal election campaign, but dental care has been absent from both major parties' policy platforms.
The Greens, on the other hand, have been campaigning to get basic dental services in Medicare for all adults, irrespective of income.
Live results: Find out what's happening in your seat as counting continues
The vast majority of dental care in Australia is provided by the private sector and predominantly funded out of patients' own pockets.
The Child Dental Benefits Schedule covers part or all of the cost of basic dental services for eligible children, while adults with a concession or health care card are eligible for free public services — but often wait years to be seen.
A new report shows many Australians are delaying dentist visits or waiting years to receive publicly funded care.
According to the dental practitioners surveyed, about 40 per cent of their patients, on average, had difficulty affording general dental care, while nearly half delayed care or chose less ideal treatment because of the cost.
While the survey was ""relatively small"", Dr Hopcraft said, he believed the findings — published in the Australian Dental Journal — represented the views of ""a large number of practitioners"".
Research shows approximately one in three Australians aged 15 and over have untreated tooth decay, while around 30 per cent of adults have gum disease.
In 2023, a Senate inquiry into the provision of dental services in Australia recommended the federal government work with states and territories ""to achieve universal access to dental and oral health care"" through Medicare or a similar scheme, over time and in stages.
Health minister Mark Butler said in a National Press Club debate last week that Labor had an ""ambition to bring dental into Medicare"", but that it didn't have capacity to do so in the immediate future.
""We're focused very much on strengthening Medicare as it currently stands. But I think over time it would make sense to bring the mouth into our universal health insurance system,"" he said.
Many Australians rely on public dental services, which have extensive waiting lists. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)
Similarly, shadow health minister Anne Ruston said the focus of the Coalition was on primary care.
""All of the statistics … tell us we have a crisis in primary care and first and foremost, that has to be addressed,"" she said.
Speaking to the ABC in April, Greens leader Adam Bandt said his party had successfully negotiated getting children's dental care into Medicare under a Labor minority government in 2012, and now wanted to ""get it in for everyone"".
The proposal, which would expand Medicare coverage to include check-ups and teeth cleaning, fillings, dentures and orthodontic work for all Medicare-card holders, is projected to cost $196 billion over the next decade.

Both the Public Health Association of Australia and the Grattan Institute, an independent policy think-tank, have advocated for bringing dental into Medicare — or a ""Medicare-style universal dental scheme"" — but phasing it in gradually over time.
Hear the latest election news as it happens on the Election Central Playlist. Only on the ABC listen app.
The Grattan Institute has also said the scheme should exclude cosmetic services and orthodontics — a recommendation backed by the dental practitioners surveyed.
Dr Hopcraft said the survey showed dental practitioners primarily supported subsidies that targeted Australians ""most in need"", both to manage government costs and reduce the significant wait times in the public sector.
But it also found there was support for a capped universal scheme — akin to what the Greens and other groups have proposed — as well as a scheme for older Australians.
The Australian Dental Association (ADA) has called for a Seniors Benefit Dental Scheme, which would provide older Australians with $1,100 of free dental care every two years.
Government data shows in 2022–23, nearly 16,000 Australians aged over 65 were hospitalised with potentially preventable dental issues.
""The dilemma is that it's a massive amount of money … to get every person in Australia to be able to go and see a dentist under the Medicare scheme,"" said Andrew Gikas, ADA board member and clinical director of the University of Melbourne Dental School.
""If we've got a children's scheme that works reasonably well, and we've got the infrastructure in place plus all the legislation to make it work, why don't we just flick the switch and produce something that will target the other end of the scale, which is a senior's scheme?""
As the election draws closer, the Australian Dental Association is calling for a scheme that gives seniors access to free dental work.
The introduction of a seniors program was recommended by the 2023 Senate inquiry as well as the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety in 2021.
By providing subsidised care to older Australians, Dr Gikas said more space would be freed up to treat adults aged 18 to 65 in the public system.
""There is a system already in place for public dentistry — it's just a matter of making sure we either prop that up better or we take away some of the burden, and one of the burdens is the elderly and those in nursing homes,"" he said.
Despite the many different proposals for increasing publicly-subsidised care, Dr Gikas said it was clear that advocates agreed more government funding was needed.
""We're going to keep lobbying to make sure that whoever ends up in power starts thinking about a better way of doing it, because the current way is not working, and is leaving a significant amount of gaps.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-02/perimenopause-signs-symptoms-hormones-help/105213314,'Shattered pane of glass': The impact of perimenopause,"Topic:
Health","When Carl began to notice some changes in his wife Allison's behaviour — namely angry outbursts, brain fog, fatigue and feelings of low self-worth — he had no idea it was due to perimenopause.
""I don't think it dawned on her either, until she started to get more physical symptoms and we realised what was going on,"" he says.
Allison, who describes the impact of perimenopause as feeling like ""a shattered pane of glass"", pictured here with her husband Carl and their dog Max. (Supplied)
Perimenopause is the term used to describe the life stage when ""ovaries are switching on and off and hormone levels are bobbing up and down"". This is in the lead up to officially being in menopause, which is a full year after periods have stopped, says Susan Davis, head of Monash University's Women's Health Research Program.
Lasting as long as 10 years, it is often accompanied by a laundry list of potential symptoms such as an erratic menstrual cycle, hot flushes and night sweats, low libido, mood swings, brain fog and headaches.
'Brain fog' during perimenopause is real, and it can disrupt women's lives and careers.
On average, a woman has her final period at 51. That means perimenopause symptoms could start as early as 40. And in roughly 10 per cent of cases, it can start even earlier.
In 2024, a parliamentary committee held a senate inquiry into investigating the impact of menopause and perimenopause in Australia.
Allison testified at the inquiry, describing the impact of perimenopause as feeling like ""a shattered pane of glass"".
""I had to gather up all of those pieces and put myself back together,"" she told the inquiry.
Her husband says he wished he was better armed with knowledge to help Allison through this.
""I wish I'd known more about the other symptoms you could expect. I wish I knew how lagging behind big parts of the medical profession are in dealing with it,"" Carl says.
""I had no idea that there's so much reform needed. And I wish I'd known that there were treatments.""
So, if your partner is experiencing perimenopausal symptoms, what can you do to support them?
Kelly Teagle is the founder of WellFemme, a collective of GPs who specialise in menopause.
She says the sheer number of symptoms someone might experience during perimenopause means being a supportive partner is vital. As is the knowledge that their behaviour isn't necessarily about you.
The hormonal chaos of perimenopause comes at a time when people already have a lot on their plates, says Dr Kelly Teagle.   (Supplied)
""Somebody that you really love, all of a sudden, has turned into this screaming banshee or is behaving really erratically and unpredictably, so you might think, 'Don't they love me anymore? Who is this person? It didn't used to be like this',"" she says.
She also recommends educating yourself on perimenopause and its symptoms.
""Educate yourself about what's going on and be aware that absolutely everyone born with ovaries is going to go through perimenopause in some shape or form.""
""Not all of them are going to get terrible symptoms but certainly a percentage of them are going to have that.""
Perimenopause can also impact libido, making intimacy a thorny issue for some.

""A large proportion of people report a drop off in intimacy, and women start to say, 'I just could not care less if we never had sex again. I'm not enjoying it or it's getting drier or I'm just too exhausted all the time',"" explains Dr Teagle.
""The partner might think that they don't love them and don't want to be with them anymore. And in the vast majority of cases, that's just not the case.
Sarah has been with her partner Rowan for nearly 11 years. During that time her perimenopause symptoms were compounded by other health concerns, including severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS), adenomyosis and endometriosis, and an IVF journey that included eight IVF cycles.
The 41-year-old says her partner has been supportive, but she worries about how the relationship is impacted.
""I have never felt judged or criticised for my many symptoms throughout this absolute rollercoaster. I have never been hassled or pressured into having sex. He is very cautious and understanding about the possibility of me experiencing pain during sex,"" she says.
Dr Teagle says both partners need to be sensitive and aware when it comes to dealing with perimenopause. (Getty Images: skynesher)
Rowan wishes he had known how hard perimenopause would be on Sarah and the impact that it would have on her life.
""I didn't know anything about perimenopause and had never heard of it. I had heard of menopause and understood that menopause occurred for older women and was referred to as 'the change',"" he explains.
""I wish that it would have been easier for Sarah to find doctors knowledgeable of early onset perimenopause treatment and [who] would have been able to offer more medical support.""
Relationships can be difficult at the best of times, but particularly when people are at this stage in life, explains Dr Teagle.
""They're at the peak of their careers, they've maybe got teenage kids or kids leaving home, and their parents are getting older and more dependent or getting ill and dying.
Join host Yumi Stynes as she rips open the sealed section on life. Ladies, We Need to Talk goes deep on the personal stuff that's hard to talk about, even with your closest mates.
It's difficult to establish whether there is a link between perimenopause and divorce.
A survey of 1,000 women by the Family Law Menopause Project and Newson Health Research and Education in 2022 found seven in 10 women blamed menopause for the breakdown of their marriage.
Dr Teagle says both partners need to be sensitive and aware.
""That goes for women too. The partner is not a mind reader and if you're feeling lousy and you know that it's likely due to perimenopause, then talk to your partner about it.""
Allison also offers these words of wisdom for anyone supporting their partner through perimenopause.
""You need to stand beside your partner. You need to support them. You do not need to solve this problem — you can't solve it. And you need to understand that this poor person is now standing on quicksand.
""Just be there and listen.""

Public Health","Birgitte Lund says she was in disbelief when her daughter returned home one afternoon with a letter.
The letter stated that lead and copper, which are classified as potentially toxic metals, had been discovered in bubblers at Spring Terrace Public School near Orange in western New South Wales.
""I thought, 'Here we go again', and now it's even worse,"" Ms Lund said.
Children at the regional school have been supplied bottled water numerous times since 2023 due to bacteria and copper detections.
It was the first time lead had exceeded safe levels.
The metals were found during routine drinking water testing by the New South Wales Department of Education in March.
Testing identified the heightened levels of metals in school drinking water. (ABC Central West: Lani Oataway)
The results found exceedence in bubblers and a staffroom sink, with lead detected at 11 micrograms per litre (µg/L).
Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council has set a safe limit of 10µg/L in drinking water.
The World Health Organization's advice is that there is no safe level of lead exposure.
The NSW Education Department did not provide the copper results when requested by the ABC.
Emails seen by the ABC show the copper or lead results were not provided to parents who had requested it because testing ""is highly technical and requires interpretation by an expert"".
""I definitely think they're hiding something otherwise they would provide more information,"" Ms Lund said.
Birgitte Lund lives a few kilometres from Spring Terrace Public School. (ABC Central West: Xanthe Gregory)
""We're provided a single letter which is minimising the issue to the point where most people don't even compute that this is a serious health concern.
The education department has a six-monthly testing program at schools where tank water is used, but the previous tests were conducted in May 2024.
According to NSW Health, unborn babies, young children and pregnant women are at the greatest risk to lead contamination which can affect mental and physical development.
Childhood exposure, even at low levels, has been linked to lower IQ, impaired neurobehavioural development, decreased stature and growth, and impaired hearing.
At very high levels, lead can also cause confusion, seizures, coma and death.
Peter Bentivoglio says he is concerned by the findings. (ABC News: Marcus Stimson)
Peter Bentivoglio, a retired neurosurgeon and former chair of neurosurgery at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital, said the only way to determine the risk to children was to conduct blood testing.
""That will give some insight into the contamination that has reached their system,"" Dr Bentivoglio said.
""I don't believe there's any safe level of lead for children.
The education department and NSW Health did not respond to questions about offering blood testing.
The results were not the first time the school had experienced problems with its water supply.
In May 2023 and 2024, bacteria was detected in some water samples.
In May 2024 copper was also found in the same bubblers affected, as well as the staff kitchen tap.
The education department said in a statement it was undertaking remediation work and would re-test the outlets to ensure water was safe to drink.
A spokesperson said the department was also working closely with an independent hygienist to investigate the source of the lead and copper.
There are numerous pathways for lead exposure, including from plumbing systems containing lead.
There have been previous concerns about drinking water at Spring Terrace Public School.  (ABC Central West: Lani Oataway)
NSW Health has advised staff to flush their drinking water outlets before the start of each school term to protect pupils from higher concentrations of lead and copper.
""Water can dissolve lead and copper from pipes and plumbing fittings when it sits in pipes for extended times,"" a NSW Health fact sheet said.
The Australian Building Codes Board is adopting new standards from May 2026 requiring the use of reduced lead plumbing products for drinking water systems.
""While there is no legal requirement to replace existing plumbing, we proactively identify safety risks or contamination sources through the water testing program,"" the education department spokesperson said.
Their statement said other environmental factors could be potential sources but did not provide examples.
Ms Lund wants answers about the testing results. (ABC Central West: Lani Oataway)
Ms Lund said all scenarios must be explored, such as the possibility of dust contamination from the nearby Cadia Gold Mine.
Mine operator Newmont was recently fined $350,000 for breaching air pollution guidelines.
In a statement, a Newmont spokesperson said several NSW government agencies, including the Environment Protection Authority (EPA), conducted studies into drinking water around Cadia.
""The EPA [found] no statistically significant relationship between concentrations of metals in samples from water tanks and kitchen taps and distance or direction from Cadia mine,"" the spokesperson said.
A company-run water sampling program and risk assessment conducted by SAGE environmental concluded ""there were no drinking water quality clusters in the district and no known links or causes from Newmont Cadia's operation"".",XBy Xanthe Gregory,Fri 2 May

WARNING: This story contains content that readers may find distressing.
The video is displayed on two screens, one being a 3D digital reconstruction and the other CCTV footage of the moment Inspector Scott began her pursuit of Joel Cauchi.
The CCTV footage, released by the Coroners Court of New South Wales, begins with Cauchi brandishing a knife and hesitating before walking up the escalators at Westfield Bondi Junction on April 13.
Seconds later Inspector Scott is seen entering the Westfield and she is pointed in the direction of Cauchi by witnesses.

After going up the same escalator, Inspector Scott runs towards where Cauchi was spotted on level five of the shopping centre.
Two male witnesses follow Inspector Scott in her pursuit — French construction workers Silas Despreaux and Damien Guerot, who provided their accounts of the incident to the inquest on Tuesday.
Both men had earlier thrown bollards towards Cauchi, hitting him but failing to bring him down.
According to a statement Mr Despreaux gave to police, he said Inspector Scott ""was the one in front of the group"" of witnesses as they ran towards Cauchi's direction.
He said they all exited the escalator together and found ""other members of the public calling out to us and pointing us in the direction of where the attacker was"".
Included in the vision was Inspector Scott with both Silas Despreaux and Damien Guerot (pictured). (Supplied: Coroners Court of New South Wales)
As Cauchi and Inspector Scott turn a corner in the shopping centre, Cauchi suddenly stops and turns around, running towards Inspector Scott, as shown in the CCTV.
Within mere seconds, Inspector Scott is shown reaching for her gun in its holster and aiming the weapon towards Cauchi, where the CCTV then stops.
At the inquest, Inspector Scott said she fired her gun three times, two hitting Cauchi, and a third making contact with a large pot plant.
The 3D digital reconstruction showed there was 6.5 metres in distance between Cauchi and Inspector Scott in the final moments before he was shot.
Mr Despreaux said he was behind Inspector Scott when she fired her gun and that Cauchi got ""very close to the police officer … and he didn't show any signs of stopping"".
""It was clear to me that he was targeting the police officer.""

Vaping","The Coalition has confirmed it would allow vapes to be sold at retail stores, tax the products and regulate the industry, in a departure from the current legislation which allows for vapes only to be sold at pharmacies.
The opposition's costings, released on Thursday, reveal the measure would add $3.6 billion to the budget over four years.
It's the third biggest saving the Coalition is offering, which will be achieved through a $1 a millilitre tax.
Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor told Afternoon Briefing it was ""not a new policy"" and insisted it would not normalise vaping.
He said instead, the change would tackle organised crime and render the vape black market obsolete.
""There's already a big vaping tax on Australians by criminal organisations, criminal gangs,"" he said.
He said the higher price of vapes would discourage young Australians from taking up vaping and said it was ""not something we want young people adopting"".
""We want to make sure people think very hard before they do it.""
While the Coalition outlined the plan in June last year when the government and Greens joined to pass the current ban through the parliament, it has not been mentioned in the campaign.
At the time, Shadow Health Minister Anne Ruston said it was targeted at taking the profits away from organised crime groups.
Jill's vaping dependence and attempts to quit became a social media journey followed by millions. Here's what she thinks about the changes to Australia's vaping laws.

Responding to the Coalitions' costings on Thursday, Treasurer Jim Chalmers rubbished the idea, saying vapes were a ""gateway to smoking"" and accused the Coalition of making ""money off people vaping"".
He brushed aside questions about the revenue lost to the black market, saying the government ""wanted to get kids off vapes"".
But he said when it comes to the tobacco excise more broadly, he is aware it is an issue for the budget.

The AEC has confirmed it received a formal complaint about alleged bad behaviour by the Labor team at a Tweed pre-poll booth.
In a statement the AEC said:
We have seen a small number of complaints about behaviour relating to campaign volunteers.
These complaints typically relate to behaviour that occurs outside of the 6-metre exclusion zone for campaigning outside of the entrance to a polling place, and as such the AEC has limited legal powers.
On several occasions we have reminded campaign volunteers from parties across the political spectrum to interact respectfully, and with civility at all times.

Health","Chronic pain, regular hospital visits and the feeling of helplessness became part of everyday life for thousands of South Australians who received pelvic mesh implantations.
The implantations, also known as trans-vaginal mesh, are used for conditions including pelvis organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.
Some implants were banned in 2017, and a Senate inquiry in 2018 found that women who were suffering after having the devices inserted were ignored despite reporting several issues including pain.
The state government on Wednesday apologised to those who had the devices implanted — almost 22 years after they first started being used in South Australia in 2003.
There were around 11,000 mesh procedures in SA between 2003 and 2018, according to the state government.
Thousands of Australian women who won a landmark class action settlement more than a year ago over damage done by pelvic mesh have still not received any compensation.
Paramedic and Australian Mesh Support Group member Kim Blieschke, who had one implanted in March 2006 following a pelvic organ prolapse, said the apology is ""a first step"".
""It was found that the mesh was eroding through the side of my vagina,"" she said.
Ms Blieschke said that in 2014, after several attempts at getting Australian doctors to remove the mesh, she was forced to travel to America for the surgery — but she still experiences permanent symptoms.
""I had consulted around Australia and every doctor here had told me that my mesh couldn't be removed and if it was I'd end up with a urostomy bag, which is a bag instead of my bladder, or a colostomy bag; a bag instead of my rectum and bowel,"" she said.
""The pain is permanent now, the nerve damage is permanent, the scarring is permanent.""
In a statement read aloud in state parliament, Minister for Health and Wellbeing Chris Picton apologised on behalf of the state government to all ""South Australians adversely impacted by medical mesh implants"".
""I acknowledge the life-altering complications for many women and some men,"" Mr Picton said.
""For the pain, embarrassment and gaslighting they've endured — we are sorry.
""For the times where you've questioned your own experiences, were dismissed by those who were meant to care for you, and had to fight to receive appropriate, compassionate and quality care you deserved — we are sorry.""
A Senate inquiry found that some women were not properly informed about potentially serious side effects of pelvic mesh implants. (ABC News: Jerry Rickard)
For mother-of-three Ms Blieschke, the apology has been a ""long time coming"".
""A 'sorry' I guess goes a little way to helping women get the help they really need,"" she said.
""A lot of them are in pain 24 hours a day. It affects their whole life.
""They used to be quite fit and active women, you know, running around with their kids. They can't do that now.
Mr Picton also apologised to those left waiting for ""years for corrective surgery through the public health system"", and to those ""who still today are physically and emotionally affected by this systemic failure"".
""I know this apology does little to right the wrongs which you have endured,"" he said.

Ms Blieschke said previous recommendations handed down from the Senate and a South Australian inquiry resulted in a number of changes, but she did not think they went far enough.
Ms Blieschke expressed concern that other mesh products are still used in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence, and said she believes the use of all mesh should be suspended pending a ""safety and efficacy inquiry"".
The Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA) said it had undertaken a ""rigorous review"" of mesh products which led to the ""majority of mesh products being cancelled and removed from the Australian market"", however it said a small number were found to ""still have benefits for the Australian public"".
It said pelvic mesh in the form of mid-urethral slings continue to be used in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence due to the ""clinical evidence that supports their performance and safety"".
""The TGA continues to closely monitor the safety of mesh devices both in Australia and globally,"" it said.
Mr Picton said it was important for the government to do what it could ""to ensure that this doesn't happen again"".
""Between 2003 and 2018, approximately 11,000 mesh procedures had been performed in South Australia,"" he said.
""Women reported chronic pain, mesh erosion, infections and permanent nerve damage.
""By 2018, more than 4,000 women had already re-presented with complications.
""In every year since, it is estimated that around 150 women will require ongoing care through a multi-disciplinary specialist clinic.""

Growing Forward, a West End community group, planted an illegal community garden on an unused plot of land owned by the Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR).

Gardener Camilla Hall said the group did not necessarily trust the department's claims, but had been washing their vegetables extra carefully in the meantime.

""We're very interested to know what the relationship between the state government is with the development next door.

Water and soil contamination has been detected at several sites along the Kurilpa peninsula, which used to be a heavy industrial hub.
Coal tar, heavy metals, semi-volatile compounds and asbestos have previously been found in the area.
The department would not say what type of contamination was suspected at the garden, but a spokesperson said it would ""shortly"" receive the results of preliminary soil testing.
A group of ""guerilla gardeners"" have barricaded themselves in a community garden in response to the Queensland government's attempt to close the site due to contamination concerns.
""Further decisions will be made once the potential contamination risk and need for further testing is fully understood,"" they said.
The department fenced off the garden in February and put up signs warning that trespassers could be prosecuted.
But there have been no arrests or fines issued to the gardeners, who have continued to use the site.
The gardeners have knocked down the fences and have been using the site for acro yoga sessions, theatre sports and activist book discussions.
Ms Hall said the garden had become an important gathering place for the West End community, after being left empty for over 90 years.

Surrogacy","A Brisbane couple could face prosecution after they admitted to using a commercial surrogacy service to have a baby abroad.
It comes after the married couple sought a parenting order in court.
Commercial surrogacy arrangements are illegal in Australia, with Queensland residents also banned from doing it overseas.
The practice of surrogacy has been around since biblical times, and today it's a multi-billion-dollar industry.
In a decision handed down earlier this year, Federal Circuit and Family Court Justice Catherine Carew ordered documents in the case be referred to Queensland's Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to consider whether the couple should be prosecuted.
""It is not in contention that the applicants have entered into a commercial surrogacy arrangement … and as such are liable to prosecution,"" the January 28 judgement said.
""It has long been the approach of this court to refer such matters to the appropriate authorities and I propose to do so.""
The maximum penalty, if convicted, is three years' prison.
Justice Carew said it was ""curious, to say the least"" why the couple had filed an application that left them ""open"" to potential prosecution.

""I am concerned that to make the order sought by the applicants would act to circumvent the law in Queensland, where commercial surrogacy is a criminal offence,"" Justice Carew said.
A spokesperson for Queensland's Department of Justice said in a statement they have referred the information to the Queensland Police Service (QPS) for consideration.
QPS said it is making inquiries.

The ABC also approached the law firm that represented the couple, Sun Legal, which said it could not discuss the specifics due to confidentiality reasons.
Accredited family law specialist and Surrogacy Australia president Sarah Bevan, whose practice represented the surrogate mother in the case, said their client ""cooperated to help the parents be recognised as the baby's parents, as best as possible in Australia"".
""Many children born through surrogacy internationally do not have their reality recognised in a legal sense. That needs to change,"" she said.
The court was told the couple had been trying for a child for more than 15 years, including undergoing several rounds of IVF.

In mid-2023, they entered into a ""commercial surrogacy arrangement"" with a company, ""purportedly registered under the law of Country E"", the judgement said.
Under that agreement, the couple was to pay the company at least €84,000 (about $140,000) to ""make all necessary arrangements"", including locating a surrogate, sourcing anonymous donor eggs, and organising for the embryo to be implanted in the surrogate.
Justice Carew said there was no evidence of what payments or other benefits the surrogate mother — who is 37 years old, lives in ""country G"", and speaks no English — received for her part.
The baby was carried by a 37-year-old surrogate in a foreign country. (ABC News: Gregor Salmon)
In 2023, the surrogate was implanted with an embryo using a donor egg and the man's sperm (one half of the couple).
She gave birth to the baby the following year.
The Brisbane couple travelled overseas, and a birth certificate named the surrogate as the mother and the man (from the couple) as the father.

The decision also said the couple's legal representative had filed submissions, stating the child had been granted Australian citizenship and issued with an Australian passport, however, no copies of either document were included.
The lawyer further said the child travelled to Australia with the couple in late 2024.
However, Justice Carew said there was no evidence as to the current circumstances of the child or the couple.
""In the absence of evidence outlined … I am unable to be satisfied the proposed parenting order would otherwise be in the best interests of the child,"" she said.

As well as the referral to the Office of the DPP, Justice Carew also ordered that documents be sent to the Office of the NSW Legal Services Commissioner for ""consideration of what, if any, investigation is conducted"" as to whether the couple's lawyer complied with her duties.
""The facts seem to warrant an investigation into whether [she] has complied with her obligations as a legal practitioner by procuring and filing affidavits on behalf of the applicants in these proceedings, in which they admit to an offence under [section] 56 of the Surrogacy Act and whether she has otherwise breached her obligation to provide competent legal services,"" the decision said.
The judge also ordered that documents regarding the surrogacy be sent to the Office of the NSW Legal Services Commissioner. (Supplied: Adobe)
Sun Legal said it had handled ""countless similar"" surrogacy cases around Australia where parentage orders had been obtained ""without any issues"" before.
""The referral to the Office of NSW Legal Services Commissioner is very disappointing for us as we take our professional obligations very seriously and are committed to providing the best possible service and advice to clients,"" the law firm said in a statement to the ABC.
The Office of the NSW Legal Services Commissioner told the ABC it could not provide any information or comment on the matter.
The Smartraveller website warns that it is illegal for ACT, NSW and Queensland residents to enter into commercial surrogacy arrangements overseas and that ""doing so, could lead to arrest and jail in Australia"".
An Australian woman caught up in a surrogacy scandal in Greece has spoken about her emotional ordeal.
Concerns around commercial surrogacy arrangements include the exploitation of women, and the legal rights and citizenship of children born through surrogacy.
Last year, the federal government asked the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) to conduct an inquiry into Australian surrogacy laws. The final report is due in mid-2026.
Surrogacy lawyer Stephen Page said he had been calling for reform in Australia for more than a decade.
He said state laws around overseas surrogacy failed to work ""because they cannot be enforced and therefore should be repealed"".
Stephen Page says he's been advocating for legal reform for more than a decade. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)
Mr Page said more than 3,300 Australian children had been born to surrogates abroad, and estimated hundreds of them had uncertain parentage because of laws in some states forbidding international commercial surrogacy.
The family and fertility law expert said Australia had eight systems of surrogacy regulation — one for each state and territory.
""There should be a uniform law,"" Mr Page said.
""I've never cared whether it's a Commonwealth Act that covers it, or all the states and territories sign up to a uniform law. Neither matters as long as it's one version not eight versions.""
Mr Page said he was aware of three other Australian cases where judges had referred couples to prosecutors for commercial surrogacy, but to his knowledge, no-one had been prosecuted.
The lawyers said there were other Australian cases were the law was not being enforced, urging it be repelled. (Pexels: Katrin Bolovstova)
""You've got a law; you enforce the law,"" he said.
On the issue about whether surrogates, both in Australia and overseas, should be compensated, Mr Page said everyone else involved in the process was paid for their efforts — the doctors, embryologists, nurses and lawyers.
""The idea that a woman will take on the potential risk of death and, if she's not a family member or friend, will willingly put her hand up and be a surrogate, I think is fanciful,"" he said.
Surrogacy Australia board member Sam Everingham said laws in some states, making overseas commercial surrogacy arrangements illegal, were meant to dis-incentivise people from undertaking surrogacy overseas.
Sam Everingham says the laws were designed to discourage people going overseas for surrogacy arrangements. (Supplied: Quentin Theron)
He said the laws had failed.
""Unfortunately, it has led to a whole lot of children not having a legal parent in Australia because the parents are too scared to go to the courts [for parenting orders].
""Officially, these kids are supposed to have a legal parent signing off consents for hospital admissions and for school.
""But these things have never been raised because the schools and hospitals just tend to assume if you're turning up with a kid with the same surname as you, you're the legal parent.
""We are going to get a problem one day when something goes pear shaped.""
Mr Everingham says some people are scared to seek official court orders. (Supplied: Quentin Theron)
Mr Everingham said despite more than a dozen reviews into surrogacy in Australia in the past 15 years, none had led to law reform to give children born to overseas surrogates recognition as having an Australian parent.
He said he hoped the ALRC would make recommendations that led to change.
A spokesperson for Queensland Attorney-General Deb Frecklington said the government would consider any recommendations from that review and ""whether any changes to Queensland's surrogacy laws, policies or procedures are required"".
""The Crisafulli government is aware of the complexities many Queenslanders face in starting a family, including through surrogacy arrangements, and we always want to make sure our laws are fit for purpose and meet community expectations,"" they said.","Kate McKenna, JBy Janelle Miles",Thu 1 May

Drugs","Sniffer dogs will patrol a Sydney music festival where pill testing is set to be trialled this weekend, with the Minns government so far refusing to act on a key recommendation of its drug summit.
Police say drug detection dogs will be deployed ""throughout the precinct"" of the Midnight Mafia festival at Sydney Olympic Park on Saturday with a ""focus on detecting supply"".
Earlier this month, a report from last year's drug summit urged the state to ""cease the use of drug detection dogs … for suspected drug possession during the current trial of drug-checking services at music festivals"".
While the government is yet to officially respond to the report, NSW Premier Chris Minns has expressed a reluctance to implement that advice.
""I'm not prepared to say in relation to this big music festival, 'Look it's a big green light, if you're going to ingest drugs, the police aren't going to be there',"" Mr Minns said on Wednesday.
""I think that that would send the wrong message, and I think it would have the unintended consequence of seeing more people take and ingest the drugs — not less.""
New synthetic substances are appearing in recreational drugs across Australia, increasing the risk of harm. Could pill testing change that?
The report was criticised for not going far enough, including by the Redfern Legal Centre and Greens MP Cate Faehrmann, who called for drug detection dogs to be banned permanently rather than merely during the trial.
At the time, Ms Faehrmann said there was no excuse not to act on the recommendations, which she labelled ""politically palatable"".
The report found ""considerable support"" for scrapping sniffer dogs at music festivals, with concerns their presence led to ""panic consumption"" and increased the risk of overdose.
But it noted the law enforcement view that withdrawing dogs ""may increase organised crime at events"".
Critics also pointed to the low accuracy of drug dogs.

In 2019, an inquest into music festival deaths found that drugs were discovered in just 24 per cent of personal searches of people that dogs had indicated were carrying drugs.
The organiser of Midnight Mafia, HSU Events, has warned festivalgoers to expect a police operation involving drug detection dogs.
""HSU Events do not condone the possession or use of illegal drugs,"" the company said in a social media post this week.
Midnight Mafia will be the second festival to participate in the state's pill testing trial, after NSW Health debuted its drug checking service at the Yours and Owls event in Wollongong in March.

About 100 attendees submitted their drugs for testing at Yours and Owls, with 10 per cent of samples turning out to be a different substance.
Sniffer dogs were present at the festival too, despite concerns being raised.
At the same event, 23 people were charged with drug possession offences.
Pill testing was also amongst the summit's recommendations, but a trial of it was announced months before the report's release.
The premier indicated that police would not be targeting those using the drug checking service at Midnight Mafia, which is expected to draw a crowd of 23,000.
""Obviously it would be counterproductive if you had a tent … where drug testing took place, or pill testing took place, and then the individual was immediately nabbed as they walked out of the tent,"" Mr Minns said.
""The protocol is very clear in relation to that, and police won't be enforcing that aspect of law enforcement,"" he said.

Air Incidents","Australia's air safety watchdog has found  fuel mismanagement by a pilot and a series of maintenance oversights contributed to a light plane's crash landing on a highway in far-north Western Australia.
The Cessna 310, operated by charter company Broome Aviation, was en route to Derby, 2,200 kilometres north of Perth, from Warmun, 600km east of the town, when it landed heavily on Derby Highway, 5km from the town's airport.
Startled motorists pulled over to avoid the plane and provided first aid to the seriously injured pilot and an unscathed passenger.
The pilot was later airlifted to hospital in Perth.
The pilot broke every bone in their face after hitting the dashboard of the plane and the report noted they were not wearing an upper-torso restraint.
Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Angus Mitchell described it as a ""complex investigation.""
""We did find some shortcomings in the training and the consolidation of pilots, but more worrying we found organisational pressures to not report maintenance,"" Mr Mitchell said.
ATSB found the fuel gauges were inaccurate and defects were not rectified. (ABC News: Andy Seabourne)
The bureau upgraded the scope of its investigation after its initial probe found other pilots at Broome Aviation raised concerns about maintenance, safety and an ""oppressive culture.""
""There was a number of maintenance issues that we found, and that went to one of our findings around the operator themselves not reporting aircraft defects on maintenance releases,"" Mr Mitchell said.
""And also the pressure that pilots had to keep flying the aircraft that they at times considered unsafe.""
The charter plane was close to Derby Airport. (ABC Kimberley: Andrew Seabourne)
The ATSB found the plane's fuel gauges were not indicating accurately and that fuel amounts in different tanks were not calculated correctly leading to ""discrepancies"".
The report found Broome Aviation's operations manual did not include a procedure for recording in-flight fuel calculations, leading pilots to adopt varying methods for fuel monitoring.
He said the operator had addressed the issues raised by ATSB and modified their processes as a result.
Broome Aviation has been contacted for comment.

Workplace Accidents and Incidents","A Riverland citrus exporting company has been fined $129,000 after an employee was degloved in a workplace incident.
In March 2023, a 22-year-old employee's left forearm was degloved and suffered lacerations while working at a Lochert Bros Pty Ltd citrus packing facility in Ramco, South Australia.
In an online judgement from the South Australian Employment Tribunal, the incident was said to have taken place when the employee reached into a high-pressure washing machine while it was operating to dislodge stuck oranges.
The machine was designed by the company and custom-built approximately 30 years prior.
The sleeve of the victim's jacket became caught in a pinch point and her arm was pulled by the rotating drive chain into the pusher bars.
She suffered a degloving injury between her elbow and wrist and underwent surgery at the Royal Adelaide Hospital which included a ""split thickness"" graft from her left thigh.
Tribunal deputy president Stephen Lieschke said the injuries were ""extensive and severe"".
The company was charged on two counts: committing a Category 2 offence against the Work Health and Safety Act 2012, and failing to ensure the pressure washer's emergency stop control complied with Work Health and Safety Regulations 2012.
It was found the control ""was not prominent"", nor was it ""clearly and durably marked and immediately accessible to each worker operating the plant"". It was also not coloured red.
The particulars of the offence also found the company had failed to provide ""information, training, instruction or supervision"" to protect workers from risks.
Mr Lieschke said Lochert Bros entered an early guilty plea within four weeks of its first appearance, allowing for a reduction in penalty.
A conviction was recorded for each count, a fine of $129,000 was issued and Lochert Bros was ordered to contribute to the informant's legal costs.
SafeWork SA was notified of the incident and investigators attended the workplace on March 10, 2023.
Lochert Brothers was issued with 44 improvement notices by SafeWork following several compliance inspections in the months after, including 18 relating to inadequate machinery guarding.
On 20 June 2023, the company advised SafeWork SA it had spent a total of $12,669.98 on repairs and safety upgrades to the pressure washer post-incident.
The tribunal heard that following the incident Lochert had appointed Liz Fourie as a chief executive and the company had since spent more than $250,000 on various safety upgrades.

Lochert Bros said it conducted an audit of its safety compliance where the incident occurred, and that it planned to arrange a similar audit of its transport division and site.
Mr Lieschke said the victim had ""made a good recovery"", felt supported by Lochert Bros with ongoing employment and had taken note of the safety improvements.
However, he said the victim had “unnecessarily struggled financially while [still] recovering”, after she did not receive her entitled workers' compensation for unexplained reasons.

Crime","A critical care paramedic who responded to the Bondi Junction stabbing says he felt ""frustrated"" and ""inadequate"" after a directive for ambulance officers to stay outside the Westfield shopping centre.
WARNING: This story contains content that readers may find distressing.
Christopher Wilkinson is an emergency officer with four decades' experience and who assessed security guard Faraz Tahir on the day 40-year-old Joel Cauchi went on the stabbing rampage through the centre, killing six people and injuring 10 others.
Doctors did “everything possible to save” Mr Tahir, who was on his first shift, but he died at the scene.
Counsel assisting the coroner Emma Sullivan told the court that at the same time Mr Wilkinson arrived on the scene, intelligence had broadcast for all crews to remain in situ while the possibility of a second armed offender was investigated.
A hot zone, or an ""active area of threat"" limiting who could enter, was later established, she said.
Mr Wilkinson said he heard about the hot zone from a police officer positioned outside the Westfield entrance who ""stated no-one could enter those doors"".
He triaged three victims stabbed by Cauchi who were brought outside, including Mr Tahir, but said it was ""far too long to [get] ambulances to some of the patients inside"", the court heard.

""For me, standing around … knowing there could possibly be people dying on the inside of the premises and not going to them because there could be a second offender, or could be a hot zone, is not good enough,"" he said.
""Someone of my experience, of 42 years … I felt inadequate being forced to stay on the outside.
""I stood there with my boots on the ground quite frustrated that people could may well be dying upstairs, and nobody was doing anything medically for them.""
Assistant Commissioner Brent Armitage, who was the ambulance commander at the scene, issued a directive for all crews to exit Westfield at 4:28pm due to the hot zone.
However, a minute earlier, police radio had confirmed there was no second offender after a review of CCTV.
Commissioner Armitage agreed that information would have been important for NSW Ambulance to know and would have been relevant to his directive.
""With the benefit of hindsight, the area would not have been declared hot, but I probably still would have withdrawn [crews],"" he said.
There were no patients remaining inside Bondi Junction Westfield by the time the hot zone was formally declared, the court heard.
When Ms Sullivan put to Commissioner Armitage that the hot zone declaration had no impact on clinical outcomes but was an ""important potential learning exercise”, he agreed.

Mr Wilkinson said he thought ""we need to change the way we do things"".
""There's an expectation an ambulance will arrive [when called],"" he said.
""We bring calmness to a scene and reassurance to the scene.""
He supported the introduction of a ""rescue task force"" where police provide protection to paramedics when entering an active armed offender situation.

Emergency Services","A second illegal COVID-era funeral gathering hosted by Ambulance Victoria has come to light a week after another very similar event was revealed.
Ambulance Victoria (AV) has confirmed a second post-funeral honour guard took place for a deceased paramedic in 2021, which was unauthorised under lockdown restrictions at the time.
The organisation's interim chief executive officer Andrew Crisp confirmed on Wednesday that he was aware of ""two guards of honour that occurred in 2021"".
""Members of the executive team involved in organising these events are no longer at Ambulance Victoria and our current leadership team does not support these actions,"" he said.
Ambulance Victoria has confirmed its staff arranged a gathering of 40 people to farewell a colleague who had died at a time when the state's COVID-19 rules capped funerals at 10.
""These events should not have happened, and we regret the impact of these historic events on our people and the broader community.""
Mr Crisp said Victorians could have confidence in the state's paramedics to provide the best care to the community every day.
It is not clear what date the second honour guard event took place, or how many people were in attendance.
The event he confirmed on Wednesday has been made public a week after an anonymous submission to a parliamentary enquiry into the state's ambulance services revealed a very similar event on 30 September 2021, which was discreetly organised for a different paramedic who had died.
AV said both gatherings were reported to the Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission (IBAC) in 2022.
AV commissioned an independent, external body to investigate the gathering, though the result of the probe is unclear.
The other honour guard event was investigated internally.
The Victorian Ambulance Union has told the ABC the gathering took place after a funeral ceremony in the form of an 'honour guard' as the family of the deceased paramedic and the hearse drove past.
The union said there was no suggestion the family did anything wrong or that the funeral itself was conducted incorrectly.
It said paramedics put in a request to conduct the honour guard and received approval from the CEO beforehand — they wouldn't have done anything without approval.
The union said the actions of senior management and the subsequent investigation into the gathering should be questioned, not the actions of individual paramedics.
The Victorian opposition is demanding transparency.

Mental Health","When Samreen Tanveer left Dhaka, in Bangladesh, for Sydney, nothing had prepared her for life in a foreign country so unlike her own.
""The people are different. Your surroundings are different. You're away from your family, your friends and everything that's familiar,"" the former University of NSW student tells ABC Radio National's Life Matters.
Life Matters is here to help you get a handle on all the important stuff: love, sex, fitness, health, parenting, career, finances and family.
""It's a whole new country ... a whole new experience.""
When Koushik Mukherjee farewelled his parents and younger sister in India at the end of 2021 so he could study in Melbourne, he too grappled with life in a new country
""[Lack of] job security, along with loneliness, do contribute towards that extra bit of mental stress. And right now you can also add the housing crisis in there,"" he says.
Housing was also a challenge for Ms Tanveer, who describes navigating the Australian rental market as ""overwhelming"".
International student Koushik Mukherjee struggled with loneliness when he first moved to Australia. (Supplied)
It's the same housing crises both major parties are hoping to alleviate by capping international student numbers in an effort to return migration rates to pre-pandemic levels.
A recent study found no link between international student numbers and the rising cost of rent, but that hasn't stopped political debate around international student numbers intensifying in the lead up to the election.
This discussion has created enormous uncertainty for international students.
And it comes after research, released last year, revealed international students experience worse mental health than domestic students.
International students experience several mental health issues, including higher levels of anxiety compared to their domestic counterparts, according to the findings published in the Journal of Mental Health.
When Poora first came to Australia to study pharmacy, she found the road bumpier than expected. But her experiences led her to discover a new passion, and find her voice.
More than half of those surveyed experienced discrimination, racism and abuse, with female international students scoring significantly higher when it came to physical and or verbal abuse, sexual harassment and exclusion.
International students also encountered many challenges in their attempts to settle in Australia, including difficulty adjusting, social isolation, language barriers and culture shock.
Other reports show that they can also face loneliness, a higher risk of social exclusion, psychological stress and, in some cases, self-harm.
One of Ms Tanveer's biggest challenges when she first arrived in Australia was her battle with homesickness.
Last year, there were more than one million international student enrolments in Australia. It was a new milestone for this country's international student sector.
We have the second highest share of international students globally, and education is our fourth largest industry.
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, international students generated $51 billion for the economy in 2023-24.
Dr Gaby Ramia believes universities should do more to look after the mental health of international students. (Supplied)
But a report last year by Gaby Ramia, professor of policy and society at the University of Sydney, claimed universities aren't doing enough to help those students with their mental health needs.
The report was triggered by a 2021 coroner's report that revealed 47 international students died by suicide between 2009 and 2019 in Victoria alone.
Dr Ramia says international students lack protection in the welfare system and they are much less likely to seek help.
""They're at a disadvantage both in terms of long-term policy and legal neglect by governments on both sides of politics,"" he told ABC Radio National's Breakfast in July.
""There is a code of practice which guides educational institutions in the way they deal with international students. And if you look at the provisions, they look actually quite good.
""But at their base, they're basically recommendatory and they're not mandatory for the educational institutions to provide services.""
Dr Ramia says there are also particular societal difficulties that international students have to deal with.
There is also the lack of income protection through the social security system, which came to the fore during the COVID pandemic.
Jo Cassidy, the associate director of RMIT's student wellbeing hub, is not surprised by these findings.
In 2024, 24 per cent of total enrolments at the education institution, located in the heart of Melbourne, were international students.

Homesickness and a lack of belonging are consistent themes among those who seek out her team of 16 counsellors.
Another issue is navigating a completely different system to what they may be used to in their home countries.
""All of our systems — banking systems, the way that we work — are very different. So navigating all of those things can be really difficult,"" explains Ms Cassidy.
""And then there's global events that happen within their own countries and within our country.""
It's something Ms Tanveer experienced first hand when protests in Bangladesh last year led to a communication blackout and curfew. It left her family back home in the dark.
""That was really scary and unsettling,"" she says.
Then there are issues of racism, as well as cost of living concerns.
""They do report incidents of racism, and our Safer Communities Team [offers] support on that issue as well,"" says Ms Cassidy.
The cost of living, including rising rents, are a concern for many of Australia's international students.  (ABC News: Margaret Burin)
So, what are the solutions?
Mr Ramia doesn't believe universities are to blame for international students' poor mental health, but he says they need to be compelled to act by government.
""[Universities] do what they need to do under the law, but they very rarely will step up to think outside the box and provide services that are actually needed on the ground,"" he says.
Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks … and you don't need to be a scientist to find it!
""What we're recommending … is for universities to come together with other organisations that provide services in terms of mental health, but also allied services [to assist with] housing, broader health and, in particular, financial insecurity.""
Despite the obstacles that can come with leaving home and moving to a new country, students like Ms Tanveer and Mr Mukherjee are making the most of their life in Australia.
""Looking back, I've grown a lot since arriving,"" says Ms Tanveer.
""I've learned to navigate new environments, take on new responsibilities and adapt to different situations, which has strengthened my character and shaped me into a better version of myself.""
Ms Tanveer also found a mentor through the Warrior Women’s Foundation, a charity that provides support for young women.
“[The foundation] helps you learn vital life skills, such as how to set up a bank account, how to set up your tax file, how to talk to someone … ,” she explains.
Meanwhile Mr Mukherjee is continuing his Bachelor of Business studies. Earlier this year, he was selected as a finalist at the AFR's Top 100 Future Leaders Awards.

Alcohol","A Queensland MP who was photographed drinking full-strength beer while in a restricted alcohol zone in the Aboriginal community of Palm Island, has told parliament he was issued with a caution by Queensland Police.
Nick Dametto, the Katter's Austraila Party (KAP) member for Hinchinbrook, shared photos on Facebook on Good Friday that showed him and friends on a beach on Curacao Island in North Queensland.
One of the photos shows Mr Dametto drinking a full-strength beer.
The Island, about one kilometre from Great Palm Island, falls under an alcohol management plan, which prohibits full-strength beer from being brought to and consumed on 10 islands that collectively make up the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire.
Mr Dametto told State Parliament he was unaware Curacao Island fell under the same regulations.
The maximum amount of alcohol a person can carry in the restricted area is 11.25 litres of any liquor with an alcohol concentration of less than 4 per cent.
The beer Mr Dametto was photographed drinking has an alcohol concentration of 4.2 per cent.
""The incident was subsequently investigated by Queensland Police and, following the investigation, an adult caution was issued. I can advise the House that the matter is now finalised,"" Mr Dametto told State Parliament this morning.

Bwgcolman woman and former councillor Andrea Kyle-Sailor said in her experience it was rare for Palm Island residents to be cautioned over breaking alcohol management plan laws.
""The only time I've ever heard of a caution is for children, but I've never heard of it being done for adults — particularly for the AMP [Alcohol Management Plan].""
Ms Kyle-Sailor said many years go her own aunty, who was 67-years-old, had to face court for breaking the restrictions.
""No criminal history, had never been before the courts in her life and she wasn't afforded a caution,"" she said.
""She had to face the Magistrates Court which was a bit embarrassing.""

Ms Kyle-Sailor said she would like the government to review the alcohol management plan to see if it was necessary.
She said she knew people who had lost their job, their blue card and even been imprisoned for breaking the restrictions.
""A caution is when the crime is not serious. Well, why are we continuing to go to court and being heavily fined?""

Fifteen local government areas across Queensland have alcohol restrictions with varying rules co-designed between the state government and the communities.
Alcohol management plans are designed to target illicit alcohol and promote ""a healthy culture and attitude"" towards alcohol.
When asked about the incident involving Mr Dametto, a spokesperson for Queensland Police said the investigation had been finalised.

Autism Spectrum Disorder","A school dedicated to the needs of pupils with autism is set to open in Perth on July 1 with the backing of Western Australia's former chief scientist and neuroscientist Lyn Beazley.
The Lyn Beazley Academy in West Perth will host 48 students in grades 10-12 and is intended to serve teens who have academic potential but struggle to cope in a mainstream school environment.
Professor Beazley told ABC Radio Perth's Nadia Mitsopoulos that many parents and young people with autism were calling for a new option in school education.
""When I was chief scientist of WA I visited many schools and we were there particularly to encourage young people into science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics,"" Professor Beazley said.
""I saw young people who didn't quite fit in, but I knew had tremendous potential.
""From then on I really wanted to make sure that they could really benefit from the best education for them, but also for society, because they have so much to offer so many skills and we really need those in our workforce and in our community.""
The school will not have regular lessons, which many autistic students say they struggle to cope with. (AAP: Paul Miller — file photo)
The school will offer a three-day-per-week program tailored to individual pupils and have high staff-to-student ratios.
Students will not have a school uniform.
""I'm so happy with the team we've put in place,"" Professor Beazley said.
""It will not look like a conventional school.
""We will have opportunities for individual learning programs, but also group learning.""
The school will encourage students to participate in community activities, undergo work experience placements and enrol part-time at TAFE.
England, the US and Canada are among the countries with national autism strategies — and now Australia has one too.
Professor Beazley said the school would encourage students to follow their own individual interests.
""We're talking [about] those young people who, like me, get switched on by science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics,"" she said.
""They might be ones who would want to write a computer program, build themselves a circuit board or a radio.
""They might have a great artistic talent.
""They might want to design something or, like me, they might have a real passion for the environment.
Thousands of Australian kids experience 'school can't'. For these families, finding a system that works has transformed their child's life.
The academy is yet to reveal its fees, but Professor Beazley says they will be modest and that parents can discuss about scholarships or price reductions if needed.
The school has attracted private funding and may apply for government assistance available to independent schools.
The board plans to expand to cater to grades 7-12, but not to pre-high school students.
""The data suggests that primary school isn't quite as challenging — same teacher, familiar surroundings,"" Professor Beazley said.
The value of special schools has split opinion for years and was highlighted by the disability royal commission's 2023 recommendation to phase them out by 2051.
Debate has erupted again over the future of special schools following the disability royal commission's final report. Here's why the issue is so complex and personal.
But the commissioners themselves were divided on the issue and three of the six – including the two living with disability – made that recommendation.
ABC Radio Perth listeners also had mixed views.
""My son is almost 13 and has autism,"" one parent wrote.
""I, personally, strongly don't see this being beneficial.
""It feels very Montessori-structured, which was incredibly unhelpful for my son.
Others said the school could be exactly what their children needed.
""My children will be your first students,"" said Brooke Brophy, whose 13-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter have autism.
""They both have gifted IQs,"" she said.
""Neither have been able to cope in mainstream school for over 10 years.
""My kids don't have behavioural problems, but they are socially and emotionally delayed because they have autism.
""My 13-year-old is bullied relentlessly at school.
""Both my children have been suicidal as a result of mainstream education.""
Professor Beazley agreed the school would not be suitable for all children and that prospective students and their parents would be asked to attend an interview for assessment before being offered a place.",Emma Wynne,Tue 29 Apr

The one-minute clip, designed to attract tourists to the state, shows a man riding an e-bike on the sand at a Surfers Paradise beach on the Gold Coast.
It has prompted the local council to consider introducing laws around the use of electric vehicles along its 50-kilometre coastline.

Mr Twine said Bicycle Queensland would support the campaign if the scene was pulled from its ads.
""One of the unintended consequences might be that people might look at that and then think that it's okay to ride their bike on the beach,"" he said.
""We would support if they wanted to re-edit it and put it up on a bikeway — you can still show that people are happy and enjoying the tremendous environment that we have in places like Surfers Paradise.""
However, Tourism Minister Andrew Powell has defended the campaign.
""People complaining about a production clearly need a holiday,"" he said in a statement to the ABC on Tuesday.

Queensland Tourism's last campaign, which centred around the popular animated series Bluey about a family of blue heelers, cost about $9.2 million.
Mr Powell said the cost of this year's campaign was yet to be determined.
""The exciting thing about this brand is that it's not just one campaign, this is multiple campaigns, this could go four or five years … until we know how long it plays out, I haven't got a number for you,"" he said.
In Queensland, electric bikes can be used on roads and footpaths and there are no state laws prohibiting people from riding them on beaches.
With local councils responsible for governing beaches within their jurisdiction, acting Gold Coast Mayor Mark Hammel said the council would now review its local laws around the use of e-bikes in that environment.
Concerns rise over young e-bike riders.
""It's great to see the Gold Coast featured in the ad — I understand cycling on the beach isn't in breach of any by-laws,"" Cr Hammel said.

She said she was driving on patrol in Bondi when she heard an emergency radio alert and ""knew right then it was very real"".
At 3:37pm, she arrived outside the shopping centre and was faced with civilians ""pouring out"" onto the street, ""yelling at me"" to apprehend Cauchi.
She told the coronial inquest that after charging up the escalators, she caught sight of him on level five and called out for him to ""stop"".
Cauchi turned to look in her direction and then ran, she said.
She saw his knife, which she assessed to be about 30 centimetres long and said she ""knew it could cause some serious damage"".
Her priority was clearing bystanders out of the way.
""I was conscious it was school holidays, a lot of people were in the mall at the time and I didn't want to hurt anyone else,"" she said.
""As long as I'm chasing this guy, hopefully he's not going to do any more damage.""

Inspector Scott said Cauchi eventually turned to face her and started running towards her and that her first thought was ""he was going to kill me"".
She fired her gun three times, two hitting Cauchi, and a third making contact with a large pot plant a woman with a pram had previously been hiding behind.
Inspector Scott said she then had to ""bite the bullet"" to secure the knife from underneath Cauchi after he died.
Her interaction with him lasted for a minute and 25 seconds in total from the moment she entered the centre.
As she entered the shopping centre, she said she ""couldn't wait"" for her colleagues to arrive and called in that she was ""going in"" alone.

Silas Despreaux and Damien Guerot, who fought Cauchi with two bollards, directed her to where they last saw Cauchi.

In their initial statement, Mr Despreaux said, ""OK let's go catch him"" to Mr Guerot.
""The first time we see him we just ran [and thought] I need to find something to protect myself,"" Mr Despreaux said.
""First thing I saw was a bollard so I took it straight away.""

""I said, 'That's great but stay behind me.'""
Inspector Scott said as they searched for Cauchi it was ""on the back of my mind"" there may have been more than one attacker.
Speaking outside the NSW State Coroner's Court in Lidcombe, Mr Guerot said Inspector Scott ""is a hero"".
Inspector Scott became emotional as she remembered the officers who came as backup after Cauchi was shot, some of whom have not returned to the force since the attack.
""Whilst I was the person who faced Joel, those same officers [went in too] … I just want to acknowledge their courage and bravery.
""As tragic as that day was, it restored my faith in humanity.""
She was questioned by Sophie Callan SC, representing the NSW police commissioner, about whether she felt fear.
""I actually felt nauseous as I ran in, because in my head I'd resigned myself to the fact that I was probably going to die,"" Inspector Scott said.
Referring to active armed offender training, she said police look at a 60 to 70 per cent chance of non-survival if you're ""partnered and vested up, and I was neither of those"".
The senior police officer who attended the crime scene, Christopher Whalley, also got emotional thinking about the commitment of young officers that day.
""I spoke to … some police who were guarding one of the scenes within the centre and asked why they were standing where they were, which was quite close to one of the people who had [died],"" the chief inspector said.

Five patients with the condition have already been dosed as part of the trial, including mum-of-two Caecilie Wickstroem Giralde, who was diagnosed last year.
University of Queensland researcher Ranjeny Thomas has spent more than a quarter of a century developing the drug, designed to rebalance the body's immune response in people with type 1 diabetes, which affects more than 130,000 Australians.

The immune system starts to recognise insulin-producing cells in the pancreas as something it needs to attack and destroy in people with type 1 diabetes — one of dozens of auto-immune diseases in which the body starts to attack itself.
Professor Thomas, who is based at UQ's Frazer Institute, said the experimental drug — dubbed ASITI-201 — was designed to retrain the immune system so it no longer attacks the insulin-producing pancreatic cells, known as beta cells.
The drug, given as an injection under the skin, combines fragments of a protein found in the beta cells of people with type 1 diabetes and vitamin D to calm the immune response.

""This therapy is really trying to get to the root cause of the autoimmune disease,"" Professor Thomas said.
She said if effective, the drug would initially be given to patients with type 1 diabetes as soon as possible after diagnosis to preserve remaining pancreatic cells and reduce the amount of insulin needed.
But eventually, if screening programs can be developed to pick up people at risk of developing type 1 diabetes, it may be possible to ""prevent the progression of the disease altogether"".
""If we can show that this drug is very safe and it does what we expect to calm the immune system, then that is an opportunity for us,"" Professor Thomas said.

The first in-human trial of 36 participants will test the safety of the drug, but blood tests will also determine the impact of the therapy on a patient's immune system and glucose tolerance.
Three doses of ASITI-201 will be trialled at the Translational Research Institute's clinical research facility based at Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital.
Some patients will also receive a placebo.
The trial is blinded so neither the patients, nor the investigators, are aware of who receives the active drug or the placebo.
Ms Wickstroem Giralde was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes last year. (ABC News: Janelle Miles)
Ms Wickstroem Giralde developed gestational diabetes during pregnancies with Frida, 4, and Vincent, 2, which put her at increased risk of type 1 diabetes.
She was then diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in October last year, which requires regular insulin injections, so volunteered to take part in the trial.
Insulin plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels — the body's primary source of energy — by allowing glucose to move from the bloodstream into cells.

""I think what's special about this trial is that it's so specific,"" she said.
""If the drug works, it can go and reprogram your immune system and help preserve the beta cells and help you produce your own insulin for longer.
Having been born in Scandinavia also gave the Denmark-raised 36-year-old a higher chance of developing the condition.
For people who have to inject insulin every day to stay alive, public ignorance about the condition, and its causes, can be intensely frustrating.
Ms Wickstroem Giralde admits to being ""needle-phobic"" and joined the trial hoping it would reduce her reliance on insulin.
""Multiple daily injections of insulin is so hard,"" she said.
""I will never get used to giving myself injections. I have to take a deep breath, close my eyes every time I have to do it.
""If I could do anything that could take that away, I would be willing to do that.
""Even if it can't help me, but it can help someone in the future, I'm more than happy to give my body for that.""

""At dinner time, I'll take my insulin, I'll eat, we might muck around a little bit more than what we usually do, and my blood sugar will go low just as I'm about to put the kids to bed,"" Ms Wickstroem Giralde said.
""Then I'll be like: 'Kids, just go in bed, choose your books'. I'll have to eat some sugar, sit down, make sure my sugar goes back in range so I don't go all shaky and uncomfortable while I'm putting my kids in bed.
The drug trial's lead investigator Aakansha Zala, an endocrinologist at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, said having type 1 diabetes was ""exhausting"" for many patients.
Dr Zala said the condition could lead to a ""wide array"" of complications, including kidney issues, where patients may end up needing dialysis.
Dr Aakansha Zala said people managing type 1 diabetes can often feel exhausted. (ABC News: Will Murray)
""They can get issues with their nerves — where they may not feel things as easily — and sometimes that can affect their ability to drive, so if people have really bad nerve issues, they're not allowed to drive,"" she said.
""It can also increase the risk of foot infections and amputations. There's an increased risk of heart disease, of strokes. They can get issues with their eyes where they may even potentially lose vision.
To take part in the study, participants need to be at least 18 years old and to have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes within the past five years.
Ms Wickstroem Giralde hopes the trial will lead to positive health outcomes for people managing type 1 diabetes. (ABC News: Janelle Miles)
Dr Zala said they were still recruiting for the study.
The researchers have some funding available to pay for travel for people living outside of Brisbane who are eligible for the trial.
Future trials, including some with children — who have a much faster progression to insulin dependence — are planned.
Diabetes Australia's director of research Grant Brinkworth, who is not involved in the trial, said the drug being tested could ""fundamentally change"" the lives of people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.
Grant Brinkworth said the experimental drug could drastically change the lives of people with type 1 diabetes, if the trial proves successful. (Supplied: Diabetes Australia)
""If successful, this research could reduce or eliminate the need for people living with the condition to endure life-long daily insulin injections and lessen the risk of the health complications associated with living with diabetes,"" Professor Brinkworth said.
""Living with type 1 diabetes is a life-changing diagnosis and people with the condition make about 250 extra decisions every day to manage their health.""

Disabilities","The former operator of a Sydney childcare centre where children were force-fed until they vomited, strapped in highchairs for hours and had their heads shoved into garbage bins, has been permanently banned from working in the disability support sector.
Thomas Fanous, who was the sole director and person in control of Jumpstart childcare centres, was exposed in March in a Four Corners investigation which revealed he had moved into the NDIS.
The revelations prompted a formal investigation by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, which has now issued him with a permanent banning order, effective from April 24, across all states and territories, banning him from delivering all NDIS services or supports.
""Permanent banning orders are issued for the most serious cases of non-compliance with the NDIS Code of Conduct, where a provider or worker is deemed to be unsuitable to provide supports or services to people with disability,"" a spokesperson for the commission said.
It said it was continuing to look into the matters identified and could not comment further at this stage.
Court records show that during Mr Fanous's time operating Jumpstart, children were subjected to repeated abuse.
Educator Amara Jaroudi was convicted of seven offences, including slamming a two-year-old onto a bench, force-feeding children, and shoving a three-year-old autistic boy's head into a garbage bin. She was fined $38,650.

The company, Kids Kinder Pty Ltd, which operated Jumpstart, pleaded guilty to 12 offences, including failing to protect children from harm, and was fined $186,620.
For nearly a decade, none of the five childcare centres operated by Mr Fanous met minimum national quality standards.
Company records show that Mr Fanous and his wife Sally, who was the nominated supervisor at Jumpstart during the period of abuse, established TF Disability Services in November 2023.
The company is listed as the registered owner of the website for Prime Support Services Australia, which markets itself as offering ""NDIS services to help you"".
The website of Prime Support Services Australia, which has since been taken down. (Prime Support Services Australia)
The website of the business, which has since been taken down, claimed it could provide ""personalised support for daily activities, personal care, household tasks, assistance through life transitions, innovative community participation and reliable transport"".
The Prime Support Services Australia website featured its top 10 Google reviews, among them a five-star rating from Sally Fanous, and another from Christine Fanous, who wrote: ""Great provider to work with. Easy, transparent and very professional. Quality care and seamless process. Would highly recommend PSSA!""
The business and a trust connected to it, the TF Disability Services Trust, are not registered as providers with the NDIS.
However, businesses that do not directly provide services but act only as consultants, charging a fee to connect clients with disability service providers, are not required to register.

Jumpstart was part of a broader ABC investigation into Australia's $20 billion-a-year childcare sector, which has triggered a parliamentary inquiry led by NSW Greens MP Abigail Boyd. Submissions close at the end of May.
Ms Boyd said she felt relief at the news of the banning order given what had been allowed to occur under Mr Fanous's watch a few years ago.
She said while his permanent banning would offer some comfort to the countless concerned members of the public, she said it was worth remembering that this kind of offending was far from unique.
""What makes this case unusual is precisely the fact that it resulted in a prosecution, and as a result a public record of offending has been able to be referred to and used to demonstrate his inappropriateness as someone operating such a vital social service,"" she said.
NSW Greens MP Abigail Boyd. (Four Corners)
Ms Boyd worked with the ABC for six months to expose the industry, using a parliamentary order to force the NSW early childhood regulator to release thousands of internal documents.
These reveal shocking incidents between 2020 and 2024, including children being dragged, kicked, used as human mops, and suffering serious injuries such as fractured skulls and burns.
Ms Boyd said the document showed that all too often, similar patterns of unacceptable behaviour are not prosecuted.
""And, even when cases reach the incredibly high threshold for prosecution set by the regulator, around 90 per cent never make it to trial or conviction — instead preferring secret plea deals that don't result in a public finding being made,"" she said.
The ABC investigation uncovered widespread neglect, underqualified staff, strict sales targets for educators, and children being fed 33-cent meals to maximise profits.
It found that 95 per cent of new centres in the past decade were for-profit, with nearly three-quarters of long daycare services now commercially operated.
Mother of three Jane was sent daily photos of her non-verbal son in one of Mr Fanous's New South Wales childcare centres and thought everything was normal.
But it was all fake.
Her three-year-old was subjected to horrific abuse, left in a highchair for hours at a time, force fed, pinched, yanked, and thrown to the ground by educator Amara Jaroudi.
Jane's son was strapped to a highchair for hours at a time at a Jumpstart centre in NSW. (Supplied)
At times, Jaroudi would splash the child with water for her own amusement while he was strapped into the highchair.
""It was a house of horrors,"" Jane said.
A court order prevents Jane's real name from being published.
""I can't express the anger I felt when I found out he was working in [the] NDIS.
""He had already hurt my disabled son and he was working with some of our most vulnerable people with disabilities.""
""I was heartbroken that other families may use his services … and their children were going to be in danger of possibly being mistreated.
""I don't want anyone to feel the pain that our family has felt, that he caused.""
""The relief knowing he's now been banned, it was just immense joy.""
""Jane"" says Thomas Fanous should never have been allowed to work in the NDIS. (Four Corners)
Jane said she was disgusted and hurt that Mr Fanous ended up working in the NDIS without proper checks being done.
""He should never have been anywhere near the NDIS.
""He had a shop front.
""They [the NDIS] should have found the court cases on Jumpstart.""
Her son, now seven, still bears the physical and emotional scars of his time at Jumpstart.
""He has permanent marks on his buttocks,"" Jane revealed. ""That's because he was sitting there for hours and hours and hours [in a highchair].""
After the revelations other families and former workers came forward, describing concerns at the centres.
Kobie Burgess was 20 years old when she started working for Mr Fanous.
It was her first job in the childcare industry, employed as a trainee at Kids Kinder in Austral NSW.
""He's a horrible person,"" Ms Burgess said.
""He shouldn't be around children.""
She said Mr Fanous would run the childcare centre like an army camp.
""Kids weren't allowed to cry, laugh or talk loudly.
""During rest time kids weren't allowed off their beds. They would force kids to sleep.""

She said as a trainee, sometimes she was even left without proper supervision, which is illegal.
""There was a time I opened up the centre with another trainee and the education department walked in for a spot check.
""There were kids sitting in highchairs without an educator sitting with them, they saw kids not supervised while eating, checklists not done.
""They asked me if I had my first aid certificate, I didn't.""
The child and others were left in highchairs for hours at a time, force fed, pinched, yanked, and thrown to the ground.
Ms Burgess didn't witness the shocking incidents of abuse which occurred at Mr Fanous's other centres by educator Amara Jaroudi.
But there were clear warning signs.
""He knows how to manipulate young people — he had a lot of young people working for him.
""I was feeling sick every day going into work. You never knew what mood he'd be in.""
Other standards also fell short.
""I saw the children weren't being fed properly, there wasn't a cook.
""For lunch sometimes it was pizza.""
Ms Burgess still works in childcare.
""When I left and worked at another centre, I finally saw what childcare is meant to be like and it's caring for kids.""

Crime","A coronial inquest into the Bondi Junction stabbing will examine killer Joel Cauchi's ""preoccupation with death and murder"" and ""inner turmoil"" in the lead-up to the fatal attack.
Cauchi, 40, killed six and injured 10 during a stabbing rampage at the Westfield shopping centre in Sydney's east on April 13, 2024.
WARNING: This story contains content that readers may find distressing.
He was shot dead by NSW Police Inspector Amy Scott less than six minutes after the attacks began.
Dawn Singleton, Jade Young, Yixuan Cheng, Ashlee Good, security guard Faraz Tahir and Pikria Darchia were killed in the attack.
Counsel Assisting the Coroner Peggy Dwyer SC said police searches of his phone found ""Mr Cauchi was preoccupied with weapons, with violence and with mass killing"".
She said there was evidence of ""rudimentary planning"" and that in the years prior Cauchi had purchased ""Ka-Bar knives"", which were used on the day of the attack.
On February 12 last year, he made a note to check out malls and ""where to run"" and later searches found he was ""planning a strike or an attack"".
""The browsing history on Mr Cauchi's mobile phone beginning around late 2022 suggested a preoccupation with death and murder.
""There were bookmark pages on serial killers, searches containing mass stabbing incidents in Australia and searches in relation to serial killers.""
Mr Cauchi also searched for information on the 1999 Columbine High School massacre on the day of the attack, Dr Dwyer said.

Andrew Paul Marks, detective chief inspector of the NSW Police homicide squad, said he did not believe that Cauchi was targeting women in his attack.
""From the start of his attack, he moved very quickly, he appeared to target people who weren't ready, who didn't know what was happening,"" he told the court.
""I did not see anything that suggested he was going to attack women.""
Dr Dwyer emphasised there was ""no direct evidence indicating any motive in relation to what happened"", apart from insight into his ""inner turmoil and his dark thoughts leading up to the incident"".
""What these records unequivocally show is a man who was seriously unwell.""
In 2024 Cauchi was experiencing homelessness in Sydney, away from his parents in Queensland and ""completely detached from the mental health system"", she said.
""There was nothing to alert his parents to just how sick he had become,"" Dr Dwyer said.
The inquest was told Cauchi, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager, in 2021 visited a psychiatrist in Queensland to provide a medical condition report so he could get a gun license and visit a shooting range, telling them he was asymptomatic and in remission.
Dr Dwyer said despite getting support for his bid, Cauchi did not follow through with the licence application.
The five-week inquest, which began on Monday, will also review Cauchi's mental health treatment.

She said his parents had expressed concern about him possessing knives, including some of a similar style used by Cauchi during the Bondi attack.
""Mr Cauchi's father was worried about him having those knives, and the court will explore whether that was an opportunity missed for intervention by police, which may have resulted in Mr Cauchi being re-engaged with the mental health system at the time,"" Ms Dwyer said.
""It is important to learn from this catastrophic event, as I've already touched on, Mr Cauchi's mental health treatment in Queensland is a very important topic.""
Dr Dwyer said the expert psychiatric evidence was ""clear and unanimous that Mr Joel Cauchi was floridly psychotic"" on the day of the attack.
She acknowledged both mental health systems in NSW and Queensland were ""under strain"" and that it ""was neither possible or appropriate for this inquest to seek to identify how to reform the entirety of the mental health system"".
Cauchi's use of cannabis in the days preceding his death will also be examined.
It's anticipated that experts, including from overseas, will give their thoughts on Cauchi's mental health treatment over the course of his life.
The CCTV control room monitoring Bondi Junction Westfield was empty at the time Cauchi began his attack.
Two security staff were rostered on the day of the attacks in the underground room but a male employee, referred as CR2, left about 3pm to undertake training in a control room upstairs.
A female security officer, referred to as CR1, who was working a 12-hour shift that started at 6am left to go to the bathroom at 3:32pm, meaning there was no active CCTV monitoring in place.
""It just so happened after CR1 [left] Mr Cauchi attacked Ms Singleton, the very first victim,"" Dr Dwyer said.
Scentre Group subcontracts its security staff, but has policies and procedures on how to respond to active armed offenders.

There is no requirement for more than one security monitor at any one time in the centre, Dr Dwyer said.
By the time CR1 returned, Mr Cauchi had attacked eight people, three of whom were killed.
""Security staff were effectively behind the eight ball — that is, they were then playing catch up to understand what was unfolding,"" Dr Dwyer said.
By the time CR2 re-entered the room just before 3:37pm, 16 people had been stabbed.
Dr Dwyer said the evidence would show initial contact and exchange of information between the CCTV control room and emergency services occurred about 10 minutes after the attack and about four minutes after Cauchi was shot dead.
Members of the public had already placed multiple triple-0 calls.
Dean Jordan SC, representing Scentre, said there was an ongoing review of security measures to ""identify opportunities to improve emergency responses and procedures"".
""Scentre is also committed to facilitating and implanting any practical recommendations arriving from these proceedings.""
Adam Casselden SC, representing Glad Group, who employed security guards Faraz Tahir and Muhammad Taha, said their ""courage would never be forgotten"".
In her opening statement, Dr Dwyer acknowledged the "" truly unfathomable"" grief of the victims' families.
""The public nature of this grief is a burden for the families that we are trying to be mindful of at every stage of the inquest,"" she said.

General Practice","For those living in the small busy rural town of Yarraman, 180 kilometres north-west of Brisbane, medical help can be hard to come by if something goes wrong.
The town of about 1,200 people has been without a regular doctor since 2018 and the nearest GP in Blackbutt, a 30-minute drive away, has closed its books to new patients.
Yarraman farmer and yoga teacher Jane Hodgkinson said residents were travelling long distances to see a doctor in Kingaroy, Toowoomba or even Brisbane or opting out of general health check-ups because it was too difficult to access without public transport.

Ms Hodgkinson said many people also could not afford to take a day out of their schedule to travel out of town for a general check-up.
""If you can get to the surrounding towns, then they've often closed their books and not taking any new patients, so it's actually a bit of an issue because people put off their regular checks and making health a priority,"" she said.
""They end up with complex issues and that just compounds again.""
Jane Hodgkinson says it is a struggle to see a GP. (ABC Southern Queensland: Aisling Brennan)
Ms Hodgkinson said she travelled to Brisbane for her medical appointments in order to get consistent care but she was ""fortunate"" she could stay with family overnight, otherwise the trip would be costly.
Rural Doctors Association of Australia chief executive Peta Rutherford said Yarraman was not the only community facing this ""real challenge"" of accessing medical support.
""When you're having to travel hundreds of kilometres to access a GP service, a lot of people actually choose to not go and have the service,"" she said.
There are five contests in regional Australia that could influence the overall result of the federal election. Here's why they matter.
""What that means is we often see them present to hospitals with really serious illness but something that could have been prevented and should have been managed in community.""
Royal Flying Doctor Service Federation chief executive Emma Buchanan said more than 32,000 people across the country did not have access to a GP within a 60-minute drive.
More than 100,000 people do not have access to mental health resources.
""We know that people who live in very remote areas are likely to die 14 years earlier to their urban counterparts and that they're dying from causes that are largely preventable,"" she said.
The number of bulk billing GPs has dropped over the past five years, especially in rural areas. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)
As the federal election campaign enters its final week, Ms Hodgkinson said she was disappointed rural health had not been a major talking point and believed party proposals were a ""bandaid approach"".
""I actually think it needs a fair bit of leadership. I think it needs grassroots leadership but it also needs help to get there,"" she said.
""It's not going to happen without some investment in time as well as money.""

Both major parties have put forward policies to tackle GP shortages, with the Coalition promising 200 training places specifically aimed at regional, rural and remote health.
Labor has pledged to expand the GP workforce to 2,000 a year from 2028, as part of its $8.5 billion bulk-billing pledge.
This election season politicians have tried to sell you the world. The team at Gruen isn't about to buy it. They've taken a big swing at the election, showing you how the democracy sausage is made, all the sizzle and none of the meat.
Ms Rutherford said there had been a lot of interest in graduates looking to specialise in general practice medicine in rural communities.
""It's not all doom and gloom,"" she said.
""What we need to do is make sure the system is ready to support these young doctors coming through and that we provide job opportunities for them and we provide an appropriate level of incentive and support to facilitate them relocating into our rural communities where we need them most.""

Ms Rutherford said rural communities and all levels of governments needed to work together to retain doctors, whether that was councils providing housing opportunities, state government ensuring it supported recruitment and retention and the federal government providing supportive training pathways.
""It's something we may need to be a little bit innovative on,"" she said.
""If you want someone to move to your community and you want a medical service — that's a really important pillar to ensure you've got a vibrant and sustainable community — we need to look at how as a community do we attract these people and retain them in the longer term.""

In 2024, a University of Western Australia (UWA) and MATES in Construction study found those working in fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) and drive-in, drive-out (DIDO) roles were at a much higher risk of having suicidal thoughts than the rest of the population.
""We looked at loneliness compared to job insecurity, workload, financial troubles, marital problems, being a minority person,"" UWA lead researcher Joseph Carpini said.
""Even when we compared it, loneliness came up as number one factor.""
Dr Carpini said one in five workers who reported feelings of loneliness also had suicidal thoughts.
In comparison, for workers who did not classify as feeling lonely, one in 20 experienced suicidal ideation.
""This isn't feeling lonely at lunch and you know, 'Buck up mate,'"" Dr Carpini said.

Since then Mr Samuel has forged a path in the mental health space and hopes that by sharing his experiences, he can help others.

""A lot of people … [if] they're not feeling connected to the people that they love, they either avoid them or they try and spend time with other people that they might not actually connect with,"" he said.
Mr Samuel said workers often started to avoid their colleagues.

""But if it's not easy enough for an AFL player's wife to find, more work needs to be done to ensure that all mums, including those with disabilities or for whom English might be their second language, can access these rooms that keep women and mums participating in society and feeling safe while doing so.""
Most stadiums across Australia now have rooms that include baby changing facilities and privacy areas.
The MCG has four rooms located around the stadium on level one, which each contain private feeding cubicles with armchairs, change tables, nappy disposal units, a microwave, TV, power point, sink and toilet.
The parenting room in the MCC Members' Reserve is kept locked on event day and requires staff assistance.
Hester Brown, wife of former premiership player Ben Brown, breastfed their two kids at stadiums between 2018 and 2023 when her husband played for North Melbourne and Melbourne.
She used the parenting room at Docklands and said some clubs now had staff whose game day role was to help partners in this area, including at the Demons.

However, she said friends of hers had been in similar situations to Merrett.
""I've also asked for help and often — and it's not the MCG staff's problem — but they often don't know where it is, or it'll be on the other side of the members, a million miles away,"" Brown said.
""If they left their kid at home, or if it's a night game, you still have to pump if you're feeding that way.
""So often, that's just you standing in a cubicle or sitting on the loo by yourself with the machine whirring in the background having not a nice or relaxed experience.
While some caregivers told us they don't hesitate to breastfeed in shared spaces, others explained it isn't always straightforward.
""And all those things can add stress because it's [already] very hard and stressful being a parent and there's lots of emotion involved in breastfeeding, lots of pain. It can be very difficult.""
Depending on the person and age of the child, Brown said pumping could take anywhere between 10 minutes to half an hour.
As Merrett experienced, mums often don't have a lot of time to find a room to feed or pump, especially if they don't know where they're going and in a crowded stadium.
McKimm said there were extra things that needed to be considered during a breastfeeding period, including planning around feeding or pumping times, having all the right equipment, and making sure the painful experience of mastitis (inflammation caused by blocked milk) is avoided.
Brown said they were all reasons why it was important to remove as many barriers as possible for new mums going to the footy.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-28/health-insurance-private-hospital-expenses/105220958,A private hospital opens in Melbourne with no out-of-pocket costs,,"I've seen the future of an important part of Australia's healthcare system — it's called Adeney Private.
It's a new private hospital in the Melbourne suburb of Kew that's 51 per cent owned by 42 doctors and 49 per cent owned by health insurance company Medibank.
There are zero out-of-pocket expenses for anyone who goes there.
That is, if you're privately insured and you go to this hospital, it's like being in a public hospital — none of the procedures cost extra, the anaesthetic is free and so is any pathology, radiology and drugs from the pharmacy, and of course the stay itself is covered by the insurance.
This hospital is the start of a quiet revolution in Australian healthcare.
Most of the political attention on healthcare, especially during the election campaign, is on primary care — on GPs and bulk billing — which is fair enough since it's where most hardship occurs and where the system falls down most egregiously.
The average cost of going to the GP is now $40 above the Medicare subsidy per visit, and the national bulk-billing rate is down to a record low of 77 per cent.
The Labor government and the Coalition have promised $8.5 billion and $9 billion respectively to get that bulk-billing rate back up to 90 per cent by increasing incentive payments for the bulk billing of children and the disadvantaged.
All of which is fine and overdue, but the other way in which Medicare falls short is with more serious and expensive medical procedures than GP visits.
At Adeney Private there are no out-of-pocket expenses for patients, because the health insurer and the hospital itself cover the gaps. (Reuters file photo)
Anyone who has private health insurance and has shown up at a private hospital for, say, a knee replacement, expecting their expensive policy to cover it, will have had a rude shock when presented with a succession of bills — from the surgeon, the anaesthetist, radiology, pathology and the chemist.
I'm due to have a routine procedure next week and last week I got an email from the anaesthetist demanding $500 at least two days before he sticks the needle in, and that's on top of what he'll get from Medicare, of course, which is not disclosed.
Goodness knows what the surgeon will charge, but it certainly won't be bulk billed and nor will he disclose what he gets from Medicare on top of what I pay him.
Step up Professor Michael Grigg, retired vascular surgeon and former president of the Royal College of Surgeons.
He decided five years ago that something needed to be done about this, or the private health system would collapse, and bring the entire health system crashing down — and it's no good waiting for the government to increase Medicare payments sufficiently to cover costs.
Just like Oprah's iconic ""you get a car"" moment, Labor is throwing urgent care clinics to punters like confetti.
At that point, non-primary care subsidies, which represent the great majority of the 7,000 item numbers in Medicare, had been frozen for a decade while inflation increased clinicians' costs, and even if they were unfrozen they would never catch up.
So he approached Dr Andrew Wilson, chief medical officer at Medibank, with the idea of collaborating in an experimental hospital that would have no out-of-pocket expenses for patients, because the health insurer and the hospital itself would cover the gaps.
They agreed on a 51/49 ownership split so the doctors would have control and they put in $20 million between them for the fit-out and the equipment.
Centuria Healthcare Property Fund agreed to a three-year rebuild of an existing hospital for $100 million with a 20-year lease from the joint venture operating company (called Curanda Vita, which is Latin for ""take care of life""), and Louise O'Connor, the head of operations at Cabrini Hospital, and before that a long-time executive at Epworth, was hired to run it.

The key to making the business model work is that stays in Adeney Private Hospital are shorter than usual. O'Connor calls it ""right stay"" and says that most patients prefer to recuperate at home as long as they are supported.
She says supporting recuperation and rehabilitation at home is cheaper for the hospital and better for the patients.
That lower cost has allowed her to negotiate contracts with radiology company i-Med, Melbourne Pathology, Slades Pharmacy and individual deals with 154 doctors. That's on top of the 42 who are shareholders in the hospital in which they agree to provide their services at no extra cost to the patients because they are satisfied with what they get from Medicare plus the hospital.

She wouldn't tell me the details of the contracts but says everyone is contributing to the success of the model because they all have a stake in it working.
She has also struck a deal with another health fund, BUPA, so their members can go the hospital for free as well, and is working on getting all other health insurers signed up.
She told me: ""This is the hardest thing I've ever done, but we need a revolution in the healthcare sector otherwise it won't be sustainable. Gone are the days when we can allow medicine to get a bit more expensive every year.""
Could the Adeney Private model apply across the private hospital sector, including existing hospitals, not just new ones?
Professor Grigg said this experiment had to become profitable first: ""It normally takes five years for a new hospital to make a profit, but we're hoping for 12 to 18 months.""
Louise O'Connor said it was ""not unachievable"" for existing private hospitals like Cabrini and Epworth to provide zero out-of-pocket care, but they would have to completely pull apart their businesses to do it.
Andrew Wilson from Medibank told me the company had asked other hospitals if they would participate in a trial, but they weren't enthusiastic. ""It's not for everybody,"" he said.
However, he said Medibank is planning to roll out the Adeney Private model more widely with other part-owned hospitals.

I asked all of them what the government could do to make it work, and the answer was unanimous: money. Medicare bulk-billing payments for all 7,000 item numbers, not just GP visits, need to increase.
Unless that happens, and gap payments for procedures continue to increase and whack privately insured people who thought they were fully covered, then fewer and fewer people will bother taking out health insurance.
If that keeps going it will make the billions of dollars in government subsidies for private health insurance a waste of money and put increasing pressure on the public system.
The excellent new urgent care clinics and extra incentive payments for bulk billing will help take pressure off public hospital emergency departments, but the queues for elective surgery are also getting out of hand and need attention.
The Adeney Private model is how health insurance, and therefore the public health system as well, could be made sustainable.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-28/ketamine-nasal-spray-added-to-pbs-for-depression-treatment/105217432,Ketamine-based nasal spray 'just the beginning' for depression patients,"Topic:
Depression","When Samuel Hockey's doctor suggested he try using a form of ketamine to treat his depression, he was curious.
""I sort of thought, 'This is just a party drug that I've witnessed friends and people take whilst we've been out or whatever',"" he said.
""Never had I even considered taking it in a recreational sense, and then to think about taking it in a medical or treatment sense was intriguing.""
After dealing with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation for half of his life — and trying other treatments such as antidepressants, antipsychotics and psychology without success — he was willing to give it a shot.
He took part in clinical trials for a ketamine-based nasal spray, which involved receiving the treatment in regular sessions under the guidance of a psychiatrist.
Within a few weeks, he noticed his mood and mindset improving.
""My family also mentioned that I was able to take on daily tasks — really simple things like making my bed,"" he said.
A new nasal spray that uses a form of ketamine to treat difficult-to-treat depression will soon become more accessible to tens of thousands of Australians.
Spravato, which contains esketamine, will be added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) from May 1, becoming the first new type of depression medication to be funded by the federal government in 30 years, its manufacturer says.
But researchers say further work is needed to make the treatment more accessible.
How esketamine works in the brain.
Ketamine was initially developed as an anaesthetic and later found to be effective against treatment-resistant depression.
It works by increasing a chemical in the brain called glutamate, which then stimulates and restores the transmission of messages to different parts of the brain.
Spravato costs patients thousands of dollars over a course of treatment, but after being listed on the PBS will cost less than $32 per dose.
Generic ketamine, which some experts say is just as effective, was already cheap.
Depression affects about one in seven Australians and becomes classified as ""treatment resistant"" when a patient has cycled through multiple types of treatment without improvement.
Ian Hickie, the co-director of the Brain and Mind Centre at the University of Sydney, said esketamine changed the ""brain circuitry"" in a different way to other antidepressant drugs, making it possible to see fast improvements.
""So immediately you have the chemical squirted up your nose [and] your mental state changes as a consequence of that,"" said Professor Hickie, who was the principal investigator on the Spravato clinical trials in Australia and received research funding from its manufacturer, Janssen.
""There's a period where you're directly affected by it, so it needs to be done under medical supervision.
""Then some hours later, many people report that their mood lifts on that day — not as we typically see with antidepressants some weeks later.""
To get the full effect patients must undergo repeated treatments over multiple weeks, Professor Hickie said.

While Spravato being listed on the PBS means the drug itself is now much cheaper, most patients will still need to pay hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket for the cost of administering the treatment, which usually includes one to two hours in a clinic with medical supervision.
There are private specialised clinics around Australia that offer ketamine and esketamine treatment but options are limited for public patients.
""What I really hope will happen now is that public hospitals and clinics will make this available for those who cannot afford private clinics,"" Professor Hickie said.
Clinical psychiatrist Colleen Loo, who has been researching the use of ketamine for treatment-resistant depression for more than 10 years, said treatment needed to be more accessible for all patients.
""The introduction of ketamine as a new treatment for treatment-resistant depression is really transformative,"" she said.
""While I think [listing Spravato on the PBS] is a useful step, what I think we really need is for the government to subsidise the treatment cost … which is still a lot for people.""
In this video from 2023, Professor Colleen Loo talks about the research into ketamine.
Professor Loo also warned that long-term ketamine use could cause serious medical problems such as permanent bladder damage, and said it was important for clinicians to undergo training and conduct safety monitoring during treatments.
""As ketamine treatment … becomes more common, I think it's very important for people seeking this treatment to go to a good clinic with good standards,"" she said.
""From a regulatory point of view, there's nothing to stop you setting up a [ketamine] clinic regardless of what training you have or haven't done.""

Sam Hockey welcomed the federal government subsidising Spravato for patients like him, but said it might not make the treatment cheaper.
""While the PBS may cover the medication we still have to pay for the clinical room and the two clinicians,"" he said.
""I think [the PBS listing] is just the beginning to make it affordable and accessible for other young people and people experiencing treatment-resistant depression.""

Disabilities","Travelling along the footpath should be a relatively simple exercise, but for many people poorly maintained pathways pose a challenge, especially in regional centres.
Mount Gambier resident Kit Cooper said when she was able-bodied she was unaware of the issue but that changed when she was diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) last May.
The genetic condition causes her heart rate to increase abnormally and can lead to dizziness, light-headedness and fainting.

""It's easy to miss the things until it's affecting you,"" Ms Cooper said.
""As a part-time wheelchair user, I have become aware that a lot of the places that I used to frequent are … inaccessible without support from a carer or a partner.""
Sharon Morgan, a Port Lincoln resident who had a leg amputated in 2011, said she had been forced to use the road because of badly maintained footpaths and poorly designed ramps.

""A lot of people who can get around normally can't see there being a problem,"" she said.
Dozens of people told the ABC of recurring issues regarding inaccessible ramps, damaged paths and concrete slabs lifted by tree roots.
Disability advocate Cyanne Westerman said such problems could increase the isolation of those living with mobility issues.

Ms Westerman, who lives with limb girdle muscular dystrophy, struggles to find a usable footpath for her motorised wheelchair even when she is just outside her Whyalla home.
""I often go on the road where it's a lot smoother, but it's also dangerous because of the cars,"" she said.
Footpath maintenance is the responsibility of local government.
The City of Port Lincoln and Whyalla City Council both have disability access and inclusion plans that highlight footpath and ramp access as issues.
Whyalla Council's 2020-24 plan showed that almost 60 per cent of people living with a disability had difficulty accessing footpaths and ramps.

Port Lincoln mayor Diana Mislov said footpath upgrades were often tied to larger projects, which made them more likely to meet the criteria for grant funding.
""Whereas roads and footpaths and even stormwater [maintenance], to some degree, are just less attractive,"" she said.
Cr Mislov said there were not enough major projects to ensure the city's footpaths were adequately maintained.
Ms Westerman's twin sister Zia, a Whyalla councillor who shares her disability, says local governments are often tied up in ""red tape"" and have limited budgets.
""Local councils are doing their best,"" she said.
""I think it's time for someone else to step in and help them do more.""
She is one of many disability advocates calling on the state government to fund upgrades to footpaths.

Whyalla Mayor Phill Stone said the council spent about $600,000 a year on footpath maintenance.
""If governments could establish a particular fund to give us access to extra funding, that would be a move in the right direction,"" he said.
A spokesperson from the Department for Infrastructure and Transport said councils were responsible for footpath maintenance, but there were various state and Commonwealth infrastructure grants they could apply for.
Councils could also access financial assistance grants by the Local Government Grants Commission, the spokesperson said.

Their three new seats of Brisbane, Ryan and Griffith were all won in south-east Queensland or ""Greensland"" as it came to be labelled.
""A record number of people voted Greens for the first time this election,"" Greens Leader Adam Bandt proudly proclaimed following the result.

After breaking the Liberal Party's 21-year hold on the seat of Ryan in Brisbane's west, Elizabeth Watson-Brown said voters felt ""abandoned"" by the major parties, and this showed ""the tectonic plates are shifting in politics in Australia"".
Three years on, experts say she's in real danger of losing her seat, and ""Greensland"" could be wiped out altogether.

""It all depends on who runs third.""

Greens housing spokesperson Max Chandler-Mather holds Griffith by a margin of 10.5 per cent, making it a nominally ""safe seat"".
However, Dr Williams believed Mr Chandler-Mather could lose his seat after just one term, if the Liberal Party run third and directed all their preferences to Labor.
""The point is, if the LNP runs third in Griffith, Labor will be elected.""
He said it was the same story in the seat of Brisbane, held by the Greens' Stephen Bates by just 3.7 per cent.

Dr Williams said Brisbane was a ""genuine three-horse race"", where a dozen or so votes decided the outcome in 2022, and could do so again.
Ms Watson-Brown's seat of Ryan, held by 2.6 per cent, is firmly in the sights of the Liberal Party.
""I think the LNP is well-placed to take that seat back,"" Dr Williams said.
The Liberals are confident they can win Ryan back from Elizabeth Watson-Brown. (AAP: Jono Searle)
But the Greens aren't just hoping to hold onto their four lower house seats, they're hoping to expand.
The party says it's targeting the seats of Wills and MacNamara in Melbourne, Richmond in northern NSW, Sturt in Adelaide, and the seat of Perth.
While Dr Williams believed the Greens had an outside chance in Labor-held Wills and McNamara, preferences would likely keep them out.
Post-2022 some political analysts predicted the Greens were headed for a ""surge"" in popularity.
However, if polls are to be believed, their primary vote is only marginally up from where it was three years ago at about 13 per cent.

Through Mr Chandler-Mather — who described himself as ""one of the few renters in parliament"" — said the Greens had been pitching themselves as the party of renters and those locked out of the housing market.
""We need the Greens in parliament to keep Dutton out and push Labor to phase out negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount … cap rents, and invest the savings in building housing that renters and first homebuyers can actually afford,"" Mr Chandler-Mather said last week.
Party leader Mr Bandt has said these reforms will be key negotiating points if Labor requires their support to form minority government.
But Dr Williams said Anthony Albanese will look to strike a deal with the teals before the Greens.
Like their name suggests, an independent MP is separate from any party, with their own individual policies and views. Here's a guide to who's who.
This is in part because of Labor's painful experience negotiating with the Greens over the Help to Buy and Build to Rent housing bills last year, and in part to avoid being forced to talk about negative gearing.
""He's not going to go down that path,"" Dr Williams said.
""He can't win another election if he has to abolish negative gearing.""
John Black, an election analyst and former Labor senator who studies voter demographics, said the Greens' stance on renting was no accident.
""According to the latest census, around 30 per cent of the population rents,"" he said.
""In the seat of Melbourne, which they hold, it's 62.3 per cent — the highest in the country.
""In Brisbane it's 49.6 per cent, and in Griffith, 45.4 per cent.
Mr Black said the Greens had sought to broaden their voter base by focusing more heavily on social and cultural issues, as well as the war in Gaza.

However, he said the party's support of pro-Palestinian rallies and Mr Chandler-Mathers' address to a CFMEU rally last year had turned off some inner-city voters.
""They've done something wrong here,"" Mr Black said.
""They managed to offend a lot of their traditional base — in particular educated people, a lot of professional women, people on high incomes who care about the environment.
""There's not a lot of support in that cohort for the CFMEU or the very bolshie way in which they attacked Labor over their position on Gaza.""

He said this was laid bare during the recent Queensland state election, where the Greens maintained their vote share, but lost the seat of South Brisbane and suffered a swing away from them in their only other seat.
Mr Chandler-Mather defended his speech at the rally, and said ""it was about principles"".
Opponents of the Greens believe there is political hay to be made from reminding voters about their expanded political agenda.

However Dr Susan Grantham, a strategic communications specialist who studies how political parties used social media, said the Greens know Gen Z and millennials make up the biggest cohort at this election — and that's where their votes were.
""Because that is the group of people that are using these platforms, there is a lot of Greens content on TikTok,"" she said.
""It's this wonderful war, almost, on TikTok, between the different parties and the different ideologies and the different policies and the different promises.""

""He's walking around with this giant toothbrush to really promote his dental in Medicare policy.""
Speaking on ABC News Breakfast earlier this month, Adam Bandt described getting dental into Medicare as a 'priority issue'. (ABC News Breakfast)
In a bid to compete, the Liberal Party of Australia recently edited a video from Greens-aligned influencer Holly McAlpine making it sound like she was criticising Greens policy, rather than supporting it.
While it didn't break TikTok's rules, the party took it down after Ms McAlpine threatened legal action.
Because this is a new space, studies don't yet exist proving the link between success on TikTok and success at the ballot box.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-27/vaccine-nation-public-health-gains-warning-covid-pandemic/105103190,COVID jabs were a resounding success but vaccines now face a growing threat,"Topic:
Vaccines and Immunity","Professor Raina MacIntyre was waiting quietly in the emergency department of a busy hospital last year when she overheard a conversation she'll never forget.
The patient in the cubicle next to hers had been scratched and bitten by his cat but was flatly refusing the tetanus booster his doctor was recommending. Couldn't he just have some antibiotics and be on his way? The doctor told him that wasn't necessary and asked why he didn't want a tetanus shot. ""I know 30 people who dropped dead. I don't want it. I'm not having it,"" he said. ""Thirty people I know died after getting COVID vaccines.""
Instead of correcting him — instead of explaining that there had been 14 deaths from COVID vaccines in Australia, all before 2022, and 13 of them after the AstraZeneca shot which had since been withdrawn — the doctor gave the man the antibiotics he was demanding, likely only reaffirming his beliefs.
""Privately, many doctors and health leaders bemoan falling vaccination rates and stay silent while anti-vaxxers claim the stage, free to make whatever outlandish … claims they wish,"" MacIntyre writes in her new book, Vaccine Nation: Science, reason and the threat to 200 years of progress. ""At the same time, many fail to provide the role modelling needed for change, stricken by the same fear as politicians"" who avoid speaking about COVID because it is ""triggering"" for so many people.
Three local councils in South Australia have been passing motions questioning vaccines, but health experts say they are based on misinformation and heighten community risk.
That emergency department exchange epitomises the public health challenge the world is now facing, and which MacIntyre, who researches infectious diseases, bioterrorism and vaccines as head of the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute, examines in Vaccine Nation. In it, she steps through the history of vaccines and the transformative public health benefits they've delivered, the rigorous safety and efficacy trials they undergo, the dangerous ways they've failed on rare occasions, and how mRNA technology is leading to breakthroughs not just in the fight against infectious diseases but potentially cancer, too.
But Vaccine Nation is also a warning about the acceleration of the anti-vaccination movement during the pandemic and worrying declines in vaccination rates around the world, which MacIntyre links to a broader backlash against science and medicine, including from within the medical profession itself. It is a precarious situation given the looming threat of a bird flu pandemic — one experts fear could be deadlier than SARS-CoV-2 — though it's already a live and urgent issue, particularly in the US, where a measles outbreak in Texas has infected at least 646 people (most of them unvaccinated) and killed two children.
A catalyst for this backlash, MacIntyre says, were COVID lockdowns, which in Australia were enforced before vaccines were available to prevent the crises unfolding overseas — collapsing health systems, refrigerator trucks full of bodies, mass graves. But lockdowns have become conflated with any kind of public health measure — including face masks and vaccines — as ""state-sponsored tools for control"" and an attack on personal freedoms. As a result, MacIntyre writes, public health messaging has become ""timid and apologetic"", myths and misinformation have flourished unchecked, and ""we now risk losing the gains of the last two centuries in a post-truth era embraced by the community and medical experts alike"".
Together with improved sanitation, better nutrition, and antibiotics, vaccines have led to significant public health advances that are easily taken for granted. A study published in the Lancet last year estimated that the WHO's Expanded Program on Immunisation prevented 154 million deaths in the 50 years after its launch in 1974, including 146 million children younger than five and 100 million infants. Vaccinating against measles had the biggest impact, the researchers found, saving some 94 million lives — 60 per cent of the total lives saved.
Until then, infectious diseases were a leading cause of death, particularly among children. The smallpox vaccine against the variola virus led to the disease's eradication by 1980. But it had previously been one of the world's deadliest illnesses, with some scientists estimating it killed at least half a billion people just in the last 100 years it was circulating. Before effective vaccines were developed in the 1950s, polio paralysed or killed half a million people every year. And until the first measles shot was rolled out in 1963, major epidemics erupted every couple of years, causing an estimated 2.6 million annual deaths.

But these gains are now under threat. Australia's childhood immunisation rates remain relatively high by global standards but fell in 2023 for the third consecutive year, the latest annual immunisation coverage report shows — a concerning trend given rates had generally been increasing prior to the pandemic. COVID and flu vaccination rates have also stuttered, with the latest data showing just 24 per cent of Australians aged 65-74 received a COVID vaccine in the past 12 months and a dramatic decline in the number of people getting the influenza shot last year compared with 2022.
More research is needed to understand exactly what's driving these shifts: it's not all about COVID, nor is it all about vaccine hesitancy or anti-vax sentiment — sometimes it's a simple matter of people not being able to access the vaccines they need. But experts have blamed a misguided fear of COVID vaccines, pandemic-driven vaccine fatigue, a lack of trust in health authorities, and a belief that COVID and influenza aren't serious infections — maybe not so surprising given, as MacIntyre puts it, the public has been ""aggressively force-fed messages"" that COVID is over, a ""nothingburger"".
MacIntyre also points the finger at doctors, including experts on vaccine advisory committees, some of whom she says have downplayed COVID's seriousness and fuelled vaccine misinformation. She is scathing, for instance, of Australia's COVID vaccination policy which, unlike the US, does not recommend vaccinating children unless they are at risk of severe disease, despite large studies finding COVID jabs are safe and effective in children.
""It's a serious infection; it causes serious complications in a small proportion of kids and on a population level that's important,"" MacIntyre tells ABC News. ""It also causes long COVID — and what are we doing to our children, letting them just get repeatedly infected probably several times a year, every year?""
In a chapter called ""I don't want mRNA in my body!"" — a tongue-in-cheek nod to the fact that mRNA is found naturally in every cell of our bodies — she examines debunked myths and conspiracy theories: that mRNA vaccines contain microchips (they do not), that they're contaminated with DNA which can alter human DNA (""not supported by any scientific data"") and a monkey virus called SV40 (ditto — plus it's just not plausible, she says).
Crucially, COVID vaccines saved an estimated 14.4 million lives globally just in the first year after they were rolled out. And the threat of a H5 bird flu pandemic is a key reason we should be thankful for mRNA technology, MacIntyre writes, because it can be used to develop vaccines at ""phenomenal speed"".

Still, while the safety of COVID vaccines is well-established, they're not completely risk free — no vaccine or drug is. A study of more than 99 million vaccinated people from eight countries last year confirmed the findings of previous research that the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA shots increased the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in rare cases, mostly in young males, but that the risk was much higher with COVID infection. In Australia, as of November 2024, myocarditis was reported in around 10-20 people per 1 million doses of Pfizer vaccines and around 20 people per 1 million doses of Moderna, according to the TGA. It may be of little comfort to people who say they've developed other debilitating conditions whose links to COVID vaccines haven't been studied rigorously — nor recognised by compensation schemes or many doctors — but ultimately the researchers stressed the benefits of vaccination still vastly outweigh the risks.
That's not to say vaccine programs always go smoothly. In a chapter on vaccine safety MacIntyre explains the strict development process new vaccines undergo and the sophisticated monitoring systems large countries use to track adverse events — this surveillance is used to pick up rare side effects that aren't identified in clinical trials.
But rollouts have occasionally revealed serious failures. One of the most infamous examples is the Cutter incident of 1955, where 40,000 children in the US contracted polio after receiving the Salk polio vaccine, which had not been properly inactivated by the manufacturer, Cutter Laboratories. It was withdrawn the same month it was launched and the episode triggered an overhaul of federal vaccine safety systems. But dozens were paralysed and five died, MacIntyre writes — ""a huge blow to vaccination programs and public confidence in vaccines"".
Seventy years later, despite the resounding success of COVID vaccines, we're now grappling with a confidence crisis on a bigger scale, driven by a tangle of factors: the explosion of misinformation online (especially on social media) and the difficulty even medical professionals face sifting fact from fiction; the elevation of vaccine sceptics such as Robert F Kennedy Jr to positions of influence and authority; and what MacIntyre describes as the proliferation of ""junk journals"" which provide a platform for ""anti-vaccination activists"" and ""pseudoscientific disinformation"". A lack of messaging from governments about COVID's ongoing health risks — particularly long COVID — and their silence on anti-vax rhetoric, MacIntryre writes, makes the situation even more fraught.
Perhaps one of the most insidious examples of the challenge science now faces is the backlash MacIntyre has copped personally. Earlier in the pandemic, whenever she'd do media interviews, angry, abusive emails from complete strangers would come pouring into her inbox. They blamed her for lockdowns and, in one bizarre example, accused her of promoting masks and vaccines and causing mass deaths as a result. ""F--- you, Raina. You are just so f---ing useless, like 95 per cent of females with 'careers',"" one emailer spat.
MacIntyre argues that ""risk perception"" ultimately drives human behaviour and tolerance for public health measures, vaccines included. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)
""I'm not sensitive at all because I know what I'm doing,"" MacIntyre insists. ""I know what I say is based on evidence, on science … and I'm just not bothered by what anyone thinks or says about me. I also don't want negativity in my life … so if doing interviews is going to bring negativity, I don't need it, I don't want the attention."" These days, she says, she'll do an interview if it's about a subject she thinks no one else understands the way she does: ""If there's something I can contribute, I would like to. But there's also the question of, when people are over it, what's the point in being a talking head out there?""
Still, things can be turned around, she says — especially in Australia, where as far as public health goes, ""we're in a much stronger position than the US or UK"". ""I think some public messaging to consolidate the gains we already have is important, so we don't lose it in the sea of misinformation that will be coming in the near future,"" MacIntyre says. ""I think the politicisation of public health"" — reflected in political leaders' reluctance to mention COVID, for instance — is something we need to tackle.""
Australia is in the middle of a surge in measles cases amid a global spike and declining childhood vaccination rates. So what precautions should be taken to avoid widespread transmission?
She also supports improving the accessibility of vaccines, and reforming Australia's Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) so that the evidence and deliberations behind its recommendations are published — perhaps in the style of the US Advisory Committee on Immunisation (ACIP), whose meetings, documents and rationale are all public. ""I think that kind of transparency and open public decision-making would help the vaccine situation in Australia,"" MacIntyre says, ""and help us protect our strong starting position"".
Other experts have suggested public confidence in vaccines could be bolstered by improving the governance and accessibility of vaccine injury compensation programs (many people who say they were injured by COVID shots have criticised Australia's now-closed compensation scheme for using an overly-narrow list of eligible medical conditions, claiming the burden of proof was too high and application wait times too long). And in the US, Gregory Poland, the editor of the journal Vaccine, recently argued that the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) must be ""strengthened"" and that large, ongoing studies are needed to help researchers work out who is at increased risk of vaccine injuries and how to reduce that risk.
Perversely, though, it may take people dying from resurgent, vaccine-preventable diseases like measles — or the onset of a bird flu pandemic — to really shift the dial. As MacIntyre writes, ""risk perception"" ultimately drives human behaviour and tolerance for public health measures, vaccines included. ""When people see friends, family and neighbours dying or becoming seriously ill with pandemic influenza,"" she writes, ""most will avail themselves of any available protective measures"".",Hayley Gleeson,Sun 27 Apr

Smoking","Michael Stevens has gone a long time without a cigarette.
The Spinifex man has worked as a health practitioner in the remote community of Tjuntjuntjara, 1,300 kilometres east of Perth, for a decade.
Among the countless challenges he faces — from resourcing, to chronic illnesses, to his vehicles' broken windows — is the region's incredible rate of smoking.
""I used to smoke. Not anymore,"" he says.
Tjuntjuntjara is one of Australia's most remote communities. (ABC News: Sharon Gordon)
Across Australia, about 8.8 per cent of adults smoke every day.
In remote First Nations communities, the figure shoots to 46 per cent.
But in Tjuntjuntjara, community leaders fear smoking rates are far higher.
""There'd be over 70 per cent of people who smoke in Tjuntjuntjara,"" community chief executive Jon Lark estimates.
He says the community urgently needs support to lower smoking rates, improve health outcomes and reduce reliance on some of the most expensive cigarettes in the country.
About 70 per cent of adults are daily smokers in Tjuntjuntjara, locals believe.  (ABC Goldfields: Katrina Tap)
Smoking causes 37 per cent of all First Nations deaths across Australia, and half of deaths in people aged 45 years and over, according to federal government data.
But Mr Lark says figures from Tjuntjuntjarra's community store highlight another problem.
When the ABC visited Tjuntjuntjara's one shop early this month, a 30 gram pouch of tobacco cost $114 and a packet of 20 cigarettes cost $56.
The prices were more than 45 per cent higher than a major supermarket, where similar products were $79 and $38 respectively.
Lawrence Minning says cigarettes are too expensive in Tjuntjuntjara. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)
Standing outside the store, local Lawrence Minning says prices were a concern in the community.
""It's too dear for smoke,"" he says.
""Smokes cost a hundred and something [dollars]. How come?""
Mr Lark puts it down to enormous freight costs on top of federal government taxes.
Spinifex woman Donna Marie Brown says the costs give rise to social issues, with younger residents ""humbugging"" elders for money to buy tobacco or people going without proper food, to instead buy smoking products.
Donna Marie Brown says smoking causes social issues in Tjuntjuntjara. (ABC Goldfields: Katrina Tap)
""They just buy a pie or cool drink,"" she says.
""That's not going to last them a few weeks.""
Ms Brown says a lot of people want to quit.
Stephen Farrington, a remote area nurse practitioner with the Spinifex Health Service in Tjuntjuntjara, says nicotine patches and gum are available at the clinic, but they are often ineffective.
""It's so social that someone will come and offer them a cigarette and they go, 'Oh, it's only one,'"" he says.
""And then they're back onto it again. So it's hard to give up.
""But yeah, the cost is just phenomenal, considering incomes.
Stephen Farrington says the community has almost zero mental health support. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)
The federal government funds the national Tackling Indigenous Smoking program, which provides a ""locally tailored and First Nations-led mix of activities to reduce smoking and vaping prevalence among First Nations people"".
The program's website says although remote First Nations communities have seen little change in daily smoking rates, there has been an uptick in attempts to quit and fewer young people are taking up the habit.
The Kalgoorlie-based Bega Garnbirringu Health Service received $1.7 million to deliver the program in WA's Goldfields.
A federal government spokesperson says the program was delivered in Tjuntjuntjara at some point early last year, but provided no further details.
But Jon Lark does not believe any of the program's elements were delivered in the community.
Bega Garnbirringu did not respond to requests for comment.
It's estimated people spend as much as a third of their incomes on tobacco. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)
Mr Farrington says the community's lack of mental health support adds to the problem.
""We've got no visiting psychiatrist to make [a] diagnosis,"" he says.
""We've got no visiting mental health nurses to support us with our day-to-day maintenance of these people.
A WA Department of Health spokesperson says WA Quitline has dedicated Aboriginal counsellors who provide culturally safe, non-judgemental support.
Federal Labor's last budget committed $141.2 million to expand the Tackling Indigenous Smoking Program, $29.5 million to expand programs designed to help people quit and $63.4 million for smoking and vaping public health campaigns over the forward estimates period.
The Coalition says if elected, it would be committed to promoting the health of Indigenous Australians, especially those in remote communities.
Tjuntjuntjara is in the Great Victoria Desert. (ABC Goldfields: Katrina Tap)
""That is why we are investing in outcomes-based health services for marginalised Indigenous Australians,"" a spokesperson says.
They said they would commit $500 million for mental health support and double the mental health sessions from 10 to 20 per year.
The federal government's tobacco excise, which results in higher cigarette prices, helps pay for health services and treatments for tobacco-related illnesses.
But this year, the tobacco tax take will be almost $7 billion less than expected, due to the booming trade in illegal, black market cigarettes.
A sign in the Tjuntjuntjara store warns tobacco prices will rise further. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)
Asked whether this meant less money was available for quit programs, the ABC was told funding earmarked to reduce smoking was not dependent on a specific amount of tobacco excise being collected.
Stakeholders say the tax is widely recognised as one of the most effective ways to reduce smoking prevalence.
Mr Stevens has not had a cigarette in a long time. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)
Mr Stevens says it certainly deterred him.
""I used to smoke, but I don't smoke no more,"" he says.
""[There were] too much people asking [for smokes].
Mr Lark points out smoking rates have fallen dramatically across wider Australia in recent decades, indicating its public health campaigns are working.
He just wishes more of them were available in his remote community.

Her 10-year-old stepdaughter was seeing youth mental health organisation headspace locally, before being categorised as too complex for the service.

""[She] has been through body shaming and suicidal thoughts,"" Ms Bottrell said.
""Once you add autism on top of that, there's really no services available.""
Meanwhile Ms Bottrell said it took her two years to get her now 11-year-old son into a child psychologist, only to have the specialist relocate to Port Macquarie, more than 150 kilometres away.
Her son's ongoing treatment is now done via telehealth.
Ms Bottrell said accessing mental health care had been a drawn-out battle, and was an issue should would like to see addressed by both sides of politics.
In the hotly contested NSW regional electorate of Cowper, access to youth mental healthcare services has become a key topic.
Access to health care and mental health were two of the top three issues for the electorate of Cowper, along with housing affordability and homelessness, in a pre-election survey conducted by the Salvation Army.
According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, about one in seven young people experienced a mental health disorder in the past 12 months.
The clinical lead at headspace Coffs Harbour, Emily Fraser, said young people in Cowper and regional areas struggled to access affordable care due to a lack of specialists.
Emily Fraser says there are gaps in access to mental health care. (ABC Coffs Coast: Claire Simmonds)
""One of the gaps we're seeing a lot is for ADHD and autism assessments, which require a specialist report from a psychiatrist or paediatrician,"" Ms Fraser said.
""There's also limited access to GPs that prescribe medication for ADHD. There's a couple that do, but outside of them, its like [finding] hen's teeth.""
While headspace helps a large proportion with its free early intervention model of care for 12–25 year olds, there are young people who fall outside what they offer.
Coffs Harbour-based clinical psychologist Basia Radlinska says local children under 12 can wait up to two years to get mental health support.

People with complex and ongoing mental health needs say the health system is letting them down.

Dr Radlinska said expansions to headspace were crucial to helping meet the needs of young people.
""[Headspace] doesn't serve youth who might have more complex mental health difficulties or who have been engaged with the system already,"" she said.
Labor candidate for Cowper Greg Vigors says his party has promised similar measures in its billion-dollar mental health care election commitment, including opening new Medicare mental health centres across the country.

But as the pile builds up, alongside freshly plucked cherry tomatoes, it doesn't have far to be transported before it can be turned into a delicious dish thanks to the recent opening of a brand new commercial kitchen, just a few metres away.
The kitchen is the latest addition to the Bridgewater-based base of social enterprise charity Material Institute.
With the site already home to a science beauty lab and market garden, the kitchen has been designed to give students hands-on experience preparing and cooking healthy meals with all the necessary equipment.
Roughly 30 students a week will make use of the kitchen, a number Material Institute is hopeful will continue to grow. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)
""This is the fruition of a long-term plan,"" Amelia Clifford, the relationships manager at Material Institute, said.
Currently, the charity runs food education program 24 Carrot Gardens in 24 Tasmanian schools, mostly in the state's south.
While largely run within the schools, the program also includes students coming to the Bridgewater site for workshops — but until now, all the cooking has had to occur outside, limiting the options.
With this purpose-built kitchen, new opportunities for the students would open up, Ms Clifford said.
Students going through the market garden have been sharing what they've learned — with the 'cuteamelons' a crowd favourite. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)
""An immersive approach in a professional kitchen will be more impactful through first-hand participant experience of the seed-to-plate journey, harvesting food from the gardens only metres away,"" she said.
It will be used by roughly 30 students a week for the workshops, and the team hopes the infrastructure will also encourage more schools to get involved.
The kitchen will also be used for food preparation and catering for local community events.

The construction of the kitchen was aided by a grant from the Tasmanian Community Fund, which said it was exactly the kind of project it seeks to support.

Students will be shown how to harvest vegetables from the on-site market garden, and turn them into tasty dishes to share. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)
Mr de Santi said setting up healthy habits early and teaching students about where their food came from was vital for setting up ""healthy habits into the future"".
""This project brings young people, children, family and the community together around growing, preparing and sharing healthy and nutritious, affordable food.""
While initially the kitchen will be put to use for school workshops and existing public event offerings, Ms Clifford said its purpose would not end there.
She said there were also opportunities to engage older high school students who were looking for pathways beyond the classroom, with formal hospitality training and apprenticeships.
Ms Clifford said having a space where young people could get a glimpse at what a career in the sector could look like, and to learn under industry professionals, was ""essential"".

When Kirsha Kaechele randomly surveyed a group of teenagers about their interests, she was surprised to hear ""beauty"" topped their lists. It inspired her to build a lab that teaches science through beauty products.
Charity founder Kirsha Kaechele — who is also an artist and curator at Tasmania's Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) and wife of owner David Walsh — said she wanted the kitchen to be a place that students could be proud to access.
She said ensuring it was aesthetically beautiful and that the students felt they were actively contributing to the program was a key part of that.
""I want them to be inspired. I want them to feel proud, I want them to walk in and say 'wow' and then take charge — just take over and run the place,"" Ms Kaechele said.
Down the line, a future goal is also to open up the space more broadly to the public as a social enterprise cafe.

Nine people have died from the virus since 2021, including two in Queensland this year.
A vaccine exists for humans, but two separate pig vaccines are yet to clear federal approval processes.
It comes as primary producers do everything they can to combat the mosquito-borne virus that causes significant reproductive issues in sows and has cost the pork industry millions of dollars.
The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) said it was assessing two emergency use permit applications, which would allow scientists to trial their vaccines in piggeries.
The competing vaccines have been developed primarily by the University of Queensland and veterinary company Apiam Animal Health.

Apiam Animal Health chief executive Chris Richards said the APVMA had told him assessment for his emergency use permit could take 13 months.
""The government is not serious at all about trying to reduce this disease in the pig industry and nor are they obviously concerned about the deaths of people that is occurring in our community as a result of this virus,"" he said.
Mr Richards said the company had the capacity to vaccinate 50,000 sows within two weeks of emergency approval.
""If we got an emergency use permit today, we'd be able to vaccinate most of those sows that are in the affected areas in the next two weeks,"" he said.
""I think that there's just a lack of understanding of the significant impact that this disease is having in rural Australia.""
Farmers have been told their best defence is mosquito controls as JEV spread in Queensland.
The most recent detection was at the Betta Pork facility in Biloela.
Director Laurie Brosnan said he was following industry best practice to keep his piggery safe, but it was not enough without an effective vaccine.
He said Betta Pork had an independent contractor who sprayed open waterways, puddles, and other areas ""at a considerable cost"".
""We also treat the animals to protect them against JEV,"" he said.
""It's just unfortunate that there's only so much you can do.""
Laurie Brosnan says he is frustrated with the wait for a vaccine. (Supplied: Laurie Brosnan)
He said he felt his industry had been forgotten.
""I understand we're in election time, and politicians make promises as they do.
""I still feel that the government isn't prioritising or even giving the pig industry a fair go.""
Australian Pork chief executive Margo Andrea said JEV was a top concern for the industry.
""The previous outbreak in 2022 cost the industry millions of dollars and significantly impacted operations for piggeries across four states,"" she said.
""Three years later, JEV continues to contribute to losses for producers and their communities.
""We will continue pushing for a vaccine that will help keep our herds safe and healthy and help safeguard our producers' livelihoods.""
University of Queensland Associate Professor Jody Peters, who oversaw the development of one of the vaccines, said there was enough data to show that it was safe and effective.

Dr Peters said her team started working on it as soon as they were notified of the first JEV outbreak in Australia in early 2022.
""The initial trials occurred at the end of 2022, and some additional trials occurred in 2023,"" she said.
""I think we have got sufficient data to prove that it is effective, and it is safe.
""But, ultimately, it is up to the regulatory bodies to determine whether we have produced enough data to date.""
Dr Peters said the need for a commercially available vaccine was growing.
""With all of the flooding that's occurred recently, the mosquito that is likely the culprit for transmitting the virus would have bred up huge populations,"" she said.
""I am incredibly frustrated, as are pig farmers, with how long it is taking to get these approvals across the line.
""But I do believe that we will have a vaccine on the market in the future.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-25/david-speirs-drug-supply-conviction-analysis-/105213210,David Speirs has gone from alternative SA premier to convicted drug supplier,,"Less than nine months ago, David Speirs held one of South Australia's most prominent and important jobs: the state's alternative premier and leader of the Liberal Party.
Now, those titles have been replaced by ""convicted drug supplier"".
In a busy Adelaide Magistrates Court as Speirs was sentenced on Thursday, he was painted as a volunteer who cared for the natural world around him and served his community as a councillor and deputy mayor before his election to parliament.
Magistrate Brian Nitschke highlighted a ""distinguished parliamentary career"" in the decade after his election in 2014, serving as environment and water minister in the former Marshall government before becoming leader of the opposition in 2022.

But amid the stress and fatigue of this top political role, he turned to cocaine in June 2024 as a form of ""escapism"".
It was only months later in September when a video was published by News Corp of Speirs snorting from a plate.
These drug charges are unrelated to the video but instead relate to two separate instances, between August 1 and August 10 last year, where Speirs admitted to supplying a controlled drug.
It was on August 8 that Speirs faced the media to quit as Liberal leader, telling reporters he'd ""had a gutful"" and didn't have the energy to continue. The announcement followed years of persistent speculation over his future.
David Speirs resigned from parliament after the charges were laid. (ABC News: Carl Saville)
During sentencing, the court heard it was the stress and chronic exhaustion of the role that first led Speirs to be curious to try cocaine when it was offered to him by a friend.
""You believe [when taking cocaine] you experienced a significant change from your chronic state of tiredness, fatigue and frustration that you'd become accustomed to since you became leader of the opposition,"" Magistrate Nitschke said.
In sentencing, Magistrate Nitschke recognised that Speirs had ""effectively lost the parliamentary and political career which [he] sought to build up"".
David Speirs represented the southern suburbs seat of Black before his resignation. (ABC News: Carl Saville)
""I accept that in many walks of life, such devastating consequences may not always be the consequences of such offending,"" he said.
But Magistrate Nitschke also said that Speirs would have had an appreciation of the ""criminality and public mischief"" of his offending because of his job.
At this time last year, David Speirs was adamant his position as SA Liberal leader was ""100 per cent secure"" and that he would not be challenged — but a great deal has changed in 12 months.
He agreed media scrutiny on Speirs had been intense, but it was unsurprising given his prominent position and community expectations of his role.
But he said that it didn't amount to extra-curial punishment, or something that punishes an offender beyond what a court imposes.
For the two counts of supply a controlled drug, which he previously pleaded guilty to, Speirs was fined $9,000 and given 37.5 hours of community service.
His lawyer had argued for a conviction not to be recorded against him, to spare the Scottish national from problems travelling.
But Magistrate Nitschke said the offending was too serious and there was a need for denunciation and deterrence, so Speirs now has two convictions recorded against him.
Speirs's sentence is an unwanted headline for a Liberal Party that has endured a brutal three years in South Australia — from the toppling of a one-term state government to a pair of historic by-election losses and a lacklustre federal performance.
Having it come just over a week before voters head to the polls for a federal election is far from ideal for federal Liberals in SA hoping to stay on message.

And a state election is just around the corner too, with Opposition Leader Vincent Tarzia's team already facing a mammoth battle to topple a Labor government led by a popular premier in Peter Malinauskas.
While that isn't a challenge Speirs will have to tackle, he will have to pay a price of $9,000 and 37.5 hours of his time for his actions.
And both he and his former colleagues will likely spend plenty of time reflecting on the remarkable fall from grace of someone who went from ""alternative premier"" to ""convicted criminal"" in a matter of months.",Unknown,Fri 25 Apr

Safety","Running a marathon is not just about clocking up kilometres — it is a juggling act of nutrition, injury prevention, and carving out time that does not always exist.
And for a blossoming cohort of female athletes, the end of daylight saving often signals a significant disruption to their ability to pound the pavement.
Concerns over safety are high.
Beyond behavioural change, what actually makes public exercise spaces safer for women? (RN: Life Matters)
The 2024 Strava Year In Sport report, which analysed sporting data from more than 135 million users, recorded a 59 per cent increase in running club participation last year.
The report also found more women are taking part in running, with a 5 per cent lift in the number of women running a marathon and a 16 per cent rise in half marathons.
At the same time, women have been found to often feel unsafe in public spaces, according to research from Deakin University.
And as the nation continues to grapple with the disappearance of Ballarat runner and mother Samantha Murphy, conversations around female safety in public spaces have been renewed.
Jane Cantwell lives in the inner-Melbourne suburb of Alphington and has been training for her first half marathon, a 21.1-kilometre run.
Training involves runs along the Darebin Creek and Yarra trails squeezed in around her work and daylight hours.
Jane Cantwell says daylight saving changes the way she trains after dark. (Supplied: Jane Cantwell)
But juggling training with work often means the only time she can train is after hours, facing the track alone.
""When the days get too short I won't be able to run before work anymore,"" she said.
How perceptions of safety influence how these women choose to run.
Ms Cantwell's running journey started just two years ago, and she recently completed a half marathon at Canberra.
She said on one hand the chance of something untoward happening feels ""low"".
""But the potential risk is so high,"" she conceded.
Danielle Bryan is the founder of Run Like a Girl, a ""ladies only"" running group that helps women with running programs, run groups, along with training and recovery tips.

She said the end of daylight saving often marked an uptick in the number of women signing up for training programs and memberships.
""Run Like A Girl's busiest time of year is now, and through the winter our numbers go up,"" Ms Bryan said.
""Putting a group together as opposed to running on your own in broad daylight in the summer … the group scenario reduces the risk of exposure.

The appetite for female running events is growing.

Lake Wendouree in Ballarat has been illuminated with more than 220 lights funded in part by a state government investment, a move that Ballarat Marathon spokesperson Adam McNicol said spoke to the growing interest in community running, particularly for women.
This weekend, Ballarat will host its second Ballarat Marathon with events spanning a 5km run through to a full marathon.
Mr McNicol said the percentage of male and female participants sat at 41 per cent female and 59 per cent male.
Busting myths that prevent would-be runners from achieving their health and fitness goals.
And the number of entrants in 2025 has boomed more than 40 per cent with about 9,000 runners set to hit the pavement in late April, amounting to about 3,600 women runners.
""When I did a lot of running around the lake on a Friday morning there are so many women,"" Mr McNicol said.
""I know from speaking to many female runners they run around the lake because of the lights, it's a fantastic asset.
""It's heartbreaking they feel they need that in order to train, or to train in a group.
""As a male I feel I can go running anywhere in Ballarat and feel safe.

Sleep","Abhinav Shrivastava's parents were early birds — academics who got up at 4am to start working.
But he took after his uncles, photojournalists who thrived in the hours the world went quiet, and routinely went to bed at 4am.
""My mother tried to make me wake up really early in the morning and do my studies … it never worked well for me,"" Mr Shrivastava said.
It took time for his parents to accept his clock ran differently, but the clincher came when he was 13 years old.
Abhinav Shrivastava prefers to work through the night, when most people around him are sleeping.  (Supplied)
""We had an exam in the morning and I just decided 'you know what, I'll cram through the entire night and then directly go to the examination hall', and it worked quite well,"" the now 35-year-old recalled.
""It's one of those interesting things, when you are in your natural rhythm, you feel quite comfortable … It was liberating.
""I figured out I was quite hardwired.""
University was the first time Mr Shrivastava could truly live by his natural rhythm.
""It's comfortable for me to wake up at three in the afternoon, get stuff done then start working from seven in the evening and keep going until three or five in the morning,"" he said.
Sleep experts estimate about 16 per cent of people are naturally inclined to stay awake until the early hours of the morning. (ABC News: Geraden Cann)
While others chased sleep, Mr Shrivastava said he thrived working in silence, free from phone calls, messages and push notifications.
The RMIT academic has tried to shift to a daylight schedule — using melatonin (a hormone that regulates the body's sleep-wake cycle) and light therapy.
""I've tried it all,"" Mr Shrivastava said.
He even married a sleep researcher, but still his body stubbornly craved the night.
Medically, Mr Shrivastava might be diagnosed with delayed sleep phase syndrome — a disorder where individuals sleep far later than normal.
Professor Shantha Rajaratnam says screen time may be contributing to more night owls. (Supplied: Monash University)
Shantha Rajaratnam, who heads the School of Psychological Sciences at Monash University, said Mr Shrivastava's sleep pattern was not that unusual.
Best estimates suggest roughly 16 per cent of the population sleep extremely late, nodding off between 2:30am and 7am.
Professor Rajaratnam said artificial lights and screens may be pushing more people into this category.
""We may be creating more night owls,"" he said.
How Mr Shrivastava differs is he belongs to a group who appear hardwired to be awake through large parts of the night, and who resist treatments to adjust.
The size of this group isn't known but, in 2019, Professor Rajaratnam helped conduct a study of 116 night owls that identified biological characteristics that contributed to someone leaning toward the nocturnal.
Researchers at Monash University's sleep lab monitor a study subject. (Supplied: Monash University)
By combining sleep scheduling with melatonin for one group, while giving the other a placebo, the experiment identified a variation in one ""clock gene"" — the PERIOD3 gene — that predicted how well participants responded to melatonin.
Another factor was light sensitivity.
A person's internal clock is adjusted by light entering the eye.
""There are 50-fold differences in people's sensitivity to light, so some people can be shifted to an earlier time zone with less light than others,"" Professor Rajaratnam said.
One sleep physician estimated about one in 1,000 people are hardwired for the night. (Supplied: Monash University)
Night owls also had a longer circadian clock, and a longer ""free running period"", which dictated how long the body naturally stayed awake if all stimuli, including light, were removed.
""The average in healthy humans is about 24.2 hours in terms of the period length, but there are some people who are 24.5 and 24.8, and so on,"" Professor Rajaratnam said.
""Their clock is trying to get later and later.""
David Cunnington has been a sleep physician for 25 years.
While most of Australia is sleeping, more than 1 million workers are supporting the $174 billion night-time economy.
He estimated about one in 1,000 people were hardwired for the night.
""When people don't respond to treatment, very often it is because of other factors,"" he said.
""Examples of other factors are depression, trauma, ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, and stress.
""There are still people who struggle to adapt to a daytime routine without these factors, but they are less common.""
In ages past, Dr Cunnington said, night owls may have manned the campfire, and society still had a role for them.
""Twenty per cent of people in Western societies work non-standard hours, so there's lots of opportunities to be working all hours, night and day,"" he said.
Dr David Cunnington says factors such as stress, depression and trauma may make it hard for some people to adapt to daytime routines. (Supplied)
Dr Cunnington said he had not met many he believed were hardwired for the night, but one was Rosemary Joyce, who now manages the sleep unit he works with.
Ms Joyce said she has had night owl tendencies since childhood, when she struggled to get up for school.
""I think there's some genetic component to it, but also some environmental stuff — being child number eight of a big family and being sent to bed before everyone else, possibly I had a bit of late-night FOMO.""
Rosemary Joyce says she is much happier living by her natural body clock rather than trying to fit into a more common daytime schedule. (Supplied)
Her father — a farmer — was also up past midnight most nights.
In her 20s, Ms Joyce was usually the last person standing on a night out, and when she had tried early shifts, they left her exhausted and without a social life.
She has found her own niche and a natural fit managing the sleep unit.
""A lot of people who work in sleep tend to have some form of sleep disorder or another.""
SleepHealth Foundation chief executive Moira Junge said education on sleep was lacking, with 47 per cent of medical professionals having no sleep training in their curriculum.
""It has only been recognised in the last little while how important sleep is,"" she said.

Dr Junge said it was important to acknowledge night owls were normal.
She said many teenagers went through a stage where their sleep shifted backwards.

As society understood sleep better, Dr Junge said Australia could adopt more flexible work and school times to cater to late-risers.
While some struggled with being night owls, she said others accepted it, finding careers in casinos, shift work, or security.
For Mr Shrivastava, his internal clock is a point of pride.
While his parents accepted his night owl tendencies, he may have met a nemesis who won't — a puppy called Cosmo.

And data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows they also account for almost half of all public hospital bed days nationally.
It's one of the biggest challenges facing Australia's health system.
But a fresh approach has dramatically reduced the number of unnecessary hospital stays by older Australians, improving care for them and freeing up beds for others at the same time.
By embedding a geriatrician in its emergency department, St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne said it has safely diverted nearly 150 older patients from the ward over one year and saved 900 bed days in the process.
About half of all the elderly patients planned for admission were able to be sent home, back to aged care or to rehabilitation instead.

One of those was 85-year-old Beverley Minogue.
In early March 2024, her knee gave out and she was unable to climb the stairs to her bedroom.
""I've got osteoarthritis. It's just all worn out. It's bone on bone,"" she said.
""I slept downstairs for four nights.""
Ms Minogue was taken by ambulance to the St Vincent's emergency department where she expected a lengthy hospital stay but was instead sent home the next day.
The turnaround was thanks to the hospital's new Geriatrician in the Emergency Department (GED) service.

Geriatricians, as a specialty, look at the big picture in an elderly person's life including overlapping illnesses, multiple drug therapies and the supports they have.
In Ms Minogue's case, lead geriatrician Richard Kane was able to recommend a series of supports that helped manage the osteoarthritis in her knee from home.
She had daily visits from nurses, a physio and a geriatrician for two weeks.
He said there was no increase in re-admissions by those diverted from hospital.
Dr Kane — the clinical director of geriatric medicine at St Vincent's — established the program and said the team has helped patients with heart and lung conditions, falls and fractures and delirium recover at home.
He said people tended to recover quicker ""in their own environment"".

""Once a cause is identified and dangerous causes are excluded, they can recover just as effectively in their own home,"" he said.
Elderly patients face unique challenges when they go to hospital, as do the doctors treating them.
""It can be harder to get to the bottom of what's going on with an older person when their health declines,"" Dr Kane said.
He said data showed being in hospital for an older person was a riskier experience than being at home.
""Contrary to what you might think their risk of falls increases, their risk of becoming delirious or confused increases,"" he said.
Once the patient is sent home, they are visited the next day by hospital staff and have daily visits after that from a doctor, a nurse, a physiotherapist, a social worker, pharmacist or other clinicians, depending on their needs.
They're also given a 24-hour hotline they can ring if their condition deteriorates that will connect them with medical staff.
""There will always be patients who need to be admitted to the hospital, and we're not about preventing that,"" Dr Kane said.
Richard Kane says patients tend to recover quicker ""in their own environment"". (ABC News: Patrick Stone)
The pilot program was funded by the Victorian government, the hospital and some philanthropic funding.
The program is now ongoing, and the hospital hopes to use specific funding from the federal government's Strengthening Medicare initiative.
The geriatrician program is one of several similar schemes elsewhere in the country aiming to address the health needs of an aging population.
A study in the Australasian Journal on Aging found more than half of the older adults seen by the geriatrician service at Monash Medical Centre were directly discharged from emergency and only 4 per cent of them needed readmission.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) said more focus was needed on funding the extra resources for the aging population with programs like GED.
An AMA Hospital Report Card found the proportion of public hospital beds for every Australian over 65 had more than halved since 1991-1992.
The AMA is calling for a scheme recommended by multiple inquiries that would give seniors $1,100 of free dental care every two years.
AMA emergency medicine representative Sarah Whitelaw said the figures were a ""frightening glimpse into the future"".
""We all know that we are facing a future where there's going to be more of us who are over 65,"" she said.
The AMA said the incoming government needed to sign off on the next National Health Reform Agreement, which raises the share of Commonwealth funding for state-run hospitals to 45 per cent over a decade, with 55 per cent funded by the states.
It also wants more flexibility in what can be funded by hospitals, including links into other community health care providers for at home programs such as GED.
""We also want to make sure that that funding drives the kind of care that we want and that our elderly Australians need,"" Dr Whitelaw said.
While Labor has endorsed the increase, it is yet to sign.

COVID-19","Victoria's paramedics union has blamed Ambulance Victoria management for covering up a funeral gathering it hosted in September 2021 during stage four COVID-19 restrictions.
The union has pushed back on suggestions any of its members flouted strict lockdown rules on 30 September 2021 when an honour guard was held for a colleague who had died.
The existence of the event has come to light more than three-and-a-half years after it happened because of an anonymous submission to a parliamentary inquiry into the state's ambulance services.
An anonymous submission to a parliamentary inquiry states many paramedics felt very uncomfortable about the funeral gathering. (ABC News: Michael Barnett)
The submission claims Ambulance Victoria (AV) hosted a funeral attended by 40 people during Melbourne's stage four lockdowns in 2021, constituting a hypocritical breach of restrictions which applied to all Victorians.
At the time, Victorians were under stay-at-home curfews, public gatherings were heavily restricted, private gatherings weren't allowed and only 10 people could attend a funeral.
Grieving the death of loved ones was universally tough on Victorian families during that period.
The submission states senior AV managers organised a gathering at a discrete location to farewell a paramedic who had died, with approval from the CEO.
The submission states the event was attended by paramedics, managers and the organisations's pipes and drums band.
It says managers who attended the funeral were the same people responsible for upholding COVID restrictions throughout the pandemic.
While he did not work for Ambulance Victoria at the time, executive director of People and Culture, Jesse Maddison, said he profoundly regretted what happened.
""It was wrong and there is no excuse for what occurred,"" he said on Thursday.
""These events occurred in 2021 under a previous leadership and I'm very confident that if similar circumstances existed the same outcome would not occur.
""I really profoundly hope that it does not impact the Victorian community's trust and confidence in our front line paramedics who do a fantastic job every single day of the week keeping Victorians safe.""
Mr Maddison denied allegations AV deliberately covered up the incident.
""I don't believe that there was any intention to cover the matter up. The matter has been dealt with as we deal with a lot of internal matters,"" he said.
The submission claims ""paramedics did not feel comfortable with other paramedics entering their branches due to the fear of catching COVID"".
""Many staff were distressed by the event, their wellbeing was significantly impacted, and morale plummeted,"" it states.
On-shift paramedics were instructed to rearrange ambulances for the event and ""hand over the keys"" to their ambulances to allow the beacons to be turned on for the hearse, the submission says.
Mr Maddison said it was his understanding that paramedics in attendance were not on duty at the time and were not paid for attending.
He said ambulances that attended the event were offline.
""I do not believe it had any impact on community safety,"" Mr Maddison said.
The submission also claims the event, held at an ambulance branch, was chosen ""to avoid public eyes"", and was booked as a professional development event in employees' calendars.
""Eyewitnesses state approximately 40 [people] were in attendance,"" the submission states.

It also claims the AV communications centre placed a warning on an ambulance vehicle to ensure it wouldn't be dispatched to a patient while travelling from the west.
Afterwards, the matter was escalated internally and referred to the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC), which substantiated the complaint with emails about the event.
IBAC then handed the matter back to AV to take action, the submission claims.
Mr Maddison confirmed people involved were disciplined in accordance with the organisation's policies and procedures but would not say what that looked like.
The ambulance union wrote to the Minister for Ambulance Services, Gabrielle Williams, in August 2023 about the gathering.
""To this day, there has been no outcome for the complaint,"" the submission states.
""There are witnesses and several other paramedics who continue to wait for accountability for the funeral event during stage four restrictions and an explanation of the governance involved in this complaint.""
The ABC has requested clarification of what measures have been taken by AV in relation to the September 2021 breach, with Ambulance Victoria deferring to the ""inquiry process"".
IBAC told the ABC it would not confirm whether a complaint or investigation was before it.
AV's interim chief executive officer Andrew Crisp confirmed on Thursday the gathering took place.
""The gathering contravened Victorian COVID-19 restrictions and was not in line with AV's values or our commitment to public safety and community trust,"" he said.
""We continue to engage with the Legal and Social Issues Committee Inquiry with a genuine desire to improve our workplace and the services we provide.""
Premier Jacinta Allan described the AV gathering as ""entirely inappropriate"".
""I can understand members of the community being really frustrated by these reports because COVID was a tough time for everybody and many Victorians were working really hard to follow the rules and this was not appropriate behaviour,"" she said.
Victorian Liberal MP Georgie Crozier, who is on the parliamentary committee handling the ambulance services inquiry, called for the government to release a report into its findings.
""It's really disappointing and shocking that this was allowed to go on given what thousands and thousands of Victorians had to endure at the time,"" she said.

""They weren't allowed to go and see loved ones, they weren't allowed to farewell them at funerals.
""[Former premier] Daniel Andrews was so tough on Victorians ... he was berating people for watching a sunset for goodness sake, yet there was one rule for some and another for others.""
The inquiry into Victoria's ambulance services was commissioned by state parliament in August last year seeking submissions on ""the core issues impacting the management and functions of Ambulance Victoria"", according the inquiry's webpage.
The scope of the inquiry includes the daily functioning of the organisation such as call-taking and ambulance dispatching, as well as governance, workplace culture and allegations of fraud and misconduct.
Mr Maddison said AV would participate and cooperate with the inquiry.
""We anticipate that there will be requests for further information in relation to this matter and we will fully cooperate with those processes,"" he said.
The Victorian Ambulance Union has confirmed the funeral gathering was held to commemorate a paramedic who had died, but said AV paramedics did not attend the ceremony.
The event in question, the union said, was after the funeral ceremony when ""the hearse drove past an ambulance branch where AV staff had congregated and formed an honour guard"".
""Paramedics who took part in the event firmly believed that it was approved by senior management and in line with the rules they were required to follow,"" the union said.
If the event was breaching COVID-19 rules then fault sits with management who approved it, the union said.
Union secretary Danny Hill said the most senior levels of AV management attended, including the COVID commander and Chief Paramedic Officer who were heavily involved in enforcing COVID rules.
""I have no doubt that AV were trying to do the right thing by the paramedic, their family and the workforce,"" he said.
""There is no question that the organisation tried to cover this up after the fact by trying to scapegoat an individual who performed an administrative role in organising some of the logistics for the event.""",Andi Yu,Thu 24 Apr

Courts","Former South Australian opposition leader David Speirs has lost a bid to avoid being convicted over drug supply charges.
Speirs pleaded guilty to two charges of supplying a controlled substance to another person on separate occasions in August last year.
The 40-year-old’s lawyer previously asked the court not to record a conviction so that Speirs could travel overseas.
But today the Adelaide Magistrates Court fined the former Liberal leader $9,000 and recorded two convictions.
He has also been ordered to undertake 37-and-a-half hours of community service.
On Thursday, Magistrate Brian Nitschke said he found the offending ""too serious"" not to record convictions.
""The need for public denunciation for this type of offending and the need for general deterrence is too great to refrain from recording a conviction,"" he said.
Speirs was arrested at Berri, in the state's Riverland, in September last year.
His arrest came after a video, published by News Corp, showed the former MP snorting from a plate. The charges do not relate to the video.
The former Liberal leader resigned from parliament after the charges were laid.

Earlier this month, the court heard Speirs started using the drug as a ""form of escapism"".
Court documents viewed by the ABC last week said Speirs supplied cocaine to two men, one of whom he knew had been attending Narcotics Anonymous.
On Thursday, Magistrate Nitschke said there was no suggestion Speirs committed the offences by using his ""status"" or position as the leader of the opposition.
""But you did commit these offences having been a member of parliament for a number of years, and whilst you occupied the important parliamentary position of leader of the opposition,"" he said.
The former Liberal leader resigned from parliament after the charges were laid. (ABC News: Che Chorley)
Magistrate Nitschke said he accepted the offending occurred at a time of stress but that was ""certainly no excuse"" for the crimes committed.
""You believe [when taking cocaine] you experienced a significant change from your chronic state of tiredness, fatigue and frustration that you'd become accustomed to since you became leader of the opposition,"" he said.
He said Speirs told forensic psychologist Lorraine Lim that he used cocaine ""about five times between mid-June 2024 and August-2024"" and it was ""mostly escapism from the stress of work"".
Speirs did not speak to the media outside court on Thursday.
Vincent Tarzia, who replaced Speirs as the leader of the opposition following the latter's resignation, said South Australians ""expect their MPs to do the right thing"".
""Now that the judicial process involving the former member for Black has been completed, it highlights that nobody is above the law,"" he said.
""Those elected to public office should be setting an example and they must therefore remain focused always on serving their community with integrity.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-24/the-struggle-of-ivf-when-you-re-neurodivergent/105144942,The struggle of IVF when you're neurodivergent,,"Liz Bancroft spent 13 years trying to conceive before giving birth to her son two years ago.
Her journey to motherhood included a gruelling six years of IVF.
It was difficult for many of the reasons you'd expect or may know intimately yourself. But for Liz, a diagnosis after becoming a mother shed further light on why she found infertility treatment so tough.
""I didn't realise that I was autistic until about 12 months post-childbirth when I realised my son was showing signs of autism,"" the 39-year-old from Perth/Boorloo says.
""In terms of my IVF journey, it annoyed me that I didn't know sooner because I would have made some changes … [which might have had an impact on] my ability to cope, potentially the outcomes, or advocating for myself more than I already did.""
Liz, who works as a clinical and counselling psychologist, has been motivated by her experience to develop a program helping neurodivergent women navigate IVF.
We spoke with Liz about her IVF experience, and what would have helped her as an autistic person.
These are her words.
A quick note, this story mentions pregnancy loss.
Liz Bancroft works with other neurodivergent women navigating fertility treatment. (Supplied)
I had a natural pregnancy 13 years ago after I got married, which resulted in a miscarriage.
Then I wasn't able to conceive naturally — that's when I started looking into IVF.
The first clinic I went to wouldn't treat me because of my BMI. So I had gastric lap-band surgery, which was then revised and turned into a gastric sleeve.
I lost 55 kilograms overall.
This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.
I went back to a different clinic and had a few rounds that didn't work out. They weren't interested in trying different protocols, so I found a third clinic [with] a slightly different approach.
At first we tried ovulation induction. I fell pregnant naturally three times in a row, three months in a row, and I lost every one.
At that point I switched to IVF. But beforehand, I pushed for a laparoscopy as I was certain I had endometriosis. They found some mild endo, and a cyst attached to my uterus, and removed all of that.
We implanted the only two embryos I had. One of them took, and that is what resulted in my son.
I went back last year to start all of this again, but the first round resulted in no embryos out of 30 collected eggs.
The second resulted in one, but unfortunately that embryo didn't implant.
I'm now almost 40 and too financially stretched for more IVF.
The plan is to try naturally in the coming months, but if it doesn't happen, I'll have to accept that I am only able to have just the one.
I work with a lot of neurodivergent clients and am very good at early diagnosis and non-stereotypical presentations.
But I always assumed I was neurotypical.
When I saw clear signs of autism in my son, he had to get that from somewhere, and it wasn't my husband.
All roads linked back to myself.
Liz's son is now aged two. (Supplied)
Some professionals might have assumed what I was experiencing was post-natal anxiety, but what I was struggling with was lack of control in my everyday routine.
I was usually a very structured, controlled person, so my symptoms or sensitivities were never aggravated.
All that went out the window with a baby.
I got therapy and worked through all the possibilities, for example childhood attachment issues and trauma.
But when I screened myself, I saw that many symptoms were just very borderline clinical levels of autism, and some surpassed.
When I ran it past a few colleagues and friends, they were all like, 'Yeah Liz. We've known this for a while.'
It's not uncommon for couples to be told that if they could ""just relax"", becoming pregnant would be easy.
It was a huge relief, looking back over my life and reframing everything through a neurodivergent lens.
It made so much sense to me.
All those horrible labels I'd been given like anal retentive, bossy, dramatic, high maintenance.
It helped repair some of those self-esteem wounds.
One of the pinnacle examples of how autism shaped my experience with IVF would be egg collection.
It's a very intense procedure and a pivotal point in treatment which will determine potential outcomes following that.
There is some research that shows chronic and acute stress can potentially have a negative impact on outcomes at egg collection.
You have to show up at a very specific time. Then there is a window they need to operate within to get results, as you've taken medication beforehand to stimulate this process.
On one occasion, we weren't greeted at the waiting room.
They were running late.
Nobody updates you on anything.
The lights are very bright, people are making noise.
You have some wishy-washy instructions from your last appointment.
For an autistic person who needs structure and routine, it can be quite stressful.
The environment started to grate on me, and I was becoming more stressed and overstimulated.
It got to the point I felt I was about to have a meltdown, so I had to leave.
Pacing is a stimming behaviour for me, so I paced outside for 40 minutes before I was seen.
My nervous system had been activated, and I wonder how much of that stress response could have impacted my egg collection.
Any debt linked to fertility treatment can be a painful reminder for childless people that life didn't go as they planned. And it's often not just financial debt they are left with, either.
Offering to slow down verbal explanations, especially if processing speed is a concern for the patient.
Having more clear written instructions and visual aids.
Dimming lighting in waiting rooms.
Addressing sensory issues around temperature in theatres.
Options for weighted blankets. Noise-cancelling headphones.
These are things that could have helped me.
Neurodivergent patients may have some greater needs, and we know an autistic woman is more likely to placate, passively comply, or shut down than they are to speak up for themselves.
Helping women with my program is essentially my new baby.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-24/rural-hospital-rollout-faces-delays-after-government-review/105206426,Queensland government delays new hospital beds amid $7b budget blowout,"Topic:
Healthcare Facilities","Hundreds of beds slated for two new regional Queensland hospitals and other health-related projects are facing significant delays due to spiralling costs, an independent review has found.
The Sangster Review, led by hospital infrastructure specialist Sam Sangster, found the former Labor government's $9.8 billon hospital capacity expansion program (CEP) would have blown out to $17 billion if the LNP continued with the rollout.
Health Minister Tim Nicholls said none of the projects proposed under Labor, including the 741 new beds planned for regional Queensland, would have been deliverable across multiple sites by the 2028 deadline.
In light of the review the government has confirmed it will redesign and replan the new hospital sites at Toowoomba and Bundaberg.
The major revamp comes after the former government had given the green light to optimise a dual campus setting for both Toowoomba and Bundaberg, which would have utilised existing infrastructure at the old sites in addition to new facilities.
In Toowoomba the new hospital project at the Baillie Henderson site is still slated to deliver 118 new beds, but all services from the old hospital will now be moved to the new site.
The review found the original Toowoomba project's plan to operate two hospital sites would have cost taxpayers an extra $400 million per year, excluding ongoing maintenance to keep the old CBD site safe and functional.
In Bundaberg the government rejected the recommendation to pause early site works, instead opting to create a new plan to transfer all services and beds to the new site, including more than 410 beds and bed alternatives.

The review found that maintaining the old hospital site, situated in a flood zone, would have cost up to $200 million per year.
Mr Nicholls said works at the new locations at Toowoomba and Bundaberg will continue.
""There will be two hospitals running for a period of time [at Twooomba and Bundaberg],"" he said.
""Obviously we hope to get 75 per cent of services relocated in the first stage, but the prospect of running a second hospital forever — which is what the old plan was — versus having a second hospital running for a shorter period of time and moving them … is a much better outcome.""
Queensland Health Minister Tim Nicholls says the government will redesign multiple hospital projects.  (ABC News: Chris Gillette)
The review also found the Mackay Base Hospital expansion of 128 extra beds and a new women's health and children's ward for north Queensland was ""undeliverable"" because the initial plan was underfunded by $270 million.
It found there were design problems including not providing overnight beds for parents and carers in the children's ward.
The report found site conditions, including the discovery of cultural artefacts and the presence of asbestos, were not properly assessed and had added more than $87 million to the project.

However, the government rejected the recommendation to terminate the contract with BESIX Watpac saying it would prefer to work with the contractor due to their project knowledge.
Meanwhile at Townsville the government has committed to developing a staged approach to deliver at least 165 more beds for the city.
The Townsville University Hospital expansion plan would only have been deliverable if ""substantial amounts of clinical scope"" was removed from the budget, which was ""clearly problematic"" according to the review.
In far north Queensland recommendations to continue with the Cairns refurbishment and develop a new plan for a surgical centre and more beds will be adopted.
On the Gold Coast, the government will end a commercial leasing agreement to give Robina Hospital access to surgical facilities and an additional 114 beds in a shared space with a private hospital service until the Coomera Hospital is built.
The review found project delays with the Robina plan meant it was best to scrap the lease agreement and accommodate the extra beds at the Coomera site.
The new Coomera Hospital plan will include 600 beds — up from 404 — while consolidating the required 114 new beds for Robina.
The Australian Medical Association Queensland said the budget constraints highlighted in the review were concerning.
""Unfortunately the report does indicate that there's a significant portion of costs that does stem from inadequate assessment,"" president Nick Yim said.
He said the additional beds were important for regional communities.
""We know that there are challenges with bed block and bed shortages, and these can contribute to increased ED wait time and ramping,"" Dr Yim said.
""So this is really positive now that we have this report and we can utilise it to identify and increase those bed numbers in that region.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-24/federal-election-2025-bulk-billing-medicare-gp-reponses/105188752,"Politicians are throwing more money at GPs, so why are they unhappy?",,"If you've heard about the big spending pledges around bulk-billing and Medicare this election but still don't feel clear about what that'll mean for your health care, you're not alone.
In case you missed it, Labor and the Coalition have both pledged $8.5 billion to give GPs incentives to bulk-bill all patients instead of just kids, concession hard holders and pensioners.
Live results: Find out what's happening in your seat as counting continues
But it's not compulsory and GP's — who decide whether or not to bulk-bill a patient — have told ABC NEWS the proposal isn't workable.
We heard from hundreds of GPs across the country and here's why many are saying they won't expand their bulk-billing practices beyond concession patients.
See how ABC NEWS used audience responses to develop this story.
GPs told us the way the bulk-billing incentives are structured means they're rewarded for seeing patients for short visits and getting more patients through the door.
They say the changes will compound the current system of time-based care, where categories of GP visits are classified based on the time you spend with your doctor.
GPs told us that will compromise care for the increasing number of patients with complex illnesses, including older patients, and people with mental health conditions and multiple chronic conditions.
1 / of 4
In a word: cost.
But let's take a typical practice and explain why GPs are upset.
Say we've got a GP who works in a country town. At the moment, if an adult patient comes in for a standard consult (15 minutes), the doctor might have a fee of $100. The patient then gets a Medicare rebate of $42.85 back. In the end, the patient is $57.15 out-of-pocket.
What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say.
Under the changes, if the GP wanted to bulk-bill and make their consult free of charge, they'd be paid a bulk-billing incentive. The rate varies depending on the town and whether it's regional, rural, remote or urban.
Because the town in our scenario is a large rural centre, the incentive is $34.50. That means the government pays the doctor $34.50 plus the existing Medicare rebate of $42.85 meaning the GP only gets $77.35 instead of $100.
The loss adds up to roughly $90 less an hour, $3,000 less a week and about $160,000 less a year.
But there is an additional incentive on offer under the new plan. If the whole practice bulk-bills all patients the clinic will get an extra 12.5 per cent loading on relevant rebates.
So that might close the gap for bigger practices but not so for smaller clinics with fewer patients.
Doctors say what they'd like to see is the Medicare rebate lifted.
That's the $42.85 figure we talked about earlier.
1 / of 4
Heath Minister Mark Butler has previously said he's against just raising the rebate because it doesn't guarantee patients will be bulk-billed.
Doctors who practice women's health told us the plan is incompatible with their patients' needs.
Others say busy, city practices with more costly overheads will be disadvantaged because their incentives will be lower than those on offer for remote clinics.
1 / of 2
In response to concerns from doctors about the incentives, the government released calculations (based on average GP earnings) which showed a fully bulk-billing GP would make more than $400,000 a year with these changes.
That $400,000 is their estimated take-home salary after they have paid their practice fees, which the government calculates at 30 per cent.
But some GPs told us the actual average wage would be significantly lower as their practice fees are around 40 per cent and then they still have to pay indemnity insurance, professional membership fees and set aside superannuation and sick and/or annual leave pay.
Many GPs also only work part-time, especially women, so will have lower incomes.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-23/mornington-island-renal-dialysis-life-saving-treatment/105196586,Patients say remote island dialysis unit is bringing them 'back to life',"Topic:
Healthcare Facilities","After spending two years away from home for life-saving medical treatment, Mornington Island resident Frank Watt says reuniting with his family has brought him ""back to life"".
""When you're home you get more support from your family … [it] brings you back to life because you feel happy inside,"" Mr Watt said.
Between 2022 and 2024, Mr Watt received treatment for end-stage kidney disease at Townsville — 850 kilometres away on a multi-day, mutli-flight commute — because there were no suitable renal facilities on the island.
It was a ""scary, lonely"" time that made him homesick, the 54-year-old said.

But that has changed since a permanent renal dialysis unit was established at Mornington Island Hospital, enabling patients like Mr Watt to receive critical treatment on country.
""Indigenous people that come from this place, it's a privilege for them to come home and have dialysis,"" Mr Watt said.
Frank Watt is relieved to be back home. (Supplied: North West Hospital and Health Service)
The ex-police liaison officer said receiving treatment locally was life-changing and he wanted other remote Indigenous communities to have the same opportunity.
""They can go down the beach and do some fishing when they got day off, sit out with families and have a talk, a yarn, like they used to before they got sick.""

The rate of kidney disease is disproportionately higher among First Nations people than the general population.
Kidney Health Australia said Indigenous patients were four times as likely to die from the condition.
Last year, dialysis was the leading cause of hospitalisations for Indigenous Australians accounting for 44 per cent of admissions — 11 times higher than the non-Indigenous population, according to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Performance Framework.
Patients with kidney disease require treatment multiple times a week to stay alive, taking hours at a time.
When that is not able to be delivered locally, remote patients like Mr Watt travel hundreds of kilometres to a treatment centre and can be displaced from home for years.

Mornington Island, nestled in the Gulf of Carpentaria off the north coast of Queensland, is home to about 1,000 residents.
Mr Watt recalled family members who were being treated for dialysis on the mainland sometimes died there, away from their loved ones back home.
""It cost a lot of money to bring home a family member back on the island for a funeral.""
Mr Watt was one of the first patients to be treated at the new renal dialysis unit at Mornington Island Hospital when it opened in June last year.
The six-chair unit caters to those who independently dialyse and those requiring clinical support from specialist dialysis nurses.
It was a boost from the previous temporary two-chair, satellite supported haemodialysis unit.

Mornington Island director of nursing Scott Windsor said it was a ""significant improvement"" in the quality of life for dialysis patients.
""Having access to such critical services locally means that patients can maintain their routines and support networks, which is vital to their wellbeing,"" Mr Windsor said.
North West Hospital and Health Service chief executive Sean Birgan said the response from the island's patients was encouraging.
""The new, more permanent renal dialysis unit allows us to deliver healthcare services more efficiently and effectively, providing better continuity of care and enhancing overall patient experience,"" Mr Birgan said.
Back on the mainland, 150km south-east, Normanton Hospital is currently undergoing a significant upgrade, due to open mid-2025.
In 2024 the federal government announced $18.58 million for additional dialysis units across multiple locations in remote Australia, including Normanton.
A specific timeline for dialysis at Normanton has not been confirmed, but Mr Birgan said it would be coming to the new hospital.
""They want the capability to deliver dialysis. That's a service they don't currently have,"" he said.
""I can confirm that the new building will have the capability of delivering renal dialysis.""

Another 400km south-west in the border town of Camooweal, dialysis chairs are scheduled to be installed in the local primary health clinic.
Acting health service chief executive Damien Searle said the chairs had been ordered and he was awaiting a delivery date.
""We endeavour to inform the community and our patients waiting for dialysis treatment in Camooweal as soon as this service is available,"" Mr Searle said.

Vaccines and Immunity","Less than half of Australia's aged care residents 75 years and older are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations — despite being at the highest risk of severe illness and death.
""It is crucial for us to increase vaccination rates in residential aged care homes,"" Australia's chief medical officer and aged care quality and safety commissioner recently wrote in a joint letter to aged care providers, urging them to prepare for winter.
The letter follows a clinical alert issued by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission in late March which noted the commission's chief clinical advisor was ""concerned about persistently low COVID-19 vaccination rates across many residential aged care homes"".
Data shows 45.8 per cent of aged care residents over 75 years have received a COVID vaccine in the past six months. National immunisation guidelines recommend all Australians aged 75 years and older receive six-monthly COVID-19 boosters.
All COVID-19 vaccinations are free for people living in Australia. (ABC News: Ongerung Kambes Kesolei)
Meanwhile, in the wider community, data from the Department of Health and Aged Care shows just a fifth of Australians aged 75 years and over have received a COVID-19 vaccine in the past six months.
Infectious diseases specialist Paul Griffin said the risk of dying from COVID-19 was much lower now than at the beginning of the pandemic, but that the disease still posed a significant risk to older Australians, particularly those in aged care.
""The COVID landscape has changed very significantly and many people now, rightly or wrongly, perceive the risk as very low. But in the aged care setting, the risk remains high,"" Professor Griffin, director of infectious diseases at Mater Health Services in Brisbane, said.
As of April 10, there were 70 active COVID-19 outbreaks in residential aged care homes across the country, according to health department data.
Professor Griffin said low vaccination rates were particularly concerning heading into winter months, which typically bring an increase in respiratory illnesses.
""When we have another wave, which unfortunately is inevitable, the impact of that wave will be greater than it would have otherwise been based on the fact that we're perhaps doing the least to reduce the impact of COVID that we've done since the pandemic began,"" he said.
While all Australians aged 75 and over are recommended six-monthly COVID-19 boosters, adults aged 65 to 74 are also eligible for a booster every six months ""based on a benefit-risk assessment"". The same applies to severely immunocompromised people aged 18 to 64.
""A dose every six months is most likely to benefit people with medical risk conditions and/or those living in residential aged care homes,"" the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation notes.
People in this cohort are otherwise recommended to get a COVID-19 booster every 12 months.
In December, the Department of Health and Aged Care wrote to every aged care facility in Australia to remind them of their obligations to keep residents safe and offer regular vaccinations.
""The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission will be monitoring vaccination rates for each home and take action where required,"" the department said in a statement late last year.
But according to the latest residential aged care COVID-19 vaccination rates, 491 aged care homes — approximately a fifth — have vaccinated less than one in 10 residents in the past six months.
The national peak body for aged care providers, Ageing Australia, was contacted for comment but declined to respond.
As a new wave of COVID-19 hits Australia, why are so few aged care residents up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccinations?
Robert O'Sullivan, president of the Australian and New Zealand Society for Geriatric Medicine, described current vaccination rates as ""concerning"" and urged providers and residents to increase uptake.
""We're still seeing people in hospitals presenting with COVID-19 with serious illness … It's still a significant cause of death in older people, and particularly people in nursing homes,"" Dr O'Sullivan said.
COVID-19 remains the leading cause of death from acute respiratory infection in 2025, ahead of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
In 2024, 3,852 Australians died from COVID-19; 92 per cent of them were aged 70 and over.
To improve vaccination levels, Dr O'Sullivan said it was important to increase public health messaging around the prevalence and seriousness of COVID-19, particularly amongst older age groups, which had ""fallen off"" in recent years.
""Part of it is probably that COVID is a relatively new illness and we don't really have any other vaccine preventable illnesses that require six-monthly vaccination,"" he said.
""Going forward, we need to be very consistent with the message that just as annual influenza vaccination is a really good thing for older people to prevent serious illness and death, six-monthly vaccination for COVID — if you're aged 75 and over or living in a nursing home — is really important.""

Professor Griffin added that improving access was also key.
""People are finding it a little bit more difficult than they did before — they're not being let know where to get these vaccines or which one to get.""
In aged care facilities, the federal government provides funding for GPs, pharmacists and primary care providers to administer free COVID-19 vaccines to residents.
In the community, COVID vaccines are free for all Australian adults and eligible children, and people are encouraged to speak to their doctor or health provider about vaccination (HealthDirect can also help you find a vaccine provider near you).
Professor Griffin recommended getting the Pfizer JN.1 booster (known as Comirnaty JN.1) which was made available late last year.
""While the previous one [Omicron XBB.1.5-containing vaccine] will provide some protection, we know that COVID is continuing to change … so I would certainly opt for the latest one.""
COVID-19 boosters can be safely administered at the same time as the flu vaccine, which is now available through GPs and pharmacies.
Many older Australians are also now recommended to get vaccinated against RSV.
""We see RSV not uncommonly in hospitals and there is now vaccination available, so I'd encourage people to talk to their doctor,"" Dr O'Sullivan said.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-23/masculinity-report-mental-health-men/105197180,New data on masculinity influencers a 'wake-up call' to all Australians,"Topic:
Men","Online ""masculinity"" content is mainstream and wide-ranging — far broader than the toxic Andrew Tate style manosphere or incel culture touched on in the hit Netflix series Adolescence.
It includes fitness and wellbeing, relationship and career advice, personal discipline and self-improvement.
A new report out on Wednesday shows more than two thirds (68 per cent) of young Australian men engage with masculinity influencers and it's shaping their identity.
The Movember Institute of Men's Health surveyed more than 3,000 men aged 16 to 25 across Australia, the UK and the US to find out what impact such content was having on their lives.
""We came in with a health lens. That is the key here. No one has done that,"" said Dr Zac Seidler, global director of men's health research at Movember.
He said getting rid of content on social media because it was ""dangerous"" was unhelpful, as there was no causal evidence to suggest that was the answer.
The report revealed young men were turning to masculinity influencers for motivation and inspiration, which could be attributed to feelings of ""emptiness, isolation"" and ""shame"" for young men, Dr Seidler said.
There are things we can do as parents and adults to nurture little boys in our lives and help them recognise toxic attitudes they'll be exposed to, particularly on social media.
Twenty-seven per cent of those who follow masculinity influencers experienced feelings of worthlessness, compared to 23 per cent of men who didn't actively engage with them.
Dr Seidler said it was a double-edged sword.
Nick Robinson, a 26-year-old who works on a farm in rural WA, has experienced anxiety since he was a young kid, and said he's susceptible to some of the standards set by male influencers.

""Comparison is the biggest thief of joy, and I stand by that forever,"" he said.
""There's been periods where I've used exercise as a coping mechanism. I'd go to the gym three times a day, before work, after work, and at night. There was a period of my life when I was very unwell doing that.""
Masculinity content followers are also twice as likely to engage in risky behaviours like taking steroids or diet pills to achieve the perfect body.
For Mo, 19, it was signing up to an influencer's entrepreneur program, which cost him $1,000 and got him nowhere closer to his dream.
Mo, 19, was lured into a scheme with the promise of getting rich quick. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)
""[Influencers] have this crazy lifestyle: rented-out Lamborghinis, rented-out Rolls Royces and Rolexes. They try to sell you this big dream that you can get rich within a month, within a week. You'll be a millionaire,"" he said.
Dr Seidler said by not engaging with young men about why they're leaning on this type of content, we're overlooking their ""unmet needs"" and won't be able to offer an antidote.
Almost three-quarters of men who lean on masculinity influencers believed ""men need to be stoic to control their emotions"" (76 per cent) compared to 57 per cent of those who do not engage with influencers, while 67 per cent of men engaging with influencers believed women should fulfil tradition roles as wives and mothers (compared to 43 per cent of non-engaged men).
What does it mean to be a ‘real man’?
Jack Toohey is the creative and production manager from Teach Us Consent, an organisation focused on consent and sexuality education at schools.
He said masculinity influencer content could be harmful because it limited how men expressed themselves.
""We are bombarded with all these things that are continuing to restrict what masculinity is, but really, when you can take a step outside that, you realise that we can show more emotions than just anger. We can be strong without being domineering. We can be kind and caring without being controlling,"" he said.
Nathan McCallum, 36, is a content creator from the NSW central coast who started posting on social media back in 2011, focusing on fitness, fashion and heavy metal.
He now has close to one million followers across Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, and rails against the idea of masculinity being a ""black and white construct"".
Meanwhile, Nick Robinson has decided to turn his mental health recovery into something positive by sharing his rural life on social media.
Since 2020, he has created his own content to discuss how vulnerability is a part of what it means to be a man.
""I suppose I've tapped into that and made an impact with those young guys that haven't had any other role model to look at, other than drinking and working hard,"" he said.
Dr Seidler said the key antidote to some of the more harmful concepts around masculinity and the way men view women was for honest, open conversations beyond the social media space so that men could reflect on whether this content was helpful or harmful to their identity.
How to avoid falling into the influencer trap?
""Everyone is obsessed with the radical, misogynistic, homophobic tropes of the world. It is a red herring. There is so much that sits beneath this iceberg, and lots of it is innocuous. Lots of it is seemingly an entry point into understanding dating, into understanding finance, into understanding working out that that is in line with men's values and is very useful. The problem is the algorithm,"" he said.
He said while we must demand more of young men, we also need to regulate social media platforms, as well as improve media literacy.
This report should be a ""wake-up call"" and we need to start listening to young men, he said.
""We're coming into these conversations with an air of alarmism, it immediately puts you on the back foot. Believing that you have a desire to understand their lives from a non-judgemental, curious perspective will open many, many doors.""
Teach Us Consent has been awarded funding from the Department of Social Services to create and distribute social media content targeting 16 to 25-year-olds and will be rolled out next month.
Mr Toohey said social media was fundamentally a health issue, like consuming junk food.
""We just need to get back to basics and teach the basics about how to be a good human and how to live a fulfilling life. It's as simple as that,"" he said.",Unknown,Wed 23 Apr

Alcohol","Queensland MP Nick Dametto says he was ""unaware"" drinking full strength beer on one of Palm Island's northern islands was not permitted, after he posted photos of himself drinking there.
The Katter's Australia Party (KAP) member for Hinchinbrook shared photos of himself and friends on a boat trip to Curacao Island on Good Friday on Facebook.
One of them shows Mr Dametto drinking a full-strength beer with the island's location tagged.
Curacao Island is roughly a kilometre from Great Palm Island.
Under Palm Island's alcohol management plan it is prohibited to bring full-strength beer onto the 10 islands which are part of the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire.
The maximum amount of alcohol a person can carry in the restricted area is 11.25 litres of any liquor with an alcohol concentration of less than 4 per cent.
""I was completely unaware that some of the smaller outer islands that make up the Palm Islands group were also included in that alcohol management plan,"" Mr Dametto said.
Palm Island has alcohol restrictions in place.  (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)
He said it would be ""very beneficial"" if there were ""more signs"" at the boat ramp and popular beaches.
Bwgcolman woman and former councillor Andrea Kyle-Sailor said she was angry when she saw Mr Dametto's post.
""He's been the Member for Hinchinbrook since around 2017 and we've had our alcohol management plan in place since 2006 so we had it in place for 10 years before,"" Ms Kyle-Sailor said.
""His electorate butts up against our electorate, so he should know.""
Palm Island, off the coast of Townsville, has a transient population of about 4,000. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)
She said it was obvious the beer Mr Dametto was drinking was full-strength as the Great Northern Original can he was holding has a white marlin on its branding, while the mid-strength variety has a black marlin.
The alcohol management plan in the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire applies to residents and visitors.
Andrea Kyle Sailor says the law needs to be applied to everyone.  (Supplied)
Ms Kyle-Sailor said even if Mr Dametto had made an ""honest mistake"" in bringing the alcohol to the island, she would like to him to be treated like any other person breaking the law.
""Nobody is exempt. People get searched all the time. It's not uncommon. Police were on the journey today at the ferry so they are constantly doing searches.
""We are humiliated when we get searched. It's really quite embarrassing being searched. They go through everything, and whether we like it or not that's the law.""
Ms Kyle-Sailor said she did not support the alcohol management plan and requested it be reviewed when she was a councillor.
Mr Dametto said it needs to be asked how effective the plan is.
""The double standard is since 2008, some Australians have been treated differently to the rest of Australians when it comes to consuming alcohol,"" he said.
""Members of the KAP like Robbie Katter, our leader, and Bob Katter have been quite vocal about management plans in the past saying they have inadvertent consequences.""
Mr Dametto said he did not believe his mistake warranted an apology.
""I think an apology should be reserved when someone is doing something intentionally wrong,"" he said.

A police spokesperson said the service was investigating the incident.
Mr Dametto said he had not been contacted by the police.
Fifteen local government areas across Queensland have alcohol restrictions with varying rules co-designed between the state government and the communities.
Alcohol management plans are designed to target illicit alcohol and promote ""a healthy culture and attitude"" towards alcohol.
Palm Island Mayor Alf Lacey said he would like to see his community discuss the effectiveness and necessity of the Alcohol Management Plan and potentially revisit it.
""I think it is really unfair. You only find the Alcohol Management Plans in First Nations communities around the state,"" Councillor Lacey said.

""It may have solved some stuff in our community, but when we go into it and delve into the community deeper — we are still a low socio-economic community, (with) overcrowded houses and certainly most of the employment outcome is not like a mainstream community.""
Councillor Lacey said it is cultural protocol for visitors to notify the council they intended to come to the islands before they visit.

Disinformation and Misinformation","Medical experts say motions passed by local councils in South Australia promoting vaccine scepticism are putting the community at risk.
Since the start of this year, three local councils in South Australia's Limestone Coast region — the District Council of Grant, the District Council of Robe, and the Naracoorte-Lucindale Council — have passed motions promoting scepticism about the safety of vaccines.
In addition, the Limestone Coast Local Government Association (LCLGA), made up of all the councils in the region, voted in favour of such a motion.
COVID-19 vaccines were first approved for use in Australia in February 2021. (Reuters: Hannah Beier)
The motions passed by the LCLGA, Robe, and Naracoorte-Lucindale councils call on staff to write to state and federal health ministers to ""ensure all vaccinations, both present and future, are tested to ensure they are free from contaminants and safe for human vaccination"".
University of Queensland infectious disease physician and clinical microbiologist Professor Paul Griffin has worked on the development of 125 vaccines and malaria human challenge studies.
He said the motions imply that past vaccines had not gone through a rigorous testing process.
Professor Paul Griffin has worked on developing a range of vaccines, including eight for COVID-19. (Supplied)
""We have one of the strictest regulatory environments in the world,"" Professor Griffin said.
""We make sure we have tested vaccines thoroughly, that they have to be safe and effective to be approved, and that they have to remain so to be continued to be used.
""We carefully assess the ingredients as well as the safety in recipients on a continual basis to make sure that remains the case.""
A trend of local governments passing motions regarding vaccinations began in October 2024 with the Port Hedland council in Western Australia.
The motion and subsequent motions passed by other councils are based on a debunked claim mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations were contaminated with excessive DNA.

A Canadian study claimed to confirm earlier findings by US molecular biologist Dr Philip Buckhaultz, but those findings have been debunked by fact-checking organisation AAP FactCheck.
The Therapeutic Goods Administration said it was aware of ""misinformation"" in media and online reports regarding COVID-19 vaccines.
""These reports are based on studies conducted by a small number of laboratories that have attempted to investigate the amount of DNA in COVID-19 vaccines,"" the TGA website stated.
The District Council of Grant was the first to move a motion directly referencing vaccines, in which it called the COVID-19 vaccine ""experimentally approved"" — a claim that has also been debunked by medical experts.
When sent questions about her council's motion, Mayor Kylie Boston said the council supported ""the role of SA Health in keeping our community safe"".
The Limestone Coast Local Government Association, made up of the seven councils in the region, also voted to write to state and federal health ministers about vaccines.
""The discussion on the floor at the meeting was that none of those present had any expertise in medical matters and can make no judgement on the efficacy or otherwise of vaccines,"" LCLGA president and Mount Gambier Mayor Lynette Martin said.
Lynette Martin said the LCLGA raised the matter as it was of concern ""to some members of the community"".  (ABC News: Isadora Bogle)
Naracoorte-Lucindale Council passed a motion after being presented with a petition signed by 25 residents.
Mayor Patrick Ross said the council was seeking ""assurances"" about vaccine safety, but denied his council was questioning official health bodies and was anti-vaccination.

""It has been said certainly by some of our councillors that we aren't medical experts, and have we gone and sought independent verifiable information? No, we haven't,"" he said.
""We just wish to ensure, by asking our politicians and people responsible for the health of the nation, that if there was some erring or if there was some doubt, then that doubt should be removed.""
Medical experts are concerned this year's flu season could be severe as flu vaccination rates fall.
A global outbreak of measles is also being blamed on falling childhood vaccination rates.
Professor Griffin said it was irresponsible for elected officials to promote vaccine misinformation in council chambers.
Professor Griffin said vaccine misinformation is leading to real consequences in the community.

""To be elected, there are certain skills and expertise those people must possess to do that and we should respect their ability to fulfil that role,"" he said.
""When it comes to health matters, we should exercise that same respect and get our advice from people with sufficient expertise to make comment.
""Australia is very lucky. We have an excellent healthcare system, a magnificent academic and university infrastructure where there are a lot of experts, and I think that's where we should try to get our information.""

Ms Bryant pushed through shin splints, chemical burns from tape, countless blisters, a trip to the hospital and more than a few tears en route from Adelaide to her hometown of Broken Hill.
The 28-year-old, who can barely get out of bed some days due to her endometriosis, ran to raise awareness of the disease which impacts one in seven women.
Temperatures in the 30s forced Ms Bryant to do much of her road running at night.
""It left us with only a seven-hour window to run in and all of those hours were in the dark,"" she said.

Ms Bryant was hospitalised on day four with dehydration and had a badly infected toenail, along with several other injuries, but carried on.
But after one too many near misses with road trains along the Barrier Highway, she decided to change plans.
""It was too close for my liking for sure,"" she said.
Instead, she opted to complete much of the last 170km on a treadmill, which she said provided a whole new challenge.
""The yellow wall at the pool YMCA and I are good friends at the moment,"" Ms Bryant joked.
Friends and family greeted Amber and Heath Bryant in Broken Hill. (ABC Broken Hill: Bill Ormonde)
Throughout it all, Ms Bryant's husband Heath Bryant was by her side almost every step of the way acting as support crew, physiotherapist, coach and occasional running partner.
""He is everything to me and every time I got sad, he was right there … I owe everything to him,"" she said, wiping away tears.
Despite some anxious moments, Mr Bryant said he always knew she had the drive and passion to get through.
""Even though [her body] is a bit worse for wear, her getting through is obviously a testament to her heart and mind,"" he said.
Throughout the run, Ms Bryant drew upon the messages of support from friends, family and strangers.
Her goal was to increase awareness and raise money for Endometriosis Australia — a disease she has struggled with since she was 16, but was only diagnosed with in April 2023.
""I gave up on myself for a long time … I just felt so invalidated,"" she said.

While one in seven women have endometriosis, it can still be difficult to accurately diagnose without surgery.
It is something staff at the University of Adelaide are hoping to change.
""We don't at this stage have a non-invasive technique which will diagnose everyone's endo,"" clinical sonographer Alison Deslandes said.
Ms Deslandes said their research was focused on creating tools to help health care professionals improve their ultrasound skills to better diagnose endometriosis.
Alison Deslandes is part of a group of researchers trying to better understand endometriosis. (ABC News: Carl Saville)
By improving the ability of clinicians to identify the disease, people like Ms Bryant will not have to wait a decade for a diagnosis.
""We're really hoping to expand some of that non-invasive diagnosis through not just imaging to diagnose the higher-stage disease but using some tech tools and AI to diagnose some of the lower-stage disease as well,"" Ms Deslandes said.
For Ms Bryant and her badly mangled feet, the nine-day run was about starting conversations, one step at a time.

Ambulance Service","For the past 11 years, Mike Breen has been attending emergencies in Tasmania's north.
He's not a paramedic, but one of Tasmania's 415 volunteer ambulance officers.
""We get a pager message giving us basic information about the job, and then sometimes you rock up and it'll be totally different to what you expect,"" he said.
Mike Breen coordinates the volunteer ambulance officer program in Beaconsfield, in northern Tasmania. (ABC News: Ashleigh Barraclough)
Mr Breen is based at the Beaconsfield Ambulance Station, where he coordinates the volunteer program.
""That could mean going to Westbury, Cressy, Georgetown. You never know where you're going to get sent,"" he said.
The Beaconsfield station is an example of the volunteer program working well, with 31 volunteers on the roster.
But the number of volunteer ambulance officers across the state and the amount of time they contribute has dropped off.
The Health and Community Services Union says it means paramedics in regional and rural areas sometimes have to transport a patient to hospital with no-one monitoring them in the back of the ambulance.
At the Beaconsfield station, some volunteers have contributed decades of service.
An honour board on the wall recognises those who have been in the program for more than 10 years.
""Lorraine Gardiner, on top of that list, has done in excess of 30 years of volunteering here,"" Mr Breen said.

One of those is Mike Jessup, who has spent 20 years in the program.
""I'll be taking the basic observations of the patient using various types of equipment, depending on what's required, and helping the paramedic from that perspective so they can concentrate on gathering all the relevant medical past history,"" Mr Jessup said.
Volunteers are all required to have an advanced first aid qualification and undergo online and in-person training each year. They also receive mental health support after responding to traumatic incidents.
Mr Jessup said volunteering with Ambulance Tasmania was a rewarding experience.

He said there were times when a paramedic was sick or late and he was the first responder.
""Through Ambulance Tasmania management, I have the authority to first respond to a case if deemed urgent and necessary,"" he said.
""I will be activated through our comms centre, and then paramedic backup will be organised to assist me on that case and they'll take over once they arrive.""

There are 11 ambulance stations around the state that are operated by volunteers only, including Flinders Island and King Island.
Volunteers help out at all stations outside the greater Hobart area, Launceston, Devonport, Burnie, Ulverstone, Latrobe and Wattle Hill.
But most volunteer shifts are not being covered.
Volunteers are Australia's invisible workforce … but many organisations are facing a reckoning as community stalwarts get older and are forced to take a step back.
The health department, which looks after Ambulance Tasmania, told the ABC 60 per cent of volunteer shifts are not filled.
""Volunteer shifts are filled based on local availability which can vary depending on location, time of year and number of active volunteers in the area,"" a spokesperson said.
The spokesperson said like other organisations around Australia, Ambulance Tasmania is seeing a decrease in the number of volunteers and number of hours people can contribute.
""This reflects broader decline in volunteering participation rates across Australia due to increased work, family, health and financial pressures, as well as changes within the service, such as the upgrading and conversion of some ambulance stations to full-time salaried models, which has naturally reduced opportunities for volunteer involvement in those areas,"" they said.
The Health and Community Services Union said Tasmania's reliance on volunteers meant paramedics were often attending emergencies on their own.
""When they're driving, there's nobody in the back of the van,"" HACSU state secretary Robbie Moore said.
Robbie Moore says the Tasmanian government should focus on recruiting more paramedics by offering better pay and conditions. (ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke)
In a statement, Ambulance Tasmania chief executive Jordan Emery said paramedics may be dispatched to emergency incidents as a single responder in accordance with relevant policies.
""In certain circumstances, additional ambulance resources will be dispatched to assist in the management of the incident,"" he said.
The union said relying on volunteers, who are not paid for their time and do not have the same training as paramedics, could be risky.
Mr Moore said the Tasmanian government should focus on recruiting more paramedics.
The health department said it was recruiting more volunteers and 78 new full-time paramedics.
It said there were currently 647 people employed as paramedics and communications centre staff.
The union is concerned about paramedics responding to emergencies by themselves in regional areas, without a volunteer or second paramedic. (

            )
Mr Moore said paramedic pay needed to increase to make Tasmania an attractive option.
""We're just about to go into bargaining, but if we don't get a decent offer, we could be the lowest paid within 12 months,"" he said.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-22/federal-election-2025-disability-issues/105165312,Three big disability issues the next government needs to address,,"Unlike the last election, issues around disability and the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) have barely rated a mention on the campaign trail.
People with disability feel they're living in limbo and want policymakers to outline a clear plan for the future.
On the eve of a new parliament, here are three priority areas advocates want addressed when the dust settles after polling day.
Do you have a story to share? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au
Disability Advocacy Network Australia CEO, El Gibbs, said the last five years had been ""a lot"" for people with disability.
There was the COVID-19 pandemic, when many in the community felt forgotten and devalued; the royal commission, which shed light on abuse and neglect over almost five harrowing years; and sweeping changes to the NDIS, which supercharged anxieties and left participants feeling like a political football.
In recent years, the royal commission was one of several inquiries that people with disability provided evidence for. (ABC News: Emma Machan)
Advocates say these events have combined to cause a huge loss of trust in governments and institutions.
""People with disability are not feeling heard or included in the decisions being made,"" Ms Gibbs said.
While there were high hopes for change three years ago when Labor returned to power after campaigning hard on disability, the CEO of Advocacy WA, Stu Schonell, said many people felt let down.

""Labor said … they were listening, that there'd be more co-design around disability policy. But what we've seen is the co-design was surface level,"" he said.

So, will the next government be able to regain trust and deliver more meaningful change?
""It will be really important for the next parliament to see people with disability for the whole of ourselves, not just in the narrow parts of us that use the NDIS or particular disability services,"" Gibbs says.
The NDIS has dramatically changed the lives of participants, many of whom are receiving vital supports for the first time.
But while the scheme now has 700,000 participants, that's still a fraction of the estimated 5.5 million people in Australia living with disability.
The 2023 NDIS review made it clear the states and territories had dropped the ball when the federal scheme began and needed to start doing more.
It proposed a new tier of services, called foundational supports, which are slated to roll out from mid-year — but there's little detail about what those will be and how they'll work
While last month's federal budget suggests an initial $364 million has been allocated, Mr Schonell said serious concerns around the rollout remained, especially in regional and remote communities, where Advocacy WA does most of its work.
""People are fearful that foundational supports are going to mean that NDIS plans are going to be either cut or people will be excluded,"" he said.
""The argument will be 'you can now access these non-existent foundational supports' — but we actually don't know what they'll be.""

With disability supports already thin on the ground outside metropolitan areas, Mr Schonell questioned how long it would be before foundational supports could be up and running there.
What do you need to know before you vote in the upcoming federal election? What would you ask the candidates? Have Your Say.
Ms Gibbs said it was imperative foundational supports were ""high on the list"" of priorities not just for the next federal minister, ""but for all states and territories"".
The NDIS and how much it costs is far from the only disability issue out there.
The unemployment rate for people with disability hasn't changed in three decades, nor has there been any meaningful increase to the Disability Support Pension (DSP), despite a 2022 Senate inquiry hearing ""overwhelming evidence"" the payment was inadequate.
Source: AIHW
There are also the extra challenges faced by people with disability in securing timely and non-discriminatory healthcare, reliable access to public transport, and affordable and accessible housing.
Mr Schonell said the latter was a particular issue in regional and rural areas.
He said the $525.65 per week DSP failed to or only just covered the median rent in many places across the country.
""We're seeing policies around home ownership for people who are employed, but we're not seeing ways of increasing housing supply and reducing demand, so rents come down and there are affordable properties for people living with disability.""

While some change is underway, there are still many unanswered questions and details to be fleshed out.
The community feels it has little to show for engaging in good faith with major inquiries — a painful process for those who bared their soul and relived trauma in the hope it would lead to change.

Advocates were ""devastated"" by the government's initial response to the royal commission last year. There was a real sense that it lacked urgency and impact.
There's so much more to living with disability than the NDIS — and advocates want the next government to understand that.
""The NDIS is a really big and significant government expense … but for people with disability, there are 11 per cent of us who get NDIS support, and that's an awful lot of other people who urgently need support,"" Ms Gibbs said.

The planned park is to be located on an A-class reserve near Western Australia's new $34 million children's hospice in Swanbourne, which is due to open at the end of the year.
A-Class classifications are used to protect areas of high conservation or high community value.
The project is being led by the Perth Children's Hospital Foundation and funded by community donors.

In March, the City of Nedlands made a submission objecting to the proposed parkland, saying it wanted to develop and maintain the area itself.
Mayor Fiona Argyle said on Monday the council was best-placed to manage the development.
Fiona Argyle said council would this week vote on a proposal to build its own nature parkland. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)
""Taking Class A reserve from the community into a private foundation does not work,"" she told ABC Radio Perth.
""This has a Whadjuk Noongar trail running through it, a 40,000-year Aboriginal trail, it is the only public access to the beach, and it is for all people.""
Cr Argyle said council would this week vote on a proposal to build a nature parkland of its own at the site.
""We want to be friends, we have the support of all the community in the area, and the community don't want to lose this park,"" she said.
A report estimates the council's project cost to be about $400,000.
The report suggests public donations could contribute to landscaping and ongoing maintenance costs.
Perth Children's Hospital Foundation chairman Ian Campbell said the council had ""totally neglected"" the reserve for decades and had missed its chance to develop it.
""We didn't really want the children, many of whom will be in the last days of their lives, looking out across that dust bowl,"" he said.

Mr Campbell said the foundation proposed to fund the construction of the park, and suggested to council it could pick up the responsibility of maintaining it.
""[The city] said 'we have no budget to maintain it',"" he told ABC Radio Perth.
""This land has been in their hands for 20 years and it is a disgrace. It hasn't been looked after at all.
""The government has lost faith in the City of Nedlands, and we've lost faith in them.""
He said the park would be open to the public at all times, not just hospice users.
Police Minister, and former environment minister, Reece Whitby said it was disappointing the dispute had yet to be resolved.
""That hospice is an important service for the most needy of children in their final hours and weeks and months.
Reece Whitby says he can't understand why council is still objecting to the plan. (ABC News: Lauren Smith)
""They need to be surrounded by peace and tranquillity and they need to be supported.""
Mr Whitby agreed that land parcel had been neglected, and said it was ""strange"" the City of Nedlands continued to object to the parkland.
""If the council is so concerned about it, why haven't they done something before now to beautify that area?"" he said.
""This is a good positive thing to do, it's the least we can do for those children.""
It's the latest in a series of debates about the project, with the city recently coming under fire over a digital billboard located on Stirling Highway which read ""Class A Reserves are for future generations. Hands Off.""
Suzy Sadler says the proposed new hospice is needed because terminally ill children should not have to spend their last days in a clinical setting like a hospital.
The billboard included the City of Nedlands logo, but was said to have come at no cost to ratepayers.
Four councillors voted against the wording of the statement, with Cr Argyle using her casting vote to determine the outcome.
Cr Argyle on Monday said she was not — and had never been — opposed to the hospice itself, and was only concerned about the adjacent land development.

COVID-19","The Victorian opposition says it's obtained evidence showing the Andrews Labor government's decision to enforce night curfews during the coronavirus pandemic was not based on health advice.
The government said it ""did what was needed to protect Victorians"" when it banned 5 million Melbourne residents from leaving their homes without authorisation between 8pm and 5am during lockdowns in 2020 and 2021.
Melbourne was the only Australian city to be placed under a COVID curfew, which coincided with the state government declaring a state of disaster due to outbreaks.
The Freedom of Information documents, seen by the ABC, reveal an email exchange between former chief health officer Brett Sutton and public health commander Dr Finn Romanes after the first curfew was announced in August 2020.
The curfew was imposed during stage four restrictions and banned people from being outdoors each night. (ABC News)
They reveal they did not propose the lockdown measure, although they did support the move.
"" … the idea of a curfew has not arisen from public health advice in the first instance,"" Dr Romanes wrote.
""In this way, the action of issuing a curfew is a mirror to the state of disaster and is not occurring on public health advice but is a decision taken by cabinet and announced today, as an important step in the response.""
In his response, Professor Sutton said ""there appears to be merit in it limiting opportunities for transmission, perhaps especially in high‐risk cohorts"".
The opposition's upper house leader, David Davis, has been involved in a five-year legal battle to access COVID lockdown documents.
He said the email exchange clearly showed it was Daniel Andrews and his cabinet — which included now premier Jacinta Allan — who made the decision to impose the restrictions, not the health experts.
David Davis says the email exchange shows the curfew was not based on health advice. (ABC News)
""What it shows is late in the afternoon, after — after — the curfew has been announced by Daniel Andrews at a press conference in the middle of the afternoon, Finn Romanes seeking approval from Brett Sutton to declare a curfew through the use of the Public Health and Wellbeing Act powers,"" Mr Davis said.
""Both powers require scientific decision-making, proper decision-making.
Mr Davis said the exchange contradicted Mr Andrews's repeated claims during the pandemic that his decisions and announcements were based on health advice.
""This is quite serious, in many respects, because of the huge impact of the curfew on businesses, on households, older people, young children,"" Mr Davis said.
The email exchange happened after the curfew was announced by then-premier Daniel Andrews.  (AAP: James Ross)
He said Jacinta Allan now needed to explain the Andrews cabinet's actions.
""The whole of Victoria was being controlled and run by a gang of eight,"" he said.
""She's the only one that remains and I think it's time for her to come clean on why this occurred.""
As a state of disaster is declared, sweeping new restrictions are imposed across Melbourne and regional Victoria will move to stage three restrictions from Thursday.
The government has released a statement saying it worked closely with public health experts on all of its COVID measures.
""We did what was needed to protect Victorians in the face of an unprecedented global pandemic,"" a government spokesperson said.
""As a part of the overall public health response to this once-in-a-100-year pandemic, and witnessing the severe impact overseas, the measures rolled out were necessary to protect all Victorians and save lives, especially the most vulnerable in our community.""",Unknown,Sun 20 Apr

Cricket","Scott Jones thought his sporting days were over when he was diagnosed with an eyesight disability at the age of 30.
Mr Jones was told he had Stargardt disease, a degenerative disease that has left him with less than five per cent vision.
But he found a new lease on life when he discovered blind cricket eight years later.
""People with a disability, they deal with their grief and loss of the life they had prior,"" Mr Jones said.
""You could sit at home and dwell on that or you could get out and meet some like-minded people to give you that lift.
""That show you there are things out there that you can do and achieve.""
Mr Jones went on to captain the NSW blind cricket side, winning multiple state titles.
He now runs a clinic teaching blind cricket, and was part of a recent exhibition match in Bathurst hoping to educate people with and without visual impairments about the sport.

There are three levels of visual impairment across the team, with four completely blind players required.
The rest of the side is made up of people with less than 10 per cent vision.
Players who are completely blind are supported by a runner between the wickets, while fielders are directed to the ball by teammates.
According to Vision Australia, more than 450,000 people are living with blindness or some form of vision impairment, with the vast majority not participating in sport.
""Overall only about three per cent of the blind community play sport,"" NSW Blind Cricket president Mark Eschbank said.
The Bathurst exhibition match was organised by Mr Jones, along with NSW Blind Cricket and and advocacy group Social Futures.

It was the second year in a row the match had been held in the city, with the aim of giving non-visually impaired people a greater understanding of living with a disability.
""They get a better understanding of the challenges that vision impaired people face,"" Mr Eschbank said.
For the past decade, the group has been running similar training programs in the Hunter and Central Coast region.
There are plans to expand it to more inland areas.

Mr Jones said the involvement of non-visually impaired people was crucial for breaking down stereotypes.

""A community that is aware will then include people with a disability instead of standing off.""

Ms Jenner was born with dwarfism and has experienced the benefits sport can have for children, having played hockey at school.
""My mother thought it's too dangerous … I am the height of a child now so I was a lot shorter then,"" Ms Jenner said.
""I didn't want to be left on the side, even at one point they said, 'Do you want to be the mascot?'
""I said 'No, I want to be out there with everyone else'.""
Ms Jenner said she became a defender.
""I was just as important as everyone else on the team which is so important that everyone else feels included,"" she said.
Mr Jones has run coaching clinics for thousands of children across the central coast and Hunter region.
He said creating greater awareness among kids about what it was like to have a disability was vital for improving inclusivity.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-20/paramedics-tv-show-filming-restrictions-in-wa-criticised/105189882,'Extraordinary spin': Censorship of filming at WA hospitals for TV show labelled dishonest,"Topic:
Health","WA Health Department directives restricting filming of hospital ramping for the TV show Paramedics have been labelled dishonest by the state opposition and a disservice to health workers and the public by doctors.
St John WA, the state government's contracted ambulance service, is currently filming with production company WTFN Entertainment for the coming seventh season of the 'real-life' show.
In a press release, St John WA states: ""This popular observational documentary, which airs on the Nine Network nationally, takes viewers behind the scenes as paramedics respond to emergency calls, showcasing the fast-paced, high pressure work of pre-hospital care"".
But a document outlining filming protocols and restrictions, sent by the Department of Health to WA public hospitals and seen by the ABC, has prompted concerns from the opposition and the Australian Medical Association WA (AMA WA), for what appears to be the department's ability to control what can and cannot be seen by the public.
WA's Health Department is forbidding use of vision showing ""perceived capacity constraints"" in hospitals. (ABC News)
Editing protocols include:
Filming protocols include:
In several previous episodes of Paramedics, filming continued once an ambulance reached a hospital, with vision of patient transfers sometimes aired.
Ramping refers to the time an ambulance spends waiting outside an emergency department, unable to transfer the patient to the hospital, meaning the patient remains in the care of the paramedics.
On Thursday, the AMA released its latest ambulance ramping report card, which has shown, in some states, ramping hours are double what they were five years ago.
Ambulance ramping in WA has increased this financial year. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)
While ramping hours in WA did drop in 2023-24 to 49,530 hours, they have since gone back up, with more than 50,300 hours already recorded in the nine months to the end of March this financial year.
AMA WA president Michael Page said he would ""hate to see excessive censorship by WA Health of what comes out of this filming"".
""I hope that there's no intervention from government that prevents the viewer from seeing the full picture of the state of our health system and the tough job that our paramedics do every day, as well as the work done by our doctors, our nurses and everyone else working in our health system,"" he said.
AMA WA president Michael Page says it's important the frustration faced by paramedics is seen. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)
""Paramedics do spend a lot of time waiting with patients on the ramp because they can't get their patients into the emergency department because we do not have enough hospital capacity.
""I hope that experience of paramedics is shown for what it is, which is a job [that] is occasionally frustrating.
""They're frustrated by the state of our public hospital system, the shortage of beds that causes them to have to wait outside hospitals rather than getting out and attending to the next patient in the community who needs their care.""
WA's Shadow Health Minister Libby Mettam slammed the government for the move.
""Ambulance ramping has become part and parcel of working as a paramedic under the Cook Labor Government, and for this government to issue such a directive on this program highlights a lack of transparency and accountability,"" she said.
Shadow Health Minister Libby Mettam has accused the government of dishonesty. (ABC News: Jake Sturmer)
""This directive is not only a disservice to WA patients, to health workers, to paramedics, but is also deeply dishonest for the government to issue such a directive during an ambulance ramping crisis.
""We've just had an election campaign. Health was not a priority. It is still not a priority.
""And it's extraordinary that this government is just continuing to try and spin their way out of what is a health crisis costing Western Australian patients lives.""
Both Dr Page and Ms Mettam called on the government to instead deal with the issue, something they said was not an ambulance problem but a hospital capacity problem.
Dr Page said planned upgrades to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and Royal Perth Hospital, which the government ran as election promises, were welcome, but not enough.
Many have promised solutions to Western Australia’s problem-plagued health system, but do any of these ideas have a chance of addressing the heart of the issue?
""We do need refurbishment of our ageing hospitals but in addition to that, we need hundreds if not thousands more hospital beds to cope with our ageing and growing population,"" he said.
In a statement, a WA government spokesperson said there were ""a number of complex contributing factors that contribute to ramping, and we are working hard to address the issue"".
""We have added more than 800 hospital beds to the system since 2021 — the equivalent of another Fiona Stanley Hospital. There are hundreds more in the pipeline.""
A spokesperson for St John WA said it was the only ambulance service in the country to publish daily data on ramping.
""We support transparency and believe the series (Paramedics) complements, rather than replaces, those efforts,"" the spokesperson said.
A WA Health spokesperson told the ABC the department did not have an agreement with the production company, but had prepared the filming protocols at the request of service providers, which run public hospitals.
The protocols were necessary, in part, to protect privacy and confidentiality as required under law, the spokesperson added.

The health minister, the department and St John WA were all asked if the protocols gave the department something akin to complete control over what could be aired.
The minister and the department did not answer the question, but St John said the query would need to be directed to the department.
St John also said it had an agreement with WTFN under which editorial control rested with the production company, but the ambulance service and other stakeholders were able to review the content to ""ensure it reflects operational, legal and reputational responsibilities"".
WTFN Entertainment did not respond to questions from the ABC about the protocols, including how they differed from seasons of the show filmed in other states.

""It gives her an ability to make a few choices and genuinely seem happy and engaged,"" Ms Hannigan said.
""Whereas everything else, apart from playing in the water … just seems to feel unfamiliar and strange.""
Annabelle was born with severe intellectual and physical disabilities.
She has frequent seizures, is visually impaired, non-verbal and has major developmental delays.
Annabelle Hannigan's mother says music makes the four-year-old happy and engaged. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)
When she was born, doctors didn't know what had caused Annabelle's disabilities.
They could only say it was an undiagnosed genetic condition.
""I think you can't help but question whether or not it's something that I did wrong in the pregnancy that meant that happened,"" Ms Hannigan says.
Doctors had been unable to tell Kiera Hannigan what had caused her daughter Annabelle's disabilities. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)
But last year Annabelle's parents got unexpected news.
British researchers, led by associate professor Nicky Whiffin at Oxford University's Big Data Institute, were conducting genome sequencing of DNA samples.
They were looking for patterns in the data to try to find DNA changes that caused rare diseases.
Dr Whiffin said her team had used a large UK genetics dataset, Genomics England, to support the research.
""[This is] a large DNA sequencing project based here in the UK which includes a large number of individuals with different rare disorders and also cancer and their full DNA sequence,"" Dr Whiffin said.
""Whilst doing that, a student in my team, Yuyang Chen, came across a specific variant in a very small gene called RNU4-2 that explains a large proportion of undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders.""
Oxford University researcher Nicky Whiffin led the team that discovered the RNU4-2 variant. (Supplied)
They immediately found the same variant in multiple DNA samples of people who were previously undiagnosed. They shared similar dysmorphic facial features and were characterised by the same kind of developmental delays.
""It was very, very clear, very quickly that we found something that was really important,"" Dr Whiffin said.
The team shared their findings with other genetic researchers around the world, who immediately uncovered hundreds of cases, including a number in Australia.
Dr Whiffin predicted there would be roughly 1,000 cases of what has been dubbed ReNU or ""ReNU syndrome"" in Australia alone.
So far around 30 cases have been confirmed nationally, including Annabelle in Melbourne.
Annabelle Hannigan's mother says the four-year-old ""lights up"" around music. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)
""We think there's probably about 100,000 individuals worldwide that have ReNU syndrome, and it explains about half a per cent of all neurodevelopmental disorders,"" Dr Whiffin said.
Maya Pinn from the support group ""Syndromes Without A Name"", or SWAN, said approximately half of all children with neurodevelopmental disorders would not have a diagnosis in their lifetime.
She said 50 per cent would also receive a misdiagnosis.
Maya Pinn says around half of children with neurodevelopmental disorders won't have a diagnosis.

""Having a 'SWAN' child impacts every single part of your life,"" she said. ""You feel like you're in limbo land, it's like trying to hit a piñata with a blindfold on.""
""You're hitting everything but the piñata and you don't know where to go next.""
Adelaide woman Sarah Warwick was resigned to never knowing what had caused her 16-year-old daughter Abbey's disabilities.
""It was very, very lonely,"" she said. ""You have to develop a whole lot of resilience and determination to keep going, because often there's no clear path.""

Ms Warwick said she tried connecting with other families with children with special needs, but nothing was specific to her experience.
""They were getting diagnoses and they found their people and their community, and we never had that,"" she said.
Abbey was one of the first to be diagnosed in Australia, after Dr Whiffin contacted fellow researcher Daniel MacArthur at the Centre for Population Genomics in Sydney — a joint project between the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and the Garvan Institute of Medical Research.
After getting the call from an excited Dr Whiffin, Professor MacArthur asked the head of the centre's rare diseases team to screen their patient database for the RNU4-2 mutation.
""Within 20 minutes he was able to come back and say, 'we have now found six families with diagnoses involving exactly that same gene',"" Professor MacArthur said.
Professor Daniel MacArthur says the discovery of the RNU4-2 mutation should allow children to be diagnosed soon after birth. (ABC News: Liam Patrick)
He said the discovery had already changed clinical practice worldwide.
""If there is a new child who's born that has a developmental disorder and they're given DNA sequencing, we should now pick this up as a matter of course and they should get a diagnosis very quickly,"" he said.
The next step is towards treatments, but while Professor MacArthur conceded this could be difficult, he remained hopeful of further breakthroughs.
""There are at least two pharmaceutical companies that are actively pursuing potential therapeutics for this disease,"" he said.
""That means there's a pretty good chance that patients with ReNU syndrome around the world at some point over the next five years will actually have access to treatments that could reduce or even substantially reduce the impact.""
Dr Whiffin is slightly more circumspect.
""I'm very hopeful that there'll be a quick route towards a treatment, but hesitant to promise too much, because there's a lot of challenges on that road,"" she said.
For Sarah Warwick, the most important part of the discovery was knowing she wasn't alone.
""It was just absolutely amazing to see pictures of photos of children who really resembled Abbey and who had similar facial features, similar challenges, both medical and developmentally,"" she says.
After years without answers, Sarah Warwick has started a support group for families of children with ReNU syndrome. (ABC News: Stephen Opie)
""There's overwhelm, there's kind of elation that you've got an answer that you didn't think that you'd get,"" she said tearfully.
Ms Warwick started a Facebook group called the ReNU Syndrome Family Support Network (Australia) and is travelling to Long Island in New York later this year for the first global conference on the disease.
She said her new network had been invaluable.
""It was just really nice to find people who had trod a similar path to us and look at things that had worked for their families and talk to people who really got it,"" she said.
She said the diagnosis had also provided reassurance for the rest of Abbey's family.
""Our son is now at the same level of risk factor for having a baby with a disability as the general population. Those results were profound for me almost immediately on that first phone call to our geneticist.""
Kiera Hannigan said she had resolved any notion that she might have contributed to her daughter's disability.
""You can really set that aside and know that it's a mutation, and lots of different mutations can happen when a baby is growing,"" she said.
Kiera Hannigan says the discovery has dispelled her fears that she may have done something to cause Annabelle's disabilities. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)
""It's something called 'de novo', which means it really just happens by chance. It doesn't happen because it's been inherited somewhere from anyone in the family.""
But she is also pragmatic about Annabelle's future.
""We understood that she had a genetic condition that would be lifelong but you are always trying to get your head around what your life will look like. That's the hardest part to comprehend,"" she said.
Dr Whiffin described the discovery as a ""once-in-a-career-type achievement"".

COVID-19","The Trump administration has relaunched COVID-19 health websites, blaming the origins of the coronavirus on a lab leak in China and criticising former president Joe Biden.
Websites such as Covid.gov and Covidtests.gov were formerly government-run websites where Americans could receive information on long COVID, vaccine options and testing resources.
But as of Friday local time, the administration redirected those seeking out the websites to information critical of former top US health official Anthony Fauci and the World Health Organization — favouring a laboratory leak theory.
""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2 publication — which was used repeatedly by public health officials and the media to discredit the lab leak theory — was prompted by Dr. Fauci to push the preferred narrative that COVID-19 originated naturally,"" Trump's revamped website read.
COVID-19 health guidelines could no longer be found on the redirected site.

In 2023, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the US government has not reached a definitive conclusion and consensus on the pandemic's origins.
Beijing has said there was no credibility to claims that a laboratory leak likely caused the pandemic.
The website was also critical of steps like social distancing, mask mandates and lockdowns.
The revamp is the latest from the Trump administration — who has been scrapping government health websites to remove information such as statistics on HIV among transgender people.
Dr Fauci, Mr Biden and the WHO had no immediate comment.
Soon after taking office, Mr Trump said that Dr Fauci, who has faced threats since leading the country's COVID-19 response, should hire his own security and ended US security for him.

US President Donald Trump has also began a 12-month process of withdrawing the US — by far the WHO's largest financial backer — from the agency when he took office in January.
The website revamp reflects The White House's position that a laboratory leak theory is the “confirmable truth.”
In January, the CIA also said it assessed COVID-19 is ""more likely"" to have emerged from a lab rather than from nature.
The CIA notes it has ""low confidence"" in its assessment and maintains its occurrence in nature also remains plausible.
Those findings, however, were made in ""low confidence"" and the organisation added both scenarios — lab origin and natural origin — remain plausible.
China's government says it supports and has taken part in research to determine COVID-19's origin, and has accused Washington of politicising the matter, especially because of efforts by US intelligence agencies to investigate.

He saw a gap in the local market and decided to start a business doing the job no-one else wanted to do.

Blayde's mum, Kieran Day, said her son had so many requests for bin cleaning he decided to give back to the local community by sponsoring the Tom Price drive-in cinema.

""Five hours before, I'll cut all my liquids off so I won't drink anything between 7'o'clock and midday, but I'll get up early to make sure I can drink two or three litres of water.""
As young people increasingly shift away from alcohol, some pub owners say they have had to make changes to their core business.
Helen Corliss is the operations manager of the Grand Hotel in Childers, one of the first stops on Judge's eating tour.

The hotel has been running regular eating challenges for about a year.
""I think it's just a bit of fun … you know cost of living pressures and everything that's going on in Australia, people when they do come out to dinner, they just want to come out and have a big meal.""
From 1kg steaks to a ""full boar"" rack of ribs and triple-stack burgers, punters must beat a time limit to eat certain meals free at the pub.
Ms Corliss said there had been a ""generational shift"" in drinking behaviours.
""We've always had the core market of the guys that come in after work, or the guys that sit there all day on a Saturday and have a pint or have a drink,"" she said.
""The younger generation are just not like that.
Mr Judge said his road trip, which will be documented on social media, was also a bid to challenge himself.
""I've really struggled in the past with a lot of my own mental health battles,"" he said.
""This is something that absolutely terrifies me to go out and be by myself for so long on the road.

Sexually Transmitted Diseases","Over the last three decades, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have quietly but steadily climbed in Australia, with bacterial diseases like chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and syphilis spreading across the country.
In 2004, just over 35,724 new cases of chlamydia were recorded in Australia, according to federal government data. By 2024, that figure had roughly tripled to more than 102,000 notifications, with infections spread roughly evenly across men and women.
""When we look at these data, we can see that chlamydia continues to be the most frequently notified sexually transmissible infection,"" said Skye McGregor, an epidemiologist with UNSW's Kirby Institute, leading its Australian STI and bloodborne virus surveillance reporting.
Gonorrhoea and syphilis have followed a similar trajectory.
Annual confirmed cases of the former had risen from 7,047 in 2004 to more than 44,000 in 2024.
Syphilis numbers climbed by almost ninefold to 5,969 over the same period.
The last three decades have seen persistent growth in sexually transmitted infections, including the bacterial disease syphilis. (Flickr: NIAID)
While these infections can be treated with antibiotics and lack the harm potential of other sexual diseases like HIV, they present serious health consequences if they remain undetected, including infertility, congenital transmission and, in the case of syphilis, organ damage.
Those first-line treatments are also at risk of soon becoming ineffective, with antimicrobial resistance an expanding global issue.
Last year, NSW Health issued a public warning of how gonorrhoea cases resistant to azithromycin and ceftriaxone were growing in the state.
""It makes infections harder to treat, which increases the risk of transmission, illness and even death,"" Dr McGregor said.
Though the rise of bacterial STIs is well-documented — observed by health workers in the country and overseas — exactly why it's happening is something more complex and opaque.
While specific populations — including men who have sex with men (MSM) — have long been associated with higher risk, the current data indicates these diseases are proliferating across age, gender and sexuality demographics.
""There's a range of factors. We can't just point to one thing and go, 'This is the main reason we're seeing an increase in STIs',"" Dr McGregor said.
One suspected reason for an increase in cases is a decline in safe sex, a trend partially influenced by medical innovation. (ABC News:  James Hancock)
Included in that range of factors are the asymptomatic nature of these bacterial diseases, declining condom use and the unintended impacts of medical innovation.
Research has found the widespread availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication that prevents HIV infection, has contributed to more unprotected sex.
The most immediate solution to all of this is also the most basic: Safer sexual practices alongside regular, proactive sexual health screenings.
""It's really important to have the message of regular, comprehensive testing,"" Dr McGregor said.
But despite that message's simplicity, enacting that change is difficult.
One explanation held by Dr McGregor is the lack of awareness of diseases like chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis alongside infection risk factors.
Skye McGregor said prevention campaigns, at the scale of those targeting HIV and Hepatitis C, could raise awareness. (ABC News: Andrew Whitington)
This blind spot, she said, stems in part from years of underinvestment, with few public health campaigns and research efforts matching the scale of those targeting HIV or Hepatitis C — diseases where infection rates have dropped in recent years.
""It's complex, but if you take into account where the reductions have been, there's a reason for it.""
While greater investment in prevention initiatives could raise the necessary awareness, other experts say strategies targeting the full spectrum of those at risk are as crucial.
""Traditionally we focused on what we call high-risk populations: MSM and Indigenous and so on. But maybe that's not the only group that needs all these resources poured into,"" Melbourne Sexual Health Centre's Jason Ong said.
It's something the sexual health physician and researcher has observed firsthand. In recent years, the number of people seeking screenings has increased. Yet, infection numbers are still continuing to rise.
""If you're testing more people, why aren't the STI rates dropping? And so that's also part of that story where, maybe, we're not testing the right populations,"" he said.
""Within certain groups, we know definitely there are people that are not testing.""
The lack of testing may come down to awareness, but it could also be deliberate avoidance. It's long been established how the stigma surrounding STIs can dissuade someone from seeking medical care.
One reason why people aren't receiving sexual health screenings is due to perceived stigma. (Pixabay)
In 2021, Professor Ong co-authored a meta-analysis on what encourages young people from high-income countries to seek STI testing. Both limited awareness and stigma were named as key deterrents.
""If we can address that stigma piece, I think that will help a lot so that people can feel comfortable to talk to a doctor about it — and get the proper testing and treatments if needed.""
But stigma isn't the only barrier to receiving sexual healthcare. The decline of bulk-billing practices within a cost-of-living crisis is keeping people away, too.
""It's now expensive for people to go to the GP,"" said David Lewis, the conjoint professor of the University of Sydney's Sydney Medical School and a sexual health physician in the city's western suburbs.
""You can do health promotion, but if you don't make the testing easily accessible for people, then it's a challenge.""
One workaround could be importing the strategies embraced for other sexual diseases.
At-home rapid tests for HIV have been available in Australia since 2019, with a pilot program providing free access in NSW launched last year.
While the equivalent technology for STIs faces questions over accuracy alongside limited accessibility — the first TGA-approved at-home kit for chlamydia and gonorrhoea relies on a vaginal swab sample — this model of private, instant healthcare could be a blueprint for increasing screening rates.
""There's all these other bits of the puzzle. It's not just a question of promotion and education."" Professor Lewis said.
""It's very hard to shift sexual risk. What programs are successful in doing is often changing health-seeking behaviour,"" said Burnet Institute's head of public health Mark Stoové.
Australia's leading sexual health experts say taking an antibiotic after unprotected sex could help curb rising rates of syphilis in the community, but there's a big catch.
This use of new approaches that centre availability, accessibility and less visibility could be one way forward to circumnavigate those hurdles to testing and sexual healthcare.
Pointing to the introduction of point-of-care testing and telehealth in response to HIV and Hepatitis C, Professor Stoové said similar adaptive models of care would — when combined with targeted education and public health messaging — close gaps in testing, in turn lowering infection rates.
Any response, he added, needs to be tailored to meet the needs of wherever people are — whether that be financially, culturally, socially or geographically.
""Particularly in the space of sexual health education, if we're putting a campaign out there, people need to recognise that the campaign is speaking to them.""",Sam Nichols,Sat 19 Apr

Men","Jack had heard a lot about the invite-only social media group Blokes Advice when he decided to apply to become a member. The group pitches itself as a place men can go for support when life gets hard and is affiliated with Better Bloke Project, a men's mental health charity.
But Blokes Advice has also been accused of harbouring a culture of toxic masculinity. It didn't take long for Jack to experience the group's dark side firsthand.
When Jack was accepted into the group, he found all members were required to post a photo of a woman they rated a ""10"" for attractiveness before asking a question on the chat. He noticed the thread sometimes contained comments that were misogynistic and degrading towards women.
The internet is awash with examples of ""toxic masculinity"". But could the term, and its overuse, actually be causing more harm than good?
""It's like objectifying women as a starting point before asking you for your advice,"" Jack said, using a pseudonym to protect his privacy.
When another member asked why feminist social media influencers were criticising the group, Jack spoke up. He posted that the group appeared to be ""a bit misogynistic"" and added the poster would probably benefit from listening to the women's concerns ""and take it on"".
That's when the harassment started. Jack was called ""A c**k soy boy"" and a ""soap box c**k fake female rights crusader"".
""I was told to go and transition because we don't want you here,"" Jack said. ""It was going all day. I felt distressed and left the chat that day"".
Jack says he was contacted privately by one of the group's moderators who acknowledged the responses were wrong but did not intervene further or remove the comments.
Better Bloke Project, its associated podcast and the separate Blokes Advice Facebook page has long been accused of refusing to take down comments objectifying women, advocating homophobia, racism, transphobia and encouraging photos of women to be posted without their consent. It has also been accused of failing to provide appropriate support to the men who approach the group for help.
In February, the podcast associated with Better Bloke Project was criticised when an episode titled ""Rob's got a BIG tip for the women"" advised ""If you want to hear what a man really thinks shut the f**k up"" to allow men to work on their mental health.
Running a local men's group has brought Hayden Esparon a lot of job satisfaction. It's also helped him through some difficult times.
It is not the first time the organisation – that has openly endorsed influencer Andrew Tate who describes himself as a misogynist and is being investigated over allegations of rape and human trafficking – has been linked to misogynistic statements.
In 2016 an earlier version of the Facebook page Blokes Advice, at that time with 200,000 members, was shut down for allowing comments that advocated violence against women, including rape.
Just months later a new incarnation of Blokes Advice was up and running. The current version is a private and invite-only Facebook page that accepts men only and now has 305,000 members. While not part of the Better Bloke Project charity, it remains a key part of it's outreach program and helps identify men in need of mental health support.
Better Bloke Project co-founder Matthew Rogers, who says he sold his house to fund the charity and took a financial stake in the separate Blokes Advice chat group in 2022, told the ABC that while the charity focused on community events, seminars and workplace training designed to end male suicide, the goal of the Facebook page was to facilitate conversations.
""By gaining control, I have been able to start shifting the tone of the group towards a more positive direction,"" he says. ""As I'm sure anyone can appreciate, changing the culture of 500 000 people is not an overnight job, but the difference between today's group and that of the 20-teens is a stark difference.""
The tone of the comments referred to as sexist, misogynistic or homophobic was ""said in humour"" Rogers says, and was ""not meant to be hateful"".
""Whether people deem it to be funny or not is subjective,"" he argues. ""We have men and women of all races and sexualities engaging with it. I understand this can be controversial but Blokes Advice exists in the same respect as a comedy club or any number of programs that can be found on Netflix.""
Jack says he did not find the comments directed at him humorous, or harmless.
The motivation for the charity is admirable. The website says Better Bloke Project ""provides the tools, resources, funding and community to address the root causes"" of suicide among Australian men. While the organisation does not claim to have mental health qualifications, Rogers say it does aim to speak to a demographic of men with a disproportional likelihood of taking their own life. Men are three times more likely than women to take their lives.
""Better Bloke is not a last-resort charity like Lifeline or Beyond Blue, but an organisation built to equip men with the tools to better themselves, destigmatise mental health, healthcare, while making them feel less alone by sharing the stories of others,"" Rogers says.
But Dr Lauren Rosewarne, a gender studies expert at the University of Melbourne, says despite their appearance on the surface groups like this are ""sometimes more about reasserting male supremacy and blaming women as opposed to actually tackling what's going on in men's mental health"".
""Suicide rates are too high … so there's an air of legitimacy that makes these groups attractive to young men,"" she says. ""The problem is that vehicle of disenchanted young men makes them susceptible to easy answers and those easy answers are often that women are the problem, that women's equality is the problem, and that we need to stamp out that.""
Rosewarne says similar groups have existed for decades alongside the rise of feminism, but the arrival of social media has facilitated connection between groups with the same mindset and expanded their reach and impact.
""That's where these ideas become not only individually toxic, but toxic in terms of the creation and expansion of toxic communities,"" she says.
Most of us have tussled online with internet trolls but did you know that trolling has its roots in Ancient Greece?
Professor Braden Hill, deputy vice chancellor of Edith Cowan University and a specialist in issues of equality and inclusion, is a critic of the group.
""My concern is that it normalises trashing all sorts of marginalised communities,"" he says.
As a gay man himself, Hill says the content is not fair and he does not share Rogers' view that it is harmless humour.
""So you victimised us but now you want us to focus on you being the victims in a mental health crisis? That's not fair,"" he says. ""Whereas if you are much more open-minded and inclusive we could be there with you but the view on being a bloke is not about having compassion for other communities and that is the problem.""
Women's safety advocate Mia Findlay,  says she was threatened after criticising the group's culture with an anonymous member posting ""better hope I don't track you down"".
""Come and pull this guy into line,"" Findlay said in a video directed to the Better Bloke Project's founders Rogers, Rob Sutherland and Brock Paulke.
""This anonymous account has spent the whole day defending (Better Bloke Project) and is now threatening women. You guys are the better blokes, right? … Send a direct message to your followers that you abhor (this), you reject it.""
As social media algorithms push a harmful image of masculinity to teenage boys, a ""healthier"" men's movement is stepping up.
Findlay asked Rogers, Sutherland and Paulke to come onto her podcast to discuss mental health and women's safety. The men only agreed if Findlay travelled to Queensland to meet them — offering to pay for her flights and accommodation.
Findlay refused. ""It was made clear the only way they would have this conversation about women's safety and men's mental health was if I went to a different state totally under their control,"" she claimed.
Findlay recently lost a defamation case against her after accusing a Sydney student of finding rape and assault hilarious.
Rogers says the group wanted the meeting in person because he distrusted Findlay not to edit the interview and ""put words into my mouth"".
Despite the controversy, some members endorse the charity and have said the group has provided brotherhood and a sense of belonging during hardship. For others, it's been the first place they have felt truly supported and heard.
A great deal of the comments on Blokes Advice are intelligent and supportive of those who post their troubles.
Yet the group also has a track record of being ineffective at assisting all of its members, with tragic consequences.
Men are reporting high-level loneliness. These experts are trying to understand why.
In March, one man ended his life - according to an Instagram post from Rogers - after approaching the Blokes Advice chat group and posting that he was ""finding it hard to smile and go on"" and ""The black dog is real"".
Some replies to his post were supportive: ""Reaching out will make you stronger and show that even complete strangers care about you,"" wrote one. ""Give me a message mate. Happy to have a chat. Been right through it brother. I'm happy to support you in any manner. Got your back,"" wrote another.
While others were harmful: ""Only a coward checks out. Chin up and fkn get on with it"".
Some members of Blokes Advice have criticised the tone of the comments in the chat and a perceived lack of effective assistance, claiming the poster could not have been clearer in asking for help.
After receiving scrutiny, Blokes Advice began adding links to mental health support services and crisis hotlines. Rogers also claims the charity arm makes direct contact with some posters flagged as in distress via the chat group and works with professionals including psychologists, trauma nurses, men's coaches and nutritionists. The avenues for accessing this assistance were not clear to the ABC.
Rogers agrees it is an ongoing responsibility.
""There are frameworks in place for identifying at-risk individuals, how to communicate with them and when to seek external help,"" Rogers says, noting he recently called police to perform a welfare check and has followed up for advice from police and mental health experts on how the charity would better support those approaching for help with suicidal ideation.
Dr Zac Seidler, global director of research at Movember, a widely respected men's health charity, says it is important not to pin blame on any organisation.
""I think it's really important to consider how complex men's mental health is. Providing a community (for support) is really important for lots of guys.""
Studies show social connectedness leads to better health outcomes for men. Jack and Richard's lifelong friendship offers a masterclass in the power of mateship.
But Seidler says allowing comments that put down others will increase feelings of shame and disconnection.
""Promoting misogyny and sexism is disgusting and it's not aligned with how we make progress for men and boys,"" he says. ""It's crap if you are speaking to an Aussie bloke and you can't give them straight to the point clinical advice.""
He is worried some groups are giving men advice about mental health without any qualifications.
The standard of assistance expected from Better Bloke Project is higher than a simple chat room or podcast because the organisation is a charity, registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission. This can blur the lines between the charity - Better Bloke Project - and its affiliated podcast, and the chat group, Blokes Advice.
A spokesperson from the Commission says safeguarding is part of a charity's primary duty of care.
""Safeguarding is protecting the welfare and human rights of people that are connected with a charity or its work,"" the spokesperson said. ""Charities should use social media responsibly in line with public expectations.""
Watching Adolescence with my son made me realise the reality of the school kids in the show is the shared reality of our own child.
Natalie Djuric, another online commentator, was so concerned by her perceptions of the charity she has set up a Change.org petition calling for an investigation into the Better Bloke Project's conduct and practises.
Djuric claims the organisation contradicts its constitution — which states it aims to control abusive behaviour and prevent substance abuse and suicide. She argues Blokes Advice has gone too far in supporting alcohol use as a social lubricant and has failed to implement appropriate escalation processes or emergency strategies to handle individuals in crisis.
Rogers says: ""We didn’t and wouldn’t, claim alcohol is a cure for anything but you can find peer reviewed studies pointing to social benefits, although not in the case of severely mentally unwell individuals. We have had very lengthy discussions many, many on addiction and the detriments of using alcohol as a coping strategy.""
Even though Better Bloke Project and Blokes Advice are separate entities, Djuric believes their relationship is troubling.
""A charity must be held to a high standard of conduct, service and transparency,"" Djuric's Change.org petition says. ""Therefore, we call for a full, impartial investigation into the practises of the Better Bloke Project Limited.""

Diseases and Disorders","A case of the serious Japanese encephalitis virus has been recorded in a Central Queensland pig, two months after the virus was detected in piggeries in the state's south-east.
Queensland Health on Friday confirmed the case in the Banana Shire Council area was the first time the disease had been detected in a pig in Central Queensland.
Mosquitoes contract JEV when they bite infected pigs or wading birds, and it's then spread to humans through mosquito bites from the infected insects.
Mosquitoes can pass JEV onto humans.
While not everyone infected with JEV will get sick, it can cause serious illness or death in some people.
Chief Health Officer Dr Heidi Carroll said the new detection in Central Queensland highlighted the fact that greater mosquito populations were likely carrying the virus across the state.
She urged eligible Queenslanders to get vaccinated against the infection, which is free for at-risk areas.
The Imojev vaccine is available for eligible population groups, like piggery workers. (ABC News)
""Some of the areas where JEV has been detected this year were already known to be a risk for JEV due to detections in previous years, and communities in these regions were already eligible for a free JEV vaccine,"" she said.
Biosecurity Queensland issued an alert in February when JEV was detected at two southern Queensland piggeries, but did not provide specific locations.
It was the first detection of JEV in animals in Queensland since July 2022.
In March, JEV was detected in Brisbane for the first time, in the riverside suburb of Hemmant.
In the following days, a man from Bowen was being treated for the virus at the Mackay Base Hospital where he later died.
He was the third Queensland case diagnosed with JEV this year, and the second person to die from complications related to the infection in the state's reported history.
Queenslanders are urged to take precautions to protect themselves after several mosquito-borne diseases were detected in the state in 2025 — including JEV, Ross River virus, dengue fever and Murray Valley encephalitis.
""People heading out into the outdoors this Easter break, such as going camping or bushwalking, are particularly encouraged to take measures against mosquito bites — especially if they're spending any time outdoors at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.""
Dr Carroll is encouraging vaccination. (Supplied)
Applying effective insect repellents, wearing long and loose-fitting clothing, covering up with socks and closed-in footwear, using insecticide sprays, and using proper mosquito screens when camping can all help prevent bites.
""Vaccination is recommended for people at increased risk of exposure to the virus,"" Dr Carroll advised.
""We are encouraging anyone who lives or works in an identified at-risk area, and who are at risk of mosquito bites, to get vaccinated.""
Piggery workers, people living near or visiting piggeries, transport workers, veterinarians or others involved in the care of pigs are also eligible for the JEV vaccine.",VBy Vanessa Jarrett,Fri 18 Apr

Autism Spectrum Disorder","According to his mum, 12-year-old Dustin Neilsen is ""just a normal bush kid"" who likes to be outside with his pet dogs, build with Lego and play his electric guitar.
This year he should have started year 7 at boarding school, but his family has had difficulty finding one that will accommodate his needs.
Dustin has autism and despite trying to coordinate a plan with schools and therapists, his parents have been turned down by two schools and told by another to wait 12 months.
""We just want them to give him a chance, and that's probably the thing that concerns us the most is people don't give him a chance,"" his mother Melissa Neilsen said.
Homeschooling was the only option because the family lives on a cattle farm more than an hour from the closest high school near Hughenden, 400 kilometres inland from Townsville in north-west Queensland.
""We feel like if he stays home, he's not going to get exposed to any of those social things and the older he gets, the more reclusive he may become,"" Ms Neilsen said.
The Neilsens live on a cattle farm near Hughenden, which leaves Dustin with little choice but to attend a boarding school. (ABC Rural: Brooke Tindall)
Dustin took part in a two-day boarding school experience with a Townsville school last year but the Neilsens were told he could not be accommodated at the dormitory at that time.
The school told the ABC it worked with the Neilsen family for months to assess Dustin's needs and determined he was not ready.
In a statement, the school said the boarding management team and the school's leadership team were not confident Dustin had the capacity to live communally and there were concerns for his safety and that of the other students.
""The school did not deny the child a position in boarding due to autism,"" the statement read.
""A decision was made to postpone the offer of a position in boarding for 12 months due to the child not being considered adequately successfully ready to enter a communal environment.""

Ms Neilsen believes the two-day experience did not give Dustin enough time to adjust to the boarding routine.
""He definitely would need time to adjust and adapt, but he has more supports than any other person,"" she said.
The Hughenden branch of the Isolated Children's Parents' Association (ICPA) is taking Dustin's story to its state conference in June.
ICPA president Wendy Henning said she was aware of many cases where families had opted to do high schooling at home because a boarding school could not accommodate their needs.
""We are very aware of the increasing numbers of neurodivergent children throughout Queensland and the need for education, regardless of where they're getting it, to be able to facilitate various learners,"" she said.

Autism Awareness Australia chief executive Nicole Rogerson said the situation highlighted the need for schools to consider inclusivity in their dormitories.
""Ideally schools would already have this issue on their radar and be planning for it,"" she said.

""This isn't about creating special accommodations,"" she said.
Melissa Neilsen says Dustin is ""a normal bush kid"". (ABC Rural: Brooke Tindall)
The Queensland Department of Education said state schools with boarding facilities could make reasonable adjustments to support the individual needs of neurodivergent students and all students with disabilities.

Older People","Mavis Rofe adored her job as a school crossing supervisor.
For 12 years, the 86-year-old helped children get safely across the road to school in the Central Victorian city of Bendigo.
It gave her life, energy and a reason to get out of bed in the morning.
""I loved my job and felt motivated, seeing the kids every day,"" she said.
But after jarring her knee in an incident in March 2023, her employer, the City of Greater Bendigo, started to have doubts about whether Ms Rofe was physically up to the job.
In the end, they sacked her.
It was news Ms Rofe refused to accept.
She took her fight to the Fair Work Commission in April last year, and this month it ruled her dismissal was procedurally unfair and harsh.
Ms Rofe was awarded just shy of $2,400 compensation in a ruling that criticised the behaviour of the local council.
""I was determined they weren't getting away with it,"" Ms Rofe said.
Mavis Rofe had been recognised for her many years of service. (ABC Central Victoria: Sarah Lawrence)
Ms Rofe was sacked after a medical assessment arranged by the council's insurer found her unfit to return to work.
It contradicted a report from Ms Rofe's physiotherapist who had given her the green light.
However, getting her hands on the report that explained why she had been sacked was easier said than done.
The Fair Work Commission criticised the council's conduct, including its repeated refusal to give Ms Rofe a copy of its insurer's medical report before or at the time of her sacking.
Her lawyer was forced to lodge a Freedom of Information request to obtain it, something Fair Work commissioner Susie Allison described as ""unfair and harsh"".
Mavis Rofe was a crossing supervisor at St Therese's Primary School in Kennington. (Facebook)
""It seems incredible to me that Ms Rofe had to go through a FOI process to access a medical report that was fundamental to the council's decision to terminate her,"" Ms Allison said in her ruling.
Ms Rofe took the matter to the commission, claiming it was ""harsh, unjust and unreasonable"", and that the council did not give her a reason as to why she was sacked or the chance to respond to it.
Georgia Walker, who took on Ms Rofe's case pro bono, said she was angered by her client's treatment.
""Unfairly dismissing someone who was a pillar of the community — at 84 years old — it was deplorable,"" she said.
""To be told, 'Thanks for coming, don't come Monday', was really upsetting for Mavis.
""All she wanted was a fair go and the respect she deserved.""
Mavis Rofe was represented for free by lawyer Georgia Walker. (ABC Central Victoria: Sarah Lawrence)
Ms Allison described Ms Rofe as someone deeply committed to her work who was loved by the school community.
Ms Rofe said the forced break had been ""horrible"" and had taken a mental and physical toll.
Ms Walker said the job had given Ms Rofe independence and joy.
""The kids would run up and give her a hug,"" she said.
The Fair Work hearing determined the council had a valid reason for termination, based on ""her inability to perform the inherent requirements of the role safely"".
Lynn Englert has helped two generations of primary school-aged students cross the road to and from school over almost three decades.
It stated, however, that the council's failure to adequately notify her of the reasons she was sacked, or give her the chance to respond, meant the sacking was procedurally unfair and harsh.
The commissioner noted that even if Ms Rofe had been given the time to weigh up and respond with medical evidence, it was unlikely she would have been deemed fit for the position.
""On the evidence before me, I am of the view that it is highly improbable that Ms Rofe would have obtained medical evidence that she could perform the inherent requirements of the role at the time of termination,"" Ms Allison's ruling said.
The City of Greater Bendigo declined to answer questions about the matter, but in a written statement to the ABC said it accepted the commission's ruling.
""Throughout the process, the city provided support to ensure Ms Rofe was not financially disadvantaged, which was acknowledged by the Fair Work Commission,"" the statement read.
""The city also maintained equitable procedures in handling the matter. We thank Ms Rofe for her service and wish her well.""
Ms Rofe said due to hip and shoulder injuries, she now spent her days doing physio, watching television and seeing family.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-18/ai-chatbots-therapists-how-it-works-versus-seeing-a-psychologist/105139252,How artificial intelligence is driving a new wave of self-help bots,,"AI chatbots like ChatGPT have quickly become embedded in modern life, and Australians aren't just using them for menial tasks.
Increasingly, people are turning to AI to help them process thoughts and emotions too.
Their lifelike ability to answer questions, engage in conversations and integrate into intimate spaces is driving a new wave of self-help bots.
And while they are gaining popularity — particularly among young people — experts have made clear such technology has its limits.
The idea of using computers to offer therapy is far older than modern understanding of AI technology.
Jessica Herrington, a creative technologist and a neuroscientist with the Australian National University, says therapeutic exploration of computers and AI dates as far back as 1956.
The development of the first chat bot, ELIZA, came about a decade later.

""ELIZA was developed to mimic a conversation between a patient and psychotherapist,"" she says.
""It was very much an algorithm that had set responses.""
But it also came off the back of an era when a more conversational model of psychiatry was developed.
""So, what we're doing today with it is actually very old in terms of an idea,"" she says.

RMIT University's Professor George Buchanan specialises in human-computer interaction within the health industry.
He explains how conversations with AI chatbots such as Chat GPT work.
""Chatbots try to predict word after word after word based on what they have been trained on,"" Dr Buchanan says.
""They don't actually understand what you're saying.
""They are just trying to guess what might be the next useful phrase to give.""
And in a therapeutic context, this gives rise to questions about AI's use in mental health.
A few years ago, Canadian computer science student Dennis Han struggled to access affordable therapy and started using ChatGPT to talk through his problems and feelings.
What he said were shortcomings in his country's system spurred him to design a program of his own with a colleague.

The result was Calmi, a chatbot that offers emotional support.
In less than a year, the bot racked up 100,000 active users worldwide, most of whom are between 16 to 24 years of age.
""I've been building this based on what I needed, and I think a lot of people my age relate to that,"" he said.
Catering to demand, Mr Han said the app he helped develop was a mash-up between research papers in the AI and mental health space, feedback from users and input from mental health professionals.
He said it solved ""a real problem"", though the company's website notes it is not a replacement for traditional therapy or treatment for diagnosed mental health conditions.
""Everyone deserves to get support in a way that works best for them,"" he said.
Experts say the human touch is irreplaceable, and apps like Mr Han's come with disclaimers that they are not meant to be used as a substitute for professional care.

Dr Herrington says there's context AI is unable to capture, which a therapist could from the moment a patient walks through their door.
""They can tell by the way you're walking, the way you're holding yourself, the way you're speaking, and all other sorts of unspoken body language, how you might be feeling or how you might be reacting,"" she says.
She adds that AI also doesn't know ""your biography, your story, or any sort of social context or support networks that you may or may not have.""
This same information is crucial for psychologists to work out an appropriate treatment strategy for their clients, explains RMIT University psychology senior lecturer, researcher and psychologist James Collett.
Therapy involves helping people understand their circumstances and challenge their ways of thinking.
While clients are ""treated as an equal partner in the treatment process"", Dr Collett says psychologists have to be ""really sensitive [in assessing whether] people are ready for that level of challenge … and be thinking when the right time is to say a specific thing or move on to a stage of intervention.""
""AI can certainly work to gather information, but it always needs to come down to the therapists' judgement as to a diagnosis,"" he says.
For that same reason, Dr Buchanan also stresses on how AI is not an appropriate tool for people in distress.
Especially for those who may have thoughts of physical harm or suicide, or are dealing with intense traumas.

Good days and bad days do not exist in AI's world, Dr Herrington says, so the absence of emotional states is one big advantage.
""You're always going to get the same sort of quality of response no matter what,"" says Dr Herrington.
There's also immediacy, which she believes can help bridge the gap seen in healthcare.
""You can ask a question at any time of the day or night, which is useful if you're unable to access a therapist at a certain time,"" Dr Herrington says.
""It could be something people use during long wait times or between appointments,"" which she believes could be ""life-saving"" for some people.
Furthermore, with mental health still stigmatised in many communities, Dr Buchanan says, an AI therapist would ""provide a degree of privacy"".
With costs out of the equation, he believes this service would appeal to ""people who are less wealthy and people who come from more conservative backgrounds"".
Dr Herrington believes the technology is here to stay, so there is merit in embracing AI, while recognising its shortcomings.
""The longer you work with AI, the more information it has to draw on for that particular conversation, eventually making it difficult for that AI to function,"" she says.
""You can work with a human therapist for 10 years, but you can't do that with ChatGPT.""
Despite this, Dr Collett finds scope for AI as a tool when set-up to support therapy.
Whether that's used in pre-program such as screening or post-program in helping someone ease out of seeing a psychologist.
An example Dr Collett provided is how AI can help with executing exercises about ""training, insight, and reflection"" such as ""challenging negative thoughts"".
As a former psychologist, Dr George Buchanan sees huge potential in AI for therapy if it is well-trained. (Supplied: Dr George Buchanan)
Echoing Dr Collett's vision, Dr Buchanan believes AI presents a good opportunity for improved quality of healthcare service but proper training is imperative on all fronts.
""It's not just about improving the AI, it's also about learning how to work with those tools better as well.""
""When used in the right context, with the right overall treatment plan, with the right method, it probably could work, but just picking it up off the shelf and hoping it will work is probably more risky"".

Reproductive Technology","Queensland Health has visited every Monash IVF clinic in the state since learning a Brisbane patient was mistakenly implanted with another woman's embryo.
The bungle, which the national fertility company has blamed on human error, is understood to have happened in 2023.
The patient gave birth to a baby who had no genetic link to her later that year.
Monash IVF discovered the mix-up in February this year after the birth parents asked to transfer their remaining embryos to another provider.
The company reported it to regulators, including ""voluntarily"" notifying Queensland Health — the state's assisted reproductive technology regulator under new laws passed last year.
The ABC understands early investigations suggested human error and a failure to follow processes were behind the Monash IVF mistake. (Supplied: Adobe)
The ABC understands Queensland Health representatives then visited Monash IVF clinics in the state to check policies and procedures.
A Queensland Health spokesperson said early investigations suggested human error and a failure to follow processes were behind the Monash IVF mistake, ""however we will await the findings of the independent review"".
Monash IVF has commissioned barrister Fiona McLeod SC to conduct that review.
The company reported it to regulators, including ""voluntarily"" notifying Queensland Health. (Supplied: Dr Elena Kontogianni)
A Monash IVF spokeswoman said on Thursday the initial investigation into the bungle found that ""despite strict laboratory safety protocols being in place, including multi-step identification processes, a human error was made"".
""Once [the review] is completed, we propose providing an update on the findings to key stakeholders and are committed to implementing all recommendations from the independent investigation,"" the statement said.
Sources say Queensland Health cannot regulate human error, and the mistake ""would not have been prevented"" if the new laws were in place when it happened.
The ABC asked the law firm representing the birth parents and child whether their clients were considering legal action.
The managing director said the firm had been instructed by its clients not to comment ""other than to confirm we act for the birth parents and child and our clients want privacy during this difficult time and will take all action to protect their confidentiality"".
The fertility company says human error led to a different patient's embryo being implanted.
High-profile cases, including a couple who accused Queensland Fertility Group of using the wrong sperm, prompted the state's health ombudsman to investigate the ""self-regulated"" sector in 2023.
Laws banning sex selection and records from being destroyed, as well as requiring records to be kept on sperm and egg donors, passed last September.
But other regulations under the legislation — including giving Queensland Health powers to issue improvement notices, put conditions on a provider's licence, or suspend or ban providers — will not take effect until September this year.
Regulations requiring IVF providers to report errors — like the implantation of the wrong embryo — to the regulator, will come in at the same time.
The Monash IVF share price has plummeted by a third since the company announced the embryo bungle last week, dropping from $1.08 to 72c at close of business on Thursday.

Healthcare Facilities","Some safety concerns at Sydney's troubled Northern Beaches Hospital have not been properly addressed, according to a damning report by the NSW auditor-general.
The report by auditor-general Bola Oyetunji revealed the hospital was not effectively delivering the best health services and clinical outcomes for the community.
It also found the hospital was not well integrated into the local health district and network, which was impacting patients in the area.
Northern Beaches Hospital is managed by private operator Healthscope in a public-private partnership with the NSW government.
The NSW auditor-general released the report into the hospital today. (ABC News)
The Minns government introduced legislation last month to ban all future public-private partnerships running acute care after the death of a toddler last year who was treated at Northern Beaches Hospital.
The report determined there was a risk the government would have to assume responsibility for the hospital earlier than 2038, when the current contract expires.
Toddler Joe Massa died at Sydney Children's Hospital after being treated at Northern Beaches Hospital. (Supplied)
The report found that the hospital failed to address safety risks with its electronic record system, which had been known since the hospital opened in 2018.
""The Northern Beaches Hospital has recorded concerning results for some hospital-acquired complications and has not taken sufficient actions to address some identified clinical safety risks,"" the report said.
It said the risk was realised during a serious adverse event in September 2024, a reference to the death of toddler Joe Massa after he was incorrectly triaged after presenting to the emergency department.
Leah Pitman and Dustin Atkinson say failings at Northern Beaches Hospital caused the death of their newborn baby Harper. This is their harrowing and heartbreaking story.
The two year old was kept waiting for two-and-a-half hours for a bed, despite a dangerously high heart rate and a severe loss of fluid.
An internal investigation found serious failures by the hospital's management, including wrongly triaging Joe as a less serious category of patient and failing to respond to requests from his parents to give him IV fluids.
He was transferred to Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick after suffering a cardiac arrest, where he died due to brain damage.
In February, Harper Atkinson was born unresponsive, almost an hour after an obstetrician at the hospital declared an immediate threat to the life of the mother or baby.
The baby died a day after an operating theatre was not ready for the mother, Leah Pitman, as it relied on an on-call system on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights.
Healthscope has said its on-call system meets all NSW Health and college of obstetricians guidelines.
The report found that while the hospital outperforms similar hospitals' emergency departments and elective surgery indicators, it had not always met its contractual targets and had recorded elevated rates of falls and birth trauma.

The report also revealed Healthscope approached the state government in November 2023, seeking to return the public portion to the state, citing insufficient funding, poor integration within the wider health network, and strained stakeholder relationships.
The government rejected the proposal in January 2024.
After the government's ban on public-private partnership hospitals last month, Healthscope said it was willing to talk about handing the hospital back to public control and said the model was ""no longer compatible"" with the state government's objectives.
Health Minister Ryan Park has defended a decision to reject the previous request and said a task force would examine the latest request.
""The taxpayers of NSW would have been hundreds of millions of dollars out of pocket,"" Mr Park said.
The report has made three recommendations, including that the hospital resolve safety and quality issues by December 2025.
It has urged the state government to consider whether the public-private model was appropriate for health care delivery, and said the operating model created tension between commercial and clinical outcomes.
Mr Park said the government would accept the report recommendations in full.
""It outlines and lays bare the problem with the privatisation of public hospital services here in New South Wales,"" Mr Park said.

In a statement, Healthscope said it agreed that the contractual arrangements with the NSW government underpinning the operation of the hospital were ""severely challenged"".
Healthscope rejected some of the findings, including that it had limited visibility over minor harm or near-miss incidents.
At a press conference ahead of the report's release, Premier Chris Minns said the government remained concerned about the privatisation of essential services.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-17/what-a-relationship-break-up-taught-me-about-being-a-woman/105151970,Why a break-up was the making of me,,"By the age of 24, I had been in a relationship for almost half my life.
This often shocks people, but at the time, I wouldn't have changed it for the world.
Being in a relationship all through my formative years meant that we grew up together and our identities formed interlinked. So how I saw myself was conjoined to how he saw me.
Of course, as young adults we had our ups and downs, but for the most part we were inseparable.
We spent all day at school together, drove our parents crazy talking all night on the phone, and then saw each other most weekends.
I knew growing up that I wasn't a typically feminine girl. I had always felt a bit ""too masculine"". I didn't wear a lot of make-up, I was fat, and I didn't fit Eurocentric beauty standards.
But when my boyfriend said I was beautiful, all those thoughts went away. I felt like the most gorgeous girl in the world.
By 19, I was working a job I loved and living in a house I owned (thanks to regional Tassie prices back then) with the love of my life. I thought I knew exactly how the rest of my life would go.
My parents split up when I was very young, and although I understood that it was for the best, it caused me to fixate on marriage. I wanted to feel true commitment. By 20, I was desperate to be a bride.
Getting married at 20 might sound young, but when you start dating in grade seven, you're ready to get to the next step!

Eventually, we got engaged. I was struggling with my physical and mental health at the time and it made me feel really ashamed about my body. I wished I was thinner, with a smaller nose and blonde hair.
I tried to push these thoughts aside because the love of my life had chosen me, which meant I was a woman worthy of love.
Skye Cusack threw herself into weight loss after doctors told her it would likely solve her mobility issues.
Then, when I was 24, our relationship ended very suddenly.
When we first broke up, I spent a long time in denial. We'd had small breaks before and I thought this was no different. We were like magnets, always drawn back to each other.
But I found out that he had feelings for someone else.
In response to this news, I did a very silly thing: I looked her up on Instagram.
She was taller, thinner and blonder than me.
As I looked at her photos, I thought: If that's what femininity looks like, what am I?
It took me right back to my old thought patterns; My nose, my stomach, my voice — it felt like everything about me was too big and too intense for a woman.
And now, without his reassurance, I struggled to get out of those patterns.
In my mind our relationship ended because I wasn't feminine enough.
It was hard continuing to live in our small regional city after the break-up. Everywhere reminded me of him and of us; going to the movies, walking in the park, and even going grocery shopping.
So I decided to move to Melbourne.
It was like another planet.
The distance from my relationship helped but, more importantly, the city's diversity was healing.
I saw women of all shapes, sizes and styles, and they were all so beautiful to me.
The definition of female became a lot more fluid in my mind, with room for movement and experimentation.

I realised that to call myself ugly or masculine was to say the same thing about my family members and community members that share my features.
I have the body and features of a mixed-race woman and this is something I am now learning to be proud of at 27.
Embracing myself has meant having the confidence to do things such as modelling for an Indigenous clothing brand. (Supplied: Skye Cusack)
I even started modelling for an Aboriginal-owned brand at a market runway event, something I never would have been confident enough to do before.
If I could go back and coach my 24-year-old self through the break-up, I would tell her to unsubscribe from Eurocentric beautiful standards.
I would also reassure her that this break-up was going to be the making of her.
The experience set me free of needing someone else's approval to feel like a woman.
It taught me there is no correct way to be feminine. You can wear a full face of make-up or none and you're still just as much of a woman, if that's how you choose to identify.
I am continuing to learn to be a proud woman of colour and embrace my unique femininity, tied now to my inner experience instead of the external validation of a partner.

Sports Organisations","Once a week, Bob Staff finds blessed relief from the pain and fatigue that has plagued him for the past seven years.
Like thousands of Australians, the 83-year-old has Parkinson's disease.
But when he plays ping pong every Monday afternoon in a modest Hervey Bay hall, Mr Staff feels as if he were a younger man again.
""As you play it, you forget about all your aches and pains,"" he said.
That's because the hand-eye coordination and quick reaction time featured in racquet sports such as ping pong and pickleball are helpful in reducing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Trevor Chong is an associate professor in cognitive neuroscience at Monash University and leads the Monash Cognitive Neurology Laboratory.
Trevor Chong says the unique features of ping pong make it particularly effective as a form of Parkinson's disease therapy. (Supplied: Trevor Chong)
He said that while many forms of exercise could help improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the unique features of ping pong made it particularly effective.
The sport's focus on balance, hand-eye coordination, and reaction time can reduce the tremors and rigidity commonly experienced by people with Parkinson's disease.
The quick thinking and strategic decision-making involved in playing ping pong can reduce the symptoms of cognitive impairment, including difficulty with memory, language, and spatial orientation.
""Last but not least, ping pong is an activity [that] often occurs in a group setting, and social interaction has been shown to significantly improve both cognition and mood,"" Dr Chong said.
Mr Staff is one of more than 150,000 people living with Parkinson's disease in Australia, making it the country's second-most common neurological disease after dementia.
And as the population ages, it is becoming increasingly common.
According to the World Health Organisation, Parkinson's disease is the world's fastest-growing neurological disorder.
Sporting groups for people living with Parkinson's disease have developed to help alleviate the symptoms of the disease through exercise. (ABC Wide Bay: James Taylor)
A Parkinson's Australia report estimates the number of people with the disease will triple over the next 25 years.
Helen Halford is the Australian coordinator for Ping Pong Parkinson, an international organisation promoting the sport as a form of therapy for the disease.
It has more than 300 branches in 25 countries, with the first Australian chapter opening last year in Hervey Bay, 300 kilometres north of Brisbane.
Ms Halford said the physical and mental health of the eight regular members, including Mr Staff, had improved since they took up a racquet.

Menopause","Claire O'Meara was in her late 40s when she started experiencing a range of symptoms that made her think she was ""dying of something really rare"".
Naturally fit, O'Meara, now 61, had spent most of her adult life as a physical training instructor in the Army.
On weekends, she ran half marathons for 'fun', while she represented the Defence Force in the national touch footy championships.
But almost overnight, O'Meara says she was ""stopped dead"" in her tracks.
""I had no motivation, and no energy,"" she explains.
""I would try to go for a run and everything hurt … I'd get to 500 metres and I was just exhausted, short of breath and puffing.""

But no matter how much she suffered, O'Meara continued ""flogging herself"", worried that she was putting on weight.
""All of a sudden I was like a bloated toadfish,"" she says.
""I'd weigh myself from one day to the next and my weight would fluctuate anywhere between two and five kilos because of the amount of fluid I was retaining.
Eventually, O'Meara made the call to see a doctor.
""I remember writing a list of all the things that were wrong with me and saying to my husband: 'I must be seriously sick.'""
O'Meara had recently moved to a farm in Bangalow, 20 minutes from Byron Bay. The GP she booked in to see was Dr Jane Reffell, an expert in women's health.

Dr Reffell told O'Meara she might be going through perimenopause, defined as the period of time leading up to your final period, and characterised by a range of hormonal changes.
But O'Meara remained in denial.
""Not for a second did I associate those symptoms with perimenopause,"" she says.
""I was like, 'no, no, I've always been young and fit and now you're telling me that I'm turning into an old woman?'""
It was the start of a steep learning curve for O'Meara, who admits she had ""never given any consideration"" to a chronically under-funded and under-researched time in women's lives.
""I just imagined that my periods would stop, which would be great,"" she says.
""I knew Mum used to get hot, sweaty and grumpy, but I thought that was probably it … I had very little awareness.""

20 years ago, Dr Reffell took the gamble to open a clinic dedicated to women's health in Bangalow, in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales.
Unsure if the demand would be there, she quickly filled her books, before, over time, she began seeing menopause patients exclusively.
""There's huge demand,"" she says.
""It's not like I advertise as a menopause doctor, so it's just word of mouth.
""What that shows is that women are talking [about menopause]… whereas 15-20 years ago, no-one talked about it.
""It was basically a taboo subject. A lot of women feel quite ashamed and embarrassed going through menopause, and many don't even realise what's happening.""
For two decades, Dr. Reffell has practised women's health in the northern NSW town of Bangalow. (Getty Images: Glen Pearson)
Dr Reffell says menopause can be defined one of two ways, with an average onset of 51.2 years, and a typical range of 45-55 years.
The first is the medical definition, in which menopause refers literally to your last period (the pause of the menses). This can be established once you have not had a period for at least one to two years.
The second definition, which Dr Reffell prefers, refers to the two to 10 year timeframe leading up to, and after, your final period (including peri- and post-menopause).
During this time, women experience a dramatic shift in the production of two key hormones, estrogen and progesterone.
As Dr Reffell explains, during the reproductive phase, women receive regular, cyclic and 'high' levels of estrogen monthly. They also experience a boost in their progesterone levels after ovulation.
Menopause can cause significant hormonal changes. However, 15-20% of women will not be affected by them. (WellFemme.com.au)
By contrast, menopause is defined by a ""withdrawal"" of estrogen, and the decline of progesterone, which can lead to wide-ranging symptoms.
""The body really has to adjust, because you've got hormonal receptors all over the place, including the brain, gut, heart, joints and skin,"" Dr Reffell explains.
""That's why the range of menopause symptoms is so huge.""
In fact, the Australasian Menopause Society lists no fewer than 21 symptoms characteristic of menopause, including, but not limited to, those related to emotional health (such as mood changes, anxiety and depression) and physical symptoms (including muscle and joint pain, as well as fatigue).
""I often see women who have gone to their GP and been fobbed off, told it happens to everyone, not to worry about it, or 'you're too young, just stick it out,'"" Dr Reffell says.
""Often these changes are put down to depression and anxiety, and they're given anti-depressants, rather than having their hormonal changes addressed.
""Women can be feeling pretty bad by the time they come to see me.""
Dr Reffell says O'Meara's symptoms put her in the category of the 15-20 per cent of women who ""have a very hard time"" during menopause.
""It's important to remember that 15-20 per cent of patients don't have problems with menopause,"" she adds.
Another 60-70 per cent will experience some symptoms and may need strategies to deal with them.
But Dr Reffell says anyone affected should be seeking medical attention.
In O'Meara's case, her symptoms were so disruptive to her quality of life, Dr Reffell recommended Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT).
MHT, which can be taken as tablets, patches or gels, provides a low-level dose of hormones (usually a combination of estrogen and progesterone) and has been shown to safely and effectively improve menopausal symptoms.

In O'Meara's case, it was a 'game-changer'.
""I started to get better sleep, and as my sleep improved, so did other things,"" she says.
""I started to get my confidence back, and to feel better about myself.
""As my mind got a bit clearer, instead of being reactive, I was able to sort of think, 'OK. Let's think about this and how we can attack it.'""
Slowly but surely, she took up running again, trying to pace herself and adjusting her own high expectations.
""I had to learn not to be an all or nothing person, and that was really hard,"" O'Meara says.
She also took the time to think about her goals, re-visiting 'bucket list' items like completing a University degree and taking up triathlon.
Never one to do things by halves, O'Meara enrolled in an exercise science degree (with a research specialisation in sport and menopause) and joined a triathlon club in Byron Bay.

More recently, she has turned to IronMan triathlons, coming second in her age group in May last year, and qualifying for the World Championships in Nice.
While she acknowledges her transformation has been ""extreme"", she hopes others can take solace from her journey.
""You don't have to be doing triathlon or long distance marathons, but exercise is medicine,"" she says.
""It can be really, really hard to get up and out the door, but I used the rule of ten minutes. So I'd say, I have to go for ten minutes, and after ten minutes, if it's not working, then I can stop. But normally I find that after ten minutes, I'm feeling better, I'm in that zone, and that in turn benefits my mental health.
""It's important to find something you love, even if it's swing dancing, salsa or hiking… just do it, because you'll reap the benefits from it. And it's never too late to start.""

Dr Reffell agrees that menopause can be the perfect time to begin an exercise program if you have previously been inactive.
This is because the drop-off in estrogen can cause bone density changes (including increased bone loss), leading to a greater susceptibility to osteoporosis.
Look back at the advice from our panel of health experts on all your questions about perimenopause.
Menopause is also associated with loss of lean muscle mass, otherwise known as 'sarcopenia'.
""We know for your bones and muscles that it's really important you do some weights,"" she says.
""So we recommend strength training once or twice a week, but also 'impact' work like skipping, and improving your balance [which becomes an issue as you age].""
And for those who have been active, like O'Meara, Dr Reffell says it's important to continue exercising, while also being gentle with yourself.
""If you don't use it, you really will lose it after menopause,"" she says.
""You might not have the stamina that you had before, or the strength, and you might injure more easily, so it's about taking all those things into account and working with your body, but not stopping.",KBy Kate O'Halloran,Thu 17 Apr
https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2025-04-17/shingles-dementia-herpes-viruses-brain-pathogen-vaccine-protect/105156218,Shingles is not the only viral condition that can affect the brain,,"A recent study reported the best evidence to date that the shingles vaccine may have a protective effect against dementia.
Researchers found those who received the shingles vaccine were 20 per cent less likely to develop dementia over the next seven years than those who did not receive the vaccine.
A large ""natural experiment"" in Wales found a substantial drop in dementia risk for those who received the vaccine.
The exact mechanism behind this effect was unclear, but if confirmed, could make the shingles vaccine one of the most effective pharmacological interventions for dementia to date.
The virus that causes shingles is just one of a number of pathogens that may affect the brain, and which scientists are trying to understand.
While research into this field is ongoing, here's what we do — and don't — know about how some of these bugs impact the brain, including any potential links to dementia.
Most people are infected with the shingles virus — called varicella-zoster virus — in childhood, which leads to chicken pox.
As a species of herpes virus, it's highly contagious, and once you're infected, it never leaves your body.
Instead, according to Tony Cunningham, a virologist at the University of Sydney, it sits idle on the edges of your central nervous system, in an area called the sensory ganglia.
""These viruses are clever,"" he said.
In some cases, the virus reactivates — usually when people are older, have a weaker immune system, or during times of stress — causing shingles.
Rarely, the virus reactivates in the brain directly, causing a type of complication called varicella-zoster virus encephalitis.
But if something similar occurs in dementia cases, then the virus is infiltrating the brain in much subtler ways, Professor Cunningham said.
""[Researchers] have never really understood why every time you reactivate the virus in that ganglia, it doesn't go into the spinal cord and gets into the brain.""
But perhaps, as has been observed in mice, it does, he said.

More studies will need to be undertaken to determine if the effect is actually as strong as it appears in the new study, especially in other populations and locations around the world.
Heidi Welberry, a data scientist focusing on dementia at the University of New South Wales, said her team was now looking at an Australia-wide data set.
""We're hoping to access the National Health Data Hub, which is an integrated data asset led by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.
""It brings together a range of different data sets, things like hospitalisations and aged care data, which is really important for questions related to dementia,"" along with vaccination data, she added.
But with such strong indication that dementia could be connected to shingles, researchers are now looking at related viruses to see if they could also be linked to the brain condition.
Shingles is caused by varicella-zoster virus, one of many herpes viruses that humans have long learnt to coexist with.
According to Professor Cunningham, other types of herpes viruses could also be potentially linked to dementia.
Top of his list of suspects is the herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores and genital lesions.
""People have been very sceptical in the herpes virology field about the herpes simplex connection to dementia,"" he said.
""I think the issue about zoster and simplex is that both of them [lie dormant] very close to the spinal cord.
""It could be the same pathway.""
Other herpes viruses, such as Epstein-Barr and human cytomegalovirus, can infect the central nervous system and reactivate later in life.
Around 4 million Australians have had an STI, but dealing with the stigma can be 'a lonely battle'.
Epstein-Barr is the virus behind glandular fever, while cytomegalovirus has been linked to an increased risk of cancer.
These herpes viruses have all been shown to cause encephalitis, meningitis or other devastating diseases, but only in extremely rare cases.
The question is whether these other herpes viruses could be quietly getting into and slowly damaging the brain once reactivated.
Unfortunately studies looking at these viruses' potential effects on dementia are much more difficult to do until a vaccine is produced for other types of herpes.
While herpes viruses are some of the biggest suspects, other viruses can't be completely discounted.
According to Lynn Nazareth, a virologist at the CSIRO, there are a number of other ways that viruses can more directly infiltrate our brain.
Her work focused on viruses that can enter the brain via the nose, and has worked on the avian influenza, which has recently caused alarm around the world.
""In most humans, [the current strain of avian influenza] seems to be targeting the eyes over the respiratory system or the nervous system,"" she said.
""But with previous strains of the virus, we know that it can [infect the central nervous system] in animal models.""
Influenza virus can occasionally cause damage to the brain without needing to pass the blood-brain barrier. (Supplied: John Gallagher and Audray Harris/NIAID/CC BY 2.0)
For Dr Nazareth, noses are a particularly important point of brain entry for viruses, as it can allow them to bypass the blood-brain barrier.
""The nose is the shortest distance from the outside world to your brain.
""It doesn't happen that often … but it's one of the bypasses that a pathogen could use to get into the brain without the barrier.""
But viruses might not even need to enter the brain to cause damage. Even just being near it might be enough.
Seasonal influenza is a good example of this, according to Dr Nazareth.
Only in extremely rare cases has it been seen to infect the brain, but despite this, it can still cause brain inflammation.
""Even if the virus stays within your nose, there's inflammation there,"" she said.
The inflammation can causes immune signals to be released, which can cross into the brain and increase inflammation in the brain itself.
""The virus doesn't need to get in to cause disease,"" Dr Nazareth said.
While most research in this space focuses on viruses, inflammation can be caused by non-viral pathogens too.
Dr Welberry said there's some evidence that certain bacterial infections — particularly those close to the brain — could also be linked to dementia.
""Other areas of interest are around gum disease and the pathogens that cause that, and there's historically been a link between things like syphilis and dementia.
There are certain cases where bacteria can cause significant problems to the brain.
For instance, bacterial meningitis — when bacteria infect the membrane surrounding the brain — is rare but can be deadly if left untreated.
The shortest distance from the outside world to your brain is up your nose. While this is fantastic for detecting odours, it can also be deadly.
But according to Dr Nazareth, like in the case of influenza, even low-level inflammation close to the brain could potentially cause problems down the track.
""Long-term inflammation … can be one of the causes that lead to neurodegenerative diseases,"" Dr Nazareth said.
In gum disease, for instance, it's thought bacteria and inflammatory molecules travel from the site of infection to the brain to increase inflammation.
While these results are all preliminary, with no results quite as strong as the new shingles study, researchers feel they are now a step closer to unpicking at least some of the many causes of dementia.
""There's been a lot of interest in this area,"" Dr Welberry said.
""I think you're going to see more research looking specifically at these kinds of questions.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-17/trolls-internet-history-shakespeare/105174658,'Vicious trolling' took place long before the internet,"Topic:
History","Ever been called a ""stuffed cloak bag of guts""? Maybe you've been described as a ""badly bound hymn book"" instead?
The former comes from the William Shakespeare's play Henry IV, written at time when the literature great's reputation as a poetic troll was already widely recognised.
And the latter is how Oscar Wilde described one of his ""dreadfully dowdy"" characters in The Picture of Dorian Gray.
Many of us have had similarly negative experiences albeit with modern-day trolls — where a person deliberately tries to upset others online.
But according to David Rudrum, an English lecturer from the University of Huddersfield, some of the most vicious trolling took place long before the internet existed and can be traced as far back as ancient Greece.
Greek philosopher Diogenes roamed the streets with his lantern in broad daylight and told anyone who would listen that he was ""looking for an honest man"".
Diogenes enjoyed a good troll, proving it was common even in ancient Greece.  (Wikimedia Commons)
And the verse of ancient Greek poet Archilochus, who was said to rival Homer, was considered lewd and slanderous thanks to lines like ""With ankles that fat, it must be a girl.""
Archilochus is just one of the figures Rudrum examines in his book Trolling Before the Internet.
While trolling can be nasty and insulting, looking at it through the lens of literature and pulling it apart to see how it works, might put us in a better position to call it out, he says.
So if it's been around for this long, where did the term come from?
The term troll has its roots in two different origin stories, according to Rudrum.
""The earliest description of an encounter with a troll dates back many centuries, and it describes a kind of monstrous individual who ambushes a traveller late one night, waylays them with very aggressive questions, and demands that this traveller respond to those questions before they continue on their way,"" he tells ABC Radio National's Late Night Live.
From razor-sharp analysis of current events to the hottest debates in politics, science and culture, Late Night Live puts you in the big picture.
""So in this particular narrative, a troll is aggressive, is threatening and is demanding a response.""
Its other origin story comes from fishing and the act of trolling for fish, which entails dragging a fishing line behind a moving boat in the hopes of luring a fish.
""In this sense, trolling is literally getting somebody to rise to your bait. It's stringing them along. It's something deceptive,"" he says.
""And crucially, it doesn't name a person as a troll does. It names an activity that some people do for fun that other people think is kind of cruel.""
Some evidence suggests that the terms troll and trolling were used as early as the 1540s.
""I've come across a ballad printed at the time of the break from Roman England, which is all about the controversy surrounding the execution of Thomas Cromwell. And yeah, it's all about trolls and trolling. It uses those very terms. And I was kind of shocked by that,"" says Rudrum.
The Bard enjoyed trolling people with a bum joke, too. Here are some of his best:
So how did William Shakespeare become one of literature's original trolls?
The way the characters in Shakespeare's plays bait each other with insults is revealing, explains Rudrum.
""Shakespeare does this a lot. He does this in his comedies, where lovers often start by hurling insults at each other. Think of Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing and the Taming of the Shrew.
""The audience clearly like[d] it. So Shakespeare's plays, as they develop during the course of his career, include more and more slanging matches, which I find fascinating.""
The character of Falstaff from Henry IV is a classic example of Shakespearean trolling.
""[Falstaff is] obviously engaging in incredible, jaw-dropping insults. But he's also doing something else. He's often trolling in a more deceptive sense, more the angler's sense of trolling.
""In fact, he talks quite clearly about some of his victims as fish that he's trying to play along the line. So he does things like off-topic commenting, wilfully misunderstanding the purpose of the conversations that he's participating in, making up nonsense when it suits him to do so.
""And then, as the last resort, hurling vicious insults at anybody who tries to challenge him. And the thing is that when he's doing a lot of that, the audience are laughing at something that the other characters on the stage can't see, because they don't necessarily understand that they're being trolled.""
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?
Modern day trolling is often used to ridicule and poke fun at the establishment, too. It was also the case for a young Lord Byron back in the early 1800s, who began his career by specifically trolling the best-known poets of his day.
The poet Lord Byron enjoyed trolling the establishment, especially after his debut collection of poetry was panned by critics.  (Supplied)
Byron was only 19 years old when his first book of poems was panned by the literary establishment.
So what does a young 19-year-old lad who's achieved nothing do when his first efforts at making a name for himself are rubbished? He goes out of his way to lampoon and insult the very authorities that have snubbed him.
""[Lord Byron] is a poet who is constantly challenging and needling his readers, often by insulting their various sacred cows,"" explains Rudrum.
""Whether that's the famous celebrated British victory at the Battle of Waterloo or it's the poetry of the great William Wordsworth.
""There's something about the way that Byron and various other poets troll that is disruptive, that is transgressive, that is getting their readers' attention [and] usually doing so at other people's expense.
""And the thing that's so fascinating about it is that it's successful, it works. I don't know what that says about our culture, but it seems to be effective.""
Does this then make renowned wit, Oscar Wilde, our most elegant historical troller?
Oscar Wilde's one liners were witty but sometimes also brutal.  (Wikicommons)
""I think certainly if you want to troll, troll like Wilde. He's most famous for his one-liners,"" says Rudrum.
""'Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.' 'Work is the curse of the drinking classes' — those one-liners are all very contrarian, very provocative. They would have been, in some cases, quite shocking to his original Victorian audience.
""But they're also brief enough to fit into a tweet. And they turn conventional morality upside down and inside out and yet they are funny. And they remain funny.""
Lulz is a corruption of the common online term LOL and the name of a particular form of trolling that developed from American internet culture.
For international hacktivist group Anonymous, their regular trolling of institutions has become internet lore and their refrain ""for the Lulz"" is now commonplace.
Activist group Anonymous are notorious for hacking and trolling specific targets.  (Reuters: Peter Nicholls)
Not dissimilar to schadenfreude — the pleasure derived from another person's bad luck —  ""for the Lulz"" is a ""slippery term"" as trolls are as likely to laugh at themselves as they are at their victims, Rudrum says.
""Lulz is a very elusive term that is often used as a way of justifying why trolls troll. But it can also be very effective in the right hands.
""So I look at the way that writers like Jonathan Swift or Oscar Wilde or Emile Zola [or] Martin Luther weaponised these very skills to target a particular issue … and try to say something disruptive and transgressive that in some cases did have good progressive outcomes.""
In the case of Martin Luther, for some his trolling of the teachings of the Catholic Church created change for the better.
""Luther is kind of the first person in history to go viral. [Trolling] can be used in the service of a cause that some people might find was a worthy one.""
It's been calculated that at one point there was one pamphlet by Martin Luther in existence for every four people who spoke German, according to Rudrum.
Dr Karl knows the best app for free podcasts, radio, music, news and audiobooks … and you don't need to be a scientist to find it!
""Now, that's pretty extraordinary. And that doesn't count his books, and it doesn't count the runaway success of his German translation of the Bible.
""That's what I call going viral.""
The link between trolling and poor mental health has long been established.
Research from the University of Queensland earlier this year even found that internet trollers are also more likely to have latent psychopathic and sadistic traits.
So if you find yourself at the receiving end of trolling, the eSafety Commissioner has a few recommendations.
Don't feed the trolls, no matter how tempting it is to respond.
If the trolling is getting to you, take screenshots and recordings of the abusive comments, then report and block the troll in-app.
And if you find yourself feeling bad about what's happening online, talk to someone you trust or reach out for professional help through a counselling or support service.

Leeanne Gaskin, a registered nurse with the Epilepsy Centre in Adelaide, said people often did not talk openly about epilepsy.
""Being that it's so common, you'd think there'd be more information, and I think a lot of that is the fear and the myths and the misinformation,"" she said.
She said while epilepsy was not a mental illness, judgement and misinformation could contribute to significant mental distress among patients.
Advocates say epilepsy is more than just a seizure, with symptoms including migraines and memory loss. (ABC News: Justin Hewitson)
Ms Gaskin said long wait times to see a neurologist in South Australia were also concerning.
She said urgent referrals to see a neurologist had a two-to-three year wait in the public system, causing some people to ""slip through the cracks"".
""Even with some of the private neurologists it can be a two-year wait,"" she said.
Sarah Ripper, co-owner of an Australian ethical menstrual care company, was diagnosed with epilepsy eight years ago, and said the tagline should be ""epilepsy — it's more than seizures"".
""Until ... people have close interactions with people who have epilepsy or experience it themselves ... you perhaps don't understand that it really is more than just having a seizure,"" she said.
""And that seizures are more than just one kind of seizures, there are many types.""
Sarah Ripper says she had learnt a lot about herself since her epilepsy diagnosis. (Supplied: Curtis Rodda)
She said symptoms like migraine, memory loss, vomiting and fatigue following seizures, as well as adverse side effects of medication, had broad impacts on daily life.

Their warning comes after Cyclone Alfred last month resulted in the cancellation of more than 3,500 blood donation appointments in Queensland and NSW when 22 donor centres were closed for four days.
Researcher Elvina Viennet said the cyclone had an ""unprecedented impact"" on blood donations in Australia.
""Hospitals began stockpiling blood and donations from other states were urgently called in to avoid shortages,"" she told the ABC.
Cyclone Alfred resulted in the cancellation of more than 3,500 blood donation appointments in Queensland and NSW. (ABC News: Victoria Pengilley)
Dr Viennet is among a group of researchers from the University of the Sunshine Coast and Australian Red Cross Lifeblood who have predicted climate change will jeopardise world blood supplies, in an article published today in The Lancet Planetary Health.
""The increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires, pose substantial risks to human health and to the stability of the blood supply chain,"" the researchers wrote.
Gastro cases are on the rise in Australia, and experts say it's not the only illness people should look out for as the climate changes.
""These events can disrupt blood donation activities, compromise transportation and storage infrastructure, and exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases, thereby affecting both the sufficiency and efficiency of blood supplies.""
The researchers' work is believed to be the first to globally examine how climate change, including more severe weather events, could affect each stage of the blood supply chain.
Blood products are not only important for saving lives in emergencies, they are also used in many other areas of medicine, including surgery, to treat premature babies, and cancer patients.
Stagnant water left behind after Cyclone Alfred has become an ""excellent breeding site for mosquito populations"", researchers say. (ABC News: Jak Rowland)
Dr Viennet said stagnant water left behind after Cyclone Alfred had become an ""excellent breeding site for mosquito populations"", increasing the risk of diseases, such as Japanese encephalitis (JEV).
""This is a direct concern when ensuring a safe blood supply,"" she said, adding Lifeblood already had ""robust"" strategies in place to safeguard blood safety.
Young Australians are most at risk, according to new research by the University of Adelaide.
But other countries may not be as prepared as Australia.
The researchers also predicted climate change, including warmer temperatures, may increase the risk of infectious diseases that could be transmitted via blood in some regions, impacting donations.
""Simultaneously, the rising burden of climate-sensitive health conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disorders, and trauma-related injuries from extreme weather events, is expected to increase transfusion demand,"" they wrote.
Lead researcher Associate Professor Helen Faddy, of the University of the Sunshine Coast, forecast that increasing migration rates with rising sea levels could result in difficulties finding the right blood for some patients.
""It's essential to have more blood donors from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, and to increase the number of people who give blood,"" she said.
In an interview with the ABC, Dr Viennet said Australia was already taking steps to try and protect the blood supply from climate change.
Researcher Dr Elvina Viennet warns future blood supplies will be affected by weather events, such as fires and floods.   (Supplied)
""Lifeblood continues to expand mobile donation units and open new donor centres,"" she said.
""We are actively working to increase donations from diverse populations and encourage more frequent donations, particularly among younger Australians.
""By donating blood, especially regularly, Australians can help build a more resilient, lifesaving network that supports people in their most vulnerable moments. It's a small act of kindness that carries enormous impact.""
Global innovations to lessen the impact of climate change on blood supplies include the use of drones to transport blood when other transit is disrupted.

Air Transport Industry","The Australian Federal Police (AFP) are warning travellers in Darwin to behave after an increase in passengers too drunk to fly attending the city's airport.
Both the Darwin International Airport and the AFP have recorded a recent increase in ""obnoxious, abusive"" drunk passengers at the facility.
In the past 12 months, AFP officers have turned away 30 intoxicated travellers from the gate and been called to remove a further six passengers from planes.
Rob Porter, executive general manager of the Airport Development Group, which operates the Darwin Airport, said he anticipated the upcoming Easter holidays and peak tourism season could cause those numbers to rise.
The AFP will be increasing its presence near the airport's terminal gates and licensed bars. (ABC News: Lillian Rangiah)
""There's some really aggressive behaviour that's unacceptable at the airport, and for the safety of everybody who flies, we'd like to see that end,"" he said.
""We want you to come and have a great holiday, but we don't want those obnoxious, abusive behaviours.""
In response, AFP officers will be ramping up their presence near the terminal gates and licensed bars leading into the busy period.
While it may be easy to chalk up the over-intoxication to the Northern Territory's laid-back reputation, AFP Superintendent Greg Davis said he didn't believe that was the case.
Rather, he said drinking at the airport was a particular problem in Darwin because so many flights occurred overnight.
Sky-high airfares, poor flight times and unexpected scheduling changes have become standard in the NT capital of Darwin.
That means it isn't uncommon for holiday-makers to head straight from the city's pubs and clubs to the airport.
""Our observations are, particularly with the late-night flights, people have already been out — perhaps they're celebrating or [having] farewells with their family — then they come to the airport,"" he said.
Airline staff have the authority to prevent a passenger from boarding a plane, if they are overly intoxicated and unruly.
Once a person is on a plane, Superintendent Davis said it was an offence to disobey directions from the cabin crew.
Refusal to comply can result in fines and charges.
Greg Davis says late-night flights at Darwin Airport appear to be contributing to the rise in drunken behaviour. (ABC News: Lillian Rangiah)

Vaccines and Immunity","The number of babies having to be hospitalised in Queensland with respiratory illness is down nearly 70 per cent since a new vaccine was introduced last year.
One less infant, under the age of six months, was hospitalised each day following the release of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) shot, Queensland Health said.
It's predicted that figure will grow to three a day by the end of the year.
One baby per day is being saved from a trip to the hospital, as a result of the RSV vaccine. (ABC News: Michael Lloyd)
Still health services are reporting a spike in respiratory illnesses, months out from the peak of the flu season.
Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Heidi Carroll said Queensland's free RSV vaccination program had prevented 193 hospitalisations.
""Expectant mothers who receive the vaccine create antibodies that transfer to the developing baby, giving their little one incredible protection from the day they're born.
""That's why we're encouraging pregnant women to consider the RSV vaccine as well as the flu vaccine this winter.""
Pregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated against the flu and RSV. (ABC News: Michael Lloyd)
So far this year, more than 2,000 RSV cases and 300 hospitalisations were recorded in young children.
""In 2024, Queensland recorded 11,300 RSV cases among children under two, with more than 2,200 little ones hospitalised due to the virus,"" Dr Carroll said.
She said flu, RSV and COVID-19 infections were likely to increase as it gets cooler.
Queenslanders can protect themselves this flu season by getting vaccinated. (ABC News: Michael Lloyd)
""Vaccination is the best defence against winter viruses to stop the chain of transmission and prevent serious illness,"" she said.
""Already this year, we've recorded more than 13,600 cases of influenza.""
That represents a 35 per cent increase in the number of flu cases recorded, compared to this time last year.
In Queensland, 18 people have died from the flu in 2025.
""We don't want to see a repeat of last year when nearly 200 people died — many of whom were unvaccinated.""
In 2024, 7,021 people in Queensland were hospitalised with the flu and 79,785 total influenza cases were reported — up from 74,296 cases in 2023.
Most Queensland patients who died last year were over the age of 65, but 39 were between 30 and 65.
""Children under five and adults over 65 are among those most vulnerable to severe flu-related complications,"" Dr Carroll said.
Vaccines for the flu, RSV and COVID-19 are free in Queensland. (ABC News: Michael Lloyd)
Even if you got a flu shot last year, Dr Carroll said ""strains constantly evolve, and people's immunity reduces over time"" so it's important to vaccinate again this year.
""Taking 15 minutes out of the day to get vaccinated against the flu could prevent people from spending days or weeks at home sick, or worse, in a hospital bed,"" she said.
Dr Carroll said certain groups are more vulnerable to potentially life-threatening complications from respiratory illness.
""Pregnant women, and eligible infants and young children can be vaccinated for free against RSV.""
GP Dr Maria Boulton said it was important people didn't wait to get vaccinated.
More than 264,000 Queenslanders have already had the flu jab this year.
Dr Boulton said hospitals were ""already very strained"", explaining vaccination was the best way to avoid adding further pressure.
Doctors are already seeing a spike in sick patients, with experts predicting it'll get worse as Queensland heads into winter. (ABC News: Michael Lloyd)
""We are concerned that hospitals are already stretched,"" she said.
""To have a lot of people ending up in hospital, severely ill with viruses, does put [more] strain on the hospital system.""

Pregnancy and Childbirth","Harper Atkinson was a desperately wanted baby.
Conceived via IVF and due in February, even before she was born Harper was bringing joy to the lives of her parents Leah Pitman and Dustin Atkinson and her big brother Ziggy.
WARNING: This story contains details that some readers may find distressing.
""He had a pile of books picked out in his room, ready to read her when she arrived,"" Dustin told 7.30.
Leah had a healthy pregnancy, although the IVF conception meant she was at a slightly higher risk of a rare condition called placental abruption, where the placenta can separate from the uterus and endanger both the mother and baby.
On Friday, February 21, Leah was due to be induced at Sydney's Northern Beaches Hospital — the same hospital where Ziggy was born.
""I had a really positive, straightforward experience there,"" Leah said of Ziggy's birth.
""There was just no doubt in my mind to go up to Northern Beaches again and have her [Harper] there.""
Northern Beaches Hospital is run by private operator Healthscope in partnership with the NSW government, and was in the headlines at the time because of industrial action from staff and revelations about the death of two-year-old Joe Massa, who had been incorrectly triaged in its emergency department.
Leah remembers reading about Joe Massa's story while at the Northern Beaches Hospital.
""I was actually lying in bed being monitored — I was on my phone and saw the story pop up — and I just remember thinking, 'Oh, my God, those poor parents, that is so heart-wrenching', and not knowing what was to come that weekend for us.""
Leah says her son Ziggy was excited about becoming a big brother. (ABC News: Shaun Kingma)
Leah was sent home on the Friday because of staff shortages.
She returned to the hospital on Saturday after going into labour at home and arrived in the birthing suite at around 8.20pm. She had hoped to have a water birth and her midwife had drawn a bath.
Almost immediately, something felt wrong. Leah started experiencing extreme pain in her lower back. Cardiotocography (CTG) monitoring indicated some concerns about the baby's heart rate.
And then her waters broke.
""There was blood in my waters. And I just remember looking down at the floor and thinking, 'Oh God, is that normal?"" Leah said.
This was approximately 9.30pm. An obstetrician entered the room at about 10.30pm. He examined Leah and declared an obstetrics emergency, and told Leah he believed she was having a placental abruption.  He called a Category One caesarean section at 10.55pm.

Associate Professor Gino Pecoraro, president of the National Association of Specialist Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, says a placental abruption is ""an important diagnosis, because it carries great risk to both mother and baby, if it happens.""
""A category one is the most urgent (c-section), where there is a very real risk to the life of either mother or baby,"" Dr Pecorano told 7.30.
""This is an urgent caesarean section that needs to happen as soon as possible.""
A c-section needs to take place in an operating theatre. But after the ""Cat 1"" call was made for Leah, she remained in the birthing suite.
""Then we were left to wait,"" she said.
""I remember asking them, 'why aren't we moving, why aren't we going anywhere?' We were left in birthing suite, just standing there.
""They kept explaining, 'theatre's not ready. Theatre is not ready' And I just remember thinking 'OK, it must be busy'. There must be an operation happening at the moment.
""And then we've later learned there's no 24/7 theatre running.""
Leah and Dustin experienced an agonising wait before Harper was born. (ABC News: Shaun Kingma)
On Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, Northern Beaches Hospital staffs its operating theatre using an on-call arrangement. Theatre staff must be within 30 minutes of the hospital.
""Why is there no 24/7 theatre at a hospital that serves 350,000 people on the northern beaches?"" Leah asked.
""It just seems outrageous.""
Leah was on the operating table 33 minutes after the Category One call, and Harper was delivered at 11.52pm — 57 minutes after the original emergency call.
Harper was unresponsive and did not take her first spontaneous breath for another 21 minutes.
Dustin and Leah watched the operating room team's attempts to resuscitate their baby.

The next day Leah and Dustin were told Harper would not make it. They made the heartbreaking decision to turn off her life support
""We wanted her to just go in peace,"" Dustin told 7.30.
""I should be holding her for the rest of my life, not just once, once isn't enough.""
""It was just such a horrendous day,"" Leah said.
""She's been through so much, and she was just such a little trooper. We both just decided 'we we need to do what's right for her'. And we decided to take her off life support.""
They had four hours to hold Harper before she died.
""I was able to have my first proper skin-to-skin cuddle with her,"" Leah said.
""It was amazing, but also just heartbreaking at the same time, knowing that this was all I was going to have.
This is one of the only photos the family has of baby Harper. (ABC News: Shaun Kingma)
The Northern Beaches Hospital is conducting a review into Harper's death, but Leah and Dustin say the cause is obvious to them.
""Time delays,"" Leah said. ""Things weren't urgent enough.""
He said hospital staff told him during a debrief that it wasn't ""economically feasible"" to operate a 24/7 theatre.
The family also believe Harper would have had a greater chance of survival if Leah's placental abruption had been picked up earlier.
Leah said she was speaking to 7.30 because she does not want Harper's death to be ""just another sad story"".
The couple also wants Northern Beaches Hospital to be returned to public hands.
""I feel incredibly angry,""  Leah said.
""I'm obviously sad every single day that she's not here with us, but so much anger and frustration, knowing that she could be, and that her death, we feel, was completely avoidable.""
Leah grapples with a range of emotions after the loss of her daughter. (ABC News: Shaun Kingma)
In March, the NSW government introduced legislation banning future Public Private Partnerships for hospitals.
Health Minister Ryan Park and Treasurer Daniel Mookhey have announced a new Northern Beaches Hospital taskforce to examine the future of the private public partnership with Healthscope.
Healthscope told 7.30 that it extends its deepest sympathies and condolences to Leah and Dustin, but could not comment on anything specific because Harper's death is being reviewed.
In a statement, the company said:
""Northern Beaches Hospital operates with an overnight on-call theatre team on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, with the on-call team required to attend the hospital within 30 minutes to ensure any life-threatening surgery including obstetrics can be performed within the hour in line with NSW Health Policy; the obstetric cover at NBH also meets Royal Australian and NZ College of Obstetrician and Gynaecologist guidelines for emergency caesarean sections.""
Still, Leah and Dustin have been left to cope with the tragic loss of Harper and know they will always carry that with them.
""Harper was let down,"" Leah said.
""And we were let down as well, and it's not fair. We have to carry this for the rest of our lives, knowing that something could have been done to prevent this.""
Dustin treasures this fabric heart that his daughter Harper touched. (ABC News: Shaun Kingma)
Dustin draws strength from a small piece of heart-shaped fabric that touched his daughter during her short life. He gripped it tightly as he spoke to 7.30.
""This is the heart that they put on Harper … to allow her scent to get on it and to give to us to hold on to. So it means a lot to me,"" he said.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-16/australian-cafe-owner-canada-ordered-remove-vegemite-off-shelves/105182744,Australian PM backs cafe owner in Canada over Vegemite dispute with regulators,,"A seemingly simple jar of Vegemite has ignited a mini trade dispute between Australia and Canada.
An Australian-Canadian cafe owner was ordered from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) to remove Vegemite from its menu and shelves as it was non-compliant with local health regulations.
Leighton Walters shared his shock on Instagram, which has since gained traction around the world.
Here's why Mr Walters' Vegemite shipment didn't meet Canadian health requirements and what happens next.
According to the CFIA, Vegemite is not banned from Canada.
However, the reason the product was pulled from the cafe's menu is because the yeast-based spread was ""found to have added vitamins"", which goes against Canadian food regulations.
The specific vitamin in question was vitamin B.
Only certain products are permitted to be enriched with vitamins under Canada's Food and Drug Regulations, including cereals, certain milks, salt, pasta and white flour.
Spreads and condiments are not included on the list.
The CFIA told Canadian media outlet CBC that the ""formulation sold at the cafe does not meet Canadian requirements established by Health Canada"".
All Vegemite products are fortified with vitamin B, suggesting none should be sold in Canada.
However, in a video posted to his company's Instagram account, Mr Walters said the famous spread is still available to purchase at places including major grocery stores and online at Amazon Canada.
Bega, which owns Vegemite, said in a statement that the company was ""limited"" in its ability to change the CFIA's decision.
""After looking into it, we can confirm we do not currently export Vegemite to Canada for sale within Canada,"" they said.
""As such, we're not directly involved in or across the specific import regulations that apply — including those set by the CFIA.""
The ingredients listed on the back of a Vegemite jar are:
Under Canada's food regulations, spreads and condiments cannot be sold with added vitamins to ensure Canadians are not exceeding their daily diet requirements.
However, Mr Walters argued the Vitamin B content in Vegemite was ""mostly naturally occurring and incredibly good for you"".
""As someone born with a birth defect, this is deeply personal,"" he said.
""Vegemite is high in B vitamins and folate, that helps minimise the likelihood of babies being born with conditions like mine and living through the pain my family and I have throughout my life so far.""
Albanese backs Aussie cafe owner in Canada after Vegemite ban
Mr Walters was born with spina bifida, a birth defect that affects the development of a fetus' spine during pregnancy and can cause paralysis, scoliosis and neurological problems.
According to Health Direct, the recommended dietary intake of B3 (Niacin) is 16 milligrams for men and 14 milligrams for women, with the upper level at 35 milligrams a day.
With 2.5 milligrams of B3 per teaspoon of Vegemite, someone would have to eat 14 teaspoons — or one-third of a cup — of the spread to reach the upper threshold.
Marmite, a similar yeast-based spread produced in the UK, is also fortified with vitamins but is deemed compliant by the CFIA.
Mr Walters said he was ""absolutely floored"" by the agency's apparent double-standard.
In fact, in 2020, the CFIA issued a statement clarifying that Marmite was not banned for sale in Canada after a shipment was mistakenly rejected.
""These products have been available on Canadian store shelves for more than a decade and will continue to be sold in stores across Canada,"" the statement read.
Speaking with ABC News Breakfast, Mr Walters said he took the Vegemite off his shelves and menu to avoid any penalties.
But he is going to try his best to push back on the decision.
""Pulling Vegemite off our shelves hits at the core and the heart of our brand,"" he said.
""This is now a huge battle that I really didn't want to fight for the sake of $8,000 worth of Vegemite that we have left, but I want to fight for my business, I want to fight for being true to who we are and who I am.""
Mr Walters has also spoken to Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and has had the backing from a number of Australian expats in Canada.
Vegemite's long-standing cultural significance even prompted Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to weigh in.
""I stand with the Aussie cafe owner,"" Mr Albanese said in a press conference.
""I did hear the report on that, and it's rather odd they're letting Marmite in which is rubbish frankly.
""Pro-Vegemite, anti-Marmite, that's my position.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-16/gene-hackman-wife-researched-symptoms-of-illness/105181282,Gene Hackman's wife researched her rodent-borne disease days before death,"Topic:
Infectious Diseases","Authorities have released a lengthy investigation report detailing some of the last emails, phone calls and internet searches by Gene Hackman's wife in the days before her death, indicating that she was scouring for information on flu-like symptoms and breathing techniques.
Betsy Arakawa died in February of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome — a rare, rodent-borne disease that can lead to a range of symptoms that include flu-like illness, headaches, dizziness and severe respiratory distress, investigators have said.
Betsy Arakawa, wife of actor Gene Hackman, died of a hantavirus infection a full week before her husband. Medical experts have said it has a low mortality rate and was mostly spread by rodents.
Gene Hackman is believed to have died about a week later of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer's disease.
Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, were found in their Santa Fe home on February 26, when maintenance and security workers showed up at the property and alerted police.
According to the report released Tuesday, a review of Arakawa's computer showed she was actively researching medical conditions related to COVID-19 and flu-like symptoms between February 8 and the morning of February  12.
The searches included questions about whether COVID could cause dizziness or nosebleeds.
In an email to her massage therapist, she mentioned that Hackman had woken up on February 11 with flu or cold-like symptoms but that a COVID test was negative and she would have to reschedule her appointment for the next day ""out of an abundance of caution"".

Arakawa's search history also showed a query for a concierge medical service in Santa Fe the morning of February 12.
A review of her phone records by investigators showed she had a call with the service that lasted less than 2 minutes and missed a return call later that afternoon.
Investigators also reviewed a call history to the Hackmans' home phone along with voicemails and security footage from stores that Arakawa had visited on February 11.
Authorities also are expected to release more redacted police body camera footage from inside the home as sheriff's deputies and investigators tried to piece together what had happened to the couple.
The written report describes them going through rooms of the home and finding nothing out of the ordinary and no signs of forced entry.
They found paper grocery bags on the floor of the pantry.

Inside one bag was a Feb. 11 copy of the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper. They also documented a bag of bagels that had been opened, with part of the contents missing.
In the living room was a large piano and couches, according to the report. There were pillows on one couch as if someone had been sleeping there.
Investigators also described a collection of art, puzzles and drawing supplies in the dining room, and medical supplies such as bandages and tape in several kitchen drawers.
The materials were being released as the result of a recent court order that mandated any depictions of the deceased couple would have to be blocked from view.
All photos, video and documents from the investigation had been restricted from release by an earlier, temporary court order.

The Hackman estate and family members had sought to keep the records sealed to protect the family's constitutional right to privacy.
An attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer, argued during a hearing last month that the couple had taken great pains to stay out of the public light during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death.
The Associated Press, CBS News and CBS Studios intervened in the matter, saying in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple's bodies and would blur images to obscure them from other records.
An environmental assessment of the Hackman property conducted by the New Mexico Department of Health revealed rodent faeces in several outbuildings and live traps on the property.
Emma Heming Willis, whose husband Bruce Willis is living with dementia, has called for people to show more support for those in their lives caring for others.
The inside of the home was clean, with no evidence of rodent activity.
Nestled among the piñon and juniper hills overlooking Santa Fe, the Hackman home is not unlike others in the area as mice are common within the surrounding landscape.
One of the couple's three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs were found alive.
A state veterinary lab tied the dog's death to dehydration and starvation.

Drugs","A coronial inquest has heard how the bodies of four people were discovered following a mass nitazenes overdose at a Broadmeadows home last year.
Counsel Assisting, Susan Locke, described how the next-door neighbour of the Bicknell Court property, Cory Lewis, had first tried to raise the occupants at around 8pm on June 24, not knowing they had passed away 17 hours before.
Mr Lewis was the uncle of one of the victims, 17-year-old Abdul El Sayed, and thought two of the home's occupants, Michael Hodgkinson and Thomas Vale, had been taking methamphetamine over the weekend and may be sleeping off the effects.
Authorities did not gain access to the house until nearly a day after the four occupants had died. (ABC News)
Following a worried visit from a family friend and with still no answer at the door, Lewis retrieved a trumpet from his home and blew into it, before climbing a side fence, enabling him to see his nephew through a small gap in the rear kitchen window blind.
""Lewis observed Abdul sitting on the floor against the pantry with froth coming from his mouth,"" Ms Locke said.
He used a rubber mallet to break a window and found the bodies of his nephew, Mr Hodgkinson and Mr Vale, as well as Mr Vale's girlfriend, Carly Morse.
Police arrived shortly after 2am and found a small plate with a ""beige power"" on a kitchen counter.
""A rolled-up foreign currency note was located on a stool near the deceased, suggesting that the substance had been inhaled through their noses,"" Ms Locke said.
""It is believed that at around 3am, shortly after inhaling the beige substance, the four deceased died.""
Ms Locke said from Mr Hodgkinson's text messages, it was clear he thought he was purchasing MDMA and cocaine.
These messages included some on the encrypted messaging app Signal, on which Mr Hodgkinson had been communicating with someone using the username ""TryMe"" about purchasing the drugs the day before the deaths.

Mr Hodgkinson instead received a mixture of drugs, including fatal amounts of a form of nitazenes 100 times the strength of heroin.
Despite the lead, Ms Locke said police investigations had so far not resulted in any arrests.
Deaths from nitazenes, a highly potent synthetic opioid, appear to be increasing in Victoria.
Ms Locke presented a chart to the court which showed there were two deaths in 2021, five in 2022, nine in 2023, and seven in 2024.

Dimitri Gerostamoulos is the head of forensic science at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine, and gave evidence at the inquest.
He said the manufacture of nitazenes was driven by the opioid epidemic in the US, which was creating a market for the drugs even as it killed up to 90,000 Americans annually.
The nitazenes found to have caused the four deaths in Broadmeadows were estimated to be 100 times more potent than heroin.
""They can cause respiratory repression within minutes, leading to hypoxia, paralysis, seizures, and most often death,"" Professor Gerostamoulos said.
Dimitri Gerostamoulos says the detection of nitazenes remains a challenge. (Supplied: Monash University)
He painted a grim picture of the ability of authorities to detect and combat nitazenes, and outlined the threat they posed to first responders, with just a few grains able to cause overdoses.
""There is the potential for these drugs to be inhaled inadvertently,"" he said.
A statement from Michael Hodgkinson's sister recounted the physical, mental and emotional abuse her brother experienced between the ages of 4 and 14.
""He was in constant fight or flight mode because of his childhood,"" the statement said.
""I believe this is a reason he later on turned to drugs.""
Photos and a box of ashes are all Sue La Velle has after her son was found dead in a Melbourne home in June.
Despite this, she said her brother was someone who could ""make you laugh until your stomach hurt"".
In a statement to the inquest, Carly Morse's parents remembered her as a child with ""a great sense of humour and a kind heart"", who loved to pretend to be David Attenborough during bush walks.
Her parents said she ""became a victim of several tragic circumstances"" — first watching her grandfather die of pancreatic cancer, and then her niece from leukaemia.
Her parents expressed a wish for their daughter not to become ""another statistic"" and said she was a kind person who would help anyone who needed it.
Ten months on, no arrests have been made over the deaths. (ABC News)
In a tearful statement to the inquest, Abdul El Sayed's Aunt, Fatima El Sayed, said her nephew would not have taken the drugs if he had known they were laced with a deadly narcotic.
""He was not suicidal and had so much to live for.""
She hoped his death might carry a lesson for the community.
""He was in a lot of pain, and we know that that's ultimately the reason you turn to drugs, as a mechanism to cope.""",Unknown,Tue 15 Apr

Courts","The Victorian Coroners Court has found a toxic workplace culture at a hospital in the state's west contributed to a Ballarat woman taking her own life in 2019.
Warning: Readers are advised that this story contains references to suicide.
Karla Lee Jordan was working as an accountant in the finance department of the Ballarat Base Hospital when she died by suicide on August 29, 2019.
A coronial investigation found the 50-year-old mother of two was subjected to long-term workplace stress due to management and cultural issues within Ballarat Health Services (BHS), which operated the hospital.
The coroner noted it was concerning that a report into the health service's workplace culture had been completed three years before Ms Jordan's death.
Her husband told the inquest she ""generally enjoyed working as an accountant"" with BHS until a restructure within the finance department in August 2017.
Deputy State Coroner Paresa Antoniadis Spanos said Ms Jordan spoke to her husband about a number of workplace issues, including concerns she would lose her job, ""discomfort with the behaviour of management"" and concerns she was being singled out by her superiors.
Mr Jordan told the inquiry that in March 2019 his wife had been working until 3am most nights to ""catch up and get what she needed done"".
The report found Ms Jordan sought help from her doctor during this period and ""presented with anxiety in relation to her workplace"".
She also told the doctor she had experienced suicidal thoughts in the past and was prescribed sleeping tablets and given a medical certificate to take time off work.
The inquiry heard Ms Jordan's mental health continued to decline and she presented as erratic and paranoid when she was taken to hospital by ambulance in early 2019.
The coroner's report said she was discharged after showing signs of improvement and returned to work under a WorkCover plan in May that year.
The inquiry found that staff remembered Ms Jordan as appearing to be ""very fragile"" when she returned to work.
The coroner found Ms Jordan was assigned an ""excessively complex"" task when she returned to work. (ABC News: Darryl Torpy)
On August 27 a colleague attended a meeting with management and a health workers' union representative and reported that Ms Jordan was having ""dark thoughts"".
The inquiry heard that the following day, Ms Jordan was assigned a task that she found highly difficult, which caused her to break down in tears and say she was afraid to ask for assistance for fear she would be belittled.
The next day her husband found her dead at home.
Ms Jordan's employer, today known as Grampians Health, told the inquest it accepted the BHS finance department's culture at the time was ""suboptimal, if not toxic"".
The coroner's investigation did not find any other ""probable suicide stressors"".
The report found Ms Jordan's return to full duties on August 27 was ""managed suboptimally"" and that the task allocated was ""excessively complex"".
It said this coincided with a report of ""mental ill-health by a colleague"".
This was labelled a missed opportunity to ""re-evaluate the return-to-work plan"" and reintegrate Ms Jordan safely into the workplace.
In a statement Grampians Health said Ms Jordan had been a valued employee and her death continued to be felt widely.
""Our focus at this time is to provide support and guidance to our staff, and to work through the coroner's findings,"" the statement said.
Ms Spanos recognised that Grampians Health had made remediations after a WorkCover improvement notice issued in January 2020.
""I encourage, without making a formal recommendation, that Grampians Health (formerly Ballarat Health Services) remain vigilant to its workplace culture and the safety of its employees,"" Ms Spanos said.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-15/pre-workout-hot-cross-bun-snack/105133652,Social media says hot cross buns are good pre-workout food. Is it true?,,"It's hot cross bun season and on social media, the Easter treat is being promoted as an ideal pre-workout snack.
Scroll through Instagram or TikTok and you're likely to come across a hot cross bun getting slathered in peanut butter, honey or butter ahead of a workout or run.
Sports dietitians Emilie Burgess and Dannielle Hibberd have worked with elite teams and athletes in Tasmania and New South Wales. They share whether hot cross buns are a good choice, plus what and when to eat before exercising.
Like a piece of toast or crumpets, a hot cross bun is a great way to get carbohydrates into your body before training or exercise, Ms Burgess says.
A traditional hot cross bun with dried fruit delivers roughly 40 grams of carbohydrates, however this can vary depending on size and toppings, Ms Burgess says.
One traditional hot cross bun ahead of exercise can keep blood sugar stable and assist muscles to contract appropriately for an hour of moderate activity.

""That could be running, it could be sprinting, it could be intermittent-based team sports, such as Monday night basketball,"" Ms Burgess says.
""Equally someone lifting weights, that kind of high-intensity effort of moving weights, that's also a pretty carb-hungry activity.
""If you need more [carbohydrates], have it with honey or jam, or have it with a smoothie.
Different activities have different carbohydrate needs.
Ms Burgess says a ""gentle paced, chatty walk with a friend"" may not require a pre-workout snack.
Toppings can be added to increase carbohydrates needed for activities. (ABC Life: Thalia Ho)
There's no black-and-white answer on how far in advance to eat before rigorous training, however Ms Hibberd says longer is better.
""Ideally the longer amount of time, the more time you have to digest, so it's less likely to cause gut upsets or cramps,"" Ms Hibberd says.
If you're focused on sports performance, a high-carbohydrate meal three to four hours before exercise is advised, with a small snack two hours before exercise.
But if waking early to exercise, a meal the night before and a small snack when you wake and before you exercise should be enough.
When choosing what to eat, Ms Burgess says foods with a high-glycemic Index (GI), are ideal as carbohydrates will be digested rapidly and utilised by the body straight away.
High-GI foods include white bread, cornflakes and instant noodles.

""Something like a hot cross bun comes in beautifully, of course depending on how thick you layer the butter on top,"" Ms Burgess says.
""They're going to provide that higher-GI so in theory should be better tolerated than a really heavily grained bread or crackers.""
For afternoon activity, depending on how rigorous, the food eaten throughout the day may provide enough fuel with little to no change to usual eating habits.
""It might mean that lunch contains a bit more carbohydrate or perhaps afternoon tea does,"" Ms Burgess says.
If you're looking for ideas for pre-workout snacks, Ms Burgess suggests a banana, a date with peanut butter, a slice of toast, a couple of pikelets or rice crackers.
She says a milk-based coffee can get protein circulating in the body and deliver carbohydrates.
Ms Hibberd suggests plain white toast with peanut butter or jam, rice cakes, fresh or dried fruit or a muesli bar as possible snacks ahead of high levels of exercise, but says it depends on the individual's needs.
Similarly, Ms Burgess says pre-training needs for fibre, protein and fat vary for individuals and some will be fine with grainy options and nut bars.
Rather than seeking out food marketed for exercise, which Ms Burgess says can sometimes be diet foods in disguise and therefore low in carbs, purchase the foods you know you'll reach for.
""If it's not actually eaten by the person because they don't like it, or it doesn't transport well to work, then they're not going to consume it, and that's kind of useless.
""Which is why the Easter bun appeals so nicely, because they are pretty universally enjoyed.""
But more importantly, Ms Burgess and Ms Hibberd say to still enjoy that traditional hot cross bun.
""You don't need to be training to have earned a hot cross bun,"" Ms Burgess says.

The Hobart-based soprano had for years donned the diva mantle uncomfortably, and knew that giving up their voice, and thus their livelihood, was inevitable.
But committing to the process was difficult.

Thomson has since started the process of a non-binary medical transition, which includes some hormonal intervention that will result in vocal changes.

Thomson has known for years they were non-binary, but didn't initially have the language to express it and only recently decided to access gender-affirming care.
ABCQueer has compiled this list of national and state-based support services relevant to LGBTQI+ people, their families and friends.
In Tasmania, gender-affirming healthcare services include the support and advocacy service Working It Out, general practitioners, medical specialists and surgeons, and the statewide Sexual Health Service, which runs Clinic 60 in Hobart and clinics in Launceston and Devonport.
These provide free access to specialist care for people aged 15 and over.

""In Tasmania, we are drastically in need of more clinicians who have experience working in this space,"" Hann said.
""All of us GPs currently working with trans and gender-diverse patients have closed books, meaning we are no longer taking new patients.
""In addition, the public clinics [paediatrics and sexual health] that support the community have increasingly long wait lists, making access to care even harder for the trans and gender-diverse population in Tasmania.
""This has detrimental effects on the health and wellbeing of patients.""
Equality Tasmania acting president Ash Russell said a handful of private surgeons provided gender-affirming surgeries, such as mastectomies or breast augmentations (top surgery) for Tasmania's trans community.

But, they said, most people had to travel to the mainland or overseas to access more complicated medical services, such as bottom surgeries or facial feminisation surgery.
""Patients under 18 mostly access the Royal Hobart Hospital Gender Clinic, which provides holistic care from multiple specialists,"" Russell said.
""Providing gender-affirming care usually involves a multi-disciplinary team of specialists, sometimes including GPs, psychologists/psychiatrists, social workers, endocrinologists, sexual health specialists, and surgeons.
Olivia Hogarth, chief executive officer of Tasmania's only dedicated LGBTQIA+ support, advocacy and education service, Working It Out, said the service provided crucial help to people navigating their gender identity.
""It's not a traditional counselling or mental health service,"" she said.
""It's grounded in suicide prevention, in that it provides support for people to explore identity and their place in the world, and to talk through the barriers they may be facing.""
According to Russell, Tasmania has a large population of LGBTQIA+ people, with the ABS estimating 4.7 per cent of the population is queer, which is higher than the national average of 4.5 per cent.
""Our state has some of the highest rates of mental distress in Australia, with a recent report from La Trobe University finding 79 per cent of LGBTQIA+ adults reported experiencing suicidal ideation.
""Poor mental health for LGBTQIA+ Tasmanians is often due to the discrimination they face and the hurdles they must face when trying to access affirming care.""
Miranda Hann believes Tasmania would benefit from the establishment of a multidisciplinary integrated LGBTQIA+ clinic through the Royal Hobart Hospital or outpatients clinics.
""[We need] a clinic with GPs, paediatricians, sexual health physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, and other allied health to fully support the health needs of the trans and gender-diverse community of Tasmania,"" she said.
Hann said if the state took a preventative approach to managing the health needs of the trans and gender-diverse community, it would not only improve their care, but would reduce costs on tertiary centres and potentially improve healthcare practices across the wider community.
Thomson is both nervous and excited about the future.
""I'm also worried that, depending on the result of the federal election, gender affirming care will be rolled back.""
Quin Thomson says they looking forward to what the future might bring. (Supplied: Van Diemen's Band)
But for now, Thomson's focus is on reshaping their work and other aspects of their artistic practice, such as conducting and composing, post medical transition.
""I find myself quite excited about this particular change,"" they said.
""Whatever happens next will be workable. And it might be amazing. And it will certainly be closer to who I actually am.
""So even though there's unknowns about it, I do know that it's a step in a good direction for me.""

Indigenous Australians","Uncle Carey McDonald is tilting his face up to the sky.
It's an unseasonably warm day after a week of a cold change marking the approach of Melbourne winter.
""It's nice to feel the sun again,"" he says.
The 60-year-old Kamberri/Wiradjuri elder is leaning against two planter boxes in the courtyard of the Aboriginal health service he's been coming to for more than 15 years.
The boxes are almost bare after months of disuse.
""Being part of this community used to mean being involved, growing something like this community garden to feed those less fortunate than us,"" he told the ABC.
Now, after what staff at the Dandenong and Districts Aborigine Co-operative (DDACL) describe as ""decades of neglect from the government"", the community hub has reached the end of its rope.
Uncle Carey says the closure of DDACL fractured his connection with community. (ABC News)
He said he first came to the DDACL with no family and no connection to culture.
""They took me under their wing and brought me into art and yarn groups, got me participating into the community, and it's allowed me to grow,"" he said.
The ""one-stop-shop"" organisation offers everything from child care to family services, aged care, disability services — the list goes on.
For some, it's just a place to come and have a cuppa.
For many, it represented the heart of the community.
Community programs like a 'Mum and Bubs' gardening group have been halted since the closure. (ABC News)
Last year, the ABC visited DDACL after reports the building was crumbling — it found flood-damaged ceilings, cracks in the walls, and a door that was too unsafe to open.
Two months later the site was condemned after the asbestos risk was deemed too high.
The building was fenced off in August last year after being condemned due to the asbestos risk. (ABC News)
Jenny Ockwell, a Wurundjeri woman and head of DDACL says running the organisation since then has been like ""putting out spot fires"".
""I can't begin to tell you how challenging it was,"" Ms Ockwell said.
The organisation has since relocated its medical services 15 kilometres away to a smaller site in Cranbourne, with no space for its community programs.
Jenny Ockwell, head of DDACL, says she has been involved with the organisation since 1977. (ABC News: Bridget Brennan)
She said it was a huge disruption for the organisation, which provides services to one of the fastest-growing Indigenous populations in the country.
""If there's one thing about our community, it's that the best way to connect with them, to have an impact, is face-to-face communication.
""All of that ground to a halt.""

Now, a joint report from Victoria's independent infrastructure advisory body and the peak body for Aboriginal health organisations across the state, has warned that other organisations like DDACL could meet a similar fate.
The report, by Infrastructure Victoria and the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, found that a majority of community-controlled organisations (ACCOs) were in urgent need of repair, and in some cases, replacement.
The very first ACCO's in Victoria began in the early 1970s, as co-operatives to provide community with health and care services.

Today, there are 33 ACCOs across the state, each providing a wide range of wrap-around services.
Collectively, these organisations run services out of about 200 buildings.
The average age of these buildings is 40 years old — the oldest is 174 years old.
The state of disrepair varies, but the report found that 82 per cent of them need replacing or substantial repairs within the next 15 years.
Over half of ACCHO infrastructure is already at the end of its useful life.
Dr Jonathan Spear, the CEO of Infrastructure Victoria, says many of the buildings are reaching a state of urgency.
""It's the floors, it's the walls, it's the ceilings that are leaking and it's really affecting the ability of these places to operate.
""They're in a state that most Victorians wouldn't put up with.""
The report also found 98 per cent of the buildings were culturally unsafe for running health services.

Some of the ACCOs, as highlighted in the report, were forced to inherit colonial buildings — many of which hold memories of a dark past, and would never be able to be made culturally safe.
According to the report, the poor infrastructure has created challenges for the staff to provide the services.
It details an account of women having to undergo pelvic exams in cramped, uncomfortable rooms.
Another describes complaints about not being able to access a private bathroom.
Aunty Jill Gallagher, the CEO of VACCHO, says other organisations agreed DDACL was the top priority for urgent infrastructure needs.
""This is critical, because the situation DDACL is in will be repeated around the state without action from government and dedicated infrastructure investment,"" she said.
""We need to be heard, and we need to be around that table.
""We're part of the health system, so see us like that and treat us like that. They certainly look after all the other infrastructure — we're just forgotten about.""
Jill Gallagher says Aboriginal health clinics need the same tools as their mainstream counterparts. (ABC News: Andrew Altree-Williams)
The report found that the avenues for accessing infrastructure funding in Victoria were often limited, oversubscribed and complicated.
Many of the available funding grants were targeted towards maintenance, repairs and small upgrades — but were insufficient for rectifying the major structural problems outlined in the report.
Furthermore, ACCOs were made to compete with each other for the grants, often requiring long, laborious and complex application processes from teams already under the pump delivering critical services to the community.
In a submission to the Yoorrook Justice Commission hearing last year, Victorian Health Minister Mary-Anne Thomas acknowledged these funding models were ""inadequate"", and ""constrained the ability of these organisations to effectively serve their communities.""

The report outlines three recommendations to the Victorian government, aimed at building and maintaining self-determined health infrastructure.
These include interim funding for minor works, more meaningful funding to replace buildings before they fail completely, and funding to develop the skills and capacity for ACCO teams to develop and deliver their own infrastructure plans.
Despite the infrastructure hurdles, evidence suggests ACCOs are outperforming their mainstream health service counterparts.
Modelling by Melbourne and Deakin University researchers revealed health interventions delivered by community-controlled clinics had a 50 per cent greater impact than mainstream clinics.
There's also a ""broad range of primary health care data"" showing the ""superior performance"" of ACCOs when it comes to First Nations health outcomes, according to a 2014 paper in the Medical Journal of Australia.
""The evidence is there that the way we deliver services to our people — it's working,"" Aunty Jill said.
Evidence suggests the demand is set to increase — with the latest ABS data indicating the Indigenous Australian population is growing at a faster rate on average than the rest of the Australian population.
The Productivity Commission says governments are shirking ""meaningful action"" to close the gap.
The Victorian government claims it has provided $2.3 million to DDACL's frontline services since 2024, across multiple departments.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the state government would not be drawn on how much funding the sector would get for urgent infrastructure repair in the upcoming budget.
""We will hand down the Budget on 20 May which will be focused on making sure that every dollar of investment goes to where it matters most — supporting families and frontline services,"" they said.
Aunty Jill told the ABC that staff at the coalface of the Indigenous health sector were ready for a government committed to action.
Uncle Carey says future governments need to ""look at the bigger picture"".
""How is this closing the gap? For me to see that the young people that need our connection, need our help, aren't getting it.
""I think it's a sad indictment if this is the legacy that the government's going to allow us to leave our young ones.""",Unknown,Tue 15 Apr

""He's very mellow, very loving, very chill …. loves his food,"" she said.
In a tale as old as time, it's all in the puppy-dog eyes.
""He has a labrador face, so I guess it's quite easy to give him whatever food he wants, needs and desires,"" Ms Schultz said.

But Archie's days of food scraps under the table have come to an end.
For the next 28-weeks he'll be part of a study that University of Queensland researchers hope will provide deeper insight into the links between gut health, fat tissue, metabolism and brain function of labradors and retrievers.
The breeds were chosen because they are ""obesity-prone"" and among the most common dog breeds in Australia.
Lead researcher Dr Erika Meler said they hope the findings will be applicable to all dogs.
""We want to have a real impact on not just those breeds but the whole population of pet companions,"" she said.
Dogs taking part in the study will be given a tailored exercise program, wear an activity tracking collar — or ""doggy Fitbit"" — and be provided with a free meal plan.
The small device that attaches to their collar will help researchers get an indication of the ""intensity"" and ""length"" of exercise the dogs are doing, Dr Meler said.
The dogs in the study will be given a full health examination by trained veterinarians. (ABC News: Julie Hornsey)
Dog owners will receive a free, weight-controlled diet for the duration of the study.
Dr Meler said obesity in dogs can be easily missed by owners.
""We probably all have crossed paths with a bit of a curvy dog and found that it was a very cute little dog, but it has some long-term health implications,"" she said.
Dogs can suffer from many of the same repercussions of obesity that overweight humans do.
""You have issues with the endocrine system, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease as well as orthopaedic diseases,"" Dr Meler said.
Dr Erika Meler and Priscilla Almeida are conducting a study of overweight dogs. (ABC News: Julie Hornsey)
Dr Meler said sticking to the right amount of food can be one of the trickiest parts of losing weight — as many humans can attest to.
""There are ways you can go around that. You can change the number of meals that you give throughout the day, or you can associate food with walks, but yes, calorie restrictions can come with little hurdles,"" she said.
The relationship between our gut and our brain has been the focus of increased research in recent years.
But Dr Meler said it is a ""very interesting and developing area of research"" for dogs too.
Researchers will work with the dogs through basic IQ testing, mostly related to games around finding treats and logic-based puzzles.
Surveys from owners who will evaluate how they feel their interactions with their dogs have changed will also be used.
With up to one in three dogs in Australia estimated to be overweight, and almost one in four obese, it's an issue that Dr Meler said needs to be tackled.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-14/heat-mental-disorders-climate-change-research/105175234,'Only going to get worse': Extreme heat linked to rise in mental health disorders,"Topic:
Mental Health","Rising temperatures nationwide could lead to a surge in mental disorders among young Australians in coming years — sparking a call by researchers for urgent action.
A new study led by a team at the University of Adelaide’s School of Public Health has found the burden of mental and behavioural disorders could increase by almost 50 per cent by 2050.
They found the Northern Territory had the highest predicted risk and the highest average temperature.
South Australia and Victoria, meanwhile, had the highest proportion of mental health burden attributable to high temperature.
Lead author Professor Peng Bi said the impact of climate change on mental health was “only going to get worse” without action.
“From mild distress to serious conditions like schizophrenia, rising temperatures are making things harder for millions,” he said.
High temperatures, according to the report, contributed to an annual loss of 8,459 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) between 2003 and 2018.
A DALY, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), measures the years of healthy life lost due to death or illness.
Researchers used AIHW data to estimate the burden of mental and behavioural disorders annually, then compared them to daily mean temperatures across more than 2,300 jurisdictions nationwide.
2024 marked the hottest year on record.
The “burden” of mental disorders measures the “impact of living” — combining the years lost to living with ill-health, or non-fatal burden, and the years lost due to dying prematurely, or fatal burden.
The team then projected how rising temperatures in the 2030s and the 2050s would affect the number of heat-related mental and behavioural disorders.
All their projected scenarios showed an increase in the burden of mental disorders.
By the 2050s, according to the report, the number of MBDs attributed to high temperature would rise from 1.8 per cent in the 2010s to as high as 2.8 per cent by the 2050s.
First author Dr Jingwen Liu said: “Our findings show that climate change will drive up mental health challenges beyond what population growth alone would cause.
The temperature residents in each area were used to was also factored into their research — meaning each jurisdiction had an individual baseline temperature.
Heatwaves loom as a growing threat to humanity in a warming climate. This summer alone, in the northern hemisphere, thousands have died during extreme heat events. It's driving researchers to find out more about the point when heat turns deadly.
“The other thing you have to take into account is the population number,” Dr Liu told the ABC.
“In the Northern Territory, the number is substantially lower than in [other states].
“When we just look at the total burden of mental health, it’s actually higher in Victoria and New South Wales.
“Even the relative risk is higher in the Northern Territory … but that doesn’t mean in the southern parts we shouldn’t invest the resources to fix this issue.”
However the report noted several limitations included the hypothetical nature of their model and potential “uncertainties” which could rise from potential future global pandemics like COVID-19.
The peer-reviewed study was published in Nature Climate Change on Monday.
Other Australian researchers have also sounded the alarm when it comes to extreme heat and mental health.
Experts say it's time Australia start treating the phenomenon seriously, particularly as the climate heats up even more.
Another study by a team at the University of New South Wales linked suicidal thoughts and behaviours to rising temperatures.
The number of young people visiting emergency departments for suicidality increased by 1.3 per cent for every one degree Celsius rise in the daily mean temperature, according to their report.
“With ongoing increases in hot weather predicted for coming decades, health services must prepare for potential increasing youth suicidality presentations,” their report said.
“Current public health heat planning and warnings typically relate to heatwaves rather than single hot days, they also typically omit a mental health component.
Dr Thomas Longden, of Western Sydney University’s Urban Transformations Research Centre, found earlier this year “heat-related” deaths could be substantially under-reported.
Governments are having to decide how to pay for impact of global warming.
Another researcher, Curtin University’s Dr Lucas Hertzog, also linked suicide and climate change.
A study led by Dr Hertzog in 2024 found 264 suicides between 2000 and 2019 could be attributed to climate change-induced heat anomalies.
Following their findings, researchers behind this latest report called for immediate action to prepare for an increase in mental health needs.
“Policymakers must step up with targeted, people-centred strategies to protect mental health as temperatures climb,” Professor Bi said.",Brianna Morris-Grant,Mon 14 Apr

Drug Offences","Former South Australian Liberal leader David Speirs provided cocaine to someone who he knew had been attending Narcotics Anonymous, a court document reveals.
David James Speirs, 40, previously pleaded guilty to two charges of supplying a controlled substance to another person between August 1 and August 10, 2024, at Kingston Park.
He was arrested at Berri, in the state's Riverland, in September last year.
His arrest came after a video, published by News Corp, showed the former MP snorting from a plate. The charges do not relate to the video.
On Friday, Speirs appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court where his lawyer William Mickan told the court his client had started using cocaine as a form of ""escapism"" in June 2024.
A court document, the facts of charge from SA Police, viewed by the ABC on Monday, said Speirs supplied cocaine to two men — one of whom he had known for 15 years — on August 2, 2024 and August 9, 2024.

It said that after seeing the two men at a seaside cafe in July 2024, Speirs began communicating with one of them via direct message on Instagram.
""The Instagram conversation of [the man] and Speirs between 21 July 2024 and 2 August 2024 did refer to the use of illicit substances, being cocaine and cannabis,"" the document said.
The document noted the other two men then attended Speirs's house on August 2, where all three ""self-administered cocaine"" supplied by Speirs.
""All persons present self-administered a few lines of cocaine and when the cocaine available ran out, Speirs went to his bedroom and returned with more cocaine.""
The document said that the social media messages continued between the two men and included discussions about the use of drugs including ""weed and coke"".
""The conversation on Instagram continues back-and-forth, whilst [the man] reflects on attending Narcotics Anonymous and at 2:52am on 4 August 2024, during the conversation, Speirs messages [the man] and states: 'I was a bit worried what we did yesterday would've taken you off the path'.""

The document said the two men again went to Speirs's house on August 9, 2024, at 5am where ""there was already cocaine out on the kitchen bench"".
""Whilst with Speirs at his home, the three consumed alcohol and cocaine, provided by Speirs,"" the document stated.
The document also revealed that when police searched Speirs's Kingston Park home on September 26, 2024, they uncovered ""resealable bags"" containing ""white powdery residue"" in his bedroom.
""As a result … police seized from the master bedroom — top desk drawer, a small plastic resealable bag containing a white powdery residue, a rolled-up $20 AUD banknote, Qantas card with white powdery residue on it, rolled-up foreign currency, rolled up $1 USD banknote, rolled up $5 AUD banknote, and a hand-rolled cigarette containing suspected cannabis,"" the document said.
""In the fireplace in the main living area, police seized five small plastic resealable bags containing a white powdery residue and two rolled-up $5 AUD banknotes.""
The documents also noted that during initial questioning at the Berri Police Station, Speirs was ""polite and cooperative with investigators"".

On the weekend, documents revealed 13 roles would be cut, including a nurse consultant, clinical neuropsychologist, two mental health clinicians and three art therapists, due to a drop in philanthropic funds.
The news of the job losses was described as distressing by the My Room Children's Cancer Charity and Children's Cancer Foundation, which donate to the hospital.
Shadow Health Minister Georgie Crozier said the cuts were unacceptable, noting they would come just prior to the Good Friday Appeal — an annual fundraising drive which last year raised more than $23 million for the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH).
However, on Monday, the hospital advised it was now working with the RCH Foundation to continue funding all 13 positions.
""The Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) is incredibly grateful for the leadership and generosity of our philanthropic partners who support the Children's Cancer Centre (CCC),"" it said in a statement.
""The RCH is working with the RCH Foundation to continue funding 13 roles within the CCC and will work together to ensure the programs will sustainably continue in the long-term.""
The hospital said it was grateful to My Room and the Children's Cancer Foundation for their commitment to patients.
It noted that the RCH Foundation had provided more than $61.2 million in funding for patient care, research, education and equipment and was ""on track to fund a similar amount in 2025"".
The Good Friday Appeal had already indicated that it would continue funding the art therapy program.

The White House released the 78-year-old's results on Sunday, local time, with signs the president was in better shape than at his 2020 check-up, which showed him bordering on obesity.
His physician, navy Captain Sean Barbabella, who ran a health clinic in North Carolina before Mr Trump tapped him for the job, cited an ""active lifestyle"" that ""continues to contribute significantly"" to the Republican president's wellbeing.

The doctor said Mr Trump was ""fully fit to execute the duties of commander-in-chief and head of state"".
The summary noted that Mr Trump previously had cataract surgery on both eyes, but gave no dates.
Mr Trump again passed a Montreal Cognitive Assessment test, a short screening test to assess different brain functions, Mr Barbabella wrote.
The test includes remembering a list of spoken words and listening to a list of random numbers and repeating them backward, among other questions.
""I think I did very well,"" Mr Trump said after the exam.
""Overall, I felt I was in very good shape. A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul.""
Mr Trump may be the oldest person elected to the nation's highest office, but he is four years younger than Democrat Joe Biden, who was 82 when his presidential term ended in January.
Despite raising questions about Mr Biden's physical and mental capacity and repeatedly asserting that Mr Biden did not know what he was doing, Mr Trump has routinely kept basic details about his health from the public.
It also confirmed scarring on Mr Trump's right ear from a gunshot wound during an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July 2024.
Mr Barbabella performed and supervised the medical examination of Mr Trump at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He said it included diagnostic and laboratory testing in addition to consultations with 14 specialists.

Public Health","A nurse who committed ""professional misconduct of a serious nature"" to gain employment at a hospital on the state's Fleurieu Peninsula, was ""desperate to get a job"", a tribunal has heard.
A judgement handed down in the South Australian Civil and Administrative Tribunal earlier this year found that Syed Husnain, 30, ""had not demonstrated reformation of character"" when committing the offending after previously being reprimanded for providing health regulatory body AHPRA with a ""fabricated"" language test result in May 2020.
Mr Husnain apologised to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia who still registered him as an enrolled nurse on the condition he engage with a mentoring arrangement and that he practice under the supervision of an approved professional.
""The respondent admitted his conduct, he apologised for his conduct, and he promised that he would never again do anything like this in his whole life,"" the judgement said.
In January 2022, after completing a four-week placement at the Victor Harbor Hospital, as part of his studies at Flinders University, Mr Husnain took steps to secure employment and supplied four documents he claimed had been signed by a man he proposed to be his supervisor.
""[The supervisor's] signature had been forged on those documents by the respondent and [the supervisor] knew nothing of any of the documents that had been submitted to AHPRA,"" the judgement said.
""The respondent clearly provided false and forged documentation to AHPRA in order to seek an approval to work at the Victor Harbor Hospital in circumstances where he had not proposed any suitable registered nurse to be his supervisor.""
Mr Husnain completed a placement at a hospital through his studies at Flinders University. (ABC News: Malcolm Sutton)
The judgement said that an offer of employment had been made to the 30-year-old by Gawler Grande Views, an aged-care facility in Adelaide's north, on January 6, 2022 and that he, again, provided a ""fraudulent and forged"" document.
""The documents that were provided to AHPRA on 28 January again included a Common Restrictions Practitioner's Declaration form where the respondent acknowledged that the details he was providing were true and accurate, and named … the Director of Care and Services at Grande Views Nursing Home, as the senior person,"" the judgement said.
""The form was fraudulent and forged, because it was not completed or signed by [the director] but had been produced by the respondent.
""It was highly unprofessional (and indeed professional misconduct of a serious nature) for the respondent to submit the form in [the director's] name and with her purported signature, when in fact, she had not signed the form and had not authorised him to do any such thing.""
The judgement said that on another occasion Mr Husnain told a registered nurse, who he approached to be his mentor, that he had failed his language test and did not admit to his misconduct.
The judgement said that Mr Husnain had acted out of desperation when he committed the misconduct.
""As to the three allegations against him, the respondent generally claims that he was desperate to get a job as an enrolled nurse and that he panicked on the occasions that he produced the various falsified records,"" it said.
""That is, of course, no excuse. Dishonesty in the submission of information is never acceptable.
""In this case, it is aggravated by the fact that the dishonesty was repeated; there are three occasions in all.""

Drugs","They can take the form of a pen that actually works, a lip gloss, a car key or an airpod case.
They're called penjamins — deliberately disguised to look like everyday objects, allowing the user to vape cannabis discreetly.
Social media, in particular TikTok, has thousands of posts about penjamins being used covertly in schools, at work and even at airports.
There are no practical means to collect or recycle vapes, and most end up as electronic waste in landfill. Some are simply thrown on the street as litter. So what's really inside vapes?
Paul Dillon, Director of Drug and Alcohol Research and Training Australia, said penjamins were in the top five topics young people wanted to discuss when he visited schools across Australia.
""So certainly there is an awareness about them if not significant use,"" Mr Dillon said.
Here is an example of the types of questions students are asking Mr Dillon:
""What's the deal with these weed vapes? If they got caught with one, would they get into trouble?""
One student said their friends had told them ""it's safer than smoking it"" and they had ""bought a penjamin after seeing different ones on TikTok"".
A drug expert cautions while most will not have a problem, ""when they do have a problem, it's often a significant problem and can be life-changing"". (TikTok: turn_podpak)
Mr Dillon said other students had shared bad experiences they've had with penjamins.
""Never tried cannabis before, he took a puff, took a couple of puffs and really went into a very dark place,"" Mr Dillon said of one user.
""He has really not recovered from that, he's now seeing a psychologist on a regular basis trying to deal with that experience he had.""
From January to December 2024, border enforcement stopped over 6.3 million vaping products from entering Australia. (ABC News: Rachel Carbonell)
Mr Dillon is keen to point out that most people who use cannabis will not have a problem, but ""when they do have a problem, it's often a significant problem and can be a life-changing problem"".
Penjamins can contain high doses of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound in cannabis, which can increase the risks of a range of adverse effects.
Manufacturers of nicotine and weed vapes have been known to use a range of chemicals in their products, including preservatives, thickeners and flavours.
Dr Hester Wilson from the Royal Australian College of GPs has concerns about penjamins.
""The quality of the liquid used and adulterants would be unknown … there is a potential risk of inflammatory issues in the lungs,"" Dr Wilson said.
Dr Sukhwinder Sohal is the past president of the Tasmanian branch of the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ).
He said data on the long-term health effects of cannabis vaping was still emerging.
""It is reported in a population-based study that wheezing or whistling in the chest is roughly two times higher among those who had used cannabis in electronic nicotine delivery system,"" Dr Sohal said.
Penjamins can also be disguised as chap stick products. (TikTok: penjaminlamar)
From late 2019 to early 2020, there were over 2,500 cases of e-cigarette or vaping-produced use-associated lung injury (EVALI), with 55 deaths reported.
Dr Sohal said while monitoring of the condition ceased in 2020 after a decline in cases, it's still an ongoing issue.
""Throughout this period in the United States, 2,807 individuals were hospitalised with EVALI and 68 individuals died as a result, which showed that EVALI continued but was not followed or reported,"" he said.
Cannabis vapes have become increasingly popular in Canada and parts of the US where the drug is legal.
From January to December 2024, the Australian Border Force (ABF) stopped over 6.3 million vaping products from entering Australia.
A spokesperson for the ABF said the organisation was aware of evolving criminal import methodologies ""such as disguising illicit vaping goods as other items and remains agile in adapting its border targeting capabilities to detect these changing criminal behaviours"".
The ABF is working alongside the Department of Health and other agencies to enable this integrated approach to detecting, seizing and destroying vape products.
HPPD, triggered by the use of psychedelic drugs, has been described by sufferers as the ""trip that never ends"". Sheree da Costa lost her son Joey to the illness and is joining the call for more awareness of the condition.
Teachers are concerned that all forms of vaping are having a disruptive impact on the education of Australian students.
""Vaping is an immense challenge facing Australian schools,"" Australian Education Union president Correna Haythorpe said.
""The growing vaping crisis is placing additional strain on teachers, who are already experiencing unstable workloads, to control the use use of vaping in schools.""
The Australian government has banned the sale of vapes outside of pharmacies and will roll out a program in schools this year designed to teach students the health risks of vaping.
Mr Dillon said due to the discreet nature of the penjamin, most parents wouldn't ""have a clue"" if their kids are using them.
Dr Wilson said vape users should talk to their GPs for help around quitting.",Fiona Blackwood,Mon 14 Apr

Perhaps it was the years of knowing the day would eventually arrive after being told her advanced ovarian cancer was incurable.
Maybe it was the shock of watching the reality of the person you love the most live their final days in a palliative care ward.
Or, it could have been the years of exhaustion of being gaslit by moments of temporary hope when a new treatment briefly worked, only to be crushed again when the cancer would inevitably spread to yet another area of her body.
Each new metastasis bringing with it a horrifying new set of debilitating symptoms.
Either way, by the time the funeral came, I was emotionally dead inside.
My mother died in 2017 after a battle with ovarian cancer. (Supplied)
My grief was so profound I felt that pushing my pain and tears down was the only way to stop it all from uncontrollably overflowing.
Last month I received a routine phone call at work that left me sobbing at my desk, and later, in the car on the drive home.
It was from the father of a woman with uterine cancer desperately pitching me a story about how research into/treatment of gynecological cancers is underfunded — resulting in appalling survival rates compared with progress made for other cancers.
I could tell by his voice he thought he had one chance to get me to care enough to do the story.
These are people's mothers, they have daughters, he begged. They are dying and no one seems to be doing enough to stop it, he implored.
He may not have known at the time that I am one of the women most likely to get one of these cancers.
As a BRCA1 carrier, I have a 44 per cent lifetime risk of developing the same dreaded ovarian cancer that killed my mother. Women diagnosed with ovarian cancer have the poorest prognosis of all gynaecological cancers.
I have one precious daughter and a second baby girl on the way. Both have a 50 per cent chance of carrying that gene mutation too.
Do you have a story to share? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au
The man on the phone was talking about the very cancers that have affected my grandmother, my mother, me, and likely at least one of my daughters.
His impassioned pleas made me wonder if I had given up hope and why I was not more angry.
When my mother died in 2017, I optimistically presumed that by the time I reached my 40s and my ovarian cancer risk started rapidly increasing, there would be some amazing new test to detect ovarian cancer early, or, at least treat it effectively.
As I quickly approach that age I am enraged to learn there is neither. My only option: have my ovaries completely removed as soon as possible.
Many women with gynaecological cancers have no such warning, no family history, no other indications they could be at risk or ways of preventing themselves from getting sick.
Gynaecological cancers including ovarian, uterine, endometrial, cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers are some of the poorest funded by research dollars.
The number of cases diagnosed each year has more than doubled since the 1980s.
I have a 40 per cent risk of developing the same kind of cancer that took my mum. (Supplied)
Unlike breasts, these are the invisible to the public parts of women's bodies that give and bring life, yet there's little understanding or awareness of the increasing rates of gynaecological cancer diagnosis.
Then there's the fact that symptoms can be vague and easily mistaken for other conditions like endometriosis, menopause, period pain or the stress of leading a busy life of being a mother, daughter, sister, carer, friend and worker.
They're symptoms that can be so easy to dismiss among all the school runs, deadlines, dinners to cook, family events to organise, work to finish off, aging parents to care for and book week costumes to prepare.
Many gynaecological cancers have no accurate screening tests for early detection and are often diagnosed at an advanced stage with low survival rates, treatment resistance and little hope for a cure.
A new report commissioned by the Australia New Zealand Gynaecological Oncology Group (ANZGOG) says that for decades these cancers have also been among the most poorly funded.
ANZGOG, whose members are groups that conduct research, says fundraising is difficult because people don't want to talk about gynaecological organs and cancers.
They've launched a campaign, calling for $25 million a year over four years to bring research and treatments up to speed with many other cancers.
Through my mother's suffering, I was the first generation in our family given the extraordinary gift of the knowledge that I have a genetic fault that causes cancer before I got sick.
Mum said finding out she had passed BRCA1 on to me was the most devastating news of her life, far worse than being told she had terminal cancer.
The one thing that gave her comfort is that information could help me to avoid the same fate.

A decade after I was diagnosed, to know there has been little progress on treatment or even a screening test to discover a deadly cancer at an early stage, is devastating.
In yet another decade from now I don't want to have to explain to my daughters why we have still failed to make progress.
All of our daughters deserve better.

Police","An autistic and non-verbal teenage boy who was shot repeatedly by Idaho police has died on Saturday, local time, after being removed from life support, his family says.
Victor Perez, 17, who also had cerebral palsy, had been in a coma since the April 5 shooting, and tests Friday showed that he had no brain activity.
His aunt, Ana Vazquez, said the teen had undergone several surgeries, with doctors removing nine bullets and amputating his leg.
Police in the south-east Idaho city of Pocatello responded to a 911 call reporting that an apparently intoxicated man with a knife was chasing someone in a yard.

It turned out to be Perez, who was not intoxicated but walked with a staggered gait due to his disabilities, Vazquez said. His family members had been trying to get the large kitchen knife away from him.
A video taken by a neighbour showed that Perez was lying in the yard after falling over when four officers arrived and rushed to the fence at the edge of the yard. They immediately ordered Perez to drop the knife, but instead, he stood and began stumbling toward them.
Officers opened fire from the other side of a chain-link fence while he was holding a knife.
According to the Associated Press (AP), the officers shot the teen within about 12 seconds of getting out of their patrol cars and apparently made no effort to de-escalate the situation.
""How's he going to jump the fence when he can barely walk?""
The shooting outraged Perez's family and Pocatello residents.
About 200 people attended a vigil Saturday morning outside the Pocatello hospital where he was treated. Another crowd of protesters gathered outside the Pocatello City Hall building, which also houses the police department, on Saturday afternoon.
Police snipers were stationed on a nearby rooftop during the protest, though no violence was reported. Many of the protesters held signs with phrases like, ""Do better, PPD"" and ""Justice for Victor,"" and passing cars honked in acknowledgement.
A police spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the AP.
""Those police broke our family,"" Ms Vasquez said on Saturday, shortly after Perez's death.
The officers, whose names have not been released, were placed on administrative leave.
Decisions about whether charges should be filed against them will be made after an independent investigation by the Eastern Idaho Critical Incident Team, Bannock County prosecutor Ian Johnson said.
""When that investigation is complete, a report will be submitted for review,"" he said.
""In a continued effort to ensure independent and objective consideration, said report will be reviewed by an agency outside of Bannock County.""
Pocatello Mayor Brian Blad said in a statement Friday, after the family announced that Perez had no brain activity, that officials' thoughts and prayers were with them.
""We recognise the pain and grief this incident has caused in our community,"" Mr Blad said.
The mayor said the city was ""addressing this matter with the seriousness and thoroughness it deserves and with the appropriate respect for the gravity of the situation.""
""The criminal, external, and internal investigations regarding the officer-involved shooting are underway, which is why we cannot answer questions out of concern of interfering with or compromising the investigation,"" he said.
Perez loved watching professional wrestling, eating fries, and taking walks while holding his mother's hand, Ms Vasquez said.
He would always notice when Ms Vasquez painted her nails his favourite colour blue or when she wore a new weave, showing his admiration by touching her hair, she said.
""He wouldn't want to sleep and would wake up again, and I would have to walk him back to the bed. I would promise him, 'Hey, I'll be back tomorrow, but you need to lay down and sleep'.""
Ms Vasquez said she didn't know what was next for the family other than that an autopsy would be performed on Monday. Right now, she said, they needed a moment to rest.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-13/what-to-do-if-your-child-is-being-bullied-at-school/105095534,What should parents do if their child is bullied at school?,,"Australian students experience bullying at higher rates than other comparable English-speaking countries, with an estimated one in four reporting they have been regularly bullied.
Following the tragic suicide of Sydney year 7 student Charlotte O'Brien last year, the federal government in February announced an ""anti-bullying rapid review"", which will examine current school procedures and inform the development of a national standard to address bullying in schools.
The review will include consultations with peak organisations from the schools sector, including parent groups, school leaders, and both government and non-government education authorities, as well as directly with parents, teachers and students.
According to the Bullying No Way website, students often tell their parents about bullying before teachers.
So what can parents do if they suspect their child is being bullied?
Rachael Murrihy, clinical psychologist and director of The Kidman Centre, offers two metrics to help parents differentiate between normal adolescent struggles and bullying.
The first metric is the level of distress and whether it's ongoing.
""So if your daughter comes home and they've been excluded, you would monitor whether it's transient and passes after a day or whether it's ongoing,"" Dr Murrihy told the ABC.
Parents often notice behavioural changes that indicate their child is being bullied long before the child can articulate what is happening. (ABC News: Elicia Kennedy)
The second metric is changes in their daily functioning, such as difficulty eating or sleeping, or noticeable shifts in their mood and confidence.
Elizabeth (not her real name), a mother whose child has been bullied, noticed a dip in her child's performance at school because they struggled to focus due to anxiety.
The parents of a 12-year-old girl who took her own life want her story to be shared.
Dr Murrihy explains that bullying can have academic consequences because it hinders cognitive ability and concentration.
""The Australian Council for Educational Research found that students with the highest exposure to bullying were shown to be a year behind in their learning compared to their counterparts who had not been bullied,"" Dr Murrihy said.
Parents often notice behavioural changes long before the child can even articulate what is happening.
""Parents know their children the best, so they're in the best place to judge,"" Dr Murrihy said.
Research suggests that the effects of childhood bullying are linked to poor social, health and economic outcomes for up to nearly four decades after exposure.
""You only have to ask an adult today about their experiences of bullying, and it might be 30 years ago, but they can still tell you about the long-term impacts of nasty words or being attacked by someone,"" Dr Murrihy said.
Bullying can have academic consequences because it hinders cognitive ability and concentration. (ABC News: Adam Shirley)
Poor health outcomes include an increased risk of developing mental illnesses like anxiety and depression.
""If you've been bullied there's an increased risk of developing trauma-like symptoms, so things like emotional numbness, intrusive thoughts, and suicidal thoughts,"" Dr Murrihy said.
Additionally, bullying can lead to severe trust and self-esteem issues, as those who have been bullied may become overly cautious and withdraw from others.
Children often hesitate to talk about bullying because they fear adults will respond ineffectively and make the situation worse.
With cyberbullying, for instance, parents may be tempted to ""protect"" their children by simply taking their devices away.
However, the eSafety commissioner advises against this, as it may deter the child from discussing future incidents of cyberbullying due to fear of losing their device.
Removing devices can also make social isolation worse as it cuts them off from supportive friends and online services.
Elizabeth recommends checking devices regularly and openly with your child, and generally showing interest in the games and videos they watch online.
It's important to ""nurture open conversations"" and create that line of communication, she said.

If parents have a hunch that something is wrong, Dr Murrihy suggests they should ""not jump in to try and problem solve"" but rather, listen and validate the child's feelings.
""Give the child as much control as you can with regard to how this is managed,"" she said.
""Gently explain why it's necessary to tell the school in the cases where it is necessary and listen as to why they might be hesitant.""
Many children will not want to report the bullying, so it's important to address any concerns they have about the process and reassure them it will be OK.
On top of a child's concerns about reporting bullying to the school, parents often worry about being labelled as ""problem parents"", Dr Murrihy said.
However, Elizabeth encourages parents to ""be 'that parent' if your child feels unsafe at school.""
""Be confident that your child needs an ally, and nobody in the school knows your child like you do,"" she said.
Schools have a responsibility to provide a safe learning environment free from bullying, and you are well within your rights to report these incidents.

Dolly's Dream, an organisation committed to changing the culture of bullying, suggests keeping a detailed record of the bullying incidents, noting dates, places, times and brief descriptions to demonstrate that the problem is ongoing.
After the initial report, the school should outline the actions they will take to address the bullying, and you can ask for a progress report.
While many bullying issues are resolved at the school level, some parents may encounter resistance when trying to work with the school in good faith.
Elizabeth has experienced blame, minimisation, and a lack of accountability in response to reporting the bullying.
""Some schools have undoubtedly struggled in their handling of bullying incidents, but there is a raft of changes underway,"" Dr Murrihy said.
Choked, punched and stuffed in a rubbish bin: these are some of the bullying incidents kids in NSW schools have experienced.
""My hope is that schools will be engaging more frequently in these whole school approaches.""
A whole school approach means that bullying is not just the responsibility of the principal or a few senior teachers but of all staff, students, parents and even the wider community.
Students are educated about what constitutes bullying and how to respond if they witness it.
Teachers follow clear policies, and have a clear understanding of ""gateway behaviours"" that can escalate into bullying.
And parents know how to support their children and recognise potential signs of bullying.
Other measures could include appointing a ""school safety leader"" to champion anti-bullying efforts and creating partnerships with community organisations.
Although it is always better to resolve bullying issues at the school level, if the situation is not addressed, you may choose to escalate the matter.
The department to contact will depend on what type of school your child goes to.
For example, public school issues should be escalated to the state's department of education, while Catholic schools typically report to the Catholic Education Office or the governing board.
If your child is being bullied online, you might decide to report the incident to the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, which can offer advice and help remove harmful online content.",Sohani Goonetillake,Sun 13 Apr

Birds","Birdwatching is soaring in popularity worldwide, with research studies finding the practice can reduce psychological distress and increase mental wellbeing.
Once thought of as a hobby populated by older men in flak jackets and camouflage hats, birdwatching is increasingly attracting younger, tech-savvy generations.
Birding videos are racking up millions of views on social media, as the latest technology on cameras and apps makes it easier to snap a great image, record birdsong, and film species in the wild.

Mr Winward describes the state of the bush after the fires as ""eerie and strange"".

She repeated calls for a seniors' dental benefit scheme.
""In this election year, we would hope to see that government would commit to funding a seniors' dental benefit scheme and making sure that all Australians, and we look particularly at older Australians who can't get to the dentist … can get the oral health care that they need,"" Ms Sparrow said.
In pain, unable to eat properly or smile – many Australians are wondering if dental services will ever be included in Medicare.
National Seniors Australia has also called for a seniors' dental benefit scheme in a recent pre-budget submission.
""As people get older and increasingly frail, the ability to adhere to good oral health practices can decline dramatically,"" the submission said.
""Older people are more likely to have poor oral health, especially those with low socio-economic status and those living in residential aged care settings.""
National Seniors Australia chief executive Chris Grice said while he would ideally like dentistry to be included in Medicare, ""we have to be practical in terms of what the country can afford"".
""What we're looking for is some sort of contribution in the form of $500 a year to support, in particular, pensioners as a targeted cohort to help them be able to fund dental care,"" he said.

Women's Health","Alex Neville doesn't know how long she'll live.
The mother of four has endured surgery, 27 rounds of radiation, 13 chemotherapy cycles, immunotherapy and is now on a clinical trial.
In 2020, the 56-year-old was diagnosed with endometrial adenocarcinoma, a gynaecological cancer.
When Ms Neville first raised a change in her periods with her doctor, she was told it was to be expected for a woman her age.
""I didn't panic and I should have … I'd never actually heard of endometrial cancer,"" Ms Neville said.

""When the bleeding continued and actually became constant bleeding, I still just thought this was part of menopause.""
Living in northern Tasmanian, Ms Neville could only receive some treatments in Launceston and had to make a five hour round trip to Hobart for certain specialists.
After her diagnosis, she underwent a radical hysterectomy which included her ovaries.
Ms Neville gave up her job as a psychologist but credits her ""health literacy"" with giving her the knowledge and strength to advocate for herself.

In 2023, after feeling some tenderness in her abdomen, doctors discovered Ms Neville's metastatic cancer had spread to her liver and spleen and was now inoperable and incurable.
Mother of three, Ali Crawford also doesn't know how long she will live.
Ms Crawford, 51, was diagnosed in 2022 with uterine leiomyosarcoma, which, like around 55 per cent of gynaecological cancers, is considered rare and has limited treatment options.

Her treatment is ongoing and she's now had more than 30 hours of surgeries and 11 cycles of chemotherapy.

Ms Crawford struggled to get scans and in desperation used a family connection.
""I felt so guilty using our contacts to get an urgent scan, but I knew I had a ticking time bomb in my pelvis,"" she said.
In April 2022, Ms Crawford underwent a major de-bulking hysterectomy that removed her uterus and surrounding organs.

""Living with this disease, this cancer, people aren't aware that it is a full time job,"" Ms Crawford said.
""So much else in my life has to fall away to try and survive.""
Ms Crawford and Ms Neville are two of about 7,000 women diagnosed each year with gynaecological cancers. A figure which has more than doubled since the 1980s.
Both women have joined a campaign led by the Australia New Zealand Gynaecological Oncology Group (ANZGOG) calling for more investment in gynaecological cancers which includes ovarian, uterine, endometrial, cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers.
ANZGOG — which works with groups that research gynaecological cancers — says ""underinvestment in research has led to a crisis for women"".
Professor Clare Scott is a scientist and medical oncologist. (ABC News: Patrick Stone)
ANZGOG brought together organisations including Ovarian Cancer Australia and the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation to form the Gynaecological Cancer Transformation Initiative (GCTI).
They want the federal government to commit $100 million over four years to improve support, treatment through molecular profiling, and further research.
ANZGOG commissioned a report by Insight Economics, which found that 23 women will be diagnosed with a gynaecological cancer every day by 2035.
For nearly two decades, gynaecological cancers have been among the poorest funded cancers, the report found.
Chair of ANZGOG, Professor Clare Scott said she was ""crying on the inside"" when she read the report.
""For most gynaecological cancers that recur and cause a woman to have what we call metastatic cancer, the survival rates are as poor as the survival rates for all cancers 50 years ago,"" Professor Scott said.
Professor Scott, a medical oncologist and researcher, said it was hard to get funding because people didn't want to talk about gynaecological organs and cancers.

ANZGOG has also harnessed the support of 150 community volunteers in their campaign — which includes terminally ill women, their carers and the bereaved — to raise awareness by taking the report to their local MPs during the election campaign.
Rare Cancers Australia CEO Christine Cockburn said ANZGOG's proposals would contribute to a ""critical advancement for people with rare and difficult to treat cancers who have been left behind for too long"".
Women who were diagnosed with gynaecological cancers faced significantly worse outcomes compared to those with more common cancers, she said.
""Much needed reform and change is needed to address this outrageous inequity in our cancer system,"" she said.
""Importantly, the [ANZGOG] program will also address our incomplete understanding of the molecular make up of rare cancers, which currently limits treatment options and leads to premature death for far too many Australians.""
Ali Crawford said she doesn't want other women to go through what she has. (Supplied)
In between her chemotherapy treatments, Ms Crawford met with the Member for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, to discuss the ANZGOG report and appeal for support.
""I hope that our voices are heard,"" Ms Crawford said.
""I hope that no woman has to go through what I have gone through, that there are better options and better treatment outcomes.""
Ms Crawford said she preferred to think of her cancer as a ""chronic disease"" so she could keep receiving treatment with hope and without fear.

Health","Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital plans to cut 13 positions at its cancer centre this month, according to hospital documents.
The positions set to be made redundant are philanthropically funded roles at the hospital's Children's Cancer Centre (CCC).
""A reduction in the philanthropic funds … is proposed to result in a decrease in the number of these roles which are currently being supported by donor funds,"" internal hospital documents state.
The roles that will be axed include a nurse consultant, clinical neuropsychologist, two mental health clinicians and three art therapists.
In a statement, the RCH said it was ""carefully considering changes to the CCC to ensure services evolve sustainably over time"".
""The exceptional medical care children receive at the RCH will not be compromised,"" the hospital said.
According to hospital documents, patients and families will continue to be able to access ""medical, nursing, allied health and mental health care through the CCC and via usual organisational processes"".
The hospital has flagged the changes are due to a reduction in philanthropic funding allocations.


  (ABC News)
The My Room Children's Cancer Charity and Children's Cancer Foundation, which donate to the hospital and the CCC, said they were ""distressed"" by reports of the redundancies.
The charities said they had not withdrawn any funding support to the hospital and that their commitment remained ""firm"".
""To demonstrate this, as recently as March 5 of this year, we reaffirmed our commitment and expressed a strong desire to fund further positions,"" a statement from My Room chair Maurizio Marocci and Children's Cancer Foundation chair Jaala Pulford said.
On Saturday afternoon the Good Friday Appeal said it would fund the art therapy program at the hospital.
""Art therapy supports the children's recovery and brings enjoyment in what can be a challenging time. We thank the community for their generous support and donations to make this happen,"" Good Friday Appeal chairman Penny Fowler said.
RCH chief executive Peter Steer said the hospital was ""thrilled"" patients would continue to be supported by the program.
""This work is truly special, and we are immensely grateful for the Good Friday Appeal's support,"" he said.
On Saturday, shadow health minister Georgie Crozier labelled the imminent job losses ""unacceptable"", noting they would come just prior to the Good Friday Appeal.
""This decision is cruel and appalling. These are not just numbers on a page. These are the people who provide support, counselling and care for sick children and their families during the most traumatic time in their lives,"" she said.
Ms Crozier says the government cannot ""sit back"" and allow the job losses to occur. (AAP: James Ross)
Ms Crozier called on the Victorian government to step in and ensure the roles would be reinstated.
She also blamed the government for the job losses. The hospital, however, has identified reductions in philanthropic allocations as being behind the cuts.
""These job cuts and the Allan Labor government's silence on the issues clearly demonstrate the state's dire financial situation,"" Ms Crozier said.
""It's not good enough to sit back and let hospitals cut critical care jobs behind closed doors.""
A Victorian government spokesperson said there had been ""no changes"" to how it funds cancer care at the hospital.

The US actor, who is best known for his role as doctor Mark Sloan on Grey's Anatomy, confirmed his diagnosis to People magazine.
The 52-year-old said he was ""grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter"".
He said he would continue to work and was ""looking forward to returning to the set of Euphoria"", while asking for privacy for himself and his family.
You may already be familiar with ALS, especially if you took part in the viral ice bucket challenge to raise awareness of the condition back in 2014.
But if not, here are the disorder's main symptoms and treatments.
ALS is the most common form of motor neurone disease (MND).
It is a terminal degenerative disorder that causes progressive paralysis of the muscles.
According to Health Direct, because the disease affects the nerve cells in the brain and spine that control muscle movement, patients slowly lose the use of their limbs and ability to speak, swallow and breathe independently.
MND Australia says:
""Weak muscles, stiff limbs and overactive reflexes are key features of ALS.
""It most commonly starts in a limb (arm or leg) and progresses over time to other parts of the body.""
To clarify, MND is the widely used generic term in Australia, the UK and parts of Europe. ALS is used more generically in the US, Canada and South America.
Other stars who have been diagnosed with ALS include R&B singer Roberta Flack, Star Trek actor Kenneth Mitchell and SpongeBob creator Stephen Hillenburg.
Oscar winner Sandra Bullock's longtime partner Bryan Randall died from ALS in 2023.

The exact cause of ALS is unknown.
Health Direct says about one in 10 cases are ""familial"", meaning the condition is inherited.
ALS generally begins with muscle weakness that spreads and gets worse over time.
Initial symptoms might include:
As the disease progresses, patients may develop:
ALS does not usually affect the senses including the ability to taste, smell, touch or hear.
The rate at which ALS progresses can vary from one person to another.
But the mean survival time with the disease is two to five years.
However, some patients can live for decades, like Stephen Hawking, who lived with the disorder for 55 years before dying at 76.
There is currently no cure for ALS.",Unknown,Sat 12 Apr

Alzheimer's and Dementia","Scientists at three Australian universities believe a dark purple plum bred in Queensland could help delay, or even prevent, dementia.
Researchers at the University of Wollongong, the University of Queensland and Victoria University are testing juice from the Queen Garnet plum to see if it can protect the brain.
While each team's work is in its infancy, Victoria University's Michael Mathai says the results are very promising.
Plant breeder Bruce Topp and his colleague named the plum ""Queen"" for Queensland and ""Garnet"" for its flesh. (ABC Landline: Cameron Lang)
""There is evidence that people with early-stage dementia or perhaps mild cognitive impairment … can be helped by this,"" Professor Mathai said.
Dr Mathai has been adding plum extract to lab-grown neuronal cells, which mimic brain cells.
""We see increases in genes or proteins made by the cells, which drive the formation of new connections and the lengthening of the axons, which are like the telephone wires that connect to the different cells … that's the basis for things like making new memories,"" he said.
Michael Mathai is exploring the plum's potential to protect and possibly repair damaged brain tissue. (Supplied)
While the research could have huge implications for the aged care sector, Professor Mathai is eager to know if the plum can also repair traumatic brain injuries.
""We've already shown the extract will protect against chemically induced damage from oxidative stress, for example, that's a neuro protection area, but … will it help to repair already damaged tissue? That's something which we need to investigate further,"" he said.
In Brisbane, Yasmina Sultanbawa says the Queen Garnet plum's high levels of anthocyanins, a compound found in purple, blue and some red fruit and vegetables, may explain its potential to improve brain health.
Anthocyanins are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Studies suggest they help reduce blood pressure, delay diabetes and support heart health.
Professor Sultanbawa believes eating extracts, juices and powders made from the high anthocyanin plums could one day be a cheaper way of treating lifestyle diseases than prescription drugs, and without the side effects.
Her research team is investigating the connection between gut and brain health, and the impact of eating foods high in anthocyanins.

""If you can really get the gut and the brain to work together, and if you understand it more, you will get a much healthier population.""
Her lab is home to Australia's only scientific ""poo machine"", a series of glass chambers that recreate what happens in the human digestive system.
Tests have shown less than 5 per cent of anthocyanins are absorbed in the small intestine, with most of the absorption happening in the large intestine.

With dementia and brain injury placing increasing pressure on families and the economy, she argues it's only logical to invest more in gut-brain research — a move that may cost millions in the short term but could save billions in healthcare in the future.

Aged Care","On his first visit to Darwin during the election campaign, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese promised $60 million to build a 120-bed residential aged care facility in the Top End.
While Labor billed it as a ""new"", locked-in announcement, Territorians have been waiting for the facility for four years.
It was first promised by the Northern Territory's previous Labor government in 2021 and backed by the Commonwealth — but since then, nothing has been delivered.
For elderly Territorians such as Jillian Emerson-Smith, the damage of waiting for a place in the NT's overloaded aged care system has already been done.
Her husband Max was diagnosed with dementia five years ago and for some time, the pair was still able to live regionally in Mataranka, surrounded by the territory bush.
But eventually, Max needed more support.
Jill and Max lived in Mataranka, four hours south of Darwin, before they had to move to the city for his care. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)
They couldn't find it in Mataranka, so they moved to Darwin.
As Max's condition became more severe, Jill had to make the heart-wrenching transition from life partner to full-time carer.
Eventually, his care needs became so great, he couldn't be left alone.
Jill missed the funerals of both her brother and sister-in-law because she couldn't find respite care.
""You are at breaking point, and that in itself is incredibly difficult to acknowledge,"" she said.
Jill says she was at ""breaking point"" while looking after Max full-time. (ABC News: Michael Franchi)
When the couple finally confronted the reality Max needed more support than at-home care, they were turned back from two residential aged care facilities.
One had a waitlist spanning more than a year, the other was three months. Both were unbearable.
The Northern Territory is set to get 60 new aged-care beds, but advocates say it will not meet the growing demand.
""The wait times — it was just cruel,"" said Jill.
""I felt incredibly alone and isolated, and there was nothing I could do about it.""
After what felt like an endless three months, an aged care place opened up at a private facility in Darwin, offering Jill much-needed relief.
Currently 60 to 80 elderly Territorians are hospitalised on any given day according to NT Health, which contributes to severe overcrowding in Royal Darwin Hospital.
Insiders have told the ABC the bed block means the hospital often operates under emergency conditions.

The former NT government's promised aged care facility was to be funded by the Commonwealth and include 60 beds, with 12 of those for specialist dementia care.
The plan had been to partner with the private sector to deliver the facility next to the Palmerston Regional Hospital, outside Darwin.
But earlier this year, NT Health confirmed the former government had not found any providers that could both build and manage the facility.
Anthony Albanese said Australia's aged care system was neglected before Labor took government in 2022. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)
In the meantime, a federal overhaul of aged care funding left its future in limbo.
Now federal Labor has committed to building the same facility with double the number of beds.
The prime minister argues during its first term in government, Labor has turned around an aged care system in ""crisis"".
""Is there more work to do? Absolutely,"" Mr Albanese said.
Shadow Minister for Health and Aged Care Anne Ruston said an elected Coalition government would ""invest up to $60 million in aged care infrastructure to ensure Territorians get the care they need, when they need it"".
""The Coalition has been working constructively with the NT government and local providers on this issue and how best to remove existing barriers to investment in the Top End,"" she said.

NT Health Minister Steve Edgington believes the cost will be double what Labor has set aside.
Council on the Ageing NT's Sue Shearer has also pointed out more than half those beds will be immediately snapped up by people on the hospital waitlist.

Sue Shearer says the government needs to do more to attract aged care staff to the territory. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)
""We have the fastest growing number of seniors in the country … they need to be able to age very safely and have the care they deserve.""
She believes whichever party forms government needs to do more to attract aged care staff to the NT, and support First Nations Territorians living remotely to age on country.
Having spent years waiting for updates, Jill is sceptical about whether any government will deliver the facility.

Influenza","Doctors say now is the best time to get a flu shot amid a surge in influenza cases across Australia.
The number of lab-confirmed flu cases recorded nationally between January and March this year was 59 per cent higher than the same time last year, according to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP).
RACGP president Michael Wright said the increase indicated an early start to the flu season.
""We are definitely telling people that the flu is circulating in the community,"" Dr Wright said.
The advice was echoed by the Australian Medical Association, which said the best time to get a flu shot was from April onwards.
It came after the northern hemisphere experienced a significant influenza season, with some UK hospitals overwhelmed by the winter peak and the US recording the largest influenza season since the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
Michael Wright says it is the right time to get a flu shot. (Supplied: RACGP)
Dr Wright said the early spike in Australian cases was an ominous sign, and it was important to book in for a flu shot sooner rather than later.
A record number of influenza cases has been recorded in Australia, jumping 50 per cent from the same period last year. Experts are predicting flu season to come earlier than usual.
He said a flu vaccine would remain effective for up to five months, taking recipients through to the end of the season.
""If you start getting it now, you'll have that immunity when we get to the peak flu season, which is around July/ August,"" Dr Wright said.
More than 4,000 people were hospitalised in Australia with influenza last year.
Dr Wright said those in higher-risk groups should start talking to their GP about accessing free influenza vaccinations under the National Immunisation Program (NIP).

That includes people over 65, those with chronic health conditions, pregnant women, and children over six months and under five Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

Fertility and Infertility","In what's thought to be an Australian first, a woman from Brisbane has unknowingly given birth to a baby whose genetics belong to strangers.
The error was discovered in February by major fertility company Monash IVF, after the birth parents asked to transfer their remaining frozen embryos to another provider.
Monash IVF has said ""human error' was the cause of the embryo mix-up.
While experts are saying this case is unprecedented in Australia, it's happened multiple times in the US, with cases hitting the headlines as early as 1999.
It's led to questions about whether stricter regulations need to be enforced here.
Griffith Law School Associate Professor Malcolm Smith said under current legislation governing artificial inception procedures, the birthing mother was presumed to be the legal parent, as was her partner.
However, that legislation was designed for situations where a donor embryo was used, not where a mix-up occurred.
Malcolm Smith says a court would have to determine any potential challenge to legal parentage. (Supplied.)
There was a possible legal argument that the valid consent that legal frameworks rely on was not given by the mother, due to the clinic's mistake and embryo mix-up, and a challenge to legal parentage may therefore be possible.
""That would ultimately have to be determined by a court,"" he said.
Any decision would also likely turn on what was in the best interest of the child.
Macquarie University Associate Professor Mianna Lotz, who specialises in reproductive ethics, said should an embryo mix-up case make it to court, bioethicists like her may be drawn upon to give evidence.
Mianna Lotz says bioethicists such as herself may be called on if an embryo mix-up case made it to court. (Supplied.)
""Many ethicists want to emphasise the moral significance of the interests of the gestational/birthing mother, which can often be overlooked in favour of the interests of genetic progenitors,"" she said.
""We put a lot of weight on the labour and the investment of the woman.""
Associate Professor Lotz said in Australia, parenthood was often defined as comprising two distinct roles, but society was rife with examples of co-parenting and mixed families, where a child may have more than two parents.
There are a number of documented cases of embryo mix-up in the US, where families have taken legal action as a result.
Examples include a lawsuit filed in 2021, where a mix-up at a Californian clinic saw two couples raising children that were not biologically theirs for months, before swapping the infants.
In a more recent case, a US woman from Georgia sued her clinic after giving birth to a baby of African-American appearance, despite herself and her donor being white.

Adam Wolf is the US-based lawyer representing the woman involved in that case, and has represented eight clients who have experienced an embryo mix-up — both parents whose embryos were accidentally implanted in another woman, and mothers who birthed children who were not biologically theirs.
He said any time such an error occurred it was ""a tragedy for everybody involved"".
Mr Wolf said these were the ""Wild West days of the fertility industry"" in the US.
""There's virtually no oversight, no regulation, at least as it pertains to the American fertility industry.""
He said Australia could learn from the US experience, and instigate stringent government oversight.
""You could have random and unannounced inspections of the labs of fertility clinics, there could be training and credentialling programs for the people who work in the labs of fertility clinics.""
US-based lawyer Adam Wolf says Australia could learn from the US IVF experience. (Supplied: Adobe)
Representing both sides has left him with a profound understanding of what both biological and birth parents go through in an embryo mix-up case.
""For the biological parents, who sometimes have never even met their children, I mean, how horrific,"" he said.
""To think about some strangers raising your child, not being able to know what your child looks like, maybe not being raised with the same set of values or with the same faith, that you would want your child to be raised.
""Then on the other side of it, for the birth parent who wants to keep her child, this is the child that she grew, that she birthed, that she's raising, that she's sometimes breastfeeding, on taking care of, bonding with.""
From his experience in the US, the genetic parents typically got custody of the child if they wanted it.
""I think the courts gravitate toward the importance of biology,"" he said.
The situation may play out differently in Australia.
Australian journalist Genevieve Gannon has been monitoring the issue of embryo mix-ups going all the way back to 1999, when the first widely-reported case, Fasano v Rogers, in the US, hit the headlines.
""Donna Fasano gave birth to twin boys that she and her husband Richard named Vincent and Joseph, however DNA testing later revealed that Joseph was the biological son of Deborah and Robert Rogers, who were patients at the same IVF clinic the Fasano's had attended,"" Ms Gannon said.
The first widely reported case of an embryo mix-up was in the US in 1999.  (Supplied: Adobe)

Ms Gannon said it was ""heartbreaking"" to read about what happened to the two families.
""Unfortunately, the meetings between the Fasano's and the Rogers were tense, and the Rogers sought a court order to stop the Fasano’s from seeing Joseph.""

Health","Eamon Lynham collapses on the polished wooden floor of the family home he shares with his parents — mum Pam and dad Anthony, a respected surgeon and former politician.
Minutes earlier, the 27-year-old youngest of four Lynham sons was rinsing cups in the kitchen sink. It's a few days out from Christmas 2023. He has a loving girlfriend, a job in information technology he's passionate about, and in a week or so, he plans to start searching for an apartment to buy after saving enough for a deposit. Life is good.

But in the seconds it takes to walk from the kitchen to the dining room, where he slumps to the floor, Eamon's life — and that of his family — changes forever.
An ambulance is called, and he's taken to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) — where his father spent so much of his surgical career. He fondly refers to it as ""my hospital"".
It's there, after scans and tests, Eamon is diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and aggressive type of brain cancer.
""The tumour was everywhere — down his spinal cord, through his brain,"" his father says, shaking his head.

Doctors tell Eamon and his family: ""There's nothing we can do.""
He's given months to live.
""That's when you start looking for clinical trials. That's all you've got,"" his father says.
""I even said to him: 'I'm not going to let you go, son, without giving it a good fight'.
""I got nowhere. Nowhere. In my head I still think: 'Is there more that could have been done?' Did I miss something?'""
Dr Lynham spent years as a maxillofacial surgeon, rebuilding the broken faces of people — mostly young men — injured by alcohol-induced rage.
In 2014, he entered state politics for the Australian Labor Party as the member for the north Brisbane seat of Stafford, to champion measures aimed at reducing alcohol-fuelled violence, serving in the Palaszczuk cabinet from 2015 until retiring from parliament in 2020.

But even he could not find a clinical trial for his son in time. Australia has no easy-to-navigate central site, or dedicated government office that assists patients, their families or doctors to locate every available human trial for a particular illness or disease and match people to suitable studies.
""Here's me, a consultant surgeon, with all my connections, with all my knowledge, a previous minister of the government … how tough was it? It was virtually impossible,"" Dr Lynham said.
""I thought to myself, if I'm having all this trouble, what hope does Mr and Mrs Smith at the Gold Coast have … if their son or daughter was ill?

At the same time, Dr Lynham says, many Australian researchers are struggling to recruit patients to their studies.
When he finally found a clinical trial for his son, it was too late. His boy was too sick.
Eamon died at home on May 25 last year, his mother's birthday, five months after being diagnosed. He had just turned 28.

Photos and videos of the shy, young man with a quirky sense of humour play on repeat on an electronic photo frame in his parents' Brisbane home.
There are pictures of Eamon as a young boy with platinum blonde hair; of him with his three older brothers and parents; at weddings; on holidays; with his girlfriend; holding his baby nephew.
""Family is everything to us and Eamon was everything,"" Dr Lynham says.
The former Queensland MP smiles as he reminisces about the good-natured ribbing his three older sons — Brayton, Rohan and Sean — meted out over how spoilt Eamon was as the youngest.

Eamon lived with his parents and would often travel with them overseas.
""Parents tend to be a little bit better off when the youngest comes along and the youngest gets treated to better holidays than the oldest ever got,"" Dr Lynham says.
The Lynham boys grew up on acreage at Chandler, in Brisbane's south-east, where Eamon had a pet goose named ""Goose"".
Goose would go swimming with the littlest Lynham, diving under the water together in the family's backyard pool. The goose would also often join them inside the house in the evenings.
""We'd be sitting there watching TV and the goose used to peck on the door and Eamon would go and get the goose, sit it on his lap and the goose used to sit there watching TV with him,"" Dr Lynham recalls, smiling at the memory.
""Unbelievable.""

As he braces for the 12-month anniversary of Eamon's death next month, the loss of his son is still raw for the respected doctor.
He admits he's overworking, continuing to operate as a surgeon part-time and attending meetings as a member of multiple boards to help him cope.
But the roadblocks he faced in trying to find a clinical trial for his son have also left him so incensed, he needed to do something about it.

Beyond his anguish, he's burning inside.
""I was feverish about this whole thing,"" Dr Lynham says.
He's gone public with his son's story hoping by throwing a spotlight on the issue, it may lead to change, particularly during a federal election campaign.
Anthony Lynham reads through some of the many reports that have been written across more than a decade suggesting solutions to Australia’s fragmented clinical trial system. (ABC News: Janelle Miles)
The medical specialist knows taking part in a clinical trial is unlikely to have saved his son, but Eamon ""wanted to take a punt, he wanted to have a go"".
""He couldn't care about the side effects,"" Dr Lynham says.
It would have provided some hope, however fleeting.
In drug trials, participants are usually randomly allocated to receive the active drug or a placebo.
Patients have no guarantees they will be on the active arm of the trial, but research participants are generally monitored more closely than other patients.
The reality is, the main benefit in patients taking part in clinical trials is adding to existing medical knowledge, given only about 10 per cent of drug trials are successful. It's frequently a gift to the next generation of patients rather than the trial volunteers themselves.
But researcher Nigel McMillan, a professor of infectious disease and oncology at Griffith University, says amid the many failed drug studies are ""remarkable success stories"", citing the chronic myeloid leukaemia drug, Gleevec.

A trial into the drug more than 20 years ago had to be stopped halfway through when an overview board realised most of the patients on the treatment arm ""were being cured"".
""They stopped that trial early because it was unethical to continue giving people placebo when clearly the drug was working so well,"" Professor McMillan says.
""This is a drug we still use today.""
As an internationally recognised cancer researcher, Professor McMillan receives regular emails from patients or their families wanting to know about clinical trials.
""People are desperate, of course, to know what's the latest and greatest,"" he says.

While he describes Australia as ""a hub of clinical trials"", he backs Dr Lynham's assessment of a fragmented system — divided between state and territory jurisdictions — in need of a huge overhaul, particularly in terms of improving patient access to research studies, no matter where they live.
""Every clinical trial in Australia has to be registered. We have that information. It's just not presented in a way that the public can easily get access to,"" Professor McMillan says.
Clinical trials can also face lengthy delays waiting for multiple ethics committee approvals, particularly if several hospitals or universities are involved, even within the same state. Individual hospitals and universities often require the approval of their own ethics committees.
Dr Lynham says answers to the problems are already available, articulated in ""inquiry after inquiry"" and report after report dating back more than a decade.
Reform could allow hospitals a greater ability to be a part of nationally important clinical trials.


  (ABC News: Alice Pavlovic)
He says former Australian chief scientist Ian Chubb eloquently articulated solutions in a January 2023 consultation report into improving the clinical trial environment in Australia.
Professor Chubb says there's been ""a lot of progress"" towards the establishment of a national ""one stop shop"" for clinical trials and human research approvals since then.
The federal government included $18 million towards the design phase of a new national clinical trials platform in the 2024-25 budget.
""The one stop shop includes what we call a front door, a public access portal, which is being developed as we speak so that it's easy to use, it's intuitive and straight forward,"" Professor Chubb says.

The vision is that the website will be supported by a staffed office, likely to be within the federal health department. That is yet to be costed and funded, but Professor Chubb is hopeful, regardless of who wins the May 3 election.
Professor Chubb has himself benefited from taking part in a drug trial after being diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2015.
He was enrolled into a clinical trial for an experimental immunotherapy treatment after the cancer had spread to both lungs.
Without treatment, he was told at the time, he only had months to live.
How do we improve our understanding and access to clinical trials?
But here he is, years later, owing his life to medical science, the very thing he has spent a lifetime championing.
Professor Chubb says the vision for the national one stop shop is that it will be much more than a portal for patients and their doctors to access clinical trials.
He wants to streamline clinical trial approval processes so that trials can be assessed by one ethics committee, rather than several.
It's about patients being able to access experimental treatments sooner, including Australians living in regional areas through telehealth.
Melbourne-based cancer specialist John Zalcberg says it cannot happen soon enough, agreeing with Dr Lynham the existing system is ""not fit for purpose"".
""It's frustrating for people caught in this time warp when things aren't available,"" he says. ""It's so important to patients that they are able to access clinical trials when they want them. They're a really important way to helping people without other options.""
Professor John Zalcberg says improving Australia's clinical trials landscape will act as a magnet for more pharmaceutical companies to come to Australia to run research studies. (Supplied)
Professor Zalcberg, who divides his time between Alfred Health and Monash University, says if Professor Chubb can deliver on his vision, it will act as a magnet for more pharmaceutical companies to come to Australia to run clinical trials.
""In the end, companies develop drugs, not universities, not hospitals,"" he says.
""Companies are spending small fortunes trying to find ways of making sure that once they initiate a trial, they can actually recruit to it, and if they're going to test a new product, that they can do that in a way that's … timely and cost efficient.""
Australia needs the national one stop shop to remain competitive in the clinical trial space, he says.
When Eamon Lynham was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2023, his family searched for a clinical trial to place him in. (Supplied)
The University of Queensland Clinical Trials Centre director Nadine Foster says Professor Chubb's proposed reforms are ""much needed"" in Australia.
Professor Foster arrived in Australia more than four years ago from England, where she led clinical trials embedded in the National Health Service (NHS).
She says the NHS Be Part of Research Website is an international exemplar for matching patients to clinical trials.

""I think the Australian process that's being proposed through the national one stop shop and national clinical trial front door is learning from that overseas way of doing things,"" she says.
But she would like to see Australia go further.
""I think a lost opportunity at the moment is to not have linked that idea of a national portfolio of high-quality clinical trials to the accreditation of our hospitals in Australia,"" Professor Foster says.
""What it would do is really help hospitals and health care clinics decide, of all of the research we could be involved in, which ones are the real priorities, which ones are nationally important.
""They're often multi-centre, large trials that provide definitive evidence about what we do in health and medical care and for the first time, we could link that to the hospitals' accreditation process and, I believe, along with the national clinical trials front door, that type of approach would lead to greater change.
""I think that would be more transformational.""

Food Safety","Spinach and mixed salad products are back on the supermarket shelves and safe to consume after a widespread recall due to E. coli.
The potentially fatal shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) was found in two pre-packaged spinach products during routine food safety checks in Queensland last month.
It prompted a recall of nearly 50 salad products sold at Coles, Woolworths, Aldi and IGA stores, in all states and territories except Western Australia.
The investigation into the cause of the outbreak is ongoing.
There have not been any reports of illness connected to the contamination.

Supermarkets affected by the recall have restocked their salad products this week.
Coles said it had resumed selling spinach and mixed salads, while affected Woolworths stores were expected to receive fresh stock this week.
Independent supermarket distributor Metcash also confirmed its IGA stores had salad products back on the shelves.
While packaged spinach products are available to buy again, questions remain about the E. coli detection.
Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) said its investigation into the outbreak, which was discovered via routine searches, was continuing.
Federal and state health agencies are also assisting the inquiry.
It said the source of the outbreak remained unknown.

Consumer behaviour expert Nitika Garg, from the University of New South Wales, said the recall would affect how people felt about the salads.
She said the amount of time it took for consumers to feel comfortable again varied.
""Something like salads or spinach or eggs, for example, these recalls, while not preferable, do happen occasionally,"" she said.
""People do recover from them a little bit faster than say, a recall on a car.""
She implored the food industry to ensure its testing regime was stringent.
""This costs the retailers as well as the growers,"" she said.

Warning: Readers are advised this story contains content that readers may find distressing.
It's been almost a month since South Australian authorities were first alerted to hundreds of dead marine life washing up at Waitpinga Beach and Parsons Beach on the Fleurieu Peninsula.
Some beachgoers also reported seeing a white foam and said they were experiencing respiratory symptoms including coughing, sore eyes and blurry vision, after coming into contact with it.
On March 25 — after a joint investigation between the Environment Protection Authority (EPA), the Department of Primary Industries and Regions South Australia (PIRSA), the Department for Environment and SA Health — it was confirmed that the deaths were as a result of a toxic microalgae.
The EPA confirmed the species of microalgae as Karenia mikimotoi — which is ""toxic to fish and invertebrates"".
""Karenia mikimotoi can also cause mass mortalities of marine species at varying concentrations,"" an EPA spokesperson said.
The EPA explained that the microalgal bloom has been driven by an ""ongoing marine heatwave"" and ""little wind"".
""The event has been driven by an ongoing marine heatwave, with marine water temperatures currently 2.5C warmer than usual, as well as relatively calm marine conditions with little wind and small swell,"" they said.

There have been reports of dying fish across the state's coast including more beaches along the Fleurieu Peninsula, beaches on Kangaroo Island and at Edithburgh on the Yorke Peninsula.
The EPA also confirmed they had received reports from the public of ""discoloured water"" at Goolwa Beach, Chiton Rock and Port Elliott last weekend, as well as ""affected sea life on Kangaroo Island"".
However, there is yet to be confirmation from authorities as to whether these additional issues are as a result of the same microalgae bloom, with investigations and testing still ongoing.

PIRSA also confirmed they had received reports of dead cockles washing up at Goolwa Beach, and said they had attended to obtain samples for testing.
Underwater photographer Paul Macdonald, who has been diving at Edithburgh for ""almost 30 years"", said he went diving on the weekend but was heartbroken by what he saw.
""Pretty much everything was dead, it was really heartbreaking,"" he said.
""We could see the water wasn't quite right, it was a brown-y colour with no visibility.
Mr Macdonald said ""fish life was prolific"" just two weeks ago when he last went diving.

A spokesperson from PIRSA said initial results taken from around Edithburgh and the lower Yorke Peninsula have yet to ""pinpoint a cause"" of the recent fish deaths.
""While investigations are ongoing, initial results from dissolved oxygen, salinity and water temperature testing along with water samples collected by PIRSA in the area so far have been unable to pinpoint a cause with no abnormalities recorded other than slightly higher water temperatures,"" they said.
Although there hasn't been reports of dead marine life, fishers in the state's South East said they have noticed the presence of algae and are concerned of its affect and spread with the upcoming warm weather.
Kingston SE Recreational Fishers Association chair Lynton McGuinness said he has noticed ""patches of the green-coloured algae"" but that there had been ""no sign of any dead fish or cockles"" yet.
""The algae bloom is there and if it thickens up it could create a problem,"" he said.
Local surfer Anthony Rowland visited Tunkalilla Beach, west of Victor Harbor, in late March where he observed at least eight dead kangaroos on and near the path to the beach.
""There were a couple of joeys standing by themselves and a couple more standing near the corpses,"" he said.
Mr Rowland said he also observed approximately 30 kangaroos acting strangely.

""I approached the group and then two or three just stacked it and couldn't get up and so I stopped walking towards the group because I didn't want them to all stress out,"" he said.
Associate professor Wayne Boardman called for the government to take action and investigate the kangaroo deaths.
""You're seeing deaths of fish and you're seeing clinical signs in humans associated with going down there, coughing and sneezing and so on. And you're then seeing animals down there that are not doing well,"" he said.
The Department for Environment and Water said this week that there was so far ""no evidence"" to suggest that the algal bloom is linked to the affected kangaroos, but is undertaking further tests.

""Tests undertaken by the Department of Primary Industries and Regions SA (PIRSA) have so far not found any evidence that either infectious diseases or Karenia mikimotoi are implicated in the clinical signs of disease seen in affected kangaroos at Tunkalilla Beach,"" a spokesperson said.
However, they said it was currently unknown whether the death of other marine animals were linked to the algal bloom.
Marine ecologist Janine Baker has warned that this is a ""significant"" bloom that is affecting sea life in ""many ways"".
""In this case, the bloom is very widespread and its affecting so many species in the marine environment.
""There's many ways in which this particular algae are affecting the animals.""
Ms Baker said one of the main dangers of Karenia mikimotoi is that it is ""globally distributed"" and ""tends to bloom in all kinds of conditions"".
A dead sea slug found washed up at Encounter Bay on March 18. (ABC News: Caroline Horn)
She said the blooms most commonly occur with ""hot sea surface temperatures"" and a ""period of calm conditions"" as well as ""hot air temperatures"".
Ms Baker said that when the live algae cells die, they sink to the bottom of the ocean floor which ""reduces the oxygen content"" and causes a ""bacterial build-up"", causing marine life to ""basically suffocate"".
""It's quite a serious way to die,"" she said.
Karenia mikimotoi can cause""allergic-type responses"" in humans and result in ""stomach upsets or flu-like symptoms"".
""Human exposure, including through breathing in algae particles, can cause respiratory and eye irritation or skin rashes in some people, while ingestion could cause stomach upsets or flu-like symptoms,"" the EPA said.
Principle water quality adviser at SA Health David Cunliffe told ABC Radio Adelaide that the algae is not toxic to humans, but the department is advising people to avoid affected beaches.
""We're not advising people not to go into the water, what we are advising people though is to avoid those parts of the beach that are obviously discoloured or have the foam,"" he said.
Dr Cunliffe says there is no issue in humans consuming fish, as long as they are caught alive, but warned people not to ""harvest dead fish or dead cockles for human consumption"".

SA Health has confirmed there are no long-term effects on humans exposed to Karenia mikimotoi.
Authorities are continuing to work alongside each other in relation to the microalgae bloom, and said they are expecting it to ""dissipate naturally"" over time.
""The EPA expects the microalgae will continue to dissipate naturally over time depending on wind, swell and tidal conditions,"" an EPA spokesperson said.
Meanwhile, the Department for Environment and Water confirmed on Thursday that Waitpinga and Parsons beaches had re-opened after being closed for several weeks.
""Waitpinga Beach and Parsons Beach, where significant levels of the bloom were first detected in early March, have now reopened after algae levels reduced,"" the statement said.
""Visitors to those two beaches should still follow SA Health’s advice and avoid entering the water if it is discoloured or foamy.""

Monash IVF CEO Michael Knaap said the clinic was providing support to both families involved.
""On behalf of Monash IVF, I want to say how truly sorry I am for what has happened,"" he said.
Monash IVF said it adhered to strict laboratory safety measures to safeguard and protect the embryos in its care and that the incident was the result of ""human error"".
""Since becoming aware of this incident, we have undertaken additional audits and we're confident that this is an isolated incident,"" Mr Knaap said.
Monash IVF has also commissioned an independent investigation into the incident.Last year, Monash IVF settled a class action with no admission of liability, following claims it used inaccurate genetic testing and destroyed potentially viable embryos.
More than 700 patients across the country were involved in the class action which saw Monash IVF agree to pay a $56 million settlement.

""However, the embryo transfer occurred prior to Queensland Health becoming the ART regulator,"" the spokeswoman said.
The ART Act was passed on September 10 last year and followed an investigation into ART providers in the state by Queensland's health ombudsman.
""We will work with Monash IVF to reinforce safeguards in their Queensland clinics and ensure any risks are identified and mitigated,"" the Queensland Health spokeswoman said.
The ombudsman report, released last July, found the area that received the most complaints related to the collection, storage, identification and distribution of gametes and embryos.
Family creation lawyer Sarah Jefford, who specialises in surrogacy and donor conception law, said the incident was ""just devastating"".
""As far as I'm aware, this particular case is unique to Australia but is not unique to the rest of the world,"" she said.
""We have a few other cases [globally] where the wrong embryo has been transferred resulting in the birth of a child.""

Water Pollution","A four-month investigation into the discovery of ""forever chemicals"" in a New South Wales river has identified a composting facility as a major contamination source.
The NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) began an extensive testing program of the Belubula River in the state's central west after PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, were detected last year.
In December it honed in on potential contamination sources from three industrial sites in the catchment, including the Australian Native Landscapes (ANL) compost site, a Blayney Council-run landfill and the Newmont Cadia gold mine.
A type of PFAS, known as PFOS, was detected at 16 of 20 locations it sampled.
All 16 detections breached ecological water quality guidelines for PFOS set by the Heads of EPA Australia and New Zealand (HEPA).
PFAS are laboratory-made chemicals that persist in the environment, bioaccumulate and are potentially toxic.

The Belubula River weaves through prime agricultural land between Bathurst and Orange, acting as a water source for livestock.
In mid-2024 landholders raised the alarm about the health of the river after discovering foam in the waterway containing PFOS.
The EPA said the results to date ""indicate the risk to livestock is low, but as a precaution, the EPA will be taking soil samples for testing"" at properties where livestock graze adjacent to the impacted waterways.
There are no livestock and irrigation water guidelines for PFAS.
Landholders noticed foam in the river mid-2024. (ABC Central West: Micaela Hambrett)
The latest round of EPA testing reaffirms results from October and keeps the spotlight on ANL near Blayney, which is located on a former mine site next to Cowriga Creek.
The samples taken in December show the highest levels were found in Cowriga Creek downstream of ANL and in Mackenzies Waterholes Creek near Blayney Council's landfill.
Both creeks are tributaries of the Belubula River.
PFOS levels upstream of the ANL site were 0.0025 ug/L (micrograms per litre), while the results immediately downstream were 0.15 ug/L.
The downstream result is more than 650 times HEPA's ecological water guideline for freshwater species.

The EPA also conducted testing near Cadia gold mine which lies to the north of the Belubula River, between Blayney and Orange.
PFOS was detected at 13 of 16 sites tested on the mine while groundwater to the west and south of the site exceeded ecological guidelines in six of 10 bores.
""The groundwater quality appears to pose limited risk to livestock, irrigation, or the surrounding environment,"" the EPA said.
It will now sample Cadia's tailings facility where mine waste is stored.
In a statement, Cadia said it acknowledged the findings and it would continue to work closely with the EPA in its investigations to uphold its ""commitment to environmental stewardship and transparency"".
As a result of its investigation, the environmental watchdog has added conditions to all three sites' environmental protection licences and has ordered the operators to carry out preliminary investigations into the presence of PFAS.
The operators of each site must review ""all likely products and materials that may have contained PFAS"" and have been used or stored on site.

They must also examine if any soils, surface water or groundwater have been impacted by the chemicals and whether they have posed any risks to human or environmental health.
""These assessments will inform the EPA's future regulatory activities,"" the EPA said.
""The presence of PFAS in the environment does not necessarily indicate that there is a health risk, however identifying sites that require investigation is an important precaution to reduce the risk off community exposure to PFAS.""

Healthcare Facilities","Sydney's beleaguered Northern Beaches Hospital (NBH) looks set to be handed back to public control.
Its private operator Healthscope said the public-private model used there was ""no longer compatible"" with the state government's objectives.
In a statement issued on Thursday, Healthscope said it was willing to talk.
""Healthscope has confirmed to the New South Wales Government that it is willing to commence discussions about returning the public hospital at Northern Beaches Hospital to the NSW public system, consistent with the project deed,"" it said in a statement.
Healthscope made the major announcement on Thursday afternoon. (AAP: Dan Himbrechts)
The hospital was run under a public-private partnership (PPP) signed by a NSW Coalition government in 2014 and was set to last until 2038.
However, the Minns government scrapped the future use of such partnerships with legislation last month called ""Joe's Law"".
The hospital had come under fire after the death of two-year-old Joe Massa last year.
He died from a cardiac arrest after his parents took him to the emergency department of the NBH in September 2024.

An internal investigation found serious failures in the hospital's management, including wrongly triaging Joe as a less serious category of patient and failing to respond to requests from his parents to give him IV fluids.
He was transferred to Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick after suffering a cardiac arrest, where he died due to brain damage.
Flanked by Joe Massa's family, NSW Health Minister Ryan Park last month said the current public-private model was not sustainable.
""The model that is Northern Beaches Hospital is not a model that we believe should be running our hospitals here in New South Wales,"" he said.
""We believe that public hospitals should be in public hands, we cannot afford this type of model to be in place again.""
The Minns government is set to introduce the legislation known as ""Joe's Law"", which will protect hospitals providing emergency, surgical and inpatient services from any future government entering such partnerships which limit public control over hospital services.
Healthscope chief executive Tino La Spina said the move to hand back the hospital was not a reflection on staff performance.
""NBH is a first-class facility, served by qualified, skilled nurses, doctors and staff, whose clinical performance has been acknowledged and commended by independent authorities."" Mr La Spina said.
He said Healthscope needed to work in alignment with the state government.
""The NSW government has recently introduced policy preventing the further use of PPPs in the health sector. Healthscope acknowledges that NBH continuing to operate as a PPP is no longer compatible with the government's objectives.
""We believe it is best for the patients, staff and the Northern Beaches community that it is returned to NSW Health, if that is the government's preferred outcome.""
Mr Park on Thursday said the government would ""carefully consider any proposal regarding Northern Beaches Hospital"".
""We can assure the community that Northern Beaches Hospital will continue to operate without interruption during any discussions,"" he said.
NSW Treasurer Daniel Mookhey said a change in legislation last month had nothing to do with the way the hospital was managed.
""The era of privatising acute hospitals is over. Certainly, for them to opportunistically profit from a change in policy is wrong,"" he said.
The treasurer said Healthscope should not expect to walk away from Northern Beaches Hospital with a profit.
""We do not want to see the private equity owners make a windfall gain at the public expense … we will be providing strict scrutiny to this transaction going forward.""
He said the taxpayers of NSW would expect the ""mismanagement"" of the hospital was not rewarded.

Health","An investigation into the sexual assault of a Townsville University Hospital nurse has found some clinical staff view unsafe patient behaviours as ""just part of the job"".
When the nurse was assaulted by a patient, who was known for ""verbal and physical aggression"", there was no clear procedure for staff to follow.
The health service has agreed to update procedures for line managers who are notified of sexual assault and make training mandatory service-wide.
The Queensland Nurses and Midwives Union expressed disappointment it had taken a serious incident for the health service to act.
The nurse was assaulted by a patient on a Townsville University Hospital ward in 2024. (ABC North Qld: Chloe Chomicki)
The investigation was launched in August 2024 after the nurse was sexually assaulted on the ward.
The patient was allowed to remain on the ward and was not moved until they allegedly assaulted the family member of another patient.
Townsville Hospital and Health Service's handling of the incident prompted the Queensland Nurses and Midwives' Union to demand an investigation.
The investigation involved an independent workplace health and safety lawyer, a member of the health service's sexual assault response team and a consumer representative.
The investigation found some staff appeared to see some unsafe patient behaviours as part of the job. (ABC North Qld: Chloe Chomicki)
Townsville Hospital and Health Service chief executive Kieran Keyes said there were several missed opportunities to support the staff member after the sexual assault.
""In August last year one of our nurses came to work just like any other day to care for her patients except that day she was sexually assaulted,"" he said.
Mr Keyes said he had met with the nurse to apologise unreservedly.
""She has worked with us every step of the way in investigating this incident and our response to it,"" he said.
""For one reason; an abundance of care for her colleagues so together we get this right should something similarly dreadful happen again.""
Keiran Keyes and Tony Mooney speak on the investigation findings. (ABC North Qld: Georgia Loney)
Mr Keyes said there had been no formal disciplinary process but a series of systemic gaps were found which he had to own as chief executive.
Health service board chair Tony Mooney echoed Mr Keyes' apology.
""I do want to acknowledge the hurt, pain and suffering, on behalf of our staff member who has had to endure ongoing issues,"" Mr Mooney said.
""The board, I am pleased to say, has fully endorsed recommendations for implementation.
""I want to make a fundamental point, we have a paramount responsibility to ensure the safety of all of our staff and the patients in their care.""
Findings and recommendations into the ""serious occupational violence incident"" were released on Thursday.
The document states that the sexual assault was unprecedented for the patient involved but they had previously displayed verbal and physical aggression.
Ward staff had taken steps to manage the patient's ""challenging behaviours"" but there was no management plan in place prior to the sexual assault.
""Some clinical staff viewed unsafe patient behaviours as 'just part of the job' at times,"" the report read.
Mr Keyes said that finding was particularly shocking and staff should not feel it was part of the job.
The safety investigation also considered the health service's immediate and longer-term incident response.
""The existing policy framework did not include a clear procedure or protocol for staff to follow in responding to this incident,"" it found.
Though the health service has a sexual assault response team there was limited awareness of the support the team could offer staff.
All four recommendations made to the Townsville Hosptial and Health Service have been accepted.
They included developing and implementing a clear Workplace Health and Safety critical incident response protocol and developing and delivering cultural change to reinforce staff safety.
The service said it had already delivered a recommended service-wide risk assessment for sexual harassment and sex and gender-based harassment.
A training course, Preventing and Addressing Sexual Harassment for Line Managers, will be reviewed, updated and made mandatory for line managers throughout the health service.
The Queensland Nurses and Midwives Union secretary Sarah Beaman welcomed any action to prevent a repeat of the incident.

Infectious Diseases","Anyone who has visited Sydney's CBD in the past 10 days has been told to monitor for symptoms of the potentially deadly Legionnaires' disease after six people were hospitalised.
Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia that typically develops once a strain of bacteria named Legionella pneumophila (Legionella) infects the lungs.
This bacteria is not spread from person to person but through aerosols.
NSW Health South Eastern Sydney Local Heath District Public Health Unit director Vicky Sheppeard said the six cases ""have a common factor of being in the Sydney CBD during their exposure period"".

Those who have been in the CBD over the past week and a half are urged to remain alert for any symptoms of the disease including fever, chills, a cough and shortness of breath.
Legionnaires' disease takes between two to 10 days to develop following exposure, according to Dr Sheppeard.
People who have been in the CBD who develop symptoms during this period are urged to visit their GP to get tested and receive treatment.
More than 500,000 people work in the CBD area, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
Outbreaks sometimes occur when bacteria from cooling towers in large buildings become contaminated.
Over the last three decades, legionnaires' disease has surged both in Australia and across the world, with experts not certain what's behind the increase.
Dr Sheppeard said NSW Health was working with the City of Sydney to investigating cooling towers in the city.
""We're actively taking steps to identify that tower and have it cleaned so other people don't become ill.""

Health Policy","Tracey David has a simple message for the politicians and bureaucrats who have so far refused to approve funding for her prosthetic nose.
""We are not cosmetic, we are not looking to enhance our face. We are looking to live with dignity,"" she said.
The New South Wales south coast grandmother received life-saving surgery to remove a malignant tumour from her face last year but was disappointed to learn there was no federal funding to help her cover the cost of a prosthetic.
""We desperately need the funding for head and neck cancer, for all people who need prostheses,"" she said.
In Australia, anyone needing a facial prosthetic must pay for it themselves. However, those below the neck can be paid for through government funding or private health insurance.
Ms David received a one-off payment through a NSW charity based at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, but said that funding would not last.
""It's only plastic — it gets dirty, it needs to be cleaned. They don't last long.
""So there you go, there's another $6–7,000.""
Cancer patients like Ms David are still waiting for answers ahead of the federal election.
Head and Neck Cancer Australia, which represents a relatively small number of patients seeking public funding to bring them into line with other prosthetic recipients, has been unable to secure a commitment before the May 3 election.
This is despite a 2024 Senate inquiry into rare cancers making it clear these patients were not being supported in accessing rehabilitation options.
Sydney pensioner Paolo Abate had his nose removed in an operation 10 years ago due to cancer.
He received funding through a Sydney Dental Hospital service but has now been told the funding is no longer available, causing him great anxiety.

""I am a pensioner. You can understand what life is like at the moment with the way things are going, so for me to save $5,000, it's a struggle,"" Mr Abate said.
""Because without a prosthesis I can't get out of the house. People without a nose, they don't look great.
""We scare people.""
Head and Neck Cancer Australia chief executive Nadia Rosen said even after the federal government had completed a review of funding, due later this year, there were no guarantees.

""We need it to happen sooner rather than later,"" she said.
""For people like Tracey and Paolo, some of our patients who are missing their nose, they are already living with devastating facial disfigurement and waiting any longer is simply not acceptable.
""We have asked for a very modest investment of around $13 million a year for people who are literally needing part of their face replaced.
""We have also provided the government and the opposition literally with a costed shovel-ready program that is based on the already existing breast prosthesis program.""
Health Minister Mark Butler said the federal government launched an independent review into the availability of prostheses programs to identify gaps in coverage.

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-10/measles-cases-outbreak-australia/105156008,Doctors warn of travel risks as measles cases surge in Australia,,"Be alert but not alarmed.
That's the message from doctors as Australia deals with a local surge of measles, sparked by a global rise in cases amid declining childhood vaccination rates.
A little more than three months into 2025, Australia has already recorded 54 measles cases for the year, including 20 in New South Wales, 17 in Victoria and 13 in Western Australia.
That's compared to 57 for all of last year, and just 26 in 2023, although Australia had previously dealt with significant numbers in 2019, when 284 cases were recorded.
While there have been cases of transmission within Australia, most cases are still occurring in people returning from overseas destinations experiencing outbreaks.
Medical professionals say the number one defence against the spread of measles is immunisation, and are urging people to check they're fully vaccinated against the disease, by having received two doses.

Newborns are able to receive their first vaccine between six to 12 months of age, depending on whether they're travelling to a high risk area, and their second dose for full protection at 18 months.
Royal Australian College of General Practitioners vice-president Ramya Raman said parents don't need to panic and can take normal precautions.
Dr Ramya Raman says there are ways of preventing the spread of the highly contagious disease. (ABC News: Tabarak Al Jrood)
""Precautions should always be considered, so handwashing, keeping surfaces nice and clean, and if anyone is feeling unwell to seek medical attention,"" she said.
""It is concerning that there is measles around, but we also have to remember that it is a condition that is preventable with a vaccination.
The outbreak has triggered measles alerts for the Northern Territory, Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland.
Dozens of potential exposure sites are listed in each of those jurisdictions and can be found on local health department websites.
Australian Medical Association president Danielle McMullen said the outbreak hadn't reached the point where doctors needed to advise families with newborns to avoid big crowds or parts of the country where measles has been detected.
Dr Danielle McMullen says parents of newborns should speak to their doctor before travelling overseas.  (Supplied: AMA)
""We also can't have people feeling like they need to live in a bubble for months and months of their lives,"" Dr McMullen said.
""Every family will make a bit of a risk decision, and at the moment there is no public health advice for people to be restricting their movements because of measles in particular.""
Although it's considered to be one of the most highly contagious diseases, widespread transmission of measles in Australia is still thought to be unlikely because of the nation's high immunisation rates among children.
There is concern from some medical experts, however, that there has been a decline in the proportion of children getting immunised since 2020.
Parents of newborns, and those who aren't vaccinated against measles may want to consider speaking to their doctor before travelling overseas, especially to countries where the disease is more prevalent.
Australians are being urged to check their vaccination status and get their children vaccinated. (ABC News: Niall Lenihan )
""It's important for people to remember that not all countries have measles as well controlled as Australia does,"" Dr McMullen said.
""When planning international travel, particularly with infants and very young children, it's always important to have a conversation with your doctor and to think about the various infection risks that can occur overseas, and make decisions about travel according to that.""
But the vaccination rate is patchier with adults, with Australians aged in their mid 30s to early 60s likely to have had only one dose.
Some adults who have migrated to Australia may have also had only one dose (or none) and are also recommended for vaccination.
Since the initial measles outbreak in the early 1990's, Australia has had several significant peaks in cases.
Along with other infectious diseases, the data is collected by a national authority, the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System.
Victoria is stepping up its calls for people to ensure they're fully vaccinated against measles, with recent cases in the state not coming from returned travellers.
Adults can catch and spread the disease, especially if they are under-vaccinated. Here's what you need to know.
""What we are seeing with measles right now in Victoria is concerning — it is highly contagious and can lead to serious health complications including pneumonia, brain inflammation and death,"" a Victorian Department of Health spokesperson said.
""Recent cases in Victoria have no history of overseas travel or links to other measles cases meaning there is now local transmission of measles in the community.
""Vaccination against measles is safe, effective, and free — and the best way to avoid serious illness.""
Victoria's total of 17 cases so far this year compares to eight at the same time last year.

The death of 62-year-old Petar Josipovic at the Royal Adelaide Hospital on September 14, 2023, is being investigated at an inquest before South Australian State Coroner David Whittle.
The court heard Mr Josipovic was placed on a waiting list for category one cardiac surgery on June 21, 2023, which should have been scheduled within 30 days, but was initially listed to occur 54 days later, on August 14, 2023.
It was then rescheduled on multiple occasions before Mr Josipovic was rushed to hospital on August 24, where he suffered a cardiac arrest.
He had successful emergency surgery early the next day, but later complications led to his death three weeks later.

Counsel assisting the coroner, Emma Roper, said an expert would tell the court that if Mr Josipovic had been operated on within the 30 days, ""it is probable that his death would have been prevented"".
Ms Roper told the court Mr Josipovic's son, Nick Josipovic, wrote to the coroner on the day his father died raising concerns about the delays, while an unidentified staff specialist also filed a report outlining concerns about the delays.
She said the inquest would explore eight topics around Mr Josipovic's care, including why his surgery was scheduled outside the 30-day guidelines and the reasons behind the cancellations.
Mr Josipovic's son gave evidence on Wednesday and said he believed his father's surgery was first scheduled for July 31.

He said, on one occasion, when the hospital called to postpone the surgery without providing a new date, he pleaded with the hospital to keep the scheduled date because his father's condition was worsening.
He said his father had complained to the hospital that his condition was worsening.
Mr Josipovic said after his father's admission via ambulance on August 24, staff told them they could not access his outpatient file and his family members had to tell staff about his previous presentations to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital emergency department.
""We were tasked with advising them that Dad was scheduled for surgery the next day,"" he said.
He said when his father was being wheeled into surgery, he was ""unable to utter a single word because of how much he was struggling to breathe"".

Her pulse rate had also risen from below 80 to about 95 beats per minute, and she had complained of ""eight out of ten"" pain for which she was given medication.
She had also vomited multiple times despite being given anti-nausea medication.
A report later conducted by the Wesley Hospital analysing the event found that Ms Campbell was registered as being at a ""zero"" on a patient deterioration early warning score at 8am and at midday on the day of her discharge.
That report found the correct score should have been two, which would have required notification of a senior staff member.

The death was recorded in the latest melioidosis data released by Queensland Health.
The government health department recorded 10 new cases in the last seven days.

The death in Townsville was one of four new local cases.
In the Cairns health service region, four cases were recorded.
One case was detected in the Mackay health service area and another in Queensland's north west region.
Melioidosis is a tropical disease caused by a bacteria found in water or soil.
Cases often surge during the wet season after heavy rain or flooding.
Townsville recorded its wettest year on record on Saturday with more than 2,419.8 millimetres falling so far in 2025.
Robert Norton, a microbiologist who recently retired from Townsville Hosptial and Health Service, said it had been an extraordinary wet season.
""I'm not surprised there have been a lot of cases and sadly deaths as well,"" Dr Norton said.
Even though widespread heavy rain had eased in Townsville, Robert Norton said cases would continue locally for weeks.

With her ""biological clock ticking"", Sarah decided to try to conceive using donor sperm through a fertility clinic.
But classed as ""socially infertile"" rather than medically infertile, she was ineligible for a Medicare rebate.
""I felt like it was just so unfair and unjust,"" says the 41-year-old mum-of-two from Mooroolbark, Victoria.
""Because I'm choosing not to settle for someone just because time is running out, I have to jump through these extra hoops to become a family.""
Sarah had to complete two rounds of intrauterine insemination (IUI) at full cost before she could move on to subsidised in vitro fertilisation (IVF).
Sarah McBride says the IVF process was difficult financially, emotionally and physically. (Supplied)
Last week, the federal health department accepted an expanded definition of infertility that would allow LGBTIQ+ couples and single people like Sarah to be able to access Medicare rebates for assisted reproductive technology, including IUI and IVF.
Previously rebates were generally only available once a medical cause of infertility was diagnosed.
The Medicare eligibility expansion came into effect immediately on acceptance of the new definition, according to Manuela Toledo, board member with the Fertility Society of Australia and New Zealand.
""The clinics are applying for the rebate on behalf of the patients,"" Dr Toledo says.
We spoke to Sarah about the changes, and what they would have meant to her when trying to conceive as a solo mum by choice.
These are her words.
I was 32 when I started thinking about doing motherhood alone.
The biological clock was ticking. I knew at 35, that's when things started to drop off [fertility wise].
I worked in child care since I was 16. I had to be a mum.
But first I had to grieve the dream of happily ever after.
However, the thought of having a child for the rest of my life, that was just so exciting.
Sarah McBride had two failed IUI cycles before she moved on to subsidised treatment. (Supplied)
Once I had seen a fertility specialist and got a list of all the fees and rebates, I saw there was a big cross through the IUI rebate because I wasn't eligible as someone classed as 'socially infertile'.
I have a friend who went through IVF with donor sperm with her husband, and they could go straight to IVF with rebates because they were a straight couple who had been deemed medically infertile.
I had to do two unsuccessful rounds of IUI before I could get Medicare, and that was going to cost $6,000, plus the medications.
Will the expanded definition of infertility impact your journey to parenthood? We'd love to hear from you: lifestyle@abc.net.au
Any debt linked to fertility treatment can be a painful reminder for childless people that life didn't go as they planned. And it's often not just financial debt they are left with, either.
There were definitely tears cried.
Knowing that I had to jump through the extra hoops before I had autonomy; before I could make decisions about my body.
I also knew I wanted more than one child, and having two successful IUIs is very uncommon.
I was told IUI has about a 12 per cent success rate with my age and medical history. Whereas IVF at my age it was closer to 50 per cent, and I was shut off from that.
if I could have gone straight to IVF and created five embryos, for example, then I could have just done another embryo transfer after my daughter was born.
It would have been less procedures, less time, and less emotional turmoil.
Doing IUI and IVF was so all-consuming; financially, emotionally, physically. I had no life apart from working and treatment.
And the options of donors that really caught me by surprise.
For donors to donate to IUI, they have to be a certain quality of sperm, and there were not a lot of donors on that list.
If I had been able to go to IVF, I would have had more to choose from.
I did the two IUIs, followed by two egg collections.
My daughter was my second embryo transfer.

After that I did try for a second on my own. And my final embryo from that round was a missed miscarriage [a pregnancy loss in which the embryo or fetus has died or stopped developing, but your body hasn't recognised the loss].
I did another cycle, and I got two embryos. I had them genetically tested to avoid another missed miscarriage, but unfortunately neither resulted in pregnancy.
I'm so happy and so excited for women moving forward.
I'm a little bit jealous, too. I wish I could have gone straight to IVF. I wish I could have chosen the right donor from the start, and not tried with a donor that wasn't my first preference.
I feel like it's such a huge win for solo mums, and for same-sex couples.
There is obviously more to be done around egg donors and surrogacy, but I think this is a huge win for our community.

Avian Influenza","Mexico has recorded its first human death from H5N1 avian influenza — a three-year-old girl who died of multiple organ failures.
The country's health ministry said the girl from the northern state of Coahuila was diagnosed with H5N1 on April 1 and was hospitalised with respiratory complications.
It is unknown how she contracted the virus.
""We are monitoring all individuals who had close contact with the patient and conducting tests to determine if they are infected,"" Coahuila Health Minister Eliud Aguirre said.
In a statement, the health ministry said 38 people who had contact with the girl had been tested, and all came back negative for the bird flu.
The ministry added that the risk of more human infections was considered low.
A Victorian child has tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza after returning to the country from overseas earlier this year. The Department of Health says transmission to humans is rare.
Type A H5N1 influenza has been spreading through animals and some people in the United States, with 70 cases recorded during the past year, the Associated Press reported.
H5N1 is a subtype of influenza virus that infects birds and mammals, including humans in rare instances, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
""The human cases detected thus far are mostly linked to close contact with infected birds and other animals and contaminated environments,"" the WHO stated.
""This virus does not appear to transmit easily from person to person, and sustained human-to-human transmission has not been reported,"" it said.
Last year, the WHO confirmed the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico after a 59-year-old man died in April after developing a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general discomfort.
It was the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with the H5N2 strain of bird flu reported globally.
The most well-known strains are H5N1 and H7N9.
H5N1 was first detected in 1997 in Hong Kong, then it reappeared in 2003 and spread rapidly to birds across Asia, the Middle East, the Americas, Europe and Africa.
The ACT government says the case was detected at a Canberra farm, which has been quarantined.
H7N9 was first identified in 2013 in eastern China.
Both H5N1 and H7N9 strains have caused serious infections and deaths in humans.
According to the New South Wales health department, a variant of H5N1, named clade 2.3.4.4b, causes significant illness and deaths in poultry, wild birds and mammals. It has spread rapidly across all continents except Australia.
It says Australia has had a number of small outbreaks on poultry farms of other strains of avian influenza that cause less severe disease in birds, with a small number of mild human infections.
One human case of H5N1 has been recorded in Australia, and no cases of H7N9 have been detected in the country as of April 2024.

Your vaccine questions answered,,"While Australia eliminated local transmission of measles in 2014, a recent rise in cases globally has seen a local surge of the highly contagious viral illness.
Only a quarter of the way into 2025, Australia has already recorded 52 measles cases — almost as many as the total recorded across all of last year (57).
Over the past fortnight alone, new alerts have been issued in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland.
There was also a case in the Northern Territory earlier this year.
Source: Better Health Channel
Most cases occur in people returning from overseas, including to popular holiday destinations like Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, which are currently experiencing measles outbreaks.
But in recent weeks, a growing number of infections have been detected among Australians who haven't been overseas or in contact with anyone who has, Kristine Macartney, director of the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, said.
Measles primarily affects children, and declining childhood vaccination rates have prompted calls for parents to ensure their kids are vaccinated.
But adults can also catch and spread the disease, especially if they are undervaccinated — a category many Australians might find themselves in.
Here's what you need to know.
Measles is a potentially serious illness that can lead to long-term health complications, hospitalisation, and even death.
In Australia, children are routinely vaccinated against the measles virus at 12 months of age (along with mumps and rubella), and again at 18 months (in combination with the chickenpox vaccine).
But measles vaccination is also recommended for people born during or since 1966 who have not received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, particularly if they are:
Prior to 1966, the measles virus circulated widely in the community and most people who lived during this time are assumed to have acquired immunity from natural infection.
But Australians born between 1966 and 1994 are considered at greater risk of measles because they are less likely to have acquired natural immunity, and may have had just one dose of the vaccine.
Health departments around the country are warning Australians to be alert for symptoms of measles as concerns grow about a rise in cases amid declining vaccination rates.
This is because it wasn't until the early '90s that a second measles dose — which increases protection from roughly 95 to 99 per cent — was added to the national childhood immunisation schedule.
""[Before this] you were only recommended to have one dose, which isn't completely protective,"" Professor Macartney said.
""The second dose also boosts your immunity over a longer period of time.""
A number of school-based, catch-up programs were run in the mid and late 1990s to increase immunisation rates, but Professor Macartney said many Australians aged in their mid 30s to early 60s are likely to have had only one dose.
""We know from previous antibody surveys of the population that this age group has lower levels of immunity to measles than is ideal,"" she said.
Some adults who have migrated to Australia may have also had only one dose (or none) and are also recommended for vaccination.
One way to check your immunisation history is through the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR), which you can access through a myGov or Medicare online account.
The AIR is a national register which records vaccines given to people of all ages in Australia. It was, however, only established in 1996 — and initially only for childhood vaccinations — which means it may be incomplete for many adults.
Another way to check your immunisation history is to look at your personal health records (e.g. a baby book), or contact your GP or local council, which may have a record of your vaccinations.
Yes (unless you're someone who should not normally receive a measles vaccine — see below).
""There's absolutely no harm at all in having a measles vaccine if you've already had two doses. It's a very safe vaccine,"" Professor Macartney said.
""And if you think you've never had a dose at all, then we recommend two doses four weeks apart.""
Blood tests to check for antibody levels to the measles virus can be helpful to determine whether someone has immunity (either from infection or previous vaccination).

But since there are no increases in adverse events from vaccinating people with pre-existing immunity, Professor Macartney recommends people who are unsure just ""go ahead and get an extra dose"".
""It's something people should certainly consider if they're going travelling, but also if they're here in Australia, because of the risk of others bringing measles in.""
Catch-up measles vaccines are available at most GPs, community health centres, Aboriginal Medical Services and pharmacies, and may be free of charge depending on your age, location and vaccination history.
Because the measles vaccine contains a small amount of the live virus, there are some people who should not be vaccinated. This includes:
The safety of these individuals depends on high rates of community immunisation, Professor Macartney said.
""This is why it's so important we don't have measles spreading around because there are individuals who cannot receive the vaccine and are more vulnerable to becoming ill.""
While immunisation rates remain high in Australia, they have slightly decreased in recent years, and remain below the World Health Organization target rate of 95 per cent.
It's also important to note that while infants aged 6–12 months are not routinely recommended for vaccination, those travelling overseas to places where measles is circulating can safely be given a pre-travel dose. They will still require another two doses later.
If you think you've been exposed to measles, you should monitor for symptoms, especially if you aren't fully vaccinated, and seek medical care if you become unwell.
If you plan on attending a healthcare facility, call ahead so you can be isolated on arrival (and avoid spreading the virus to others).
Measles usually starts with cold-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, runny nose, and sore or red eyes, which can develop 7 to 18 days after exposure.

""What happens is the fever comes up before the rash … and you're contagious at that point, so people often don't realise it could be measles and that's where the spread of the virus occurs,"" Professor Macartney said.
As a precaution, it's a good idea to avoid anyone who might be at risk of serious illness, including infants, pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system, until 18 days after your exposure.
""For people who have a reduced immune system, there's also the possibility of getting an antibody immunoglobulin injection if they've been exposed, and that can help them to reduce getting measles,"" Professor Macartney said.
Similarly, an immunoglobulin injection or measles vaccine can sometimes be administered after exposure to people who are undervaccinated, but needs to be done within a few days of exposure.

Warragul and District Specialist School year 12 student Eli Gourley said the program helped him come to the aid of a friend who was close to taking their own life.
""It was quite scary for me and my friend,"" he said.
Young Australians are facing a high mental health burden, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.
The organisation has identified anxiety and depression as being among the top three most common chronic conditions for people aged between 15 and 24.
L4L teaches students about the importance of maintaining good mental health, strategies to help, and who they can talk to if things get too much.
Participants also develop leadership skills in the process.
Adults learn alongside the young people and between them they build a community with the language and understanding to tackle mental health issues.
Empowered by the skills they have learnt at L4L, Eli and his friends now feel better equipped to deal with mental health crises.

""I was on the waitlist for a little bit of time, which was at the time kind of stressful and sort of a bit of an omen of things to come I think,"" she said, reflecting on her time at the hospital's gender diversity service.
""At times it felt like there were meaningless obstacles, the more time that I had to wait.""
Rowan said she needed two psychiatrist recommendations to be prescribed estrogen — a key hormone used to induce feminising changes.

The now university student said she had a ""broadly positive"" experience as a patient at the gender diversity service, but faced lengthy wait times between appointments.
""I think that throughout that process I had some of my lowest moments because I had to experience what felt like the clock ticking down far too early for me.
""Every appointment that I went to that wasn't me receiving approval for the care was a failure.""
Rowan is not the only young person to have felt frustrated by the wait times for gender-affirming care.
According to support group Parents of Gender Diverse Children, many South Australian families accessing the gender diversity service are left waiting lengthy periods of time for psychiatric assessments.
""We're limited in numbers of psychiatrists for mental health full stop,"" said the group's South Australian representative, Jane Russo.
""When you start looking at psychiatrists who specialise in children and young people around gender diversity, it's even more limiting.""
SA Health said state guidelines require a young person to be assessed by a psychiatrist before being referred for gender-affirming medical treatment.

The approximate wait time for the service, according to SA Health, is three to four months from referral to be seen by a mental health clinician.
After this, it takes approximately 12 to 15 months to see a psychiatrist, according to SA Health.
""WCHN [Women's and Children's Health Network] will continue to consider opportunities to improve wait times for patients in addition to the increase in psychiatry availability which is already being implemented,"" WCHN said in a statement.
""All youth undergo initial assessment and care as indicated from the mental health team prior to proceeding for, or while awaiting, medical assessment.
""Not all children referred to our service will go on to access medical-based treatment.""
Ms Russo, whose child is a patient of the gender diversity service, said the wait times for psychiatric assessments could be challenging for young people on the brink of puberty, who worry about impending changes to their bodies.
""They [the gender diversity service] are doing the best that they can with the little resourcing that they've got to try and ensure our children are seen to quickly and are getting the appropriate care that they need.
""It's just there are too few of them [staff].
""They don't have enough time to do it as quickly as they would like to.""
Last week, ABC News revealed that the CEO of the Women's and Children's Hospital, Rebecca Graham, had apologised and ordered a review of the gender diversity service, after the clinic was found to have not referred 22 children to a psychiatrist before being prescribed treatment.
Dr Graham said the children — aged between 11 and 18 years — were assessed by senior mental health clinicians such as psychologists or senior nurses before receiving treatment, but they were not assessed by psychiatrists in compliance with the state's gender diversity model of care.
She said the hospital had provided ""additional psychiatry staffing to the service"" in light of the findings, with the review to also consider the ""timeliness"" of accessing the service.

In a statement on Tuesday, WCHN said it has increased psychiatry full-time equivalents (FTE) at the WCHN gender clinic from 0.6 to 0.8 FTE and ""this will increase to 1.0FTE later this month"".
""The specialist psychiatrist has clinical and non-clinical requirements for the service including patient assessments and multi-disciplinary team meetings, and will be working full-time or five days per week,"" WCHN said.
""There is strong integration of care and communication between all members of the multi-disciplinary team.""
The Australian Professional Association of Trans Health (AusPATH) said additional psychiatrists for the gender diversity service were needed.
""Timely access to gender-affirming care and treatment is an essential part of keeping young people safe,"" the association's CEO Eloise Brook said.
""We know that there is a whole bunch of really concerning mental health challenges that go along with delayed care.

She said the requirement to have a psychiatric assessment — on top of an assessment by a senior mental health clinician — could hinder young people's ability to access timely care.
""There is definitely an argument for the benefits that the second assessment could have, but I think that argument only holds when access to psychiatrists is much greater than it is now,"" she said.

The case was examined by the disability royal commission and heard that in the years prior there was ""almost daily interaction"" between special school staff and the brothers.
Staff noticed Kaleb and Jonathon did not always have adequate clothing or food, sometimes needed bathing because they smelled of urine and dog odour, and at times passed ""rocks and pebbles"" in their bowel motions.
Eighteen months ago, the royal commission recommended the Queensland government ""should acknowledge and apologise"" to the brothers on behalf of departments and agencies for failing to prevent their abuse. That apology was quickly delivered.

Now, the state's ombudsman is releasing his own investigations into some of the departments that had contact with the family over the years to see whether current practices would ""adequately prevent"" the nature of abuse Kaleb and Jonathon suffered from occurring to other children with disability.
The first report, tabled yesterday, has examined the Education department, particularly around student protection reporting, record keeping, and professional judgement.
""We identified some areas of Education's current practices, procedures and training where improvements could be made to ensure neglect is identified, suspicions of harm are appropriately recorded and cumulative harm is captured,"" the report said.
The ombudsman made nine recommendations including that the department review its practices and training course to ensure they ""consistently state that suspicions of harm that may not constitute 'significant harm' or sexual abuse must be recorded as student protection reports"".
The report said the royal commission had heard school staff made some notes, known as ""records of contact,"" in the department's information system about Kaleb and Jonathon, but only one student protection report was submitted to Child Safety.
The department identified several instances when staff ""should"" have submitted student protection reports, the report said.
Brothers Kaleb and Jonathan*, then aged 19 and 17, were found in May 2020 after their father was discovered dead from a terminal illness at their Brisbane home.
""Education told us it expects staff to recognise that having to continually shower and wash a student's hair because it smells of urine is an indicator of neglect, complete a student protection notification on OneSchool in this situation, [and] refer the report to Child Safety,"" the ombudsman's report said.
""In order to avoid what occurred in Kaleb and Jonathon's case from happening again, where suspicions of harm may be 'buried' in Records of Contact and not identified as student protection concerns, Education should ensure its practice is to record these concerns or suspicions in a student protection report.
Other recommendations included that repeated incidents of harm or concerns be recorded as student protection reports ""on every occasion"".
The report said the current guidelines do not provide specific instructions on the reporting process for staff to follow for harm that may not meet the reporting threshold on its own, ""but could indicate a pattern of ongoing harm"".
Their father, who was also their carer, was found dead at the home. (Supplied: Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation of People with Disability)
""They need to provide clearer guidance to school staff about the importance of recording individual incidents of harm that recur or are ongoing [the hygiene issues that Kaleb and Jonathon repeatedly experienced are an example].""
The ombudsman also recommended that the student protection report form be changed so it records whether a student lives with disability.
""This is a missed opportunity because knowing that a student is living with disability could help to determine whether the student has care and support needs that are not being met.""
Ahead of its release, the report and recommendations were provided to the department.
Director-General Sharon Schimming said in her response to the ombudsman that the department ""remained committed"" to ensuring its student protection practices are of the ""highest standard"" and welcomed recommendations from the report that can strengthen its approach.

She didn't expect to face ""confusing and baffling"" policies, nor to feel frustrated and left in the dark.
The four-year-old, who loves dancing and rough-and-tumble play with his brothers, is Deafblind.

Ari communicates using tactile sign language — a process where he places his hands over another person's hands to feel them signing.
He is able to sign in return and wears cochlear implants which enable him to hear some sound.
""He requires one-on-one support at all times, all waking hours of his life, in order to access communication, language, mobility and learning,"" she said.
Ms Bennett began looking at schools for Ari a year ago and contacted the Department of Education about his needs.
She wants Ari to learn alongside other children who use sign language and has found a hearing support class at a local public school in regional New South Wales, where they live.
If he was enrolled in a mainstream class he would be able to access the one-on-one assistance paid for by Integration Funding Support (IFS).

But Ms Bennett has been told the NSW Department of Education would not fund the one-on-one support in that class because the class itself was already a funded environment.
Ms Bennett inquired about exemptions to the policy but said the lack of clarity was exhausting.
""It's been really difficult. Very confusing. Very vague,"" she said.
She thinks the hearing support class would be best for Ari, but admits it's not a perfect solution.
The class is taught in Australian Sign Language (Auslan), which Ari won't be able to understand because of his vision impairment.
Ms Bennett wants Ari to have a connection with peers who are Deaf and believes students in that class will be more likely to take the time to communicate with him because they have similar needs.

As with every aspect of his life, Ari will need someone with him in the class to interpret what's happening through tactile sign.
""It's common sense that his needs don't change based on what classroom he's in.""
Rikki Chaplin, president of Deafblind Australia said Ari should not be expected to join a class taught in Auslan without additional support.
Source: Deafblind Australia
""He cannot benefit from Auslan,"" he said.
""He requires tactile sign in order to be able to learn what the other children are learning.""
Mr Chaplin is also Deafblind.
He has no vision and moderate to severe hearing loss, so he can communicate through speech and receive information aurally.
Ari, however, never had the opportunity to learn to speak using his hearing.
Mr Chaplain said people who cannot receive information through sound or communicate verbally rely heavily on tactile sign language.
""There are quite specific signs used to indicate different words or different phrases or different concepts,"" he said.
Rikki Chaplin says Ari shouldn't be expected to join a class taught in Auslan without additional support. (ABC News: Elizabeth Pickering)
On its website, the NSW Department of Education states that parents of children with disability should contact their preferred school two years in advance.
Even when they do this, like in Jamie Bennett's case, advocates say it's not uncommon for families to struggle.
""Parents are left scrambling because they don't know where to go to next and who it is that can really help them when it comes to ensuring that their child is included,"" said Skye Kakoschke-Moore, CEO of Children and Young People with Disability Australia.
She said the education system needed to better cater for students with complex needs.
Skye Kakoschke-Moore says the needs of every child with disabilities are different. (ABC News: Patrick Stone)
The federal government says it supports the rights of students with disability to have the same education opportunities as students without disability.
""There are support programs in place to help ensure students with disability … can fully participate in the economic and social life of the community,"" the Department of Education's website reads.
The NSW Department of Education told the ABC they work closely with parents and carers and a team of specialist staff to ensure each student received access to the support they need.
""Public schools are proud to provide an inclusive education that ensures students with disability can access and participate on the same basis as students without disability,"" a spokesperson said.
The spokesperson said while the department didn't comment on specific cases it ""looked forward to continuing to collaborate with the family to ensure the support required is provided, following the appropriate processes.""
Ari Bennett uses sign language to communicate with his mum, such as when he wants more pushes on the swing. (ABC News: Mary Lloyd)
Mr Chaplin said inclusion policies were important but meant nothing unless there was a genuine intention by governments to provide the resources to implement them.
And without additional resources for someone like Ari, he said inclusion would not be possible.
""Inclusion policies of education departments, while well intentioned, are often full of rhetoric,"" he said.
Ari Bennett lost his hearing at seven weeks old and now uses a cochlear implant to interpret sound.  (ABC News: Mary Lloyd)
Ms Bennett isn't sure what school will look like for Ari right now, but she'll continue preparing him for the transition and hopes the future will be bright for him.
""I want him to be included, I want him to be understood, and for him to have friends"", she said.

AFL","Outgoing AFL Players' Association (AFLPA) chief executive Paul Marsh believes mental health will continue to be one of the biggest issues confronting players.
The union boss, who has been at the helm for 11 years, will depart in May to replace Todd Greenberg as chief executive of the Australian Cricketers' Association.
Marsh took pride in the AFL's advancement in the mental health space during his tenure.
""One of the things we do annually is we'll survey the players and get a sense of where they're at and what are their big issues,"" he said.
""Mental health has been consistently the number one issue to the players.
""And one of the things that we're really proud of is the reform that we've led around the industry.
""This is a high pressure industry, and I think we've come a long way in this space over the last 10 or so years.""
Marsh noted the increased scrutiny that has come with bigger rights deals and wider media coverage.
""Not everyone's built in the way that they can deal with the scrutiny that comes with it, and it's 365 days a year now, the scrutiny on some players,"" he said.
""So I foresee this is going to be a bigger challenge going forward. It's not going to get easier for the players on this front.
Paris Tier, the partner of GWS defender Conor Stone, found herself in her GP’s office asking to go on Ozempic after receiving online hate comments about her weight.
""I'd love to see a little bit more measured commentary coming out of the media at times, but we also understand that that's where the money comes from.
""And so there's a reality here that I think players are just trying to work out how they're going to deal with it.""
Marsh is also confident the union and AFL are ""getting closer to a resolution"" regarding changing the illicit drugs policy.
Those negotiations were complicated in March when it emerged the AFL had given Sports Integrity Australia a list of players who could potentially be target tested under the separate anti-doping policy.
ABC Sport is live blogging every round of the AFL and NRL seasons in 2025.
""There's two issues that are running parallel with the drugs policy,"" Marsh said.
""There's the actual negotiation of what it looks like, and then there's the Sport Integrity Australia issue that we're waiting on some answers from the AFL around … and I think that's a really important part of this.

""We won't actually get an outcome until we understand what's taken place and then whether that was appropriate.""
The AFLPA will start its search for a new CEO, mere weeks after Geelong captain Patrick Dangerfield stepped down as president in favour of Collingwood skipper Darcy Moore.
Marsh, the son of Australian cricket great Rod Marsh, felt it was time for a new challenge after 11 years and multiple historic player collective bargaining agreements (CBA).
""It's a good time, we're a couple of years out from the next collective bargaining agreement. If I had to wait any longer, I think it's difficult for the next person coming in,"" he said.
""So a variety of factors, but cricket's in my blood.""

AFL","Star Hawthorn midfielder Will Day will miss up to four months with a foot injury in a major blow to the undefeated Hawks.
Hawthorn
One of the key members of the 'Hollywood Hawks', Day will have surgery after scans revealed a stress fracture in the navicular bone of his foot.
The 23-year-old missed the early part of last season, then was forced to sit out Hawthorn's two finals because of injury.
But Day had put together an impressive start to this season, led by a best-on-ground performance in the Opening-Round win against Sydney.
""In this instance, surgery is required to fix the fracture,"" Hawthorn doctor Liam West said.
""Additionally, surgery will also reduce the risk of future issues for Will during his career.""
Hawks football boss Rob McCartney described it as a ""bitter blow"".

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-08/the-rules-i-use-to-combat-loneliness-while-living-alone/105123432,I live alone. Here's what I do to feel less lonely,,"I naively made the decision to pay rent by myself amid the cost-of-living crisis. Not my smartest move.
And while I stress about how expensive this all is, I have surprisingly found my bleak financial future is nothing compared to a more intimidating foe: loneliness.
I always considered myself to be introverted, preferring to stay indoors instead of out in the world, which is what inspired me to move out on my own in the first place.
I loved living alone at the beginning, because it meant I could decorate my place however I wanted and get a real taste of independence after landing my first ""big girl job"".
But by the end of the second year living alone, the higher cost of living and living pay to pay started taking a real toll on my social life.
I found it easier and cheaper to just stay home, and without roommates or family there was no organic opportunity for chats and interactions.
I realised that I needed to be disciplined and create structure for myself to make the most out of living solo.
So I have created a loose set of ""rules"" that I follow to feel less lonely.
Before I moved out by myself, seeing my friends involved checking out trendy restaurants and hitting up the assortment of expensive bars found in Melbourne/Naarm.
Hosting at my place means that we all get to spend less money, and I can tailor the night to our tastes.
I love to treat my movie-loving mates to a night dedicated to watching films from genres they are into. With friends who love to cook, we do pot-luck meals. And I indulge in some healthy bouts of scrapbooking with my more craft-inclined pals.
Scrapbooking stops me going down existential rabbit holes or scrolling on my phone. (Supplied: Ash Pappas)
I wish I could go back in time and tell my past self to pick up a hands-on hobby much earlier than I did.
Keeping my mind occupied, especially when spending a lot of time indoors, is so beneficial.
Scrapbooking gives me something to do instead of absent-mindedly playing same YouTube videos on repeat, having my mind shift into the scary territory of existential fear or comparing myself to people on social media.
Because I work from home I don't get the automatic separation of home time and work time, the social aspect of a workplace, or the commute to make me leave home and get some fresh air and exercise.
I have to put in some extra effort to get those things.
This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.
I try to hop down to the nearest cafe close or — if the weather allows — the nearby park, work laptop in tow, so I can experience a change of scenery, people-watch and feel connected and part of the world.
My habit of cancelling last-minute was at its highest during my first two years of living alone, and it's been my goal ever since to resist the underlying urge to stay home.
Personalising my childhood bedroom to suit 20-something me has made living at home more manageable.
I've found that social anxiety jitters are nothing compared to the unquenchable dread of FOMO or the isolation I create for myself when I do cancel.
My chronic cancelling habits also almost cost me friendships with some of my closest pals. So now I make plans and I do my absolute best to keep them — which has, so far, been a net positive.
It gets me out of the house, I see my favourite people, and I've obtained an appreciation for exploring parts of my city with friends both new and old.
Going to things alone was something that I wouldn't have had the guts to do before I started living solo, but now I do. And because it forces me to actually strike up conversations, I've become closer to folks that I'm not sure if I would have before.
(The Sims will still be waiting for me when I get home.)
Plants not only give life (literally) to my space, watching a seed grow from a tiny sprout into full-grown herbs, flowers or other kinds of botanical beauty is something to behold. (Supplied: Ash Pappas)
When my parents moved overseas and my brother moved out, the family cat became my responsibility.
Having another living thing pester me for food and wake me up at four AM surprisingly provided a much-needed break from solitude and a certain routine I had to stick to.
Since he passed last year I've felt the familiar sting of loneliness creep back into my life.
While they are not quite the same level of company, my plants do give me something to care for, to keep alive and to share my space with.
I won't lie and say that I'm an exceptionally talented green-thumb, since I mostly just provide sunlight, water, and the occasional bit of plant food, but I do my best.
And taking care of plants keeps me active and adds structure to my quieter days.
These ""rules"" help me to stay on track and make living alone easier, but there are days where I'm not sure how much longer I can endure any more financial insecurity and solitude.
Independence is great, but so is camaraderie (and a full wallet).
I might look back into sharing a new flat with housemates one day, but I'll continue to relish my independence for as long as I can.

Rehabilitation","Readers are advised this story discusses suicide.
Seven years ago, Patsy Miller was at work in her small town of Merbein in Victoria's north-west when she received the heartbreaking news that a ""young man"" had died nearby.
The young man was her son, Lenny, who had taken his own life at the age of 24, and metres from her workplace after years of battling a drug addiction.
Lenny died seven years ago. (ABC News: Timu King)
Lenny had sought help on multiple occasions and wanted to recover from his addiction, but with no rehabilitation centre close to home, he was forced to make the long and exhausting six-hour journey to Melbourne for recovery.

After more than a decade of lobbying from residents struggling with the fallout of alcohol and drug use in Victoria's north-west, the state government has funded a $36 million, 30-bed rehabilitation centre in the Mallee town.
But while Ms Miller said the facility would change lives, the proposal has caused fierce division in the community.
Merbein is a small town in Victoria's north-west. (ABC News: Timu King)
Ms Miller said it was vital that rehabilitation facilities existed in regional areas so people could recover while having family and support close to them.
When the state government announced the centre in 2022, Ms Miller said she cried.
Mementos and photographs of Lenny can be found all over his mother’s home. (ABC News: Timu King)
""I was so, so glad, because there's so many times when Lenny was in his bad addiction, I would pray that and wish that someone could just come and help him, something could change … somewhere I would find help.
""And it never came, unfortunately.
Ms Miller says she would pray for help for her son in the midst of his addiction. (ABC News: Timu King)
The residential rehabilitation facility will be able to accommodate up to 200 people per year and will be located on the site of an old primary school.

The facility will be the first in the area, and the fourth rehabilitation centre in Victoria run by service provider Odyssey House.
CEO Stefan Gruenert said Victoria's north-west was an area that needed greater attention.

""There's been a really big gap in the western part of the state, particularly that north-west, and some people have had to access treatment in Adelaide or come all the way into Melbourne,"" Dr Gruenert said.
""In the north-west of the state they tend to have higher than average rates of alcohol and other drug use, and I think in part, their lack of services hasn't helped.""
According to the 2024 data from the Victorian Alcohol and Drug Association (VAADA), there are approximately 4,500 Victorians waiting to access some type of treatment at any given point in time.
That number has nearly doubled since the association's first survey in 2020.
Nationally, the number of people able to access treatment in a given year is between 30 and 40 per cent of the total number of people that would like to get help, according to VAADA.
The plan for a rehabilitation centre in Merbein has not been well received by some residents.
Over 1,000 people in the community have signed a petition against having the drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre in the town.
Merbein Lions Club president Phillip Sedgmen started the petition.

He said the group wasn't against the centre, but wanted it located 10 kilometres away in Mildura.
""We haven't got a bus service, a taxi service, we haven't got medical facilities, we don't have a manned police station,"" Mr Sedgmen said.
He said the group was also concerned about safety, given the proximity of the facility to homes and the lack of consultation they received.
MP for Mildura Jane Benham said the community had ""little to no communication whatsoever"" from the state government and was ""appalled"" by its approach to announcing the location.
But, she said it was a much needed health facility for the community.
The Victorian government did not respond to Ms Benham's comments directly, but said the location was found to best meet the government's site evaluation criteria.
An information session was held with the Merbein community in February.
Dr Gruenert said safety shouldn’t be a concern for residents.
""We don't have any incidents that have occurred with neighbours [of existing Odyssey House facilities] and our residents at any of those other sites for at least the last 10 years, and to my memory, even for 40 years that we've been operating.""
Local Jacinta Masierowski recovered from drug addiction more than 10 years ago with the help of a rehabilitation program in Western Australia.

She said a rehabilitation centre close to home would be ""amazing"" and she hoped to work there when it opened.
""It's kind of what saved me from still being an addict,"" Ms Masierowski said.
""It's been a passion since I have been clean to work in rehab and when this was coming up, I was like, 'Oh wow, this is amazing.'
""I was so excited, I said to Mum, 'I need to get there and work, I need to get my foot in the door.'""
Ms Masierowski said the majority of the workers at the rehabilitation centre she attended had recovered from addiction themselves and understood the challenges of recovery.
""They told us about their stories and how they got clean, and I think that then sets a positive note to know that you can actually get clean,"" she said.
""It's just that you need that one person to believe in you, to say, 'You're going to make it' and you'll be surprised by how that makes an addict feel.""

Doctors and Medical Professionals","Thousands of doctors in the NSW public hospital system have begun a three-day strike as part of a push for improved pay and conditions.
First announced by the Australian Salaried Medical Officers' Federation (ASMOF) last week, the industrial action centres around claims of unsustainable workloads, chronic understaffing and low pay.
The union is pushing for a 30 per cent pay rise in one year, and 3 per cent in the years following, to bring rates in-line with other states.
The government has countered with a 10.5 per cent increase over three years and an offer of 3 per cent now to be backdated if the strike is cancelled.
Doctors began striking on Tuesday morning. (ABC News: Abbey Haberecht)
Doctors gathered outside Westmead Hospital on Tuesday morning, holding placards and chanting for ""safe conditions, safe care"".
Some doctors told the ABC they were working up to 20 hours a week unpaid, with union members now making their way to protest outside the NSW Health Ministry at St Leonards.
On the Mid North Coast, about 40 doctors took to the highway opposite Coffs Harbour Health Campus to protest their pay dispute with the government.
ASMOF estimates more than 100 doctors will take industrial action over the next three days at the base hospital.

Robert Macleay — a registrar currently working in the rehabilitation unit — said he was striking because the current pay and conditions for doctors didn't compare with other states.

""But at the same time, I can't be attending a farewell party every week or two for yet another person crossing the Queensland border.

""Which was around getting NSW Health back to the bargaining table, they had spat the dummy and walked away.""
The strikes are set to last for three days. (ABC News: Courtney Barrett Peters)
According to the union, some doctors, due to lack of staff, have been required to work excessively unsafe hours, including consistent 16-hour shifts with limited breaks.
While Mr Park couldn't confirm how many doctors would be taking part — alluding to ""thousands"" — the union expects it to be up to 9,000.
""This decision hasn't been taken lightly,"" said executive director of ASMOF's NSW branch Andrew Holland.
Have you been affected by the doctors' strike? Let us know your story.
According to ASMOF, the industrial action — which has not been approved by the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) — will see the state's hospitals staffed at levels akin to public holidays.
The expected impacts will largely avoid emergency departments and critical care units, with the union stating these will be rostered at a level that ensures safety.
The Doctors Union is calling on the government for a 30 per cent rise in one year and 3 per cent in the years following. (ABC News: Abbey Haberecht)
What will be adversely affected are non-urgent procedures, including elective surgeries and outpatient clinics.
""I know that for many people, they have been waiting months or years for their elective surgery, which again typifies the problem,"" intensive care staff specialist and ASMOF councillor Behny Samadi said.
""Unfortunately, those will be cancelled. Some clinic appointments will also be cancelled, which means that there will be delays in seeing a specialist.""
Intensive care staff specialist Behny Samadi says there will be delays in patients being able to see their specialists. (ABC News)
Mr Park confirmed the process of cancelling surgeries had started, describing the potential impact over the three days as ""significant"".
He also argued that despite contingency plans, staffing could not be ""patched up"", and the reduction would have flow-on effects to other parts of the hospital system.
Westmead is among the large metropolitan hospitals the government says will be most impacted by the strike. (ABC News: Patrick Thomas)
Of particular concern for the government are metropolitan tertiary hospitals with a large workforce, such as Westmead, Prince of Wales and Royal Prince Alfred.
""Tuesday is arguably the busiest and most significant day of the week in terms of our emergency department presentations,"" Mr Park said.
ASMOF has alleged that doctors looking to strike have been threatened by NSW Health with deregistration and court.
The union also says it has long attempted to negotiate with the state government over improved pay, describing their 3 per cent offer as ""a pay cut"".
Mr Park branded those claims as ""disingenuous"", saying the government had played by the rules and turned up to all of the negotiations, and was ""extremely disappointed and frustrated"" the union had defied the IRC.
Health Minister Ryan Park says the potential impact from the strike will be ""significant"". (ABC News)
Mr Park agreed that doctors should be paid more but said the union's demand for 30 per cent was ""unreasonable"", and blamed the previous Coalition government for suppressing wages.

The ABC has spoken to two patients who say they made complaints to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) about Dr Daniels.
AHPRA confirmed to the ABC his registration has been suspended, but said it could not provide any further details.
""Confidentiality provisions of the national law under which we operate limit what we can say publicly about an individual practitioner or matter,"" a spokesperson said.
""Unless a matter is already in the public domain, we are unable to provide information in relation to it.
AHPRA works with a process known as national boards to regulate health practitioners, and each health profession that is part of the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme is represented by a board.
Information on the AHPRA website states that national boards ""have the power to take immediate action to limit or suspend a practitioner's registration as a temporary measure"".
The website said ""immediate action"" was ""always interim action while a board continues an investigation"" and that no findings have been made against Dr Daniels.
When a practitioner's registration is suspended, they are not able to practise anywhere in Australia.
A national board or tribunal would need to revoke Dr Daniels' suspension.
Dr Daniels has not had his registration to work as a psychologist suspended.

Homicide","A teenage boy who killed his friend after attacking him with a hunting knife in a Brisbane street for ""no legitimate reason"" was ""addicted to stabbing"", a court has heard.
The now 18-year-old man, who cannot be identified under the state's youth justice laws as he was 17 at time, was handed a 12-year sentence on Monday.
Late last year, the teen pleaded guilty to the murder of 19-year-old Abddullahi Ahmed Iyow.
He also pleaded guilty to other offences, including threatening violence toward a member of the public who tried to intervene.
The teen admitted to stabbing Mr Ahmed Iyow, who he knew, three times in the abdomen in Acacia Ridge in June 2024.
Mr Ahmed Iyow was taken to hospital and underwent surgery, but died of his injuries a month later.

During the sentencing hearing, the Supreme Court heard the teenager had become angry with Mr Ahmed Iyow after he had damaged his phone, which caused the loss of his drug dealing contacts.
At first, the court heard the boy physically assaulted Mr Ahmed Iyow and pushed him to the ground, before helping him back up to his feet.
Crown Prosecutor Chris Cook told the court it was shortly after this that the teenager pushed him to the ground again, and began stabbing him multiple times for ""no legitimate reason"".
""The defendant claimed he was disrespected,"" Mr Cook said.
CCTV footage played to the court showed the moments leading-up to the stabbing, including the pair walking together to a park, and then later, the teenager waving the knife around.
Vision from inside a police car arriving at the scene was also played to the court.
A teenage boy has admitted to the stabbing murder of a 19-year-old man.
It showed Mr Ahmed Iyow lying on the grass motionless, and the teenager nearby just before he was arrested.
Mr Cook submitted the crime should be considered particularly heinous, so the teenager could be sentenced to more than 10 years.
""This was a violent murder that occurred in broad daylight,"" he said.
The court heard the teenager, who was a refugee from East Africa, did not have a criminal history, but did tell a psychiatrist he had previously been involved in multiple gang crimes.
The court heard the teenager admitted he found fighting ""entertaining"". (ABC News: Liz Pickering)
In a pre-sentence report, the court heard the teenager admitted he found fighting ""entertaining"", and he stabbed people because it was ""more joyful"".
""I was addicted to stabbing because of my past trauma,"" the report quoted him saying.
Mr Cook told the court a particular incident, where the teen admitted to being involved in a kidnapping incident, was ""really scary stuff"".
""It sounds like warfare on our streets … that has never come to the police's attention,"" he said.
The court heard the teenager had been a daily drug user of cannabis and prescription medication, and had been intoxicated at the time of the attack.
He was also diagnosed with a severe conduct disorder, the court heard.
Through his lawyer, the teenager apologised to the family.
""I made a huge mistake,"" his lawyer said on his behalf.
In a victim impact statement penned by Mr Ahmed Iyow's parents and two of his siblings, the family said the killing was ""unjustified"" and ""brutal"".
""Since that day, our lives have been shattered,"" they said in the statement.
They said the victim had been a ""vibrant teenager with his whole life ahead of him"" but his future was ""cruelly stolen"" by a teenager who was ""callous and cowardly"".
""All this suffering and trauma was for this killers' careless actions,"" they said in the statement.
The teenager was due to be sentenced last week, but proceedings were postponed after he was attacked in the dock.
One of Mr Ahmed Iyow's brothers was arrested and charged with assault, and this incident had to be taken into consideration by the judge.
Justice Rebecca Treston determined the teenager's offending was particularly heinous and sentenced him to 12 years.
He will be released after serving 70 per cent of his sentence.",Talissa Siganto,Mon 7 Apr

Human Rights","Residents in the remote Aboriginal community of Wadeye have effectively settled a racial discrimination lawsuit with the Northern Territory government claiming they were unlawfully deprived of adequate healthcare.
As part of the settlement the government has said it would endeavour to increase interpreters, allocate at least two full-time doctors and establish a local dialysis service in the community within three years.
Lead claimant Patrick Cumaiyi filed the first of two lawsuits in 2019 after he was allegedly taken to the local health clinic following ""an incident"" involving police in 2016, before being deemed ""fit to be detained in police custody"".
Mr Cumaiyi claimed the consultation lasted just 10 minutes and did not involve interpreters to relay his responses to the nurse, who instead relied on information provided by police.
Wadeye is a community 400km southwest of Darwin, with a population of about 1,900. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)
The following evening, Mr Cumaiyi alleged he was handcuffed and placed in the back of a caged police vehicle which he then jumped out of while travelling at at least 60kph.
The documents claim he was again taken to the clinic for treatment without the assistance of an interpreter, where the interaction was again ""based on solely or predominantly"" information provided by police.
Later that night, Mr Cumaiyi said he was flown to Royal Darwin Hospital where he was diagnosed with a fractured skull and admitted to the intensive care unit, arguing his earlier treatment was the result of unlawful racial discrimination.
In a second class action filed in 2021, Wadeye residents argued they were provided with a lower level of healthcare compared to other remote centres like Nhulunbuy and Tennant Creek due to the community's significantly higher Indigenous population base.
The class actions have now been withdrawn with the government agreeing to make a public commitment to try to improve services. (ABC News: Tristan Hooft)
Unlike those other towns, they argued there was no full-time local GP and no hospital or private medical clinic in Wadeye, while the sole government clinic did not have a permanent doctor on site or ""any effective after-hours ambulance services"".
At the time, the NT government denied racially discriminating against the residents or that medical and interpreter services in Wadeye were inadequate.
More than one in every 20 Wadeye residents is in jail, making it one of the most incarcerated communities in Australia.
In a defence filed with the court, the government said Mr Cumaiyi had been ""ground stabilised"" after ""recklessly endangering the safety of an aircraft whilst on a police aeroplane"" that was taking off from Wadeye.
But both groups withdrew their lawsuits last week on the condition that the government publicly commit to try improving health services in Wadeye, including a minimum ""interpreter attendance rate of 85 per cent for the Murrinh Patha language"".
In a statement to the ABC, NT Health Minister Steve Edgington said the government was ""committed to providing high-quality healthcare in Wadeye"".
“We will continue to assess and review health service delivery in Wadeye, and across the territory, to meet community needs,"" he said.",Jason Walls,Mon 7 Apr

Courts","The families of those killed in the Bondi Junction stabbings have backed a coronial inquest, after father of a victim and prominent businessman John Singleton called for it to be shelved.
On April 13 last year, Joel Cauchi fatally stabbed six people and seriously injured several others inside the Westfield shopping centre in Sydney's eastern suburbs.
Mr Cauchi was then shot dead by NSW Police Inspector Amy Scott.
Six were fatally stabbed and several others seriously injured at Bondi Junction Westfield in April 2024. (ABC News: Brendan Esposito)
At a direction's hearing on Monday, lawyers told the Coroners Court that the inquest later this month will use a trauma-informed approach, including no sensitive CCTV or body cam vision played in court, and only two civilian witnesses testifying.
Counsel assisting, Peggy Dwyer SC said the court will rely on written statements that have been ""so painstakingly taken"" by NSW Police.
""Although there were hundreds of people who were shopping at Westfield Bondi Junction on that Saturday and witnessed some of the terrible events, they won't be called to give oral evidence,"" Ms Dwyer said.
The victims of the Bondi attack include Dawn Singleton, Jade Young, Yixuan Cheng, Ashlee Good, Faraz Tahir, and Pikria Darchia.
The lawyer for the Good, Young and Singleton families, told the court on Monday that they understand the ""mandatory nature of this inquest and support it"".
Sue Chrysanthou SC said she would not be representing Dawn Singleton's father, John Singleton, who spoke to the Nine Network on Sunday and called for the inquest not to go ahead.
Mr Singleton has been appealing to the court to drop the inquest, concerned it will cause distress for himself and other family members.
John Singleton told 60 Minutes he was ""worried"" about the loved ones of the victims in his bid to have the inquest axed. (Supplied: 60 Minutes )
""I'm worried about the family, loved ones of those people who were killed, not actually why their privacy should be upset by the inquiry,"" Mr Singleton told 60 Minutes.
Ms Chrysanthou told the court that the families she represented were adversely impacted by some members of the media, including the broadcast that aired overnight.
""They continue to be impacted, including by reason of a broadcast last night … their lives have been changed in a way that none of us can comprehend,"" Ms Chrysanthou said.
""Children's lives have been altered by what occurred and it's important for them to understand if anything else could have been done or any recommendations can be made to ensure that if this ever happens again, it won't be as impactful on the families as it has been.""
Sue Chrysanthou SC said the Good, Young and Singleton families had expressed ""support"" for the coronial inquest. (AAP: James Gourley)
Ms Dwyer said the families cannot be expected to speak with one voice, even if they are members of the same family.
She implored the media and the public to understand that the inquest itself is mandatory under the Coroners Act and that the specific issue of the media's response was added at the request of the families.
""A number of families have reported their significant distress at graphic footage being shown in the media,"" Ms Dwyer said.
The five-week inquest is also set to examine potential failings in the mental health system both in New South Wales and Queensland in the lead-up to the killings, and whether there were opportunities for early intervention.
In November, the court heard Cauchi remained off his ""psychotropic medication"" previously used to treat his schizophrenia prior to the attack, despite repeated warnings raised with authorities about his deteriorating mental health.
Ms Dwyer told the court that body-worn vision from Queensland police officers showing their last interaction with Cauchi will be shown when they were called to his parent's home in January 2023.
A leading neuropsychiatrist says there was a potential ""systemic failure"" by Queensland authorities when it came to treating and communicating about Joel Cauchi.
""That may be relevant for your honour to understand his mental health presentation and parties may wish to watch that in court for the purposes of then asking questions,"" Ms Dwyer said.
""What were the circumstances around Joel Cauchi ceasing the use of psychotropic medication that was necessary to treat his mental health condition, and how was Mr Cauchi's mental health managed from February 2020 onwards,"" Ms Dwyer said.
The inquest will further examine the coordination of the emergency response, and the adequacy of the shopping centre's security response, including why no alarm sounded inside the centre until after Cauchi had been shot dead.
Expert reports from psychiatrists, general practitioners, an emergency medicine specialist, a toxicologist and a security expert will be presented.
Ms Dwyer said the purpose of the inquest was not to blame individuals or organisations but to learn the lessons that could help prevent such a tragedy from happening in the future.
The inquest will commence on April 28 and conclude on May 30, with some family statements expected in the final week.",CBy Chantelle Al-Khouri,Mon 7 Apr

Health","When the human heart stops, a race against the clock begins.
Without the heart pumping blood around the body, the brain and other vital organs are starved of oxygen — and the chance of survival plummets with every minute that passes.
But a clinical trial by NSW Ambulance has been buying cardiac arrest patients life-saving time, by bringing a machine that's usually only available in hospital to the scene of cardiac arrests around Sydney.
Its results so far are among the best in the world.
When triple-0 receives a cardiac arrest call, pre-hospital critical care doctors like Natalie Kruit and Brian Burns race to ""ECMO 1"", a rapid response car based at ambulance headquarters at Sydney Olympic Park.
Doctors Natalie Kruit and Brian Burns are part of the team trialling the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, machine. (ABC News: Sarah Gerathy)
In the boot is a mobile version of an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) machine, which is a form of heart and lung bypass that removes a patient's blood and replaces carbon dioxide with oxygen before pumping it back into their body.
Once at the scene, where other paramedic teams will already be rendering CPR, the ECMO team gets to work using a portable ultrasound machine to guide them as they thread a catheter into the patient's groin and connect them to the ECMO system.
The dark blood turns bright red as it passes through the machine and back into the patient's body, delivering precious oxygen to their vital organs.
They are then taken to hospital, usually to have a blockage in their heart identified and cleared.
Trials of the ECMO device are yielding results that are the best in the world.  (ABC News: Sarah Gerathy)
NSW Ambulance Commissioner Dominic Morgan said he was thrilled with the results of the trial so far.
""We are seeing already a 28 per cent survival rate for the numbers that have gone through the ECMO procedure,"" he said.
""And we are getting patients onto the heart lung bypass in world-beating times, as low as 17 minutes. Nowhere in the world are achieving what the doctors in New South Wales are achieving.""
Dr Burns said the survival rate for the patients would normally be much lower, because they are in what is called ""refractory cardiac arrest"", and haven't responded to traditional CPR.
""If the patient doesn't come back after 15-20 minutes of resuscitation their chance of walking out of the hospital is less than 3 per cent,"" Dr Burns said.
""So we are seeing 10 times increased chance of survival. And we are interested in patient-centred outcomes, which is to walk out and go back to your family or go back to work.""
Todd Reuvers became the first person in Sydney to be saved by a mobile ECMO machine when he went into a cardiac arrest at the warehouse he was working at in south-western Sydney.

His colleagues came to his aid and rendered CPR before the first paramedics turned up, but his heart was still stopped for an hour.
""You don't realise how lucky I am,"" Mr Reuvers said.
Dr Kruit said the trial was also seeing a huge boost for patients who did not end up needing the ECMO machine, but who still benefit from the expertise and extra equipment that is brought to the scene of their cardiac arrest.
""We provide advanced monitoring and advanced therapies as well, so effectively what we are doing is bringing the hospital to the patient,” she said.
Paul Thompson benefited from the critical care and expertise provided by the ECMO team when he went into cardiac arrest in front of his wife Emma De Carle. (ABC News: Sarah Gerathy)
Paul Thompson was headed to hospital with chest pains when he went into cardiac arrest in front of his partner Emma De Carle as she drove along Military Road at Cremorne in December.
He was lucky that a lifesaver bystander gave him CPR and he didn't ultimately need to be placed on the heart and lung bypass.
But he was amazed to later learn of the help the critical care doctors from the ECMO team had given him when they arrived on scene.
""It's just a second chance at life,"" said Mr Thompson who has two teenage sons.
""I'm going to make the most of it with my family.""
In order to be eligible for the ECMO trial, patients need to be aged between 18 to 70, have had someone witness their cardiac arrest and have received CPR.
A specially trained paramedic sitting in the emergency control centre assesses if patients meet the criteria to deploy the ECMO car.
Dr Kruit said that was a real game changer in parts of Sydney that were not close to major hospitals where they might usually be rushed to have a blockage cleared.

""Obviously the geography of Western Sydney and south-western Sydney in particular is very difficult to reach because it's so spread out.
""So bringing the technology to the patient we are actually improving the equity of access to all patients.""
NSW Health Minister Ryan Park said funding for the existing trial had been extended for another year.
But he was open to expanding it in the future.
""That's certainly something that we would look at doing should we continue to get these types of results,"" he said.",Sarah Gerathy,Mon 7 Apr

Infectious Diseases","A second child with measles has died in Texas, state officials say, in an outbreak of the childhood disease that has resulted in more than 480 cases in the state and has spread to New Mexico and Oklahoma.
US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr travelled to West Texas on Sunday and said he was travelling to the area to comfort the families who have buried two young children.
The school-aged child, who was unvaccinated and had no underlying health conditions, died on Thursday in the hospital from measles pulmonary failure, the Texas Department of State Health Services said.
""The child was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized,"" Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, Texas said.
The outbreak has resulted in more than 480 cases in Texas. (AP Photo: Julio Cortez, File)
It is the second death of a child in Texas since the measles outbreak began under Health and Human Services Secretary Mr Kennedy's reign.
An anti-vaccine advocate, Mr Kennedy has resisted urging widespread vaccinations as the measles outbreak has worsened under his watch.
On Sunday, however, he said in a lengthy statement posted on X that it was “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles"".
Mr Kennedy has given his support for the vaccine, despite being an anti-vaccine advocate. (AP Photo: Annie Rice)
He has said previously that vaccination was a personal choice and advocated for the use of vitamin A, which has been shown in some studies in developing countries to lessen the severity of symptoms but which can lead to liver toxicity in high quantities.
Republican US senator Bill Cassidy, who is also a physician and who backed Mr Kennedy's confirmation after he promised not to make changes to vaccine oversight, said on X after the reported death that ""everyone should be vaccinated"".
""Top health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies,"" Mr Cassidy wrote on X.
The measles vaccine is 97 per cent effective after two shots.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its website says the vaccine is ""the best protection against measles"", which spreads through the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs.
Local media have reported that Mr Kennedy plans to attend the child's funeral scheduled for Sunday.
Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration's former vaccine chief, said responsibility for the death rests with Mr Kennedy and his staff.
Dr Marks was forced out of the FDA after disagreements with Mr Kennedy over vaccine safety.
""This is the epitome of an absolute needless death,"" he told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday.
Dr Marks also said he recently warned US senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn't mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak.
The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months in the US. (AP Photo: Mary Conlon, File)
Experts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year.
In West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.
With several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease — and declining childhood vaccination rates nationwide — some worry that measles may cost the US its status as having eliminated the disease.
Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours.
Up to nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC.

She got little sleep the night before, having stayed with relatives in a two-bedroom house in Newman, 1,200 kilometres north-east of Perth, along with 10 other people.
""Sometimes I can't get any sleep,"" Ms Peterson said.
""Staying with relatives is very hard — we have family members coming in, knocking on the door, banging on the door.
Ms Peterson's blood cycles through the dialysis unit then is returned to her through a rubber tube. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)
The 58-year-old, an elder of the remote Jigalong community, requires life-saving dialysis three times a week.
She is one of about 96 patients who use the four dialysis chairs at Puntukurnu Aboriginal Medical Service (PAMS) every month.
The Newman clinic serves some of Western Australia's most isolated residents.
About half of its patients travel huge distances from remote desert communities to access care.
Like Ms Peterson, many rely on family and friends for accommodation.
Overcrowding, due to a lack of housing, can have dire health implications. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)

The PAMS clinic has operated four dialysis chairs since 2022. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)
He said his immunocompromised patients, many of whom travelled to Newman and stayed in overcrowded homes, were facing diseases seen ""nowhere else in the developed world"".

They are calling for $9 million in capital funding from state and federal governments to get the project underway.

Renal hostels already accompany dialysis units at Kalgoorlie and Port Hedland, while a contractor was hired last year with federal funding to construct a 30-person facility in Broome.
Mr Chibawe said a Newman hostel would provide some temporary relief to the most vulnerable, while housing shortages were more meaningfully addressed.
""We're trying to avoid being a band-aid ... a repair shop,"" he said.
""Come here, we fix you, but go back to the same place where you got the infection from — that's not sustainable.
""If we want equitable health, then we have to put money where there is entrenched disadvantage.""
Two kilometres from the PAMS clinic, millions of tonnes of iron ore are dug from the earth each year.
They generate about $24 billion annually for majority owner BHP.
The Australian multinational also owns 1,100 homes in Newman, 130 of which are boarded up and uninhabitable.
Some have sat vacant for more than a decade.

Those who are subject to the NT's banned drinker register are unable to buy alcohol.
Individuals can be placed on the list by the police, courts and corrections, self-referral or by guardians and carers.
But local leaders in Mount Isa have argued the NT's alcohol regulations drive people across the border, placing a greater burden on social services.

Mr Leavers said he was yet to seek legal advice on how the bans could practically or legally be enforced.
He was also yet to contact Northern Territory authorities.
The NT does not have a direct counterpart to Mr Leavers, but NT government minister Steven Edgington's electorate of Barkly shares a border with north-west Queensland.
Mr Edgington's ministerial portfolios includes health, alcohol policy, Aboriginal affairs, housing and local government.
He said he had not yet been consulted by Queensland's cross-border commissioner but saw ""real opportunities"" to enhance cross-border arrangements between police.
""Not only with regard to sharing information but providing more opportunities for them to be working together,"" Mr Edgington said.
Police union boss Ian Leavers appointed Queensland cross-border commissioner.
Mr Leavers said a potential joint police facility could bolster law enforcement on the border.
Queensland's Department of Premier and Cabinet, which Mr Leavers advises, said planning was underway to meet with local stakeholders to better understand policing and liquor issues on the western border.
""This is still in a planning phase,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.

Waanyi man Arnold Holt is from Tennant Creek in the NT, about 660 kilometres west of Mount Isa.
Mr Holt said the Isa was known as a social place by some across the border, but the freer availability of alcohol caused issues and he had previously sought help from the Riverbed support service.

Careers","Sarah Williams wasn't looking for a career change. She didn't dream of quitting her job in the higher education sector to launch a short-stay accommodation business near Tasmania's pristine Wilderness World Heritage Area — though if you don't know her full story, it might sound like a dream.
When she resigned from her job as an intranet designer at Melbourne University in 2017, Williams was at breaking point. Since being diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) in 2009, when she was 33, she'd struggled to keep her head above water at work, fighting debilitating fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, frequent viral infections and, in a previous role at a different university, a graceless manager who refused her request to work some days from home because it would be ""unfair"" to her team.
But when she crashed that year, her health and life in freefall, she was too exhausted to feel sad. ""I felt so utterly sick and depleted that I knew I needed time off to rest completely,"" says Williams, now 49. The only way she could afford to do that, though, was by moving back to a property she owned in Meander, an hour's drive south-west of Launceston in Tasmania, where she grew up.
A handsome cedar shingled guesthouse her grandfather had built next door would one day become the bones of her new career — her meal ticket. But for a long while Williams pushed thoughts of work, of getting out of bed, to the back of her mind. ""My 69-year-old mother who lived in Adelaide flew down to be my unpaid carer for what we thought might be three to six months,"" she says. ""It turned into eight years.""

When it comes to career changes, our cultural conversations often follow the unicorns among us — high-profile movers and shakers who take impressive leaps of faith at brave new endeavours: the formula one engineer who cooked up a popular croissanterie, the Hollywood actress who built a cult lifestyle and wellness brand. But what about the people who change their career not to scratch some creative or philanthropic itch or make a truckload of money, but out of necessity — because illness or injury derailed or destroyed their ability to work?
The most recent Jobs Mobility report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows 2.1 million people left or lost a job in the year to February 2024, with about a quarter saying they did so to get a better job, or because they just wanted a change. But nearly 6 per cent lost a job because of their own ill-health or injury, up from about 4 per cent in 2021 — more than the 4.6 per cent who retired, or the 1 per cent who left a job to start their own business.

As Williams knows well, ME/CFS — which can be triggered by viral infection, trauma or chemical or mould exposure (Williams developed it after getting glandular fever, an infection caused by the Epstein Barr virus) — can seriously limit patients' ability to work.
A 2019 survey of more than 1,000 Australians with ME/CFS found 89 per cent had stopped working or significantly reduced their hours of paid work, with just half reporting they were engaged in some form of employment, education or training. The survey, by advocacy organisation Emerge Australia, found more than two-thirds of patients were living below the poverty line, with the majority spending substantial amounts of money on medical appointments, medication and supplements.
Similar patterns are now playing out among people with long COVID, another infection associated chronic illness whose signs and symptoms overlap with ME/CFS. Australian researchers have estimated long COVID resulted in an average of 100 million lost labour hours in 2022, costing the economy $9.6 billion, or one-quarter of Australia's real GDP growth that year.
For years after Williams moved back to Tasmania, her health continued to decline. Mostly confined to her bed, she had trouble thinking clearly and reading, became painfully sensitive to light and noise and was almost entirely dependent on her mother. But by 2020 she'd turned a corner — likely the result, she says, of lower stress and proper rest, taking antivirals, treating her thyroid disease, and getting on hormonal contraceptives, which stopped her periods and the symptom flares they sparked.
She also credits the awe-striking natural environment around her: the Meander Valley's lush rainforests, woodlands and moorlands, hundreds of wild caves, stunning gorges, serene lakes and gushing waterfalls. ""I like that it's a mix of rural and bush and the wildness is lovely,"" Williams says. ""Seeing native birds and animals"" — pademelons, possums, eagles, robins, wrens, lizards and frogs — ""just the fact you can see life going along, doing its thing, is sublimely beautiful.""

And then it hit her: If she loved where she lived, other people would, too. But would they pay to stay — could she earn a living in the process? The guesthouse Williams's grandfather had constructed in 1986 from local Myrtle heartwood and Huon pine was ""quirky"" and ""gorgeous"", she says, but needed renovating. She used her savings to modernise it, building a deck and installing a cedar hot tub with sweeping views across the valley and mountains.
On top of developing a ""sustainable"" business model and marketing strategy, researching her competition and deciding which booking technology to use, Williams also had to work out how she'd run her short-stay accommodation business with an energy limiting illness. She was better, but not well, so help — with gardening, maintenance, linens, laundry — would need to be outsourced.

When she launched Cedar Cottage Meander in January 2021 — just as the COVID pandemic was picking up steam — travel, for many Australians, was on the backburner. It was a calculated risk. ""I was looking forward to the first guests, feeling a little bit overwhelmed, but excited as well,"" Williams says. ""And I didn't really have any expectations for it — I just wanted to see where it would go.""
That's not to say any of it was easy. Williams is acutely aware of how fortunate she is to be able to work at all, that she had property — and the loving support of her family — to fall back on. And her decision to start her own business in the first place was perversely influenced by her aversion to applying for disability support. She'd heard stories about how difficult, often impossible, it was for people with ME/CFS to access such programs and, given the lack of awareness and education among doctors, had little faith it would be a straightforward process.
Case in point: just 3 per cent of ME/CFS patients surveyed by Emerge Australia in 2019 said they were able to access the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) — a troubling figure, the non-profit said, given how physically and cognitively disabling ME/CFS can be.
""I've learned that injury, illness and disability can affect anyone at any age, and there is no moral component,"" Williams says. (Supplied: Jess Bonde)
""The idea of navigating either the Disability Support Pension or later the NDIS felt overwhelmingly daunting,"" Williams says. ""I wanted to have control over my livelihood and I knew the stress of applying for either would be counterproductive to my health. I didn't trust that the service model would provide the support I needed without taxing my energy reserves to the point of another relapse.""
Today, an average work week involves managing bookings and communicating with guests, scheduling maintenance visits, planning content for her website and social media, ""endless"" laundry and cleaning and making sure her mum — who still lives with her — has everything she needs to look after the cottage's organic vegetable garden. Thrillingly, though, Williams says her business allows her to fully support herself financially, including paying for disability support workers when she needs them: ""I kind of have to pinch myself because it's done really well … I'm proud of the fact it's been successful commercially.""

And while sometimes she misses aspects of her old career — she spent 14 years in the higher education sector, relishing the creativity and teamwork of her IT roles — she has grown to appreciate the lessons her chronic illness has foisted on her, the way it has reshaped her outlook on work into something gentler, more accepting of her limitations.
Her eyes are also now open to the fragility of life, and the unnerving possibility that we all may be just an infection or accident away from losing our ability to get up tomorrow, to go to work, to live fully.
""I've learned that injury, illness and disability can affect anyone at any age, and there is no moral component,"" Williams says. ""I've learned that productivity doesn't equate to self-worth. That a lot of 'busyness' is a waste of time, and that doing nothing is valuable, too … I've learned that sometimes we can create the type of employment we want to see in the world, instead of looking to others to provide it.""",Hayley Gleeson,Mon 7 Apr

Health","Anna Awburn was your typical, sporty 14-year-old when exercise suddenly started to bring on extreme pain in her head.
""Being a pretty sporty kid with sporty friends at a sporty school, I was doing rowing, swimming, netball, basketball and I basically just had to say goodbye to all of that,"" Ms Awburn said.
""After swimming training, I'd just have this blinding pressure in my head … playing netball became impossible, because I'd be on court and starting to lose my vision.
An estimated 4.9 million Australians battle through the debilitating pain of migraines. But despite estimates the condition costs the national economy billions each year, a leading researcher says there's far from enough funding or support.
After a series of tests — which ruled out family history of brain tumour — Ms Awburn was eventually diagnosed with chronic persistent daily headaches, which mimics chronic migraine.
Like many people who live with migraine, exercise often brings on an attack for Ms Awburn, some 15-years after she first experienced it.
""Exercising is really hard, especially when I was in my early 20s, I was having up to 25 attacks a month, and I was basically bed bound, like couldn't really do anything,"" Ms Awburn said.
""Some days I could go for a nice walk and be fine afterwards or I could be bed bound for the next two or three days, you just never really know.
Studies show exercise can be prescribed as a non-medical treatment that could decrease attack frequency, intensity and duration. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)
For many people who live with migraine — like Ms Awburn — exercise has been reported as a trigger for attacks, despite limited research to back up the reports.
One study by the Journal of Headache and Pain found 38 per cent of participants reported exercise as a trigger for attacks.
56 per cent of those participants reported the attack began during exercise, while others reported an attack started on average more than two hours after exercise had stopped.
But on the other hand, studies also show that exercise can be prescribed as a non-medical treatment that could decrease pain frequency and might improve intensity and attack duration.
Natalie suffered with chronic migraine attacks for 17 years, then one injection changed everything. Experts say she is one of the ""lucky ones"".
Accredited exercise physiologist Emily Cordes — who also lives with chronic migraine — has first-hand experience.
""For the first year or so of living with chronic migraine, I, personally, couldn't really exercise without triggering an attack, and I would find all sorts of different things would trigger attacks,"" Ms Cordes said.
""It just felt like, yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare, to be honest.""
Now, Ms Cordes works with a ""huge number"" of people who live with migraine, and she said it's a complicated relationship.
""Even if you feel like exercise is a trigger for your migraine attacks, it might not be the whole story,"" Ms Cordes said.
""It could be that they're exercising in the sunshine and the heat is bringing one on, or they're dehydrated when they're working out, or perhaps they haven't eaten recently, and their glucose levels drop as they're exercising.
Accredited exercise physiologist Emily Cordes also lives with chronic migraine. (ABC News: Shauna Foley )
While medical research into migraine has improved recently, it is still limited and the way each person experiences an attack can vary greatly.
In her personal experience, Ms Cordes said exercising can sometimes abort an attack but it's best to trial what works for each individual.
""When I'm working with a client who has migraine, I tend to say, if your pain is around that level five out of 10, you might want to try going for a walk and just experiment,"" she said.
Experts say there are many reasons why medical practitioners struggle to treat migraine but there are ways to address it.
""If the pain is already beyond a five out of 10, you're better off resting and doing it on a day where you don't have any of your migraine symptoms present.
""Don't rush this … exercise should also be fun, so, trying to find ways that you can do things that are enjoyable to you, and starting small and building slowly.""
As for Ms Awburn, she can already see a difference since working with an exercise physiologist in Canberra last year.
""Touch wood, but I think I haven't had as many attacks since starting this program with Haley [exercise physiologist], so I definitely am noticing more strength in my upper back and neck,"" Ms Awburn said.",Anthea Beveridge,Mon 7 Apr

Health","Thousands of public hospital doctors are expected to walk off the job on Tuesday for the first time in decades over a pay and conditions dispute with the NSW government.
Despite being ordered by the Industrial Relations Commission to refrain from any industrial action for three months, the Australian Salaried Medical Officers' Federation (ASMOF) is predicting many of their 9,000 members to strike across three days starting from April 8.
The union claims staffing in key areas, such as emergency departments, will be maintained for patient safety reasons, but elective surgeries will be affected.
The strike action is set to go ahead despite warmings from the industrial relations umpire. (ABC News: Abbey Haberecht)
Negotiations stalled at the bargaining table with the union and the government at loggerheads over the amount of the pay increase.
The union wants a 30 per cent rise in total, which they say will bring remuneration in line with other states.
The government has countered with a 10.5 per cent increase over three years.
NSW Health warned doctors would be told to return to work if patients were put at risk.
""If ASMOF members breach the Industrial Relations Commission's orders and proceed to action, we anticipate this action will have a significant impact on our ability to deliver services to our patients,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.
""Where NSW Health has concerns about patient care we will be issuing a lawful direction to doctors to attend work where required.""
Behny Samadi, an intensive care specialist, described the government's offer as a ""pay cut"" when factoring the past few years of increasing inflation.
But the Sydney doctor said ""personally, this was never about pay"".
Instead, Dr Samadi said, the strike action was an attempt to ""modernise"" the award, improve working conditions and address the culture inside NSW Health which she said had taken a ""nosedive"" over the years.
""New South Wales Health has become this cartoonishly evil, faceless, nameless organisation,"" she said, describing a disconnect between administration and frontline staff.
Intensive care specialist, Behny Samadi, describes the government's wage offer as a ""pay cut"". (ABC News: Abbey Haberecht)
She said she was made to work until she was 38 weeks pregnant, and when she ""begged"" administration for a car park to avoid walking long distances in 40-degree weather with low blood pressure from her pregnancy, she was denied.
""It's just ridiculous how bureaucratic and soulless it's [NSW Health] become,"" she said
Dr Samadi claims requests for a new ultrasound machine were denied because the decision-makers ""don't understand that we can't treat our patients like this"".
The current award is under fire for not remunerating staff specialists for long additional hours.
""I get called in in the middle of the night, I don't actually get paid for that time, and then I'm expected to be back at 8am the next day, as if nothing has happened,"" she said.
""There's no such thing as an overtime sheet for staff specialists.""
The specialist said aside from additional hours going unpaid, there was ""no system to safeguard for fatigue"".
The health minister says the strike will force the cancellation of elective surgeries. (ABC News: Anushri Sood)
Health Minister Ryan Park said ASMOF has ""ignored"" the government's offer for a backdated 3 per cent pay increase provided the union scrap their industrial action, adding the government would need to spend around $11 billion to meet the union's demands.
""Now I don't know how much more the government can offer … I don't know why they're not at the table,"" Mr Park said.
He has said preparations were underway to manage the impact on patients, and that people with elective surgeries postponed would be contacted.
""This will put patients at risk because we know elective surgery will need to be cancelled,"" he told a press conference last week.
The union has demanded the government ""cease threats and intimidation against frontline doctors"" after NSW Health sent letters to staff ahead of the proposed strike.
In one of the letters, staff were told NSW Health ""may make notifications"" to the healthcare watchdogs, complaints commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, ""depending on the impact of the conduct of the medical officers during the industrial action"".
Dr Samadi said doctors didn't want to strike.
""It's just that clearly this is a last resort,"" she said.
""Nobody is going to abandon their patients, and we have plans for safe, minimum staffing levels.""
Adding that ICUs, emergency departments, emergency theatre lists and trauma services would be ""largely unchanged"" to ""maintain patient safety"".
She apologised to patients whose elective surgeries would need to be rescheduled due to the industrial action.
""But we don't have a choice. And the bigger picture is that we want a functioning health system,"" she said.",Brianna Parkins,Mon 7 Apr

Accessing prescriptions is becoming an issue for many Australians, due to ongoing supply shortages of multiple medications.
Ms Roberts's two children have ADHD and all require medication.

The shortage has been time-consuming and frustrating for everyone in the family.
""I put in all of our scripts to be filled five days before they were due [in January] and they couldn't be filled,"" Ms Roberts said.
The issue has been exacerbated by the fact that her children have experienced side effects from other ADHD medications which makes finding an alternative difficult.
Shannon Roberts tries to keep ahead of scripts ending, but that still doesn't help. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)
""My eldest is now on her third medication change, my second eldest is waiting to be seen at a clinic in April,"" she said.
""My kids had horrendous side effects from Ritalin. The eldest lasted one week because we were so worried about her mental health.""
The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has 400 medications listed as in short supply, including menopause hormone treatments and blood pressure medication.
Another of the drugs in short supply is Concerta, one of the most popular ADHD drugs.
18mg, 27mg, 34mg and 54mg dosages are all listed as limited in supply.

Albany pharmacist Jane McLean said supplies had ebbed and flowed in recent years.
""Last year Vyvanse was in short supply most of the year. This year Concerta is in short supply,"" she said.
Ms McLean said in the ""last few years we've seen more out of stocks than what we've seen in the previous 10 to 15 years"".
Pharmacist Jane McLean said supply issues are affecting many medications. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)
Regulations surrounding ADHD medication mean scripts can only be filled five days in advance of your last supply running out to prevent stockpiling.
ADHD WA clinical advisory board chair Roger Paterson said it could take months to find the right medication and prescription for a child, adding to the stress for families.
""The bottom line seemed to be that demand was gradually outstripping supply … there is a shortage of supply around the world,"" he said.
""We are just experiencing it in our own way within the field of ADHD.""
The TGA said the Concerta supply shortage was likely to continue through to December this year.
Pharmacy Guild of Australia WA president Andrew Ngeow said the country was at ""the end of a very long and complex worldwide supply chain"".

Meditation and Prayer","New York's Rikers Island isn't for the faint of heart.
The notorious jail is dank and dark and carries a stale, stagnant smell.
But within these walls, an Australian — former journalist Joh Jarvis — is doing something unusual.
She's teaching meditation to inmates and the warders looking after them.
""Rikers Island is a violent, harsh, unrelentingly difficult environment for anyone who's incarcerated there,"" Joh tells ABC TV's Compass.
""There's a lot of overcrowding. And if you've got people who are highly charged and overreactive, then that … just causes all sorts of disciplinary issues. That's when fights start.""
It's these reactive behaviours — and the feelings of distress that often lie beneath them — that Joh wants to minimise.
After moving to New York City from Australia, Joh Jarvis began teaching meditation inside Rikers Island. (Compass: Johnny Sierra)
She teaches Vedic meditation, which is derived from a 5,000-year-old Indian tradition and centres around a word or mantra.
""You think of this word easily and you let it go,"" Joh explains.
""Your mind likes it and enjoys the vibration, and it takes your mind deeper … and your body starts to relax.""
On Joh's first visit to Rikers, she didn't know whether the inmates would have any interest in meditating.
To her surprise, not only were they keen to try, they responded incredibly well.
""They got the technique really quickly … [and] they actually practised in their cells on their own,"" she says.
In 2021, Joh created The Light Inside foundation to build on the volunteer work she'd started at Riker's Island and to expand the project.
It's since been introduced in a jail in North Dakota. There, along with teaching the inmates, Joh has been collecting data.
She wanted to test whether this spiritual practice could improve their wellbeing.
So, she surveyed them before they learned meditation, then after four days of practising.
""[Beforehand] their wellbeing was … very low. It's what would be described as being 'in distress,'"" she says.
But after four days, every participant reported an improvement — some remarkably so.
Joh Jarvis says everyone, including incarcerated people, deserves the opportunity to improve their mental health. (Supplied: Joh Jarvis)
The prisoners spoke of sleeping better, feeling less angry and being better in touch with their emotions.
One inmate, who's serving a life sentence without parole, credits meditation with helping him feel ""calm"" for the first time in his 17 years behind bars.
Another sees meditation as a tool that could help him stay clear of drugs and fights once he leaves jail.
""Instead of going out and sticking a needle in my arm, I can go out and sit in a park and go and take some time for myself, even if it's only 15–20 minutes,"" he says.
Long before Joh set foot in America's most dangerous prisons, she spent more than 25 years working as a journalist and media executive in Australia.
She reported on the Mabo decision and covered the controversial Waterfront Dispute in 1998.
""I was a pretty serious person, and I hit it pretty hard in all ways,"" she says.
""I worked very hard and sometimes I drank too much. It really all took its toll.""
During this time, Joh suffered an overwhelming loss.
After her brother's sudden death, Joh Jarvis turned to meditation. (Supplied: Joh Jarvis)
When she was in her early 30s, her 27-year-old brother died suddenly.
""It was shattering. It broke me,"" she says.
Desperate to find something that could quell the grief, Joh tried therapy, jogging, yoga and breath exercises. She also quit drinking, which had previously been a crutch.
She says these measures temporarily boosted her mental state, but they never felt enough.
Meditation was the one thing she hadn't tried.
""The idea of it didn't appeal to me. I saw it as 'woo-woo,'"" Joh says.
Despite having reservations, she describes her first time meditating as transformative.
""When I went outside after … everything was this psychedelic green, the trees were just alive,"" Joh recalls.
""I felt so happy and so free, and that was in complete contrast to how I was feeling [before].""
Joh Jarvis isn't the only teacher who believes meditation can play a role in solving societal ills.
In the New South Wales town of Nowra, fellow Vedic practitioner — and friend of Joh — Barron Hanson has embarked on an ambitious test.
He wants to get 1 per cent of Nowra's population — around 250 people — meditating each day, to see whether this improves the wellbeing of the whole town.
This idea stems from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who famously taught Transcendental Meditation (TM) to the Beatles. It's a phenomenon known as the Maharishi Effect.
""This idea proposed … that if you can get a small group, as little as 1 per cent, meditating, you can have a seismic effect through the collective consciousness,"" explains Barron.

The Maharishi's TM organisation claims that mass meditation can lower crime rates and reduce hospitalisations. But despite organising more than 50 events to prove as much, the science remains contested.
""I thought maybe Nowra would be the perfect Petri dish to see whether we can recreate one of these experiments,"" says Barron.
While Nowra might be a world away from the US prison system, it's also home to a population under stress.
The regional town has high levels of unemployment, domestic violence and substance abuse.
In recent years, it's also faced bushfires and floods.
And so, Barron reached out to Dr Judy Pickard, a clinical psychologist based at the University of Wollongong, with his month-of-meditation proposal.
Over 31 days, she worked with Barron to track the wellbeing of 35 people taking part in his experiment.
Barron has visited India several times, and done more than 3,000 hours of meditation teaching training. (Supplied: Leeroy T)
""As a scientist, you could be sceptical about something like [the Maharishi Effect],"" Dr Pickard says.
""Yet, we also know how much benefit there is [from meditation] on the individual level.""
""It makes sense that if people are … psychologically well, acting with compassion, and more aware of their reactions and how they respond to different situations, that it would have a knock-on effect, in terms of how they think about other people.""
In the end, Barron managed to get half of his 250-person target meditating for the whole month.
It culminated with a sold-out night of meditation music at the Shoalhaven Entertainment Centre, headlined by ARIA-winning artist John Butler.
""I thought Barron had a really noble cause,"" the musician tells Compass.
""This young, bright man has gone back to his home town and he wants to teach 1 per cent of the population to meditate with this idea that there's a cascading flow-on effect.
""I just feel like that's [creating a] multi-generational legacy.""
Indeed, meditation is a practice John Butler has found solace in.
""As much as people like to see it as an esoteric, mystical thing … it's a good way to have mental hygiene, emotional hygiene, spiritual hygiene in this crazy world,"" he says.
Musician John Butler was moved by Barron's big-hearted ambition for Nowra. (Compass: Simon Koloadin)
It's too early to tell whether Barron's initiative has had any impact on Nowra's wider population.
He is waiting on the release of data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to check whether the experiment correlated with any changes to crime rates, vehicle accidents or hospital admissions.
Despite these uncertainties, the results from Dr Pickard's research are clear.
She reported a significant reduction in depression, anxiety and stress amongst the cohort of meditators.
""We looked at things like self-compassion and flourishing and positive emotions, and found significant change in that as well, which is really exciting,"" she says.
For Barron, this in itself is a huge success.
""Can meditation change the world? All I really know is my own personal experience and that it's had a profound effect on me,"" he says.
""If we can change the individual, then maybe we can change the collective.""
Friends Joh Jarvis and Barron Hanson are bonded in their belief that mediation can make a real difference in the world. (Supplied: Joh Jarvis)
It's a sentiment that Barron's friend Joh Jarvis shares.
""I think I became a journalist because I wanted to improve things,"" she says.
""[But] we would shine a light on something … then the same problem would crop up somewhere else. It was like this game of Whac-A-Mole.""
Unlike journalism, she believes meditation gets to ""the heart of things"".
""We're dealing with people's deep distress and stress and trauma,"" she says.
""Through learning meditation, all of that [can be] lifted. It gives people an opportunity to change.
""That's why I'm doing this, that's why I care about it … because it really makes an impact.""

The house did not appear fit for human habitation, and we assumed it had been empty for some time.
Until we learnt Kara*, an NDIS participant, was living in this squalor.
When the ABC visited Eshal Crescent in Wyndham Vale in February, we were on the trail of alleged NDIS fraudster Khawaja Moeen Haroon.
We had been tipped off that his network used two homes on the street, owned by some of his business associates, to house NDIS participants.
Haroon's network has placed dozens of NDIS participants in share houses across Melbourne's western suburbs over the past four years, allegedly luring many away from their existing providers with promises like cash and free cigarettes.

The participants sometimes had serious mental health issues such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, as well as acquired brain injuries.
The NDIS packages of clients with these types of disability can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to the companies managing their care.
Once the participants were in the Haroon-network homes, they were allegedly isolated, provided with minimal services, while at the same time their NDIS packages were drained of funds.
The participants often descended into worse drug addiction problems and mental health issues than they had before, two former workers allege.
Advocates told the ABC some of the NDIS participants living in houses linked to Mr Haroon struggled with drug addiction.  (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)
The ABC this week revealed Haroon has been the centre of a federal criminal fraud investigation since 2023, but companies associated with him were still able to sign up participants after that.
In a statement, Mr Haroon told the ABC he denied all the allegations made against him and said he was committed to cooperating fully with any official inquiries and trusted the facts would speak for themselves in due course.

When we returned to the street a few days later, we caught Kara in a moment of calm.
She said that a couple of years ago she was about to move into a house organised by Unison, a reputable homelessness service in Melbourne's inner west, when she met a man who convinced her to go with him instead.
""I was happy to take that [Unison] place, but he persuaded me to take their offer which was breakfast, boarding,"" she said.
""They said they'd help out with accommodation and then help me get my own place.""
She said she didn't know how long she'd been at number 20 and she hadn't been able to keep up any medical appointments because she had no phone.

""I might look like I'm dazed out, but I'm not. I'm still there.""

She confirmed much of Kara's story and said the deterioration in her sister since she went with the NDIS providers at the end of 2023 was stark.

""She was very much part of the family, and then she just sort of distanced herself and isolated herself from her family and friends,"" she said.
""She never has a phone, was never able to contact me … She's never got bank cards, she's never got ID.""
Anna said when Kara first went with the NDIS provider, they were letting her live in a house rent free and giving her money each week, which she found strange.
She said it was unclear what care she was receiving, and when she visited, support workers were never present.
""I'm sad, disappointed,"" she said.

She gave us phone numbers of the people who had purportedly been supporting Kara over the past 18 months.
The current number she gave us is one the ABC has linked to the Haroon network of companies.
A previous number she had from when Kara first signed on with the provider was advertised online as being the phone number for another one of Haroon's companies.

When we asked Khawaja Haroon specifically about Kara and whether she had been, or was still in his company's care, he did not respond.
Three doors down from number 20 was a house owned by a business associate of Haroon. Mark* answered the door.
He seemed anxious and we soon found out he was keen to get to a mental health appointment.
""I haven't been very well,"" he told us.

He invited us in. There were two single seats in the spacious living room.
CCTV cameras were on the wall — although we had no way of knowing if they were monitoring Mark and us.
Mark told us he wasn't sure how long he's been living here, but he's been by himself for about a month.
He had a Nokia phone, but no credit — and while we were talking, it became clear he didn't know how to use it.
Mark said he wasn't happy.

""I'm left here by myself a lot of the time now,"" he said.
When his support coordinator arrived to take him to his appointment, she was surprised to see us.
She told us she worked for the NDIS in a government role and gave us her name, which we later worked out to be false.
She actually owned a private NDIS provider that was only registered as a company in December last year, shortly after federal police raided several of Haroon's properties.
Mark's home was sparsely furnished when the ABC visited. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)
A few days later, we called Mark on the phone number he gave us when we met.
When we asked him where he was, he said he didn't know, but that he had moved house.
He then handed the phone to his support coordinator — the same woman we met on Eshal Crescent.
She told us she had been looking at a new house for Mark for a while, and brushed aside any suggestion that it was because of our visit.
This was the last time we spoke to Mark.
His phone has been turned off since.
On a recent visit to Mark's former home, it looked like it was being cleared out.  (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)
Khawaja Haroon did not answer our questions about Mark, and if he had ever been or was still a client of his network of companies.
When the NDIS was introduced in 2013, it was meant to transform the way people with disabilities were cared for.
Then-prime minister Julia Gillard said they ""will have their needs met in a way that truly supports them to live with choice and dignity"".
But while it has undoubtedly been positively life changing for many participants, Kara and Mark are among those who've been left behind.

Their big support packages and complex mental health disabilities make them especially vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous providers.
Charlotte Jones, CEO of the Mental Health Legal Centre, said she believed the misuse of NDIS funding had even led to some of her clients dying before they should have because they had not received proper supports.

""The NDIS should have made such a difference, and it should have given them much better lives,"" she said.
""And there is no way that we can look at some of the outcomes and say that we protected these people as well as we should have done.
""For people who have been left neglected and abused over a number of years and exploited for financial gain, the impact of that on them meant they died before they should have done.
""We have to safeguard better.""
The NDIS and the NDIS Commission told the ABC they could not comment about active investigations, but that they had zero tolerance for any exploitation of NDIS participants.
The commission, which is in charge of safeguarding participants, said it was committed to protect and uphold the human rights of people with disability and ensure that quality disability supports and services are delivered in a safe manner.
Since the ABCs visit, Kara has left the house on Eshal Crescent, telling her sister her NDIS provider was no longer working with her.
She's now homeless — in and out of emergency accommodation until she can find a place to live.

On the evidence we've found, we believe she and Mark were at one point in time clients of companies connected to Haroon.
But it is possible that companies unconnected with him came in and signed them up more recently.
One thing we know for sure: when we went looking for Khawaja Haroon, we found a trail of devastation.

Human Interest","When Hannah Jayne finished high school without an ATAR, higher education was the last thing on her mind.
At 17, all she wanted was financial independence to get out of an unstable home environment.
When a job opened up at the local sand mine processing plant, Tronox, in Broken Hill, she jumped at the opportunity and quickly climbed the ranks.
But it was through an advanced first aid certificate that she found her calling in life, and a passion for health and first aid blossomed.
Now studying to be a paramedic through Charles Sturt University, the 23-year-old plans to stay in Broken Hill once she graduates.

Despite the addition of 18 paramedics at the start of the year, the remote mining city in far west New South Wales is struggling to retain its workforce, according to Health Services Union delegate Ben Weller.
Finishing school and finding full-time work at the mines was a relief for Ms Jayne.
It meant financial security and independence after so many years of struggling to make ends meet through casual jobs.
But the then-18-year-old was initially ""terrified"" of working in such a male-dominated industry at Tronox.
Instead, her new colleagues became a surrogate family for her.

""Honestly, they stepped up for me,"" she said.
""Some of them washed my car, I had their spare jumpers when I didn't have any.
Fuelled by a new-found interest in first aid discovered on the mining site, Ms Jayne began looking into tertiary education options for paramedicine.
With assistance from the Country Universities Centre-Far West, which provides people in the regions with access to university pathways and study spaces, she applied for a bridging course at Charles Sturt University.
In 2024 she was accepted into a Bachelor of Health and Medical Science, and then in October she received the news she never though would come: she'd been accepted into a Bachelor of Paramedicine.

The 23-year-old was also offered a scholarship from Chances for Children, which would help pay for her accommodation, placements and other expenses.
""I read it [the acceptance letter] about eight times with tears in my eyes.""

She is one of 180 students studying paramedicine at Charles Sturt University's campus in Central West NSW.
Paramedic and Health Services Union delegate Ben Weller knows firsthand how the region has struggled to maintain its workforce.
He said it wasn't only the region's remoteness that made staff retention difficult.
""We can't offer the staff any progression opportunities. We couldn't offer the staff any help with housing, any monetary incentives, any upskilling incentives.
""Given our geographical isolation, we've always been a bit disadvantaged when it comes to our resourcing, crewing and the care we can provide to our community.""
Ben Weller moved to Broken Hill three years ago and fell in love with the region. (Supplied: Ben Weller)
For many new recruits who have only just graduated from university, the move to remote far west New South Wales away from support networks can be a shock to the system, he said.
Mr Weller believes a solution to maintaining staff could be through incentives like providing upskill and development training, such as what is offered at metro stations, and assisting new recruits with housing and other supports.
""We'd love to see opportunities for all staff around western NSW to be able to upskill to be able to work their career towards those higher clinical levels,"" he said.
In a statement, a NSW Ambulance spokesperson said, ""NSW Ambulance paramedics transferring to Broken Hill may be entitled to additional leave and financial assistance under the NSW Transferred Employees Benefits Scheme.""
The statement also said that Broken Hill was serviced by two Royal Flying Doctor Service aircraft operating out of Dubbo and six NSW Ambulance fixed-wing aircraft operating out of the Mascot Air Ambulance base.
A commercial flight between Broken Hill and Dubbo is more than an hour.
Between Sydney and Broken Hill with no stops is a two-hour commercial flight.
On Friday NSW Minister for Regional Health Ryan Park announced additional paramedics would be sent across the state, including an extra three for the Central West Zone Two, which Broken Hill is a part of.
Now three months into her university degree, Ms Jayne is excited about the prospect of bringing back to Broken Hill the skills she learns on placements.
""[I want to] have that experience in bigger cities and other places in NSW to kind of learn more and bring all those things back to Broken Hill, whatever we're missing out on,"" she said.
Ms Jayne never thought university was something within her reach. (ABC Broken Hill: Coquohalla Connor)
Her advice for anyone struggling through similar circumstances is simple —keep showing up.
""You never know what's around the corner, you've just got to continue showing up. Be there for yourself, for everyone around you,"" she said.
""There are so many ways to get into university and, no matter what your scenario is, if you're not quite financially stable or you don't have support around you, there's always a way to make it work.""

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-06/a-list-hub-arts-events-autism/105036068,One of the biggest myths about autistic people — and why it isn't true,"Topic:
Art","Madeleine Lobsey and her family rarely leave the house — not because they don't want to, but because the world can be a confronting place for them.
Madeleine, her husband and their three children are all autistic.
""The world just doesn't work for us,"" she said.
Everyone in the family is neurodivergent and hugely supportive of each other and their needs. (ABC NEWS: Scott Preston)
The Lobsey home is a vibrant haven, where activities like building Lego, board games or baking are aplenty.
Encouraging signs, colourful furniture and fidget toys remind everyone they are free to be themselves.
The Lobsey house is full of affirming and positive imagery. (ABC NEWS: Scott Preston)
What's striking about their home is how supportive they are of each other and their needs — eldest child Lucia can recognise and respond to signs of overstimulation in Madeleine before she does herself.
Madeline was diagnosed as autistic three years ago at the age of 48 and said it explained a lot, including why she'd always found anywhere with a crowd challenging.
Madeleine Lobsey is passionate about the arts and creating spaces where autistic people can feel comfortable. (ABC NEWS: Scott Preston)
She's passionate about the arts and creating events and spaces where autistic people can feel comfortable, such as theatre productions, exhibitions and performance spaces.
The former actor and director has taken matters into her own hands to work with online platform the A-List Hub to develop autism-friendly events at venues such as the Brisbane Powerhouse, Sydney Dance Company and Melbourne Museum.
Thanks to a one-off federal government grant, staff have been trained in autism-friendly practices and adaptions have been made to each event to make them accessible.
That includes reducing class sizes and crowd capacity, dimming lights, providing quiet spaces, and creating visual stories to explain to people what will happen and when.
The events, such as this silent disco at the Brisbane Powerhouse, have been a big success. (Supplied: A-List Hub )
The project has also held silent discos, tactile collage making events and classes for contemporary dance, which can provide people a way to express themselves without words.
""I love the arts and I love culture … and so does my family, but we found ourselves over and over again, trying to go to things, buying tickets to see things, and needing to leave,"" she said.
It's thought 290,000 Australians have an autism diagnosis, though it's estimated the true number of autistic people is much higher.
Autism exists on a spectrum and every autistic person is different, but many are particularly sensitive to certain sensory inputs, which exacts a physical and emotional toll.
Even a trip to the supermarket can be too much.
""If you think about all the different music that's playing in the background … the beeping of machinery, the sound of tins hitting cupboards, fluorescent lights and you can go through lots of temperature changes where you walk past the freezers,"" Madeleine said.
In situations like those, Madeleine said her heart rate and anxiety levels will rise, and she might become confused, develop headaches or shut down.
""It's like a tsunami … imagine if you could never block out any sense, and it was all coming at you at once,"" she said.

Bec Street, a neurodivergent artist and educator who works for autism peak body Aspect, has also avoided events in the past, and often feels a sense of dread before going out.
She's one of the consultants on the A-List project.
While it's commonly believed that all autistic people are anti-social and don't want to go out, Bec said that wasn't true.
When events aren't sensory-friendly, Bec will often bring her ""bag of goodies"" — items like noise cancelling headphones or sunglasses — to navigate sensory overload.
""Then once I get somewhere and settle in and meet my people, I will have an excellent time and be the life of the party,"" she said.
Bec said making events autism-friendly wasn't just about ""turning things down"" — it's also about creating ""sensory joy"".
""We have lots of opportunities in these spaces to play and experiment with different materials … there's just so much joy to be found in the senses,"" she said.
Many arts spaces and events have started adopting ""relaxed performances"" or ""quiet hours"" — where shows are adapted to be more accessible for a short period of time during the week.
Madeleine said she appreciated that, but it still limited her family's ability to enjoy one of their passions whenever they wanted.
""I want [to help us get to] the next evolution where this is just standard practice and my family doesn't have to go at a certain time on a certain day to be able to experience the arts.""
If the reception of recent A-List events is anything to go by, the demand for more is high.
Madeleine says families have loved the A-List events. (Supplied: A-List Hub)
Madeleine has been thrilled to see thousands of autistic people and their families not only get out of the house, but enjoy themselves too.
""That for me, has been the ultimate joy of this.""
Bec's advice to companies and venues trying to be more inclusive is to remember that it is just good business.
""Disabled people make up a large and loyal audience. When you make your space inclusive, you open the door to people who are just waiting for an invitation to join in.""
The autistic community includes people with diverse views and preferences for language. Some people like to use ""autistic person"" (known as identity-first language), some like to use ""person with autism"" (person-first language), and some don't mind either.
Over the years reporters Nas Campanella and Evan Young have worked on disability stories, the autistic community has increasingly opted to use identity-first language.
That trend is reflected in this article, though the ABC respects the right of everyone with lived experience to use the language they prefer.",Unknown,Sun 6 Apr
